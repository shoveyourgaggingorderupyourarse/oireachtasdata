    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400003#A00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the status of the national broadband plan and the progress of this initiative towards its goal of ensuring high-speed broadband to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the national broadband plan, NBP, has both a commercial element and a State intervention element.</p>  <p>  The commercial element has been hugely successful, encouraging significant investment by the telecoms sector.  Commercial operators have invested more than &euro;2.75 billion in upgrading and modernising their networks over the past five years.  In 2012 fewer than 700,000, or 30%, of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high-speed broadband.  When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%.  Today 74% of premises can access high-speed broadband.</p>  <p>  Under a commitment agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, Eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high-speed broadband.  According to data for quarter 3 of 2018 submitted by Eir to my Department, the company has passed almost 210,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment.</p>  <p>  Regarding the State intervention element of the NBP, my Department is now in the final stages of a procurement process to engage a company which will build, maintain and operate the State intervention network.</p>  <p>  My Department has received a final tender submission from the bidder which is tendering for this contract.  This submission is under assessment by my officials.</p>  <p>  It is my priority that the procurement process be brought to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  In the coming weeks I will bring a recommendation to Government on the remaining bidder's submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400003#A00500"><p>There is somewhat of a recurring theme to the response the Minister has issued.  It is a theme that preceded his arrival into the office he now holds, an effort on the part of the Government to take credit for the work being done by the private contractors in the overall roll-out of broadband.  The facts remain that the Government committed back in 2012 to roll out high-speed broadband to areas that were not commercially viable.  People made decisions in this regard but there has been little or no progress since.  It is the case that a final tender was submitted in September.  However, back when the Government negotiated the programme for Government, the projected date for the signing of that contract was June 2017.  We are no closer to it now than we were then.  What we need from Government is a clear timeline of completion of its work.  I have some issues with the Smyth report but it is completed.  I cannot understand, nor can most people, the necessity of these ongoing discussions within the Minister's Department.  He knows what is required.  This has been ongoing for a very considerable period.  What we now need is action and timelines in order that we bring some certainty to the people who have waited far too long for this really important service.  The work the Department agreed under an arrangement with Eir to roll out broadband to 300,000 homes throughout the country has infuriated as many people as it has resolved issues for them.  A house that is one house beyond an area that Eir has committed to serving will not get broadband.  There is no sign of it happening.  The Department's work has created almost as many problems as it has attempted to solve.</p></speech>

A detailed final bid was submitted in September.  It is a comprehensive bid to deliver a broadband plan.  The Deputy asks why my officials and I are taking so much time to evaluate this.  I think he himself the other evening raised questions, as did numerous other Deputies, about issues such as the robustness of the technology, the deployment strategy, the contract terms, the governance of the project and the terms for connection.</p><p>Deputy Dooley heard them himself.  Numerous legitimate issues were raised.  It is right that we would tease them out and be satisfied.  If I am in a position to bring a recommendation to the Government it will be based on having teased out the very issues Deputies here are raising with me.  That is the reason time is being taken for that.</p> <p> The Deputy complained that the Government is taking credit for commercial operators deciding to carve out part of the original 750,000 households, but that is under the terms of State aid.  Once one enters into the provision of State support to a project such as this, there has to be an opportunity for others to come in, and that has triggered the arrival of others to make provision for 300,000 households.  They are the facts.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley has one minute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B00300"><p>I have raised very serious concerns about the capacity of the remaining bidder to deliver.  I and others have been raising them for the past year and a half and, sadly, it seems that it has only dawned on the Government in recent weeks.  Perhaps the concerns are being taken more seriously following the Minister's arrival in office.  I have been raising concerns since the main contractors that had the capacity to deliver the project, who were identified in the KPMG report before this process ever started, pulled out.  What I cannot understand is the continued delay of the Government in reaching a decision.  Surely the information is there.  If tough decisions have to be taken then the Minister will find support on this side of the House, but let us make them and then move on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B00400"><p>I am sure anyone would have preferred that the five bidders who originally entered into the process stayed right to the end, but as Deputy Dooley knows, the number reduced to three and, in turn, they reduced to one.  That is the nature of any procurement process.  Having just one bidder left required far greater due process by the State to ensure that the State interests are protected.  That is the reason there has been this level of work to evaluate carefully the risks and benefits, technically and financially.  I do not think anyone would forgive me for short-circuiting that work.  It is important that when I go to the Government with a recommendation it is based on a thorough evaluation.  That is clearly what I am attempting to achieve.</p></speech>

The Minister has chosen a model.  I believe that he is caught in a vice between two companies, namely, the finance house and Eir, which is now owned by a French investor.  The Minister mentioned that he will bring a recommendation to the Government in the coming weeks.  I have heard that for a long time in this House.  The wait is one thing, as people want broadband, but the other concern is the capacity of the company that is left in the tendering process.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B00800"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now in its final stages, with the bidder's final tender with my Department officials for assessment.  As I have noted in my previous response, the Government's priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The tender for the national broadband plan State intervention network is technology neutral and does not mandate the delivery of service by any specific material or infrastructure.  This means that selection of the most appropriate infrastructure to use as part of the roll-out of the network is and was a matter for the bidder.  That notwithstanding, the bidder has indicated to my officials that it intends to utilise both private infrastructure, belonging to Eir, and State-owned infrastructure, the MANs, to deliver its solution.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains a register of infrastructure owners, both commercial and public.  This register is available on my Department's website and remains open to new entries.  The register is available for commercial operators to use for the purposes of engaging with infrastructure owners, including the bidder.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B00900"><p>The remaining bidder is being left with the best of both worlds.  He will get a State subsidy and from what the Minister said he will be allowed to use State infrastructure.  I heard what the previous Minister said about Eir.  I previously asked to see the legal advice concerning the cherry-picking by Eir of the 300,000 households that were taken out of the broadband plan.  I wanted to see the legal advice on State competition rules that said Eir had to be allowed to pick the most commercially lucrative 300,000 households.  To date, I have not seen it.  If that was the case, the logic would follow that the electricity network in the Dublin area or any of the city areas in the State would have to be sold off to the private market to allow them to operate them because it is commercially viable to do that.  Rural areas would then be served by the State or a State-subsidised system.  I do not think that argument stands up.  Under the current plan the company will own the system after 25 years.  The company is stringing the Minister along.  The current situation is that he is caught with this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B01100"><p>This is where we are at the moment.  There is a question mark over the timing but the real question relates to the capacity of the company to carry out the work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B01200"><p>It is important to bear in mind that it was open to any bidder to enter the process.  As Deputy Stanley is aware, the ESB was previously part of a consortium.  There is no sense in which anyone was excluded, State-owned or otherwise.  It is also important to bear in mind that under state aid rules, state aid cannot be given to a commercial venture.  State aid cannot be given to either a private company operating a commercial business nor to a state company operating in a commercial world.  They are the rules of state aid.  Because of that rule, Eir was entitled to make a request that it would deliver commercially an element of the process.  There was an obligation under state aid rules to accept that offer.  That is a different point to Deputy Stanley's suggestion that we cannot have a State commercial company.  Of course we can have a State commercial company such as the ESB, but we cannot give state aid to such a company.  They are the rules of state aid.  There is a clear distinction here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B01300"><p>I accept Eir is entitled to make a bid to pick off the most lucrative households and businesses but the State was in a position to say "No" as well.  The logic of that would carry over into other infrastructure in the State and that has not happened.</p>  <p>  There are significant problems with the current system.  The town of Stradbally is served by a mast and my information is that the mast is composed of copper.  We are left with a shambolic system.  Despite the fact that in the programme for Government it was stated that additional Exchequer capital would be provided if needed to deliver on the commitment to bring next generation broadband to every house and business in the country by 2020, we are as far away from that today as we were this time last year.  We are hearing the same answers as we heard previously.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister stitching in conditions in the tendering process that the cost cannot escalate over the term of the contract, in other words, that the costs cannot escalate beyond whatever price is agreed with the remaining bidder over the term of the contract?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400004#B01400"><p>We are not as far away today as we were a year ago.  The reality is that we have a final bid submitted by the bidder at the end of the process.  I have heard various comments of concern and that is the reason I and my officials are taking the time to tease through this to make sure that any recommendation I make is made on the best advice possible.  It is not true to say that the State was in a position to refuse a commercial entity that wanted to carve out from a state aid package.  Under state aid, if an undertaking is commercial and a company makes a claim that it is commercial, then the State cannot include it in a State intervention area.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  The system is not to be delivered by copper.  This is to be delivered by fibre to the home.  That is to future proof it.  All of those who entered the competition were going to use such technology.  The aim was to future proof the system.</p></speech>

The observed scale and rate of change is consistent with regional and global trends, and these changes are projected to continue and increase over the coming decades.  Climate change will have diverse and wide-ranging impacts on Ireland&rsquo;s environment, society and economic development, including managed and natural ecosystems, water resources, agriculture and food security, human health and coastal zones.  Ireland's first statutory national adaptation framework, NAF, was published in January 2018.  The NAF sets out the national strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the country to the negative effects of climate change.  Under the NAF, Departments are preparing sectoral adaptation plans, which are due to be completed by September 2019. </p>  <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is the State agency charged with protection, management and development of the inland fisheries resource. </p>  <p>  I am advised that climate change has been identified by IFI as one of the greatest threats facing the wider aquatic environment and fish populations and structures in the medium to long term.  This will require significant efforts to overcome the considerable uncertainties and research requirements in relation to the impacts of climate change on Irish fish species, populations and habitats.  IFI has been proactive in this regard as the impact on fish stocks can be a barometer of climate change. </p>  <p>  In addition, IFI is exploring the building of an evidence-based assessment programme to assess the impact of climate change on the Irish fisheries sector in both freshwater and estuarine environments, with the ultimate aim to inform and build capacity for fisheries conservation and protection measures. </p></reply>

Since 1980 there has been a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat.  The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have happened since 2000.  We are playing Russian roulette with the future of our planet.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach was elected, he claimed the Government would be taking new initiatives in respect of climate change in the wake of budget 2018.  Looking at this Department his assertions are laughable.  That is the case across Government.  Our transport, energy and home heating sectors amount for almost half of our emissions yet the Government has done almost nothing to move them to a greener future.  All the time we see the impact on our economy.  The impact on freshwater fishing has an effect on our salmon stocks and the industry around that, which is valued at &euro;100 million based on the 2016 levels.  We have to get real on climate change and start extrapolating the impacts of climate change on our economy in a real way. </p></speech>

It also sets out the expenditure on the national policy position, a planned &euro;21.8 billion investment including &euro;14 billion to be invested by semi-State companies and private sectors in the national strategic low carbon and climate resilience plan, to prepare for that.</p>  <p>  There will be a transition period because we cannot just stop one thing and change to something else.  For example in agriculture and fisheries, it has to be built upon.  I am confident in the plans we have set out and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has been given permission to set up an all-of-Government action plan for climate change.  The investment is there but we need to make sure we change in such a way that we do not leave people behind or target the wrong people. </p></speech>

The principle of carbon pricing was introduced by the then Government in 2012.  Fine Gael-led Governments since then have failed to even raise that by &euro;1 or a cent since 2012.  If appropriate measures are taken in time, it means less will have to be done in the latter part of the target period.  I see nothing here or elsewhere that suggests to me that the Government is serious about tackling the impacts of climate change or addressing the future concerns the Minister of State has rightly identified.  He has laid out the difficult road ahead for this sector.  Unless we can bring that back to specific Government action, we will be failing future generations and our environment.</p></speech>

The Minister has already announced that seven major climate action projects will share &euro;77 million in funding, leveraging a total investment of &euro;300 million in the first round of applications for the climate action fund.  These projects will support decarbonisation of transport, heating, electricity and agriculture and demonstrate the type of investment that is happening here and now, not in 2040.  We will be building on this and for example, we want Bord na M&oacute;na, one of the companies in my remit, to change from brown to green and show by example how it can be done for the rest of the country.

They are mainly the result of a deal struck between Trump and Juncker last year, with Trump commenting afterwards that the EU was going to be a very big buyer of US liquid gas.  The terminal being built on the Shannon will lock us into future fossil fuel use when our future energy policy needs to focus on renewables.  Why are we allowing this private company to do this?</p></reply>

Europe is currently importing approximately 70% of its gas needs, with this share expected to increase.  The diversification of sources is important for security of supply purposes.  The involvement of US or other companies or corporations in the European gas industry is a commercial decision by those entities in a liberalised gas market.  The EU has acknowledged the importance of importing gas from the USA and other sources to diversify and render its energy supply more secure. </p>  <p>  At present Russia is the largest source of these imports, whereas the USA is of the order of 1% to 2%.</p>  <p>  The diversification of sources of supply is important for security of supply purposes and liquid natural gas, LNG, offers the opportunity to diversify supply.</p>  <p>  In Ireland since the Corrib field opened, we have reduced our dependence on gas imports from 95% to approximately 33% in 2017.  However, that reliance will rise again as the flow from these fields reduces.  We import from just one source in Scotland. </p>  <p>  The Shannon LNG project has been designated am EU project of common interest.  Ireland has supported that designation as it offers Ireland the potential for improved security of supply.</p>  <p>  In August 2018 Shannon LNG announced it had entered into an agreement with New Fortress Energy to develop the proposed LNG terminal at Ballylongford, County Kerry.  As this is a private commercial project, any future investment decisions on the development of this project are ultimately the responsibility of the project promoters, subject to compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.  </p></reply>

The Government is moving away from Russian gas and going to America and wants to frack gas, which is twice as damaging.  It is a scientific fact that US gas is fracked gas.  It releases more than twice the amount of methane than conventional gas, which comes from Russia which is already more damaging to global warming than coal.</p><p>This is nuts.  It is not going in the right direction in terms of climate change.  There is no evidence that this is a good climate action decision.  Royal Dutch Shell invented the idea of natural gas as a bridge fuel in 2001.  We are still talking about it 20 years later.  The reality is that over a 20-year period, liquid natural gas is dirtier than coal and diesel oil in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced.  This is because of the unburned methane that is released through the extraction, processing, transport, storage and combustion of that gas.  I have been looking at stuff from Cornell University, which is one of the leaders in this field.  It has pointed out that "reducing methane is absolutely key to meeting" the UN COP21 targets.</p></speech>

I would like to explain what we have to do right now in terms of our supply.  We have to transition to cleaner sources of fuels.  In the meantime, we need to have a transitionary period.  We cannot say we are not doing this or that.  The Shannon project is a private enterprise that is governed by EU regulations.  This means it can be done.  There is a need for secure supply right now.  In 20 years' time, we will have transitioned away from this type of fuel but we cannot do it overnight.  I mentioned earlier that Bord na M&oacute;na is moving from peat to other sources of energy.  This transition will take time.  We are working on that.  At the same time, we need to have security of supply.  We cannot rely on one source alone.</p></speech>

There has been a myth about gas as well.  I have looked at the Minister's responses over recent months.  It has been said that we are following EU guidelines.  As far as we are concerned, the unelected EU Commission is in the hands of the fossil fuel industry.  The carbon dioxide emissions from gas are far less than those from coal and diesel, but the methane element is disastrous.  Cornell University has pointed out that "Earth's climate system responds too slowly to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, and warming to 2&deg;C and higher will occur within the next 35 years unless methane emissions are reduced below current levels".  The Shannon facility will lock us into something that is not positive in the context of where we should be going as we seek to deal with the challenges of climate change.  This is not a way forward.  The Minister of State is arguing that we will have no security without this facility.  Rather than pursuing a dirtier fuel using fracked gas from America, we would be better off staying better friends with the Americans to bring us to a point where we will be using more renewables.</p></speech>

That is part of the whole-of-Government action plan on climate change.  As I said earlier when we spoke about the warming of our fisheries, this is happening and we have to face up to it as a reality.  We need to have an adult conversation about it.  We have to make sure whatever we do is done in a way that involves a transition to the proper place.  I do not disagree with what the Deputy has said about the research that exists.  We need to make sure we can secure supply for the moment.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to move away from fossil fuels to a cleaner society.</p></speech>

I ask the House to forgive me if I am being repetitive.  As I said in response to earlier questions, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has received a final tender submission from the bidder in respect of the ongoing procurement process for the national broadband plan.  My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  I will bring a recommendation to the Government in this regard in the coming weeks.  The level of subsidy required to bring high-speed broadband services to the 540,000 premises in the national broadband plan State intervention area will be determined through this procurement process.  Until the assessment is concluded, I will not be in a position to formulate a recommendation for the Government.  I am not yet in a position to discuss cost.  With regard to the completion of the build of the infrastructure, if a contract is awarded and signed, deployment will commence at the earliest possible opportunity with activity across all counties in the first year of deployment.  Given that deployment is likely to take some years, if a contract is awarded the bidder will be required to provide almost 300 broadband connection points across all counties in the first year of deployment.  These broadband connection points have been selected by local authorities and are locations of community importance such as schools and community centres.</p></speech>

There is nothing in it.  The motion we discussed earlier this week made it clear that the estimated total cost of the delivery of the national broadband plan is escalating.  The lack of clarity regarding those costs is a real concern.  The Minister's response is a source of further concern.  We know from this week's debate that the structure of the sole remaining bidding entity has changed substantially over the course of the process.  Significant concerns now exist regarding the robustness of the national broadband plan and the structure of the sole remaining bidder.  What happens if we have legal challenges?  As I said during this week's debate, I am a small contractor who tenders for projects.  The tender process has to be robust.  There cannot be a tender process if just one person or company is involved.  It just does not happen in that way.  I wish it did, because all of us would have great fun and we would have a great country.  The Minister knows that this is a right unholy mess.  It is just not good enough for businesses in my area, right from Carrick-on-Suir up to Nenagh.  I was contacted this morning by a man who is involved in a substantial long-standing business in Nenagh.  He does not have a broadband service.  It is 350 yd. away from him, but he cannot get it.</p></speech>

The Deputy will understand that people who are considering tenders do not talk about those tenders ahead of a decision.  That is normal practice.  The Deputy has expressed concern about a change in the composition of the bidding consortium.  There has been a very detailed pre-qualification process.  Any change in the composition of the consortium, or indeed of the contractors, has to go through that process.  An evaluation committee looks at technical and commercial compliance requirements.  When a change occurs, the committee looks at the financial standing and the technical and professional capability as a result of the change, as well as the suitability from a compliance perspective.  Every time there is a change, those tests have to be run and the State has to be satisfied that the requirements are met.</p></speech>

I am worried that this project will turn out like the children's hospital project.  The Minister has said that the non-disclosure of tender prices is a normal part of the tender process.  This process is not normal.  It is abnormal because we have just one bidder.  There is no political or commercial sensitivity here.  The only problem I have here is that taxpayers are being fleeced and homeowners are getting no service.  The Minister made it clear that following the review conducted by an independent process auditor, Mr. Peter Smith, a recommendation would be made to the Government on whether to appoint the Granahan McCourt-led consortium as the preferred bidder.  This is riddled with opportunities for legal litigation.  I represent people from Puckane to Ballingarry and everywhere else.  I represent homeowners, schoolgoers who want to get information on courses and fill out their CAO application forms, farmers and ordinary business people.  We are talking about providing hubs and giving community access.  This is farcical.  It is going nowhere.  The Minister is down a cul-de-sac.  It is not normal.  It is abnormal.  The Minister should do something about it because it could end up in the High Court or the Supreme Court.  If the Minister knew anything about tendering, he would know that he cannot deal with one bidder.</p></speech>

There was more than one bidder in the early stages.  We have had to contend with the withdrawal of some of those who initially entered the process.  That has been the reality.</p><p>As a result of that, to meet the concerns that Deputy Mattie McGrath's constituents are expressing to him, which concerns were eloquently expressed during the debate here the other night, we need to attest to the robustness of the technology, the deployment strategy, the terms of the contract, the governance, the protection of the State interest, the terms for connection of individuals who will be connected, and the fulfilment of the brief as set out.  These are things on which we have to conduct due diligence because there is only one bidder.  We must ensure that the State interest is protected.  The care that my Department and its officials are taking is proper in light of the concerns that the Deputy's constituents are expressing to him.  The Deputy would not thank me if we did not do that robust evaluation and that is the reality.  The Deputy would be the first person to ask why we did not evaluate this or that.</p></speech>

Gyproc, part of the Saint Gobain construction materials provider, operates a gypsum mine in Drummond, County Monaghan, and has a factory in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  The company employs more than 160 people in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Mining operations have been taking place in the area since 1936.</p>  <p>  On 19 December 2018, a crown hole, often referred to as a sinkhole, developed in the area of the Drumgossatt mine.  My Department, Monaghan County Council and the Environmental Protection Agency are working together to ensure that Gyproc carries out the necessary investigations to understand the development of the recent sinkhole in Magheracloone.  A programme of works has been agreed between the parties, including site investigations.  The results of investigations will be submitted by the company to the statutory authorities for monitoring and verification.  Timelines have been set for these works, which will be adjusted and revised depending on results.  The three statutory authorities continue to work closely to ensure that the situation is managed and resolved by the company as promptly as possible.  As a precautionary measure, Monaghan County Council closed a section of the L4900 road to facilitate the investigative drilling which is ongoing at the location.  I attended a meeting on 15 January in Carrickmacross which was held to allow representatives from the three statutory authorities, independent technical consultants and Gyproc to address concerns and questions from local residents affected by recent events.</p></speech>

Land collapsed at the community centre in the immediate aftermath of the emergence of that sinkhole.  Part of a road also collapsed with a significant impact on people getting around.</p>  <p>  My concerns are centred around the safety of the roads, five homes and a national school in the area.  Gyproc sent information leaflets to households explaining what was happening, which was fine to a point.  Inspection holes were bored around the collapsed ground and instruments lowered in to confirm the state of the structures below.  The holes were caused by pillars collapsing after water was pumped into a disused gypsum mine.</p>  <p>  The subsidence in September affected a radius of about 120 m and another hole has since opened up in a nearby area.  I accept it is a matter for the private company to deal with, but is it the Department's view that this is isolated to this particular mine structure, or is there a potential for similar events to happen at other disused mines or mine areas throughout the country?  That is what concerns me.  To what extent is the Department monitoring those disused mines and what kind of structure is in place to deal with that?</p></speech>

The second was the result of what they technically call a roof collapse, where the surface went down in a circle.  Both of these are being investigated, and that includes independent auditors looking at the results.  Gyproc has undertaken to produce all maps to the residents.  It will also produce all of the mining licences maps for that area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy touched on, one of the big things was the communication.  I told Gyproc at the meeting in Carrickmacross, in no uncertain terms, that its level of communication left a lot to be desired.  Gyproc has taken that on board and will set up a stakeholders committee where the county council, my Department, the EPA, the residents and the company will meet regularly, probably every fortnight, for updates on what is happening.  It is a serious issue, especially because of the type of mining that is being done there and the type of material involved.  There are other mines around the country which are being looked at.</p></speech>

I understand that, from the time that the water was pumped into the caverns, a three-month period elapsed before the collapse at Drumgossatt.  I understand that Gyproc indicated that it only monitors every six months, as required by the Department.  It appears in this case, based on the preliminary investigation, that the entire event happened within a three-month period.  The time between the flooding taking place and the actual collapse was three months.  The current directions of the Department make no requirement for Gyproc to do any reviews within that time.  It might be worthwhile for the Department to look again at its recommendations for necessary checks that need to be put in place and monitoring that to ensure that we do not have a similar situation in some other location.  The Department might also look at or review other mines throughout the country to ensure a similar situation does not arise.</p></speech>

That is something my Department will be looking at.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a mining heritage that extends back to the Bronze Age.  It has occurred at hundreds of sites, the majority of which are not the legal responsibility of the State.  The Department maintains an inventory of sites at which historical mining is known to have occurred, in compliance with Article 20 of extractive industries waste directive.  There Department continues to monitor other major sites around the country.  The site in Monaghan has a particular reason the collapse happened and it was because of the pumping in of water at a particular time which destabilised the ground.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that we have to look at the monitoring regime in places like that where there are specific issues or if there is a material change to the activity that is going on.</p></speech>

In Irish households, food waste is costing about &euro;700 each every year.  Ireland aims to halve food waste by 2030 in line with the United Nations sustainable development goals and the EU&rsquo;s circular economy action plan.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, we waste nearly 1 million tonnes of food annually.  About a third arises in retail and catering, with a somewhat smaller share of waste from consumers, and somewhat larger share from producers.  While supermarkets are directly responsible for the disposal of only 2% of food waste, their influence across the supply chain makes them central actors in combating our national food waste problem.  Recognising this, my Department and the EPA sought to involve major supermarkets in reducing food waste.  Aldi, BWG, Lidl, Musgrave and Tesco have all participated in my Department&rsquo;s action group on food waste.  This has involved signing up to the food waste charter commitments, supporting the EPA&rsquo;s "Stop food waste" campaign, signing up to the FoodCloud food donation network and collecting and sharing food waste data.</p>  <p>  I intend to build on this foundation.  I am currently reviewing the data on waste streams and practices at different points in the supply chain and any implications for our current programmes.  My aim is to identify initiatives which can reduce food waste in line with agreed targets but also to improve recycling by encouraging increased uptake and use of the brown bin by householders and businesses.</p><p>I shall work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the EPA, producers, retailers, consumers and local authorities to develop an effective strategy to deliver on these new ambitions.  Schools are important channels through which attention and improved practices can be promoted.</p></speech>

A great deal of progress has been made to reduce our food waste over the years.  If one looks back at 2009, the first pilot was done at Frenchpark in Roscommon which entailed a national master composter training programme.  The programme has been rolled out nationally since.  The introduction of brown bins was another success.  There is a website, <i>stopfoodwaste.ie</i>, which is also very good.  I welcome the Department's interaction with the various supermarkets, including Tesco, Lidl, BWG Foods and Musgraves on the initiative mentioned by the Minister and in the setting up of the action group.  Charitable organisations like FoodCloud are doing tremendous work.  Along with Simon, it operates a food hub in the midwest, which is great.  We need to build on this progress .  As such, I ask the Minister whether he has plans to step up efforts to reduce food waste.</p></speech>

A 50% reduction is going to require huge improvements.  Food bins are not universally deployed currently which means that is one area to examine.  There is significant contamination of bins currently.  The relatively high rate of contamination can compromise the recyclability of materials.  That is another area.  We will identify demands and requests on the production chain to see how we can reduce the impact across it.  It will be partly about enhancing consumer consciousness, taking into consideration the role of schools but we will also look at retailers, as the Deputy said, right back to producers to reduce the handling and creation of waste.</p></speech>

Indeed, producers are also an issue.  If one looks at vegetables in particular, there is a grading system which means that a vegetable of a different size or look than the norm is discarded.  Is that an area at which the Minister might look in the context of this issue?</p></speech>

Over one third of waste is at the producer end which reflects practices like that.  Whether the discards can be recycled into other material such as animal feed or whether they can get into the consumer chain, I am happy to look at any suggestion from players in the field.  I intend to meet with different players to go through the policy changes we need to make to deliver on our ambitions.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to address the policy initiatives his Department is developing to deal with these matters.</p></reply>

Providing adequate charging infrastructure is critical to ensure the continued growth in the uptake of electric vehicles.  There are currently 668 standard public charge points in the ESB's ecars network and a further limited number provided by local authorities and retail outlets.  There are also 77 fast chargers, mainly on national routes.  Most standard public chargers can provide approximately 100 km of range in one hour whereas fast chargers typically provide 100 km of range in 20 minutes.  Since the start of last year, a &euro;600 grant has been in place for home chargers and over 1,000 grants have been paid out to date.  Under the first call for applications from the climate action fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB ecars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network.  The key elements include six high speed charging hubs on motorways capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously; 16 high speed charging hubs capable of charging four vehicles simultaneously; additional high power chargers at 34 current 50 kW locations; upgrading over 50 22 kW chargers to 50 kW, and replacing up to 264 locations with 528 charge points at the pre-existing pilot grade of 22 kW to next generation high reliability models.  It is an ambitious programme.  New EU regulations will require employers with over 20 parking spaces to provide charging points by 2020.  This is in addition to the requirements in respect of new developments for both commercial and multiple dwelling developments.  As part of the climate action plan I am developing, I intend to look at the adequacy of the infrastructure and its path of growth to ensure we can meet the ambitious target we have set for electric vehicles in the network.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="11:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400008#F01100"><p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  The Minister has outlined some of the progress and indicated that there are 668 ESB charging points.  He further stated that his Department had provided a &euro;10 million grant to the ESB.  The Minister said there will be private charging points such as those which employers with more than 20 car spaces will be required to provide by 2020.  While that will cater for a lot of it, there is a need to create a network nationally which is more substantial and strategically located.  For people travelling from the west, south or even midlands, the question of range is always at issue, in particular when one's lights and window wipers are going at the same time as everything else.  I ask about the policy direction on the ownership of the network.  From where is the policy that the ESB must divest itself of the network coming?  Is it the Department?  Charging is not like refuelling a diesel or petrol car, it is a major investment.  There is also the matter of upgrading the grid as wider ownership of electric vehicles will place a strain on it.</p></speech>

As such, it is entering into consultations with stakeholders on the introduction of fees for fast chargers later in the year and for standard chargers in 2020.  The expectation is that many more entrants will come into the market when the service is no longer free.  The other network is that of the local authorities which have been very conscious of trying to develop a network which deals with range anxiety.  We are also considering whether the role of local authorities can be enhanced and whether they can be supported in this context.  There will be a mixture of public and private provision.  The key is that when charging is no longer entirely free, those who have obligations to meet will get some recompense and that will promote greater density in the network.  I will be assessing this carefully in the context of the plan to ensure we have it right.</p></speech>

What will happen with them?  There was a big push from the regulator to have the ESB divest itself of those chargers.  Is that continuing and is the policy direction coming from the Department?  It is a very clear question.  I welcome the fact that local authorities have become involved.  As the Minister has heard me say in the House before, local authorities have a major role to play as the form of government closest to the people in addressing climate change and in taking climate action.</p><p>If it does not happen at local level, it will not happen at national level.  There will be charging at home and workplaces, but there will be a substantial loading on the grid.  In Norway lights are reported to flicker in some parts of the country where there is a high number of EVs.  In its low carbon future document the ESB stated that to connect 275,000 EVs and heat pumps, the grid would need an upgrade costing &euro;300 million.</p></speech>

That suspension has been lifted, however, and the ESB is undertaking a new expansion under a new dispensation from the CRU.  The decision is one of an independent regulator and I am not aware of any requirement to divest.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is undoubtedly right about the loading on the grid.  As the uptake of electric vehicles increases, we will have to fortify the grid.  Capacity is one of the important aspects EirGrid must examine, not only for taking on electric vehicles but also renewables.  It is equally important that we move to smart metering and dynamic pricing opportunities in order that consumers can meet the pressures on the grid and that there can be dynamic demand to allow us to better manage the pressures.</p></speech>

The legislation sets out details of the tasks and, <i>inter alia</i>, restrictions, timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and the Oireachtas.</p><p>Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which member states must guarantee the independence of national regulatory authorities which are expressly forbidden from taking direct instructions from government.  The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the European Union's third energy package.  A policy direction in this matter, therefore, is not being considered.  Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised and competitive.  The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice of suppliers, products and prices for consumers and businesses.</p><p>The regulation of retail market prices for electricity and gas in Ireland ended in 2011 and 2014, respectively.  The thrust of Government policy on energy costs is focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency.  Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices and data from approved price comparison sites show that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. </p><p>The CRU has a statutory market monitoring function in the electricity and gas markets and is solely accountable for the performance of its functions to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

They are set out in the legislation.  The problem is that there is no competition on prices; rather, in some cases there are signs that energy prices have increased since the so-called liberalisation of the sector.  The regulator judges competition solely by switching rates, that is, the number of people who change from one supplier to another in any one year.  I understand the rate is high compared with that in other European countries.  That is the reason the regulator gives and has given in the past, but the problem is it does not deal with the issue of price because people are given a reduced price for a short period only.  Has there been any recent initiative?  Through his powers in legislation, has the Minister of State asked the regulator to initiate an investigation into the prices charges?  Last year the electricity supply of 4,626 households was disconnected.</p></speech>

Long-standing Government energy policy since 1999, aligned with the thrust of the European policy, has focused on the importance of increasing retail market competition, which results in a choice for consumers.  Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices.  Data from approved price comparison websites such as <i>bonkers.ie</i>or <i>switcher.ie</i>show that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers.  For example, in switching supplier a customer could save consuming an average amount of energy up to &euro;148 on an annual electricity bill and up to &euro;118 on an annual gas bill, while a customer of a single dual-fuel supplier could save up to &euro;300, as estimated by independent websites.  Therefore, there is competition and prices are being driven down by it, which is how the market should work.</p></speech>

The problem, however, is that the rates charges go back up, as anybody who has tried to switch supplier will have learned.  There is not a long-term saving.  In the past 20 years the percentage of household income spent on energy has increased dramatically.  If we consider the profits of suppliers, we can see that Bord G&aacute;is Energy which was once a State-owned company but which was sold to British Gas in 2014 made a profit of &euro;28 million in 2015, while pre-tax profits at SSE Airtricity have also increased.  Other companies' profits have risen substantially.  Has there been any investigation by the CRU or the Competition Authority?  Pay-as-you-go meters are typically used by people and households on the lowest incomes, but they are being charged significantly more for electricity.  The Minister of State needs to examine the matter to provide a policy direction and must speak to the CRU<b></b>about it.  The poorest households pay on time because they must, but they are being charged the most.</p></speech>

In addition, it is clear that such a move would run counter to the thrust of long-standing Government policy on energy, which favours competition.  Moreover, the CRU has carried out investigations of energy market competition in recent years and recommended a range of new measures which are being enacted by the regulator to boost consumer engagement and raise awareness of the availability of cheap, discounted tariffs to customers who switch suppliers.  If a customer switches suppliers, he or she can switch again the following year.</p></speech>

Perhaps it might be outlined in the second phase of the plan, but will the Minister comment on the specific infrastructure he is considering using to roll out broadband provision?  Are ESB poles being considered to bring fibre optic cable to homes, or will it only be done using telephone poles?  What percentage does the Minister estimate will not be provided by fibre optic cable but rather will be wireless?  They are the details I am looking to tease out to help to inform our discussion on the issue.</p></reply>

A few nights ago we had a debate in which many concerns were raised.  The reason the work is ongoing is we wish to tease out the issue of the robustness of technology and so forth.</p>  <p>  On the use of technology, bidders had access to the entire network.  There is an intention to use the networks of both Eir and the metropolitan areas.  Therefore, existing infrastructure is being used where possible, although delivering fibre optic cable to homes will require substantial new infrastructure.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases fibre broadband will be delivered to the home.  The approach envisaged throughout the process has been that up to 2% could be provided for otherwise than by fibre broadband to the home, with a request that it could go to a higher number on agreement.  However, in the vast majority of cases fibre broadband will be delivered to the home.</p></speech>

It seems that one of the options is to use ESB, rather than telephone, poles.  The thinking behind it is why in the long term would we maintain two mechanisms for delivering cable to a house?  We know that every single house has an electricity connection.  If the ESB already has the capability, working with Siro, to wrap fibre optic cables along electricity wires, it would be much easier to provide access that way.  There are difficulties with it as the cables run across fields, rather than along roadways, as telephone poles tend to do.  I question the overall strategic logic of maintaining the network of ESB poles in the country, as well as 2 million telephone poles.  A long-term strategic saving must be available if we were to use this opportunity to double up and use the same infrastructure, although I know it would not be easy.  There are lots of difficulties in negotiating with farmers and so on, but it would be a missed opportunity if we did not think strategically at this critical stage.  I am interested in knowing about the use of ESB poles and where the process is at.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, we had a number of them entering the competitive process.  Bidders could look at different approaches.  The ESB was one of the bidders at an earlier stage.  Clearly, they had to choose which approach to take in making their bid, but they are making use of existing infrastructure, both State and privately owned.  The mix is for the tenderer to set out.  It was an open technology-neutral tender.  There was no State direction on particular approaches that should be taken.  They were the terms on which the tender was developed.</p></speech>

The Department does not have to stand back completely.  It is good that metropolitan area networks, MANs, are being used.  It was obvious that they would be, given the history of the bidders.  The bidder may also use Eir poles.  However, it is my understanding the bidder was very keen and open to entering into negotiations with the ESB with that as an option.  I am keen to get some sense of whether that is now dead.  The Minister mentioned using existing infrastructure.  Is he precluding the use of ESB poles?  Is that likely or unlikely to happen?  Surely the Department must have some idea of whether it is in the mix where final delivery is concerned.  There is a State interest in the network we are building and its degree of efficiency.</p></speech>

Obviously, the bidders had to negotiate on the option they felt suited them best.  That required them to negotiate privately with other providers where they were going to use that network.  It was up to the bidder to come forward with what it regarded as the best approach in delivering at the least cost.  That has been the approach throughout the process.</p></speech>

It is a blight on the landscape in towns and villages and rural Ireland.  I know that the Minister of State will say dealing with it is the responsibility of local authorities and they are.  As it is a uniform problem in most parts of the country, it is time the Government and the Minister of State's Department looked at an initiative to support local authorities in dealing with this problem.</p></reply>

In 2019 specific priorities are the enforcement of large-scale illegal activity requiring multi-agency responses; identification of sites where illegal dumping occurs for enforcement; and creating regional multi-agency fora with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in each of the six Garda regions.  This will give a particular focus to the work of the regional lead local authorities for waste enforcement.  I shall provide assistance with enforcement costs and site solutions in 2019.  Enforcement is primarily through the local authority network which undertakes about 140,000 site inspections and 15,000 enforcement actions.  Each year the Environmental Protection Agency engages in particular enforcement of an upper tier of waste activities.  It also supervises the enforcement activities of local authorities and promotes programmes for critical improvement in enforcement.  My Department supports these activities with a &euro;7.4 million enforcement grant and is reviewing the effectiveness of the programme.</p>  <p>  In 2019 my Department will also be funding anti-dumping initiatives with a grant of &euro;2 million.  The grant has supported hundreds of projects across a range of activities, including clean-up, awareness and prevention, surveillance and smart enforcement.  This year's projects are being identified.  The criteria for the selection of projects will be communicated to local authorities shortly.</p></speech>

He specifically spoke about large-scale dumping.  Perhaps in his further remarks he might indicate how many prosecutions actually went through the courts last year and were successful.  With a lot of fly-tipping and the like taking place, local authorities will state securing the evidence to secure a successful prosecution is difficult.  While there are initiatives, how effective have they been?  Let us move away from large-scale dumping and look at the dumping of domestic refuse.  Perhaps there should be initiatives to provide greater flexibility for local authorities to offer free services.  I do not mean replacing the domestic charge; I refer to civic amenities available for one-off use.  Local authorities used to collect large household items once a year, but that has largely been done away with in many parts of the country.  Initiatives of that type need to be reintroduced.</p></speech>

It is a particular problem in my area of Galway East, but it is rife throughout the country and we need to do something about it.  The review that is ongoing will inform us on enforcement and helping local authorities and how effective enforcement and prosecutions have been.  I do not actually have the number of prosecutions to hand.  That is part of the overall review, but it is important that money is being made available.  We need to review and set out criteria to obtain effective results from it.  We need to mention the offenders in the media when they are found in order that they are named and shamed.  That is also very important.</p></speech>

From what local authorities tell me, however, securing prosecutions in court is difficult.  The Minister of State might come back in due course and indicate how many prosecutions were secured last year, but the reality is that many people are never brought to court.  That is the underlying issue.  From the householder's point of view, I note that we used to have a system under which large items were collected from houses once a year or every second year.  That service is no longer available from many local authorities.  Funding should be made available to local authorities to provide it.  Large-scale dumping often consists of beds, sofas and other large items.  Rather than paying for the clean-up afterwards, there should be a pro-active programme, as part of which local authorities would provide that service.</p></speech>

I agree that we need to incentivise people to dispose of what they have in a legal way.  We also need to have an awareness campaign to highlight the issue of prosecution.  We will get the Deputy the figures he has requested, but we are on the one page.  It is a question of making the most effective use of the money to ensure we will end up with an outcome that shows we are reducing this plague on the environment.</p></speech>

We are fully in favour of good public service broadcasting and funding it, but if one looks at wages alone, one will see figures of &euro;495,000, &euro;400,000 and &euro;389,000, which are substantial sums for a station that is serving the population of the whole island of 6,500,000, which is roughly half that of London.

I understand the director general has indicated an intention to see further reductions in the fees paid to top performers, but that is an operational matter for the company.  It will respond that some of the top performers are key in generating advertising revenue and that from its point of view they create important access to audiences and commercial revenue.  However, there is a balance that it has to strike, but we must recognise that it is part of the day-to-day operations of the company.</p></speech>

I understand he cannot go in every day of the week and demand this, that and the other be done.  However, this issue needs to be watched of a general policy direction.  The Minister needs to do this on behalf of householders.</p>  <p>  On the licence fee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment made various proposals and set out a course for the improved collection of the licence fee.  We know that there is a significant gap; in the region of &euro;40 million a year is not being collected.  Has the Minister any update on the matter? </p>  <p>  On introducing a cap on wages, the Minister has said the director general is seeking to reduce costs, which is welcome.  Has the director general indicated to the Minister that there is talk of a cap on wages similar to that being considered by the BBC?</p></speech>

It is something RT&Eacute; has also recognised.  It has indicated its record in bringing down salary levels and its intention to see it occur further.  I will certainly raise the concerns of the Deputy when I meet RT&Eacute;.  There is a balance to be struck.</p>  <p>  On the collection of the licence fee and the level of efficiency achieved in stamping out non-compliance, there is a cross-government report being produced which is due to be presented in the first quarter of the year.  I am looking forward to receiving it as it will look at the effectiveness of the system in place.</p></speech>

The Minister will appreciate that there is considerable concern, particularly in the light of what has happened in the building of the national children's hospital and the serious escalation in prices.  Will he outline for us any information he can on the cost of rolling out the national broadband plan?</p></reply>

The approach has been entirely different.  We are now at the end of a tendering process in which a very detailed examination of every element of the cost, right down to the number of poles required and the footage of fibre to be rolled out, is taking place.  It is at that level of detail and not at an initial stage.  Costs identified now will be very robust and have been subject to very close scrutiny by the State.  There is a distinction to be made in the stage of the process we are at.  We are at the stage where finalised tenders are being submitted.</p></speech>

The best value for the State could be provided on the basis of using that infrastructure.  Is the Minister concerned, in the light of the structures and tender process deployed, that following the consultative process we have ended up with a process where the two main players with all of the infrastructure are no longer able to participate because they do not see value in it for them?  We are left with one contractor who is not really involved in the business.  It is effectively a private investment fund in Boston with access to some sub-contractors here.  This contractor is effectively the only player left in the race.  Does the Minister have concerns about its capacity to deliver best value for the State?</p><p>In light of what the Minister has seen since he has arrived at the Department and knowing what he now knows, would he still stand over the consultative dialogue process deployed?</p></speech>

That list closely mirrors the list of subcontractors which would have been included by any other bidder.  They are experienced subcontractors.  The whole pre-qualification process required the evaluation committee to go through the experience, competence and record of work of the various players in the contract.  All these elements of competence, capacity and compliance have been examined in great detail by all those involved.  They are leveraging State infrastructure and private infrastructure, wherever that may be possible.  That has been a key element of the process.</p>  <p>  The approach of having a competitive tender has been supported by several decisions by the Government.  I believe it was the right approach.  This is an area in which the State did not and does not have a preconceived approach as to the ideal model to deliver best value.  It had an ambition.  The competitive tender process allowed that ambition to be filled by people experienced in the field who came forward with what they believed was the best way to achieve the plan&rsquo;s high ambition.</p></speech>

The heartbreaking stories of the families, and their courage and dignity in the face of what was facing them was seared on all our minds at the time.  The Government and the Minister for Health made many promises in the immediate days and weeks after the controversy broke.  It appears now, however, that the gap between those promises and their actual delivery is one into which thousands of women are beginning to fall.</p><p>Yesterday, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised the impact of increased smear test demand causing backlogs, delay and, ultimately, invalidating several tests because of missed expiry dates.  The Taoiseach in response would not or could not give a figure for the number of recall tests as a consequence of those missed dates, despite the fact that my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, had been asking questions at the beginning of December on this issue.  Last night, the HSE confirmed to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that 6,000 women would have to be recalled for a test as consequence.  This underlines the scale of the problem.  It is even worse than anybody would have thought yesterday.</p><p>This revelation, as well as the manner in which it came out, is once again causing concern.  The Government has failed to draw a clear line under the controversy.  It made significant promises but did not put the necessary resources in place to back them up.  Now, we are in a situation of concern.</p><p>On 10 January 2019, through a freedom of information request published in <i>journal.ie</i>, we learned the chief executive officer of Sonic Healthcare, which runs Medlab Pathology and which handles 50% of samples sent in through CervicalCheck, wrote to the Minister for Health on 15 June 2018 looking for what it termed his urgent intervention to address the unprecedented number of samples.  It warned him that without immediate action it believed the future viability of the cervical screening programme would be in jeopardy.  The Minister, however, did not act with any urgency about this.</p><p>On 18 October 2018, Deputy O'Reilly asked the T&aacute;naiste during Leaders&rsquo; Questions about the issue and the backlogs.  Again, the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged there was a difficulty, gave words of comfort but nothing came of that in terms of extra resources or an action plan.</p><p>The hike in demand as a consequence of the changes last May has led to a massive delay and is undermining the system.  We all believe in this essentially important scheme and want to restore confidence in it.  Once again, it is under significant pressure, however.  A rushed decision, not backed up by proper resources, has us back at this point again.  The Minister, despite many warnings, has put his head in the sand about dealing with it.</p><p>How long have the Minister for Health and the Government known of the need for a recall test of the 6,000 women in question?  When was the Taoiseach informed about that particular figure?  What measures is the Government taking?  I was in contact with GPs this morning.  The first they heard about this issue was on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  They are the first port of call for people who hear that story.  What actions is the Government taking in this regard?  Will the Minister for Health publish all of the medical advice he received before he took the decision to launch the free smear test process?  Will he come into the House to take questions from health spokespersons on every aspect of this issue?  More importantly, will he take questions on his plans to restore confidence in this considerably important programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400012#K00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to provide some clarity and, I hope, some reassurance to women concerned about this issue.  Before answering the Deputy&rsquo;s political charges and questions, I want to reassure the many women who understandably want to know exactly what is going on.</p>  <p>  In May, the Minister for Health made the decision to offer free out-of-cycle smear tests to women who were concerned about their health following issues which had emerged regarding the CervicalCheck controversy.  This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of many anxious women throughout the country.  The Government&rsquo;s approach has always been to seek to provide reassurance to women and to be fully transparent about that.  This clearly heightened concern and awareness around CervicalCheck, and the offer of free out-of-cycle smear tests has contributed to capacity issues - it is not a resource issue - resulting in the emergence of a backlog.  We know that because it has been raised multiple times in the House.</p>  <p>  The new issue which has arisen is separate to that backlog.  It is entirely inaccurate to claim that the repeat smears which women were offered have expired.  The new issue is separate to this and relates to one company only of the three involved in providing screening services.  Quest Diagnostics has advised CervicalCheck of a specific problem with standard human papillomavirus, HPV, tests which have been carried out outside of the manufacturer's recommended timeframe since secondary HPV screening was introduced.  The HSE's clinical review has assured women that this poses very little risk to women's health.  Evidence shows that HPV tests of this kind are effective outside of manufacturers&rsquo; recommended timeframes.</p>  <p>  However, as a precaution, the HSE will be writing to women to attend their GPs for repeat smear tests to confirm the results and to provide them with the reassurance to which they are entitled.  The HSE expects up to 6,000 women are likely to be recalled for a repeat smear.  These tests will be processed by the laboratory as a priority.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the politics of this issue, all in this House have an obligation to reassure women and give accurate information on what is being discussed and how we are going to solve it.  Priority number one is to reassure people.  The Minister for Health is not available next week but is happy to come into the House the following week to take questions and to give a detailed statement to respond to any of the queries which the Deputy may have.</p></speech>

These are essential to rebuilding trust and confidence in this necessary programme.  This information, however, has had to be dragged out yet again.  It was not provided through the HSE or primary care practitioners but on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  Surely the first port of contact should not have been &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  The Government was made aware of the second issue in November.  It is now the end of January.  There would have been no attempt to communicate if it had not been for the questions that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked in the House yesterday.  This morning the director of the screening programme said the demand and the backlog of tests is one of the reasons that this second issue was exposed.  There is a link.</p>  <p>  The most important thing is that we restore confidence.</p><p>The Minister may not be available but it is essential that a junior Minister would come to take questions as we do not have ten days.  We need to restore confidence immediately.</p></speech>

I understand one of the labs has reduced its staff complement from 16 to four; demand for screening has gone up by a third but it cut staff by 75%.  As the Government was made aware of the backlog on 18 October, what did it do to get extra resources to address what the T&aacute;naiste has defined as a capacity issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400013#L00400"><p>Let me reassure the House that this is not a resource issue.  When I say it is a "capacity issue", I refer to the capacity in the labs.  At a GP level, doctors have coped extremely well with the significant increase in the demand for smear tests and out-of-cycle smear tests offered without charge.  My understanding is that the challenge has been at the lab level, and this is not about resources; rather it relates to the capacity of labs with regard to testing and throughput.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is giving the impression that somehow the Government is trying to hide something and we would not be talking about this if it had not been for the Fianna F&aacute;il leader raising it yesterday.  That is not true.  The HSE stated it was made aware of this matter in November and the Minister was made aware of the issue with secondary HPV testing in December.  The issue was discussed at the CervicalCheck steering committee, including with patient representatives who are working very hard on that committee on the range of issues involved and outlined in published weekly reports.  The Minister sought regular updates but a final report was not available to him relating the numbers involved or who they were.  When the matter was raised yesterday, he did not have the information and could not provide it until it became available.</p></speech>

The cost of the proposed national children's hospital is spiralling out of control and will have serious impacts on other health projects over this year and beyond.  On Tuesday, 500 ambulance personnel staged a strike because the HSE bluntly and blatantly refuses to recognise the union seeking to represent members.  There is now a scenario where thousands of letters are being delivered to patients, many of whom have waited for long periods, telling them surgeries have been postponed because of the inevitable industrial action from nurses and midwives because of the Government's continued failure to address a recruitment and retention crisis.  To top all of this, in the past 24 hours another CervicalCheck scandal has emerged, as serious issues have arisen relating to the screening programme.  We have a health service that is in a state of constant chaos, and nobody on the Government benches seems to be willing to accept the seriousness of the position.</p>  <p>  The latest developments concerning CervicalCheck will be a source of serious concern and worry for many women.  We have been assured the risk to women is low but it is yet another example of the incompetence that prevails in a chaotic system.  Guaranteeing free smear tests for all women in the aftermath of the CervicalCheck scandal was the correct action but the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced that move without first consulting with GPs or labs.  Ensuring the labs had the capacity to deliver on the increased workload and complete the tests within the necessary time would have been correct as it would have avoided the problems we now see.  Lo and behold, we are now witnessing serious issues again.</p>  <p>  When this scandal was its height last year and people were demanding information and accountability, the buzzword was "confidence" and we can hear it again today.  Building public confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is necessary as we know screening saves lives.  Problems like this, however,  rock the confidence of people in the process.  We have been told that the Minister, Deputy Harris, was informed in December but will the T&aacute;naiste be a bit more specific about when the Minister found out that the screening was inadequate and retests would have to be done for up to 6,000 patients?  Why will it be February before these women can be informed that they need to have another test?  That will be two months later so what has the Minister done in the intervening period?  Why is it so late in the day while women have not been informed that the information they may have received on their second test - this would have been done because of a potential abnormality in the first test - could be inaccurate because it was done outside the timeframe stipulated by the manufacturer?  How can we be assured that this is the end of the matter and no more women will get a letter to the door or a phone call from a GP telling them information relayed to them relating to life-saving screening may be inaccurate?  Will the T&aacute;naiste answer those questions and clarify for those concerned women out there that this is the end of the matter, a line has been drawn under it and we can now move on?</p></speech>

Lessons must be learned and we must constantly improve how we provide healthcare services.  Those challenges are consistent across every developed country.  We spend &euro;16 billion per year on healthcare and there is a constant demand for change and improvement.  When mistakes are made, the Government must be held to account in how it fixes those errors and learns lessons from them.  The cost overrun for the national children's hospital has been mentioned and we have commissioned PwC to look in detail at how that has occurred.</p></speech>

That is instead of trying to score political points on the back of getting a proper and professional piece of independent work to ensure we get an accurate assessment of what happened and we can learn lessons for other projects.  The Deputy mentioned the potential nurses' strike and that is before the Workplace Relations Commission, the machinery of the State, and I hope it will be able to bring sensible proposals that can be the basis for an agreement to avoid the significant impact on patients that strike action would bring.  We all hope that will be possible.</p>  <p>  The CervicalCheck matter has been very demanding, particularly for so many women and their families who have felt its impact.  It has also had an impact in the Department of Health, the HSE and the Government, and we are ensuring we are doing everything we can to protect a screening service that saves lives while putting in place the necessary changes to improve it.  We must ensure all of this is transparent.  It is what we have been trying to do and will continue to do.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned secondary testing where low-grade changes have been detected on a cervical smear test.  A second so-called triage test that looks for the HPV virus is carried out by laboratories in those cases.  An issue has emerged with one of the three labs involved and we are working to correct it.  We will continue to do that.</p></speech>

When did the Minister, Deputy Harris, become aware of this?  Will the T&aacute;naiste be more specific than just telling us it was in December?  What did he do about it?  How come we are now in late January and 6,000 women who now need a repeat test have still not been informed?  Has the Minister been assured that this is it and there will be no more than 6,000 affected people out there?  Will he assure us of that?  From what time did this laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, make such a mess and how did it get things so wrong?  The director has told us that despite the lab being aware of this in November, it still does not have a clue how this happened.</p>  <p>  Mistakes have occurred and will continue to happen in the health service but we have just emerged from a major scandal and many women are still dealing with its consequences.  People have lost their lives because of the CervicalCheck scandal and now we have found out that another 6,000 women must have a secondary test done again because the laboratory got things wrong.  What happened and why did the Minister not bring this to the attention of the D&aacute;il?</p><p>What did he do?  How can the T&aacute;naiste assure us that we should have confidence?

This is the secondary test when low-grade changes are detected.  The HSE is working with Quest Diagnostics, which is one of the three laboratories used by the cervical cancer screening programme, to address the situation that has been identified regarding HPV tests.  Of the approximately 500,000 samples tested by Quest since 2015, the HSE has advised that some HPV tests have been performed outside of the recommended 30-day timeframe.  I am assured that this issue affects a very small portion of people, approximately 1%, of the tested total.  There will be cases where this means that a woman who has already had a test will be written to and requested to present for a re-test on a precautionary basis.  The HSE will write to those women and their GPs next week to request that they return for a further test.  It is expected that up 6,000 women will be invited to attend for a repeat test.  These tests will be processed by the laboratory as a priority.  The HSE has advised that all of the evidence suggests that even though the test was done outside of the 30-day window, the original results are still very reliable.  Consequently, can we please try to reassure people here that there is no cause for undue concern?  This is about full transparency because that is what patients should be entitled to expect.  It is about correcting a mistake that should not have happened and giving women reassurance through a repeat smear test.  The information I gave earlier to this House is that the HSE became aware of this issue in November.  The Minister became aware of it in December, had discussions on it, has asked for reports relating to it and has not yet received a complete report on it.  Consequently, the information I am giving to the House today is current.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is right; all of us in this House support medical screening for the early detection of cancer and other diseases.  The medical evidence that screening saves lives is overwhelming and we all need to ensure that we encourage men and women to avail of all screening opportunities.  In that context, it is essential that we and the public have full confidence in all our screening systems, including CervicalCheck.  However, there has been a litany of problems.  We know of the suffering and courage of the group of 221 women and we will continue to press the Government to respond to their needs.  We now see that 1,000 smears have been compromised over the summer due to delays.  The smears were waiting too long in the queue to be examined in the laboratory and now women need to have those smears repeated.  In the latest twist that was unveiled yesterday, it appears that a further 6,000 tests, a figure we only received late last night, are compromised due to HPV testing in the same laboratory, which has led to technical problems that, again, require those 6,000 women to endure a repeat test.  The delay in getting the cervical smear test is now 22 weeks according to the HSE.  If there are problems with the check and a re-check is required, this results in a further delay of 22 weeks.  Many women are availing of private healthcare options to get a faster check but that is not an option for everybody.  It is another example of the two-tier system.  I was contacted by somebody today who said that when she was told about this inordinate delay, she was advised that she could get a fast test if she paid for it.</p>  <p>  Delays in CervicalCheck are also causing delays to life-saving procedures.  For example, if women are to get a number of other medical procedures such as kidney transplants, they need up-to-date smear tests.  The delay in getting that check can cause delays to other life-saving procedures.  How much scandal can the screening programme take?  We are in favour of screening but the problems besetting CervicalCheck indicate that something is deeply wrong.  These problems are further eroding confidence in screening and people are anxious.  </p>  <p>  On behalf of the Government, can the T&aacute;naiste confirm how much additional funding was allocated to CervicalCheck last year?  Will the Government commit to full staffing and funding so that we can get CervicalCheck back on track and delivering the quality service we all want?  As a result of what has happened, as an emergency measure will the Government undertake to refund the cost of private checks, which might be of the order of &euro;100 to &euro;200 per patient, to address the backlog and remove the inequality between those who can pay privately and those who cannot?  </p></speech>

This is what the Scally report and the support packages for victims of this scandal were all about and that is what the Minister for Health has been trying to do, in my view, effectively, to bring order to how we respond to this in an appropriate way.  The Deputy talks about scandal.  We can contribute to that scandal and that sense of fear and uncertainty if we do not respond appropriately in this House and create fear unnecessarily.  We have a new issue that we did not know about and which needs to be addressed.  It was raised with the Minister in December-----</p></speech>

Is it that the HSE does not talk to the Minister or Government?  After what happened last year, we need to know the full facts.  I asked three specific questions.  Since the T&aacute;naiste will not have time to answer them here, could he respond to me in writing to deal with the anxieties of women and the inequalities facing those who cannot afford to wait 22 weeks for a result?</p></speech>

I said that the way in which this House responds to scandals like this either adds to the scandal and the sense of uncertainty and fear that many women face or has the opposite effect.  In all the decisions it has taken, all the reports for which it has asked and all the recommendations from experts for which it has looked, the Government has always focused on full transparency and trying to reassure women about their healthcare.  That is what we are doing here.</p><p>My understanding is that when the Minister was informed that there was an issue, he was not given details in respect of numbers or details of who those patients were.  He did not have that information and so could not share it.  The issue was discussed with the CervicalCheck steering committee which, of course, does include patient representatives and other experts.  The Minister asked for a detailed report on this issue so that he would be fully informed.  He did not have that and so could not provide it to the House.  That is my understanding but the Minister, who is on paternity leave at the moment, is happy to come in and answer all the questions the Deputy would like to ask of him regarding political accountability on these issues as soon as he returns to the House the week after next.  This morning, however, let us try to provide some reassurance, on the basis of the medical advice we have, to women who may be concerned today and who may be getting letters in the post next week regarding the repeat smear tests they will be offered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400015#N00200"><p>I wish to raise the issue of how Ireland is responding to its obligations to balance its ability to generate sufficient power to satisfy its needs with its obligations in respect of decarbonisation and climate change.  It is Government policy that the ESB's coal-burning power station at Moneypoint in County Clare will cease production by 2025.  Moneypoint is an old coal-burning station, which at its full capacity has the capacity to provide 900 MW of power and which plays a very important role in electricity generation in Ireland.  It provides a cheap, stable source of electricity.  The closure of the plant at Moneypoint presents the Government with a major problem in maintaining sufficient production of reasonably priced energy for a growing economy while meeting its international climate change obligations.  According to EUROSTAT, the cost of producing electricity in Ireland in 2017 was quite high.  Burning coal leaves a huge carbon footprint, which results in Ireland facing large fines of up to &euro;600 million for missing its carbon emission targets and climate change obligations.  Emitting greenhouse gases comes at a price.</p>  <p>  What will replace the power station at Moneypoint in 2025?  How will the ESB replace its capacity to generate power if the station is closed completely?  What are the plans in that regard?  Can Moneypoint be converted into a station which uses an alternative source of energy such as biomass or gas?  Can electricity generated from renewable sources such as offshore wind energy and tidal energy, which is available in abundance in the Shannon Estuary, be harnessed and channelled through Moneypoint?  Can the station be used as a landfall location for electricity produced from such renewable sources?</p>  <p>  Moneypoint is an important part of the electricity grid structure, the high-voltage lines of which radiate across the country.  The question is whether it can generate enough renewable energy to replace that generated by coal.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give me an indication of what the Government plans to do in respect of the plant at Moneypoint, which will cease burning coal in six years?  We need to be proactive on this matter and not wait until the last minute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400015#N00300"><p>I am glad the Deputy asked this question because this action is one of a series of significant measures the Government is pursuing to reduce the amount of emissions coming from this country and its economy.  Moneypoint, and energy generation generally, is a little different because it is in the traded sector and so does not have as direct an impact in terms of our national targets as do other emission sources.  Having said that, it is inappropriate to produce power from coal any longer.  We have to give the ESB the time to find viable alternatives that can use the significant grid infrastructure that connects Moneypoint across this country.  The station is connected to two 400 kV lines and is the most significant piece of electricity grid infrastructure we have so we should be using it in the future to transport power around this island.  However, we have to find alternatives to coal in order to do that.  It is up to the ESB to work with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to find alternatives that use the grid to its full capacity and that recognise the employment challenges that may come from a move away from generating power from coal.</p>  <p>  There are multiple opportunities arising from renewables, both onshore and offshore; from gas, which is an awful lot cleaner than coal although it is still a carbon fuel from which we need to move away; and from biomass, where there certainly are opportunities.  However it is up to the ESB to come up with viable commercial alternatives that can protect employment in the region and that can use the existing infrastructure, just as it is up to Bord na M&oacute;na to do so with respect to the transformation process in which it is involved.  It is worth noting that the ESB announced this week that it is engaging in the development of a very significant offshore wind project off Dundalk.  This will be a very significant contributor of renewable energy to the Irish grid in the future.  This is the change that is happening.  The use of coal to generate energy must end by 2025 but we need to use the infrastructure which has been built up over many years and which will still be part of our power solutions.</p></speech>

He obviously understands the difficulties, particularly those facing Moneypoint.  The question is really what are the alternatives?  I know that the ESB is to produce a report on how it will use alternative energy sources in electricity generation at Moneypoint but we have to have a clear pathway in respect of how those changes are going to occur.  There is potential for renewable energy, the question is whether there is going to be sufficient renewable energy which can be channelled through Moneypoint.</p>  <p>  I have another question on an area in which the T&aacute;naiste may be an expert.  On Brexit and interconnectivity with the UK and Northern Ireland with regard to delivering electricity to this country, what will be the effects of Brexit on electricity sources in Ireland?  Finally, the T&aacute;naiste mentioned that this measure will have profound implications for employment in County Clare.  The power station at Moneypoint is responsible for approximately 400 jobs in west Clare.  How will those jobs be replaced when we move from coal to some other form of energy generation?  Will they be protected?  Will other employment opportunities be generated from Moneypoint?</p></speech>

On Brexit, we plan to publish the heads of the legislation which is being prepared for a no-deal Brexit later on this afternoon.  One of the 17 heads of that Bill addresses the single electricity market.  It is not the only response required in that regard but an element of the response to the challenges we would face in respect of the single electricity market in the event of a no-deal Brexit is included in that legislation.</p>  <p>  I am very familiar with Moneypoint.  I have visited it on a number of occasions.  I was previously the Opposition spokesperson on energy.  Of course the ESB faces challenges in this area in terms of finding viable alternatives to coal, supporting its employees, and ensuring that the infrastructure that has been built and which connects Moneypoint remains a key positive factor in terms of grid management and electricity supply in the future.  I believe that enormous opportunities for job growth in County Clare and the west coast generally will arise from offshore renewables in the future.  The ESB will obviously come back to Government with a specific plan, as has Bord na M&oacute;na, with regard to how it proposes to move away from coal as a power source and towards alternative fuel sources which will be more climate-friendly.</p></speech>

Will the Government publish the medical advice the Minister for Health was given before he took the decision to proceed on the smear test issue?  The second issue is that the T&aacute;naiste keeps saying it is a matter for the laboratories.  The Government took the decision to progress the expansion of the screening programme without providing resources for the laboratories.  Does it intend to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to provide the necessary resources, once and for all, to address the backlog, as well as the second issue?</p></speech>

It is important to say the problems related to secondary HPV testing are not solely connected to the increased volume of smear tests.  We need to be accurate in considering what has contributed to what problem.  There are two separate issues.  One is capacity and one is secondary screening, when it has been necessary, in one of the three laboratories.  It is important to separate the two issues.  There is, of course, an obligation on the Government to be as accurate as it can when explaining what happened and why .  The Minister, Deputy Harris, looks forward to doing so.</p></speech>

We need it.  Whoever is in charge of the HSE at this time, be it a Minister of State or a senior Minister, needs to answer serious questions.  On numerous occasions today I have asked about when the Minister for Health received the advice.  Was it in early or at the end of December?  Why has it taken so long for the women who have been affected to be informed?  While the Taoiseach is abroad, the T&aacute;naiste is in charge.  Surely someone is in charge of the HSE who can obtain the information as to when the Minister was informed, what he was informed and why the Government decided not to inform patients until now.  As we still do not have a figure - it is about 6,000 - are we sure this is the number of people affected who have been identified?

The idea of taking paternity leave is a very good one.</p>  <p>  I have another health question for the T&aacute;naiste.  He will recall that the roll-out of free GP care was a Labour Party initiative that began in the term of office of the last Government.  In bad financial times we were able to make great progress with it, but it has stalled since the change of Government.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to roll out free GP care to the under-18s.  Given the lack of young adolescent mental health supports, this would be a very important contribution.  When will the commitment be implemented to roll out free GP care to the under-18s? </p></speech>

I asked Mr. Tony O'Brien, formerly of the HSE, who committed to giving me the answer to it.  I asked the Minister for Health about the matter twice and he committed to giving me the answer to it.  I also asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, when he replaced the T&aacute;naiste today and he, too, committed to giving me the answer to it.  It is a very simple question to indicate the political root of the problem with CervicalCheck.  From which laboratories did the 221 misdiagnosed false negative results emanate? I believe the answer to this question will show very clearly that at the root of the this tragic problem - another woman lost her life recently - is the decision to outsource women's health.  I ask the question again today and for an answer to it.  I know - I have seen documentation - that the answer is simple.  From which laboratories did the 221 misdiagnosed false negative results come?  It is a simple question, to which there is a simple answer that the Government refuses to give to me.  Having committed on several occasions to give me the answer, it still refuses and has done so since last May.  Imagine how frustrated women are.  The answer will show that at its heart was the decision to outsource women's health.</p></speech>

There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of probationary garda&iacute; assigned to County Tipperary.  It is absolutely astonishing that, between 2015 and 2018, County Tipperary was allocated only 48 probationary garda&iacute; out of a total of 2,146.  Last year only eight garda&iacute; were assigned to County Tipperary, a large rural county in which there are huge concerns about rural crime.  I now hear talk about garda&iacute; being picked to go to the Border.  Are we to have the numbers of garda&iacute; diminished again in rural areas?  Such a measure would be totally unjustifiable.  We need our fair share of Garda recruits and wish them well when they come.</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy and all other Members to a statement by the Garda Commissioner in which he states quite clearly that reports of 600 garda&iacute; being moved to the Border are entirely incorrect.  He has not discussed this matter, nor considered the proposal.  With regard to the position in County Tipperary, I assure the Deputy that operational issues are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  However, I note his concern and intend to visit the county tomorrow where I will engage with stakeholders and interested parties on the matter of rural crime.  I will be happy to furnish the Deputy with a report on the meeting.</p></speech>

Last year I was informed by the Government that an additional 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists would be recruited, which I welcomed.  In a response to a parliamentary question this month it was stated CAMHS was operating with only 39 out of 72 in-patient beds nationally.  As of 26 November, there were 44 out of 74 beds in use.</p><p>Despite the commitment the Government made, does it accept that we are going backwards in this area?  </p></speech>

Yesterday I met the national management teams of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, including representatives from the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, the clinical leads and the management leads.  We discussed this issue, along with many other issues, challenges and successes involved with CAMHS.</p>  <p>  The issue of beds closing is very complex and can happen for a variety of reasons.  It is often attributed to the behaviour of some patients who cannot be managed, meaning that beds have to be closed for safety reasons.  A facility is currently closed because of the extensive damage that was done to it.  Clinical cover is also an issue at times.  It is an ongoing challenge and is one we are acutely aware of and are dealing with as best we can on all levels, including the HSE management and the clinical team.</p></speech>

Fishing quotas are very unequally distributed and traditional fishing families are being squeezed out.  For example, in 2018 a tier 1 boat could fish 437 tonnes, but now, due to penalties imposed for exceeding the quota, the allowance for that boat has been reduced to 70 tonnes.  A tier 2 boat, allowed to fish 149 tonnes in 2018, has now had its allowance reduced to 24 tonnes.  Fishermen should not be penalised for landing fish over the quota, because under EU regulations excess fish cannot be discarded at sea.  However, under Irish law, the only way to land the exact quota is to discard the excess fish at sea.  Will the T&aacute;naiste explain why there are conflicting regulations in the EU and Ireland on how fishing vessels can land exact quotas?  The pilot quota balancing scheme will squeeze the lifeblood out of small fishing villages and towns.  What does the T&aacute;naiste intend to do to ensure a fair system for all in the fishing industry?  Will the Minister, who is present, meet those people who have been severely fined under this new regime?</p></speech>

That step will significantly enhance the financial viability of the small inshore fishing sector, of whom there are a far greater number than those operating in larger fishing boats.  The Deputy is obviously aware that we operate within the confines of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The fishing opportunities available to the industry are determined at the December council meeting each year.  We attempt to secure the maximum possible opportunity for our fishermen while operating within the constraints of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, which includes attaining a maximum sustainable yield, and within the constraints of the landing obligation.  In the context of the outcome of this year's December council meeting, we have managed to achieve those objectives.</p></speech>

On 29 November last year, Permanent TSB announced it was selling 6,139 loans linked to family homes.  That was not the first sale of family homes by that bank, or indeed by other banks, including State-owned banks, going right back to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, to vulture funds.  What made this a new low in Irish banking was that these mortgages involved families who were meeting their agreed arrangements with the banks.  They were fully up to date, but the sale still went ahead.  No sale to a vulture fund is right, but this sale is particularly offensive.  It is time for action, and the people and Sinn F&eacute;in say that enough is enough.</p><p>This Bill builds on the Central Bank's code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.  The first line of the code of practice, introduced in 1991, states &quot;A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower&quot;.  The code dates from a time before the banks destroyed this country's economy.  The cruel irony is that the banking collapse directly led to the loss of jobs and businesses, which in turn led to hundreds of thousands of people falling into arrears.  Some ten years after that collapse, those same banks are now turning on those families unfortunate enough to have suffered.  They are literally throwing them to the vultures.</p><p>This is a vicious circle.  Its victims are hard-working families and individuals who are doing their best to recover after the banks crashed the economy.  Anyone with a sense of justice or fairness must see that these vulture sales are completely unnecessary.  Another quote I came across is the following: &quot;Notwithstanding its voluntary nature, I expect that best practice dictates that the code be applied by all institutions to all classes of residential property&quot;.  Those are not my words, but the words of former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, from 2012, when he placed on the record of this House his answer to the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when asked about the voluntary nature of this code.  It should be noted that he said that it should be applied to all institutions.  Some six and a half years later, we hear nothing from the Government about best practice and the application of the code.  Have these years of putting banks first changed the core values of the people so much that we do not dare insist on what were basic demands only a few short years ago?</p><p>I do not believe that this is a radical Bill.  It is concerned with fairness and putting into legislation what the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance had until recently considered best practice.  The Government will surely say that the Bill will end the market for sales to vulture funds in this State.  I deeply hope that is the case, and I have no problem in saying that.  I do not want a vulture economy, and neither does my party.  I have chosen a side.  I am on the side of the small struggling farmer, homeowner and small businessman, not the side of the vultures.  I hope that is clear.  The banks selling off these loans are not paying a penny of tax.  They are subsidised by the help to buy scheme.  They are allowed to charge rip-off interest rates.  They are reducing services bit by bit, especially in rural Ireland, and are allowed to sell these loans despite the code of practice saying that they need the consent of the borrower.</p><p>The people have a right to say to the banks that we almost bankrupted ourselves to save them and that we have thousands of our sons and daughters in Australia and elsewhere because of them.  The least we can ask of them is for them to do their job and work through their mortgage arrears applying the options available and doing their best to keep people in their homes.</p> <p> The Bill is not great in length - it is a medium-length Bill - but its purpose can be summed up in the line taken from the code of practice of the Central Bank of Ireland.  It says that a loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower.  That is where Sinn F&eacute;in proudly stands.  I look forward to hearing where others stand when we move the Bill through Second Stage, which I intend to do next week.</p></speech>

Deputies expressed the view that there should be an input from this and the Upper House prior to the Government making a decision on the exact role and functions of directly elected mayors.  I am glad that the D&aacute;il will be able to have this discussion.  We will have it in the Seanad next week.</p><p>I wish to outline the proposals that I intend to present to the Government in the coming weeks.  I am here to listen to any good suggestion from Members.  Nothing has been finalised yet, so suggestions regarding this significant reform of how local government is run will be taken on board.</p><p>As the House will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to consider directly elected mayors in cities as part of a broader range of local government reforms.  Several previous programmes for Government included similar measures.  The reforms' principal aim is strengthening local democracy and shifting the balance of power, which is lopsided in many respects, between the executive and those who are directly elected by the people.</p><p>On foot of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, I submitted to the Government last September a policy paper, entitled Local Authority Leadership, Governance and Administration, which included a number of policy proposals for directly elected mayors.  This policy paper was approved by the Government at its meeting of 27 September and forwarded to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for consideration.  The Government also agreed in principle that plebiscites would be held on directly elected mayors with executive functions in the areas of Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council, and Galway city and Galway county councils at the same time as the local government elections next May.  This decision was subject to the necessary provisions for the holding of the plebiscites being included in the Local Government Bill and the requirement that I would revert to the Government with more detailed proposals on the plebiscites, the questions to be put and the specific powers to be given to these directly elected mayors.</p><p>Following yesterday's completion of the Local Government Bill by the Houses, the Bill provides for plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions in the local authority areas of Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, and Waterford City and County Council.  It is intended that the plebiscites will be held at the same time as the local elections in May.  The Department is prioritising the Government's instruction to produce more detailed proposals on plebiscites, the questions to be put to the electorate and the specific powers of mayors.  These detailed proposals, including an analysis of the costs involved, will be submitted to the Government in the coming weeks.  Prior to reverting to the Government with these more detailed proposals, I wish to consult both Houses to understand their views on the matter.</p><p>As Deputies will be aware, local government legislation divides local authority functions into executive and reserved functions.  The proposed office of directly elected mayor with executive functions should bridge the gap between the two categories of functions.  It is my view that, subject to some exceptions, responsibility for executive functions could be transferred in their entirety to directly elected mayors.  The directly elected mayor would be an <i>ex officio</i>member of the elected council and continue to perform the functions currently exercised by local authority cathaoirligh, mayors and lord mayors, including reserved functions.  This would encompass a civic and representational role, where the mayor would act as the &quot;face&quot; of the local authority domestically and internationally.</p><p>Given the potentially wide range of functions performed by local authorities, the directly elected mayor's role would need to be supported by a chief executive officer.  The executive mayor would have a similar relationship with the local authority chief executive as a Minister has with a Secretary General of a Department.</p><p>The mayor's functions would exclude executive functions related to planning matters, which would remain with the chief executive.  Chief executives would also continue to be responsible for organisational and staff related matters.  This is similar to arrangements in Departments, where the Secretary General is responsible for such matters.</p><p>The elected council would be the primary body with responsibility for oversight of the mayor in the performance of his or her functions and for holding him or her accountable while also exercising its existing and future reserved functions.  I emphasise this point, as it has been raised in many discussions in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere.  We are not proposing the removal of any of the existing reserved functions that local councillors have.</p><p>A mechanism to recall the mayor should also be set out and will be included in the final memorandum that goes to Government.  I would be interested in Members' views on that issue.  At a local level, on creating a position with such responsibility it also would be necessary to ensure, were a matter to arise, that there would be a recall election mechanism for the public, as has been recently provided for in the United Kingdom but that has existed for years in many other democracies across the world.</p> <p> In addition to the directly elected executive mayor proposals, I will propose a strengthening of the strategic planning committees, SPCs.  My intention is to create a Cabinet-style system where the chairs of the various SPCs would form the mayor's cabinet, replacing the corporate policy group.  As to what role or title would be officially given, no decision has yet been made.  It is the case in local authorities right across western Europe that different councillors sometimes are the lead councillor for certain strategic matters that the local authority controls and I certainly envisage that should be the case in Ireland.</p> <p> I intend that the policy paper will analyse the costs involved in establishing a new position of directly elected mayor.  This analysis is to include the costs of the position of mayor itself and of the plebiscites to be held.  This is an important requirement for the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> As I mentioned, it is intended that the plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions will be held on the same day as the local elections in May next.  Anyone entitled to vote in the local government elections in the local authority areas listed will be entitled to vote in a plebiscite on directly elected mayors.  Regulations for the holding of the plebiscites and their necessary requirements and arrangements, will be made by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Information for electors on the proposals to be voted on in the plebiscites will be drawn up by the Department and sent to local authorities for distribution to electors.</p> <p> The Government decided at its meeting of 27 September that in view of the complexities of local government in County Dublin and the Dublin metropolitan area, which is defined in the national planning framework, it would be appropriate to allow space for detailed and informed public discourse on the matter of directly elected mayors for Dublin.  For that reason, the Government decided that the issue of directly elected mayors for Dublin would be referred to a Dublin citizens' assembly, to be convened in 2019.  The Department of the Taoiseach is leading on the convening of the assembly, with the input of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Consideration will need to be given to the membership of the assembly, for example, whether the assembly should include elected officeholders similar to membership of the Convention on the Constitution.  It certainly is my personal view that the assembly should have a similar make-up as the Convention on the Constitution.  There is also a range of complex policy questions to be examined by the Dublin citizens' assembly, including the consideration of functions of the officeholder; the proposed relationship between the directly elected mayor and the local authority elected members and the executive of the local authorities involved; and the geographical area that would fall under the Dublin mayor's remit.</p> <p> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Members for their ongoing engagement on the issue.  The establishment of offices of directly elected mayors with executive functions would represent a very significant change and development in the political accountability of leadership at local authority level and I look forward to hearing the views of Members during the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400022#X00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity today to speak on this issue of directly elected mayors.  I will start by reflecting on some comments the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, made last night in respect of the Local Government Bill 2018.  The Minister of State noted that when he was speaking with the councillors' representative group, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, it was not able to provide him with even one additional power that it thought could be allocated to councillors in the performance of their elected roles.  That is difficult to believe but if it is true, it is shocking.  Having spent 17 years as a councillor - the Minister of State also was a councillor - there are plenty that I could have suggested for the group.  In respect of the specific role of directly elected mayors, there are powers I definitely believe should be allocated to these mayors should the plebiscites be successful.  They are powers I note the Minister of State already has ruled out when he touched on the subject during the debate before Christmas and, again, this afternoon.</p><p>I believe that if all we are doing in creating directly elected mayors is creating a post for a councillor to go and cut ribbons, we are doing a disservice to the role in the first place and, in fact, are codding the people.  They would be going out <i>en masse</i>to vote for a person who they believe could act as a genuine local leader who could effect change in their area only to find that the Government did not give him or her any real powers in the areas that matter.  Those powers would still remain with the chief executive because those at Government level could not trust a mere elected councillor to have powers that could bring together the forward-looking plans we need for our towns and cities.  If we really want to create the positions of directly elected mayors that will be comparable with the same positions across Europe that the Minister of State has cited, these need to be afforded executive powers.  These executive powers should be along the lines of a director of services in respect of planning, housing and transport in order that when reports are produced by the respective professional persons at staff level in such local authority departments, ultimately, a file can be signed off on or rejected by an elected representative who has been sent there by the people of that county and city to do the job.  That is the key line, namely, a person sent there by the people.</p><p>Increasingly, people are becoming frustrated that when it comes to major decisions impacting on their lives in their counties and cities, they suddenly find that those for whom they went out and voted do not have the power to make or rescind a decision.  They can make lengthy speeches in the council chamber and can stand with people at a protest but they do not have the executive power to make or rescind executive decisions.  It will be an unelected person, a faceless official whose details will not be listed in many cases on the local authority's website, not even his or her email address or telephone number, who will make that decision.  Frankly, that is not right.  I had enough of it when I was a councillor.  I do not want to see an opportunity wasted by us not affording directly elected mayors, in whom people would have confidence, the power to do that.</p><p>As a country, we either will have the welcome conversation that, thankfully, is starting today in this Chamber about whether we now accept we have matured and moved past the scandals and clientelism that scarred this country in the post-Independence era to a position where we trust those elected to do the job we expect they should be able to do or, if the Minister of State does not create such a vista, we will be saying that our future leaders at local and city level, including those who have not yet even been born or conceived, are to carry the sins of a small number of their forefathers.  We will be saying that, forever and a day, we do not believe we can trust elected members to discharge what is the preserve of unelected officials.  I do not believe in that mantra.  I want to see elected members have powers similar to those of a director of services in the areas of planning, transport and housing in order that they can set down a programme and vision for their respective city and county and then lead the development of that plan with the powers to implement it.  I do not seek a situation where we have directed elected mayors rolled out to recite the corporate message of the local authority, that is, the &quot;face&quot; of the local authority, as the Minister of State called it, as opposed to the expressed will of the people.</p><p>The benefit of trusting our elected representatives with such power is that these officeholders will be accountable in a real sense for their actions to the people who elect them in their city or county.  If they fail in meeting those high standards or in upholding their mandate, they will be gone in the next election.  Let us take, as an example, the recent controversy in south inner-city Dublin surrounding the removal of the Weaver Square garden space, which is used currently for allotments by residents but will be turned into 100 rapid-build homes.  It is a green lung in the heart of inner-city Dublin, which is a condensed urbanised space where there is a dearth of green space for city dwellers to enjoy a green lung and plant their own vegetables.  It also is an urban space where there are thousands on the social housing waiting list and where 100 rapid-build homes would make a real difference to people waiting years for a place to call home.  During that debate, there were passionate statements on both sides with equal credentials, but one statement that stood out for me was that of Ms Samantha McCaffrey from the Weaver Square Community Garden group, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, &quot;We want to see a fair, transparent public planning process&rdquo;.  That statement sums up the frustration of people with their local authorities when it comes to decisions that really impact their lives.  People can live with final decisions if they can see that their opinion mattered in the process.</p><p>We need real decision-making powers for elected mayors.  They should not be allocating a few bob for potholes or making representations to an engineer.  We should have a situation whereby a local resident can speak to a local elected person who can either accept or reject his or her petition.  The fact that so many decisions that matter to people are made by unelected officials is a source of great frustration.  The public would prefer to have a mayor with the line manager power to sign or reject a planning file.  This is a debate worth having and I am starting it today.</p> <p> I referred to a recent controversy in Dublin by way of example.  Of course, the plans being brought forward would have made little difference in that situation because there are no proposals for a mayor for our capital city, which quite frankly is unbelievable and a disgrace.  Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that Dublin needs a directly elected mayor.  Deputy John Lahart, who will speak on the issue, brought forward a Bill on 27 October 2016 which proposed holding a plebiscite for a Dublin mayor.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that such a position could revolutionise the city of Dublin.  If afforded the correct powers, it could ensure that we have a European capital which runs properly, rather than one strangled by transport issues, as was the case last year.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, strolled into the Chamber, said it was nothing to do with him and left again.  Nobody was accountable and nobody took the issues by the scruff of the neck.  However, everyone pays the price for the system that, as a country, we are prepared to endure.  The citizens of Dublin want to see a massive step taken and a directly elected mayor for the city.  That question should be put to the people.</p> <p> Equally, there is a need for a discussion about the powers a directly elected mayor would have in order to get Dublin moving and operating correctly.  That is the case for many areas of the country, in addition to Dublin and those listed, which would benefit from having a directly elected mayor.</p> <p> Having had the honour of twice serving as mayor of my home town of Navan, I know what a privilege it is.  However, we should seek to take the position to a new level.  We should trust the people we elect and let them set out a vision which they can implement when elected rather than having a scenario similar to the presidential election, in which candidates talk policy but such flowery language means nothing in the long run in terms of tangible changes.</p> <p> The Minister of State referred to councillors having Cabinet-style positions at a local level and taking the lead role in certain departments.  That is the situation across Europe, as I am aware having engaged with councillors in twinned towns across the Continent.  However, there is no point in floating that idea unless those lead Cabinet roles would come with the powers of a director of service.</p> <p> I welcome the discussion.  The Minister of State has come forward and asked for our opinions.  I have given mine.  I hope they will be taken on board and that we can have a robust debate and work collaboratively to ensure that if directly elected mayors are endorsed by the people in a plebiscite, they will have real powers, be truly representative, change the communities they represent and be accountable to the people.  If we do that, it will be a good piece of work and we will have changed the system in this country in a meaningful way for generations to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400023#Y00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Quinlivan.</p>  <p>  I wish to note on the record the very constructive way in which the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has engaged with members of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the broader issues of local government reform as well as on the Local Government Bill with which the House dealt yesterday.  In light of that engagement by the Minister, it is important that members on this side of the House engage in the same constructive spirit.  For decades, Members of the Opposition have demanded reform of local government, but when they get into power they do not do anything about it.  We would be far better served by having a genuine and constructive debate on what can be done in the short to medium term and then acting on it.  If there are good Government proposals which reflect some of the views of the Opposition, let us get the ball rolling on them.  All Members accept that our local government system gives too little power to elected members and too much power to chief executives and managers.  Many of them are public servants of outstanding quality and ability and serve their communities well but, nonetheless, they are unelected.  On that basis, I wish to put forward some reflections of my views and those of my party colleagues.  Deputy Quinlivan will do likewise.</p>  <p>  There is no straight answer to the question of whether one supports the idea of a directly elected mayor because it very much depends on what powers will be vested in that office.  I welcome the personal views of the Minister of State that there should be a shift of executive functions to a directly elected mayor if such a post is created.  I too believe a plebiscite is the right way to go because it would give the office popular democratic legitimacy, as well as generating debate among the public on the matter, which is good for democracy.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that we are discussing elections and plebiscites before discussing the powers which directly elected mayors would have.  We must address that matter quickly.  The Government proposals in that regard should be put into the public arena well in advance of any plebiscite in order that we can decide whether or not we support the propositions.  I oppose any reduction in the reserved functions of elected members and, therefore, welcome the indication of the Minister of State that those functions would remain as they are.  There should be consideration of functions being devolved downwards from some State agencies or, possibly, Departments because that would further enhance the role of directly elected mayors.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that Dublin is not being included in the broader discussion.  However, I acknowledge that a process initiated by a predecessor of the Minister of State fell foul of Fingal county councillors, including some Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors, who blocked the possibility of a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor in Dublin.  The issue is more complicated in Dublin because there are four local authorities.  I was a member of South Dublin County Council and am aware of concerns that a directly elected mayor would be city centric and that there would be a return to some of the difficulties encountered in the days of Dublin Corporation.  There was also a genuine concern, including with my local authority in south Dublin, regarding powers being devolved upwards to a directly elected mayor from the local authorities.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not support such a move.</p>  <p>  It would be best to identify a small number of strategic important functions that would be vested in the office of a directly elected mayor.  I agree with the Minister of State that planning should not be one of those functions, although that could be considered at a later stage when the system is embedded.  However, given where we have come from in terms of planning corruption and the improper relationship between some politicians and some planning decisions, it would be far better to begin with directly elected mayors having responsibility for issues such as strategic development plans and transport.  If we design an office that has clear executive functions and start with a number of clearly defined issues on which a directly elected mayor would add value, it will win public confidence and demonstrate the office works.  One could then have a process of rolling devolution of other powers at further stages.  That would be a sensible way to go about it.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supported the creation of the office of a directly elected mayor for Dublin, subject to its being granted the right kind of powers.  However, our preference is for a different system than may exist in Limerick, Cork or Waterford, for example, if the people of those cities and counties agree to such a proposition because Dublin requires a mayor who does not have the functions of the individual chief executives of the four local authorities but, rather, strategic functions overarching those.  For example, rather than being responsible for planning decisions, the directly elected mayor should be tasked with deciding on planning issues of very strategic importance such that one does not have the kind of practice whereby one local authority decides to gazump a commercial centre in the neighbouring local authority by developing a very large retail shopping centre, as happened some years ago on the border between Fingal and south Dublin.  If some of those larger strategic functions were vested in a directly elected mayor for Dublin, it could be very positive.</p>  <p>  We must also think carefully about how such an office would interact with the existing structures of local government, including local councillors, strategic policy committees and other bodies, whether in the cities for a directly elected mayor is currently proposed, in Dublin or elsewhere.  That would not be straightforward and should form part of the discussion.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that we are having this debate in public.  The housing committee would be a good forum for us to have less rhetorical and more evidence-based and cordial discussions as to what is required.  The committee would be happy to facilitate the attendance of any Oireachtas Member with an interest in this matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge a comment the Minister of State made to the housing committee on several occasions.  He pointed out that we have been so focussed on the housing crisis that we have not given local government enough space and he is correct in that regard.  The committee must take its responsibility in regard to local government more seriously and create more space for those discussions.  Some of these legislative proposals will give us an opportunity to do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to working constructively with the Minister of State on this issue.</p><p>We want to see more powers devolved to elected politicians.  We would like to see the public given the opportunity to decide on directly elected mayors.  If the Minister of State is willing to continue to work with us as he has done so far, he will find that, even where we have differences, we will be very willing partners in the process to ensure the kind of government we provide for citizens at local government level is enhanced in their interest and the interest of the wider community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400024#Z00200"><p>As the Minister of State is aware, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the upcoming plebiscites on directly elected mayors.  Generally, we believe more needs to be done to secure support.  I remain deeply concerned that, this close to the proposed plebiscite, we are still unaware of what powers and functions the newly elected mayors will have and how the office will work.  With European and local elections at the same time, people will get confused.  We need to have the discussion as quickly as possible.  We need to tell people what the Minister of State is proposing.  We need him to tell us first of all, obviously.  If he wants us to sell the concept at the doors, he needs to start informing us now.  Voters are already looking at local election manifestoes in which there will be information on mayors or upcoming referendums.  Time is passing quickly.  I am genuinely concerned the proposal will not pass because people will not have enough information on it.  If it is passed, directly electing a local mayor will hand power back to the citizens of Limerick and other cities.  That can only be positive.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Bill 2018 provides for the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council.  The mayors will provide for a new type of leadership in our main cities.  The system will allow candidates from each party and none to set out their vision and ambitions for their cities.  This is vital in my city, Limerick, where a mayor could set out his ambitions and plans for regeneration areas, for attracting more business to the region, and for boosting tourism in the city.  There could probably be a targeted response to try to address the great number of unemployment blackspots across the city.</p>  <p>  Having directly elected mayors will be of little benefit or value to us if they do not have real power, however.  Key functions related to transport, infrastructure, economic development, waste management and tourism should be vested in the mayor's office.  These powers must be devolved from central government and also the relevant State agencies.  It is important that staff and funding follow to allow the plans to be implemented.  There is no point in electing a mayor who has no power, nothing to add, and is just in office as a figurehead.</p>  <p>  It is vital, however, that there be no reduction in the powers, functions and budgets of the existing local authorities.  The merger of the Limerick councils would not have been achieved without strategic intervention from the Government to allow it.  It was not the case that the two councils were able to merge on their own.  Therefore, we need to be cognisant that we will need to provide additional funding to councils if they want to do this.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, we already have a weak local government system by comparison with the systems of many of our European counterparts.  It is important, therefore, that if we further strengthen our local government structures, we devolve responsibility for issues that can be dealt with at local level to those on the ground.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the upcoming plebiscite as there has been completely insufficient engagement with voters about it.  There is a high degree of uncertainty about the exact shape a directly elected mayor's office would take.  Individuals have spoken to me about this.  They hear there will be a directly elected mayor and plebiscite but they do not know anything about them.  I cannot answer the questions because the Minister of State has not given us information on what the Government intends to do.  We need to provide the information as quickly as possible.  May is fast approaching and it will come sooner than we expect.</p>  <p>  People in Limerick to whom I have spoken are completely unaware of the proposal.  My concern is that the proposal will not pass.  It is in danger of defeat.  If the Government goes ahead with the plebiscite, which I want it to do provided it gives us the information, and if the relevant powers are in place, having directly elected mayors could have a very positive effect on Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  The Minister of State will have our support if he comes forward with some proposals that enhance the functions of directly elected mayors and if he devolves more powers to them while retaining the functions of local councillors and providing the additional resources and staff that are required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400024#Z00300"><p>I welcome this debate.  I agree with what has been said about the importance of having a public debate on this issue in advance of plebiscites in May.  There is very little knowledge that there will be plebiscites in the areas concerned.  Across the water and north of the Border, we see from the Brexit negotiations the damage that can be done if a major change is proposed and the public does not know what it is about.  The British public learned a lot about what Brexit is since it decided in favour of it but it really should have been having the conversation on it before it voted, and it should have had all the required information.  It did not have it.  This is an example of where putting something to the public without having the necessary broad conversation is dangerous.</p><p>Having said that, I believe we should have the plebiscites but we do need the conversation.  The Minister of State needs to find a way in which to have the public debate in the areas concerned as well as here in the D&aacute;il Chamber, at meetings of the committee and so on.  The Minister of State needs to find a way, be it through town hall-style meetings or otherwise, to have a general debate so people will understand what the matter is about.</p><p>I support what has just been said.  I said in the debate before Christmas that we do not know what the functions will be.  The Minister of State referred to the requirement that he would revert to the Government with more detailed proposals on the plebiscites, the question to be put and the specific powers to be given to mayors.  It is all very well to be reverting to the Government, but will he do so soon so there will be enough time in which to have the conversation?  If we only get the information out on the functions and powers close to the vote, there will not be time for a public debate.  This is a big decision for local people.  If somewhere ends up with a celebrity-style mayor because there has not been a proper debate on what mayors do, it will have the wrong kind of person.  We need somebody who can take the responsibility.  It is not just about powers.  It is about responsibility.</p><p>Traditionally, because local government has been so weak, local public representatives have not been in the habit of taking serious decisions and accepting the consequences of their actions.  I support the fact that the Minister of State said councillors will continue to have their reserved functions.  To an extent, in decisions on budgets and such functions, councillors do take responsibility.  If, however, a person is given specific powers, he or she has to take the associated responsibility.  Sometimes it is said that while one would like to do everything and would vote for everything, there is only a limited budget, meaning only certain things can be done..  Therefore, there needs to be clear understanding.</p><p>My experience of this issue is based largely on the model in France.  I was chairman of a twinning committee at one stage and visited the city twinned with Limerick, namely Quimper, Brittany.  I had discussions with French mayors and deputy mayors.  A French municipality includes the town or city plus the rural hinterland.  The mayors make decisions.  The deputy mayors are in charge of matters such as transport and the budget.  Therefore, they have to say they can do this road but not that road, or this but not that.  These are the kinds of responsible decisions we have not been used to in local government.  We really need to prepare our public representatives, in addition to the public, for genuine responsibility.  It is not just a matter of voting against something because it is in one's area when one knows one's colleagues will vote for it in some other area and it is going to go through.  We have to make sure there is real responsibility taken at local level.</p><p>There are a number of different models.  I have not had time to read about them all.  The IPA had in the winter 2017 edition of the <i>Local Authority Times</i>an article about the different kinds of models for directly elected mayors.  We need to consider what model we will have.  I would be inclined to agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that a small number of specific functions would be more appropriate in the beginning.  That will mean the public will have a better chance of understanding what it is voting for, and the public representatives and the directly elected mayor will understand what their responsibilities will be.  Some of the decisions they might have to make might not be all that popular, and they need to recognise that.  There is a genuine learning curve and there is not an awful lot of time to learn.</p><p>I presume Galway is excluded because it will not be ready on time.  In a way, it is a pity that the people of Galway will not have the opportunities to vote for what the rest of us will have the opportunity to vote on.  The people of Dublin will not either.  With regard to Limerick, mayors should be municipally based.  An issue arises over the fact that the local authority in Limerick has responsibility for both the city and county, as is the case in Waterford.</p><p>As Deputy Quinlivan knows well, under the existing system, Limerick City and County Council has had mayors from far away parts of the county.  There is also a municipal mayor which causes a lot of confusion about the two roles.  I am not sure how it will pan out, but if the directly elected mayor comes from a rural part of the county, it will present an issue.  Mayors in other places such as New York, London or Vancouver represent cities.  There is an understanding internationally that a mayor - a directly elected mayor in particular - is a city based politician.  If we end up with a directly elected mayor of Limerick city and county or Waterford city and county from the rural part of the electoral area, it will pose a problem in how he or she will represent the municipality.  I do not know what can be done about this, but it is something that needs to be considered.</p> <p> I support the principle and hope it will work out well, but it will have a much better chance of being successful if there is clarity well in advance on the functions, powers, responsibilities and budgets, as well as the relationship with the executive of the council, the people and the Government.  There are many issues about which the public has not thought or been aware in terms of how it might work.  We have always had the same system of local government, which is not about directly elected mayors with powers and functions.  I presume the intention is that a directly elected mayor will be like a Minister, that the chief executive will be like the Secretary General of a Department and that the staff will work under both in some way.  There are issues to be clarified in that regard and I call for as much public dialogue as possible.  Although the responsibility primarily rests with the Minister of State, there is also a responsibility on the rest of us to ensure it is possible and that the information will be decided and made available as quickly as possible in order that the plebiscites and elections will be conducted in such a way that there will be public understanding of what is being voted on.  People will not be voting for a champion sportsperson but for somebody who will take responsibility for the running of the area.  There also needs to be a sense that this is about subsidiarity, local conversations and engaging with community organisations, businesses and everything that goes on in a local area, not about one person sitting in his or her office making decisions for everybody else.  It must be collaborative and there must be engagement throughout the area.  I am broadly supportive, but, please, let us get out and speak to the public about what is being proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-24a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400025#AA00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the issue of directly elected mayors.  A groupthink opinion has developed and it appears that the majority of Opposition parties and Deputies in the House, from Fianna F&aacute;il to the Green Party and all parties in between, support the idea without being able to offer any meaningful explanation of how the role will actually work.  On what we can all probably agree is that local government in Ireland is in desperate need of urgent reform.  We do not really have local government but poorly funded local administration.</p>  <p>  Consecutive Governments, beginning with Fianna F&aacute;il in the 1990s, have whittled away the powers of local authorities, with the result that is now probably the most centrally governed country in the European Union.  However, I am not convinced that the introduction of a directly elected mayor will resolve the issue.  The argument in favour of having a directly elected mayor appears to be as follows.  If Dublin, Galway or Cork had a single recognisable figurehead who was directly elected by the people, that person would have a mandate to use his or her executive powers to fix any problem.  If it all sounds too good to be true, it is.  Instead of making vague statements on the reasons we may need to have a directly elected mayor, the parties and the Government should examine how the model has worked in the United Kingdom in the past 15 years.</p>  <p>  More than 20 years ago, before he became a war criminal, Tony Blair, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister for the first time, used similar rhetoric to that used by political parties here when he stated the heart of the problem was that local government needed recognised leaders if it was to fulfil a community leadership role.  He said the people and outside organisations needed to know who was politically responsible for running the councils.  His love of all things American, including its mayoral system, resulted in the Local Government Act 2000.  Among the reforms contained in it was the possible adoption by local government of a directly elected mayor model.  The residents of a city could vote through in a referendum that it would be governed by a directly elected mayor.  Towns and cities would still retain councils and the plan was that the two would work together, with final responsibility residing with the mayor.  Since the introduction of the legislation, there have been 53 referendums held in the United Kingdom, with only 16 of the 326 towns voting to be governed by a directly elected mayor.  Although the lack of appetite for the proposal does not necessarily equate to failure, a study comparing a city that had adopted the model with the previous model of local government found there had been very little change in terms of policy output and spending.  Research undertaken in the 16 cities in question has shown that directly elected mayors are just as dependent on central government for funding, that their introduction does not lead to a sudden upheaval in a city's fortunes or spending power and that it is extremely difficult for a mayor to exert influence in specific policy areas.</p>  <p>  I will take the city of Liverpool as an example.  At approximately 500,000, it has a similar population to Dublin, excluding the suburbs and other boundaries.  From 2011 to 2012 the city had a standard Cabinet and council leader model.  In that period the city spent 64% of its annual budget on social services, including education, housing and social care services.  The following year, from 2012 to 2013, it voted in favour of the elected mayor model.  Figures show that it now spends an almost identitcal figure, 62%, of its annual budget on social services.  The new mayor had no choice but to work with the existing council.  The same will happen in Dublin or Galway if they decide to adopt such a position.  Not only have directly elected mayors in the United Kingdom been unable to exert any real power, they have not been taken seriously by the citizens of their towns and cities, for which one would hardly blame them.  In 2002 voters in Hartlepool elected the mascot of the football club, H'Angus the Monkey, as their first mayor.  His campaign slogan was "free bananas for schoolchildren", which was actually not a bad idea.  He won two further consecutive elections and served for a total of ten years.  In 2013 Hartlepool voted to get rid of the directly elected mayor and return to the original cabinet and council leader model.</p>  <p>  Comparisons with cities such as New York or London are not helpful.  The mayor of New York has a budget of $60 billion and appoints the police commissioner.  As we know, the United States has a federal system.  Therefore, the system of local government is established by each state, not the federal government.  Local government is not dependent on central government for funding or powers.  That is why the US system works, the UK model has failed and the Irish model will also more than likely fail.  Similar to New York, London is cited as an example we should have directly elected mayors.  However, it is not only at city but a region.  Yes, it has a directly elected mayor, but there are also a Minister for London, a regional government office and a regional budget, as well as 32 councils in the 32 boroughs.  The 32 councils are responsible for the majority of local services such as education services, social services, waste collection and road maintenance.</p>  <p>  For the mayor system in Ireland to work like the US system, mayors would have to have significant executive powers, but I have yet to hear anyone outline from where those powers would come.  They would need to be taken away from somebody who already has them and we do not do that too easily in Ireland.  If a directly elected mayor were to exert real influence over a city, he or she would need similar powers to those vested in the Ministers for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Given that for the past 25 years consecutive Governments have diluted the role of local government, it is unlikely that there will a complete U-turn on this policy.  In fact, it is probably delusional.</p><p>In addition to ministerial powers, for directly-elected mayors to work, they will need powers similar to those now vested in semi-State organisations such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, and C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CI&Eacute;.  The newly created Land Development Agency is probably the worst thing that has happened in this Chamber since I came in here in March 2011.  This agency will have significantly powers to source sites and land.  Will these mayors be given similar powers?  NAMA still has significant powers.  It controls most of the development of the Dublin docklands.  Will a directly-elected mayor be able to challenge NAMA's use of its powers or will he or she be given similar powers when NAMA is finally disbanded?  </p> <p> Truth be told, the Land Development Agency is NAMA mark 2 anyway, so this going to run and run.  It will continue to use that mechanism to provide unaffordable housing to the people of Ireland at great cost, given that developers will be engaged who look for between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000 profit per unit for themselves.  I do not expect that authority will be given to a mayor.  There is a growing trend in this House of legislation being proposed that goes against empirical evidence and data.  Legislation is instead drafted on the basis that if it sounds good then it must be good.  </p> <p> A Bill was passed last week on sexual offences which went against all of the empirical data yet the Government allowed it to advance to appease its coalition partners.  It was a load of rubbish.  The introduction of directly-elected mayors is similar in nature.  It sounds like a great proposal, all the Opposition parties can get behind it and they can call and sell it to their constituents as something that will solve the problems in their cities or towns.  When we drill a bit into the proposal, however, there is not much detail.  Analysis of our nearest neighbours in the UK, where a similar system of central and local government operates, shows that the introduction of directly-elected mayors has not worked.  It could be argued that it has been a bit of a disaster.  </p> <p> I welcome, therefore, the Minister of State's decision to hold a citizens' assembly to examine the proposal to introduce the office of a directly-elected mayor in Dublin.  I ask him, however, to suspend the proposed plebiscites in Cork and Galway and allow the assembly to examine the overall proposal in respect of the whole country and not just Dublin.  If do this, if we would like to dream about how it should be done, that is fine.  It works for cities in America.  Unless we are prepared to go down that road, however, and take so much power away from others and give it to the new mayor, we are wasting our time.  This is just another sham that looks good and sounds good but is going nowhere.  The mayor will just be a tool of the local authority, which has very little funding and is totally dependent on central government.  This proposal will, more than likely, end up just costing the State more money without deriving any merit from it. </p> <p> If this was an Opposition Bill and not a Government one, it would not get the money message.  Imagine the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 not getting a money message yesterday.  That is a new low for that scheme to stop Bills progressing.  The Bill yesterday was opposed on the basis that introducing criminal offences could cost the State money and that it could be open to challenges.  All legislation ever introduced here since the State was founded has been open to challenge.  That is absolute bollocks.  </p></speech>

I deeply regret we are not adding the people of Dublin to that list.  It is a real missed opportunity.  A citizens' assembly is coming - and to answer one of the questions the Minister of State asked in his opening statement - it should include elected representatives.  That is because we have experience of local government, most of us, which can usefully add to that assembly.</p>  <p>  I will make some broad points to explain why we are so supportive of the concept of directly-elected mayors.  I was at a Women for Election event last night.  I reflected then that in the depth of our crisis about ten years ago, a whole range of different movements rightly rose up seeking to change our democracy and how we do things.  Some of those things have been delivered.  I refer to examples such as having gender quotas for people to run for Parliament.  That has been very beneficial.  The provisions originally written by the Green Party, and, in fairness, implemented by the subsequent Government, took corporate donations out of Irish politics.  That is another example of how we have changed the nature of politics.  </p>  <p>  There are various missed opportunities I place at the doors of the Fine Gael and Labour parties during their time in government.  One was the wrong property tax being picked.  That was instead of a tax based on site value.  That is one example.  The other biggest failing, however, or one of the biggest in reforming the way we do politics, has been the failure to follow through in strengthening local government.  I am particularly bitter about that because when we were in government, we introduced legislation for the introduction of a directly-elected mayor in Dublin.  It had almost gone right through the parliamentary process, I think it was on Report Stage in the Seanad when we ran out of room and that Government fell.  We were that close to achieving the objective of having a directly-elected mayor for Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to rectify that.  I hope the people will direct us towards have a real strengthening of local government by supporting the plebiscites.  It is particularly important for Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick because we need to counterbalance the excessive and growing influence of Dublin as a centre of development.  We need to see other strong cities to balance development more effectively.  That is not to do down Dublin.  I was at an interesting conference in Cork where clearly researched analysis showed that the development of second, third and fourth cities also tends to strengthen a capital.  It is not one versus the other.  I believe that will be best achieved by the people of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway starting to develop their cities in a far more creative, careful and intelligent way.</p>  <p>  No one could look at the development of those cities over the last 30 or 40 years and not surmise that the current system is fatally flawed.  One of the key issues to examine is what the responsibilities of a directly-elected mayor would be in respect of planning.  I agree with the Minster of State's comment in his statement that directly-elected mayors do not necessarily have to deal with individually planning decisions.  I refer to co-ordinating planning such in the broad planning of a city and the broad task we have of turning around the city of Cork.  It is a fantastic city with incredible Victorian and Georgian heritage.  Over the past 30 or 40 years, however, the city has seen a hollowing out of its centre and a sprawl beyond it.  That is because of a lack of leadership, a lack of co-ordination by the city council and a lack of any real vision for how Cork might develop as a city.  </p>  <p>  That needs to change and it needs local political leadership to make it happen.  It is the same for each of the other cities.  Only 3% of the population of Limerick city lives in the historic core area of the city.  It is also a fantastic Georgian city with an amazing location on the Shannon.  It too has seen a sprawl out with motorway networks that just lead to gridlock.  The development of public transport has not been facilitated and nor has the development of high-quality new housing and schools close to where people work and want to live.  That has to change.  It is the same in Galway and that is probably the worst example, in terms of being a city where everyone seems to live on one side and then travel across to the other side to work.  It is hell for motorists because we have built a city of roundabouts rather than a city of tribes.   </p><p>That has to change.  A civil servant or a chief executive who has all the powers does not have the mandate to achieve the scale of change needed.

The current system is not working and needs to change.</p>  <p>  I broadly agree with the proposal that the relationship between the new directly elected mayor and the local authority chief executive would be akin to that of a Minister and a departmental Secretary General.  I agree with the proposal for making the chairs of the various strategic planning committees, the current corporate policy group, into a cabinet.  That is an easy way of the current system evolving into this approach.  Those of us who have worked as councillors know the local area committee system works.  That should be strengthened at the same time.  Powers should not just rest in the key areas of transport and planning but include enterprise development, culture and the environment.  I would also like to see the strengthening of local government in education, policing and healthcare.</p>  <p>  This would really empower local government.  However, it will happen better when faith in local government is returned.  Faith in politics comes from people having the ability to get rid of a mayor if they do not like the way their city is being run and developed.  The current system whereby we hand over a mayoral chain every year is a phoney exercise, pretending the real power is there.  It is deeply unfair to councillors and those who take up the office of mayor.  My experience in Dublin is that one is only getting to grips with it and understanding the scale of the job when one is then out of office because the year is up.  It is a completely flawed and failed system.</p>  <p>  Being brave in terms of adopting a different system is the right way to go.  It needs to be done in tandem with other elements.  At a climate committee meeting yesterday, I acknowledged that some of the initiatives such as the regional rural and urban development funds, as well as the climate fund, are well designed.  Rather than the system deciding everything centrally in the Department of Finance or the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, it is far better for us to provide funding to allow local authorities or other institutions to make bids to do regeneration projects.  Those projects which work best should then be replicated in other parts of the country.  In those circumstances where there is a significant pot of money for cities to compete where the best project wins, this would encourage the expertise, planning and thinking in local authorities which would help them flourish.</p>  <p>  When will the convention for Dublin take place?  My city is probably the one in greatest need for new leadership.  The current system in Dublin is broken.  We are facing gridlock in our city.  We have an inability to develop.  We are still widening every approach road to Dublin.  The greatest possible lunacy in transport and planning is happening under the current system.  We need a mayor for Dublin.  We need for that convention to finish to ensure Dublin can have its plebiscite.  Dublin deserves the right to have a directly elected mayor and a say in how our city should grow.</p></speech>

A directly elected mayor is of considerable importance to the community which elects that person.  I note the powers of executive authority which will transfer to a directly elected mayor will be useful, powerful and make him or her accountable to the public for his or her actions.</p>  <p>  The current weakness in local government is that the system goes back to the various local government Acts introduced in the 1920s.  Eventually, the County (Management) Act brought in the county manager essentially as a dictator to order and decide what happened with a local authority.  Councillors and mayors, unless they were strong personalities, did what they were told.  Conflict in local government as a result of this approach was often reflected in reports in local newspapers.  The position of county manager was unelected.  In the majority of cases, county managers led dynamically and we have had excellent administrators and managers.  However, we also have had bad ones.  From my local newspapers, I note there is conflict between my local authority chief executive officer and councillors.  Members opposite are smiling about this.  I will not comment on the controversies or the personalities.  However, it is not right that local government in County Louth has been reduced to a confrontation between the two.  If that were to change, I would welcome it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State&rsquo;s legislation should go further.  The Government has had the wisdom to nominate several towns for future exceptional development, such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Sligo and Athlone, in the national spatial strategy plan.  We need to identify a new source of executive authority in the local government areas in which these towns are situated.  If one were to add directly elected mayors for Drogheda and Dundalk, it would lend authority to decisions being made by, as well as the focus of, local government.  It is important we do that because the democratic deficit is clearly there.</p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan is correct about councillors getting the mayoral chain every so often.  I have been privileged to wear the chain of office in Drogheda at least three times myself.  In the future, should I ever be retired from this House, I might do it again.  Local government needs accountability, decision-making and people power.  At the heart of what the Minister of State is doing is bringing people power, executive authority and accountability back to the people.</p>  <p>  Another deficit in local government is due to the fact that Oireachtas Members can no longer be local authority members.  I know the arguments for removing the dual mandate but I was and am still against that move.  Members&rsquo; experience, knowledge and insight could be particularly useful to local government.</p>  <p>  If a directly elected mayor will have the same executive functions as the chief executive officer of a local authority, then the mayor should have the same salary too.</p><p>The salary of a mayor should be the same as that of the current chief executive or administrator.  It would attract the required calibre of person needed to do this job.  The position would need to be properly paid to attract the best candidate.</p> <p> I presume the election of a mayor would be a separate vote in the local government elections.  The difficulty is whether a person could run for mayor while simultaneously running to be a councillor.</p></speech>

It is fair to say he has advanced it more rapidly than any of his predecessors.  There is an issue with the citizens' convention.  It is not a real citizens' assembly as this Chamber is the citizens' assembly.  I know the matter is to be referred to the Citizens' Assembly because it will make the decisions that this House lacks the courage to.  It will come back with the same kind of ideas about a directly elected mayor for Dublin that the more radical among us have been proposing for a number of years.  It is a shame and we should grasp the concept.</p>  <p>  Dublin Chamber has been making the point for a number of years about the number of agencies with which someone coming to the country must engage.  Other cities with directly elected mayors that have powers and budgets have a one-stop shop or a go-to person who everybody in the city or county knows.  Ultimately, the buck stops with the person.  He or she has responsibility and with that responsibility comes accountability.</p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on the point as I would start with a very restricted number of responsibilities, just as London did.  We could even start in Dublin by giving a directly elected mayor responsibility for transport, making him or her the one-stop shop for the area.  Even as an Opposition Deputy, there are a number of agencies that must be engaged when dealing with transport.  Dublin Chamber has a voice from business and we must also consider Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and cyclist groups.  These are a small sample of the total group as we must talk to everybody to get the different views.  The mayor would have the power to call all of those in and make decisions affecting them.</p>  <p>  I have spoken with the Minister of State and I know he realises that Dublin is different.  It must be stressed that Dublin is not competing with other cities in Ireland.  As an international city, it is competing with other cities in Europe that already have directly elected mayors.  Climate change meetings, for example, would be attended by mayors from Munich, Barcelona, Madrid and Paris.  They have great power and authority.  In Dublin, on the other hand, there are four mayors that are indirectly elected and which have no say in the direction of policy at home.  They may sign up to conventions but they have no real power or influence.  A directly elected mayor affords a capital the opportunity to develop partnerships with other cities with whom we have common policy interests.  In a scenario where the United Kingdom has left the European Union, it will be critical to develop new allies.  These do not always have to be national and they can be city-based if we find a common cause and are able to fight our corner with those allies fighting for the same issues.  Westminster restricted the power of the London mayor but increased its power over the years as the directly elected mayoralty began to bed in.</p>  <p>  Dublin has been grinding to a halt and congestion costs an estimated &euro;300 million per year, rising to an estimated &euro;3 billion per year by the time we get to 2030.  We need somebody who is accountable and responsible, and the current Minister exercises no great responsibility or interest in traffic congestion or transport issues concerning everyday Dubliners.  He shuns any kind of accountability in that space.  I am a spokesperson for Dublin issues and I know from engaging with the four Dublin local authorities that they have four directors for each of the areas of planning, transport, arts and culture or environment, and it is rare for those directors to communicate with each other.</p>  <p>  I am the first to champion the idea that the establishment of those four Dublin local authorities as a response to the corruption that was in the planning system.  Elected representatives who may have lived in another part of a county could potentially have voted to zone land 50 miles away.  The four Dublin local authorities became very manageable and absolutely ruled out that possibility of corruption.  Another benefit is that we have established three successful county towns in Dundrum, Swords and my constituency of Tallaght.</p>  <p>  I raised the following matter at a meeting of the climate change committee.  A roundabout has recently been constructed in my constituency.  It is a small matter in the grand scheme of things.  Somebody said to me recently that I must be up to my tonsils dealing with Brexit but I said the biggest issue I am facing is a roundabout in my constituency because nobody seems to be accountable for it.  It is causing chaos but no public representative can pinpoint who is responsible.  There are public meetings planned - I am going to one after this - and there will be a protest on Saturday.  It seems that it is only through protest in town that officialdom begins to listen and take action.  If we had a directly elected mayor, the people in my constituency would know it is the person to go to and the mayor would be responsible and accountable.  The mayor would have to rectify the problem.</p></speech>

He submitted his paper, Local Authority Leadership, Governance and Administration, and he considered many of the key aspects of setting up devolved directly elected administrations.  I very much welcome the possibility that mayors will be elected in Cork City Council, Limerick city and county and in Waterford.  As I said when debating the Bill, I am very disappointed that Galway and my city did not get the same provision.  The Minister of State set out the steps to be taken on plebiscites etc. and there is a tremendous need for devolved administrations at the closest level to the people.  I did not like the Minister of State indicating in his speech that there would still be a chief executive officer, CEO.  Surely the CEO would be the directly elected mayor.  Would it not be better to call the head of the administration, who would be responsible for human resources etc., the secretary general or whatever?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has set out a reasonable argument on how to select the strategic planning committees.  All of us who served in local government could see the leaders of the committees forming that type of cabinet across a local authority.  The biggest disappointment is that the Minister has not gone straight ahead and asked the 1.5 million Dubliners to vote on this.  As Deputy Lahart said so eloquently, they want somebody whom they can hold responsible for the range of services from local government that are not being fulfilled.  This could relate to the state of the streets or lights.  Even with housing there is a lethargic and bureaucratic approach from the four councils in the Dublin region.  It is the record of the past 25 years and we need a much more dynamic system.</p>  <p>  I have always been in favour of directly elected mayors and a strong supporter of a single directly elected mayor for the four Dublin local authorities.  That mayor would have a small cabinet drawn from the four councils or a directly elected small assembly.</p><p>Last week we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of the first D&aacute;il.  The decision of Cumann na nGaedheal in the late 1920s to do away with local administration - at the time, there were local councils in Howth and Rathmines - and set up the bureaucracies involving county managers represented a very regressive step.</p></speech>

The major problems that dramatically affect the Dublin region, including the shocking lack of affordable and social housing, the very backward state of the poor transport system compared to those in other European capitals of similar size and in the erratic ad hoc developer-led planning system, may all be traced back to a lack of vigorous local leadership throughout the past 100 years.  Probably the most effective manager in Dublin city and county was Mr. Frank Feely.  When I served on the council, he used to say Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would never allow a directly elected mayor in Dublin because the day he or she was elected, he or she would become the second most important politician in the State after the Taoiseach.  There is an element of truth in that and it is something to which we should face up.  Other great cities such as Vienna in Austria have them.  When we look across Europe, we can see 17 directly elected mayors in the United Kingdom in places such London, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham.  It is fascinating to watch mayors who have a clear mandate such as Mr. Andy Burnham in Manchester, Mr. Andy Street in Birmingham who used to head up a famous retail chain and Sadiq Khan in London and the operation of their dynamic programmes encompassing public transport, housing and the revival of drainage systems.  Likewise, when we look across the United States, we see the same.  I was struck some years ago by the example of Stockholm which has four councils but a single executive mayor, Karin Bj&ouml;rnsdotter Wanng&aring;rd.  She can make key executive decisions for the entire municipality.  The greater Stockholm area has a population of 3 million or 4 million.</p>  <p>  I welcome the tiny steps the Minister of State has taken and would like him to reflect on the points made about the chief executive.  I know that it is going for consultation, but Dublin desperately needs a directly elected mayor.  It is a step I support and it is ironic that Cork, Waterford and Limerick will have directly elected mayors before Dublin.</p></speech>

As a former councillor and mayor of Fingal County Council, we have a tremendously weak system of local government, which is not the fault of local authority members; rather, it is because authority has not been delegated to local authority members.  As Deputy Lahart outlined, even when local authority members want something done, they are prevented from doing it by the unelected officials.  This must end.</p>  <p>  Without a lot more work and information in the public domain, holding a plebiscite in May in the cities and counties outlined in the provisions brought forward by the Minister of State will be difficult but not impossible.  Therefore, we must move quickly.  The matter of Dublin city and county must be managed very carefully.  While I really look forward to the debate in any form of citizens' assembly or convention, the underlying principle of my difficulty and that of the members of Fingal County Council when we rejected the previous ill-thought-out and weak proposal for a mayor of Dublin still stands.  My difficulty with what had been proposed for Dublin was related to the issue highlighted by Deputy Broughan.  We would have had a mayor who would have overruled local authority members-----</p></speech>

They do not have the authority they should have.  My difficulty lies in the fact that a celebrity candidate could be elected, a point mentioned by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  When someone runs for election as Dublin city mayor, it will be like the European elections or a presidential election.  That person will obviously use his or her platform to either stay in the job for years or catapult himself or herself into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and other offices.  I am not sure if this would be of benefit to the people of Dublin city.  However, I was not talking about Dublin only but about the concept of mayoralties.</p>  <p>  We need to identify what the roles would be.  The concept of retaining the post of chief executive, albeit under the title of director general, is wrong.  The mayor would be that person and I do not think we should create a ministerial function.  We should create a position of mayor, rather than duplicate what is done in other countries.  There are directors of services across local authorities.  They should be the ones who would provide for co-ordination between departments and the office of mayor.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister of State pointed out, the right thing to do would be to form a cabinet, including various functional departments within each local authority, that would be headed by a councillor elected by the council, as is the case in the strategic policy committees.  The roles and functions should be transparent and authoritative.  It should be absolute that decisions would be made and that people would be responsible directly to the mayor.  Councillors should have a budgetary function in order that they could hold the mayor to account because otherwise one would only have a say every five years, by which time the city or county could be in a mess.  It is imperative that there be that interface between councillors.  </p>  <p>  The question of pay for local authority members and mayors is important.  I would hate to create a mayor of Cork city or county or Limerick city or county who would be paid less than the role deserved, which would be at chief executive or county manager level.  </p>  <p>  On the interface with other service providers, Deputy Wallace was incredibly cynical and did not make one positive contribution to this discussion, apart from referencing the federal system in the United States.  Of course, when Irish people think about the position of mayor, they think about that system.  Unfortunately, we do not have a federal system, but having control over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or at least having clout with Irish Water is incredibly important.  Chairing the joint policing committee would not be good enough as the mayor would have to have some interface with policing, even if it was a little beyond what we already do as public representatives.  </p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about being a mayor in County Louth in the future if he was ever "retired" - his word, not mine - from this House.  If he was able to call to see the chief superintendent in the Louth division on foot of the seizure of drugs worth &euro;950,000, as happened yesterday, nobody in County Louth would mind one bit.  They would be happy that the mayor of one of the major towns in the county was taking direct control of and interest in the matter.  It does not have to undermine the role of the Commissioner, but there should be some thoughtful way to create an interface.</p></speech>

It is imperative that there be transparency and authority.  </p><p>In the context of a debate that might happen in the future at the convention, I do not agree with the concept that there should be a single mayor of Dublin because it would undermine the local authority system, into which we have put so much time and effort in the past 25 years in order to nurture it.</p></speech>

When those Bills were taken on Second Stage, the House agreed to defer a vote on them, pending further discussion and consultation with the Minister and the Government.</p><p>That was a wise move.  I would suggest that the citizens of Dublin will need to know the details of just how such a directly elected mayor would operate before voting on the principle of having such an office.  It would be important to examine the role and functions of such a directly elected mayor in the Dublin area, which is the area on which I will be concentrating in my contribution.  I am very supportive of the principle of directly elected mayors.  The issue of having such a mayor for Dublin is being referred to a citizens' assembly.  I am disappointed that more work has not been done on the situation in Dublin and that more consultation is needed through the citizens' assembly.</p> <p> As the Minister of State said in his speech, we need to examine the functions of such a mayor, the relationship the office will have with elected members and the executive, and the geographical area to be covered.  Functions which will certainly be covered include housing, planning, transport and, perhaps, some justice issues such as those covered by the joint policing committees of the local authorities.</p> <p> If central government and Departments are going to cede power to local government, it will present challenges for the Minister of State.  He knows that.  Civil servants do not like ceding power and any Bill he proposes could be scuppered by the permanent government.  I am sure the Minister of State is quite aware of that as he is a very experienced Deputy and Minister of State at this stage.</p> <p> There is no doubt that the existing post of Lord Mayor of Dublin is largely ceremonial but the huge amount of goodwill citizens have for the office cannot be underestimated.  That is something which can be built on.  It is certainly something which I have experienced in my own right.  That said, the system of local government in Dublin city is not working at the moment.  I was elected to Dublin City Council in 2014 and it was my experience that the assembly was too big at 63 members, that it is very fragmented politically, that it has very limited powers and that, as a result, it is impossible to get anything done.  Meanwhile the problems in respect of housing, transport and planning which I mentioned earlier continue to get worse.  I appeal to the electorate to take the local authority elections very seriously and to elect people who are going to make decisions rather than people who just wish to protest.</p></speech>

In bringing forward the office of a directly elected mayor, it is very important that there is no duplication and no waste because the public will not tolerate it.  The experience of the establishment of the HSE and Irish Water has left a very sour taste in the mouths of citizens and, indeed, of all of us.  Citizens will need to be assured that the office is necessary and that scarce resources are not being squandered.  The message is clear: no waste, no duplication, no unnecessary bureaucracy, and no exorbitant salaries.</p>  <p>  I will finish up on this point.  If somebody wants to invest in Dublin or has a major proposal for Dublin, who does he or she ring?  That is very unclear at this point in time.  A directly elected mayor would give leadership, bring forward accountability, as Deputy Lahart has outlined, and give the city a profile, which is very important.  We have had the examples of other directly elected mayors throughout Europe and the world outlined to us in this debate.  Those are the key issues.  I want the Minister of State to continue with his consultations.  I am disappointed that the question of a mayor for Dublin has not been advanced further at this stage, but we will also give input into the debate and we look forward to receiving the Minister of State's renewed proposals in due course.</p></speech>

I was not aware that we were finished.  I thank the Deputies who contributed.  To reiterate, it is the intention of Government to devolve as much power as possible from the hands of the executive to the hands of elected people.  I take on board what most of the speakers have said, which is that it might be better to focus on a few strategic areas first rather than going for the big bang approach.  There is some merit in that proposal.  It is my absolute ambition that, if the plebiscites pass and the roles work in the relevant local authorities, the head of each local authority in the country will be directly elected by the people.</p>  <p>  Deputy Farrell suggested earlier that Deputy O'Dowd be mayor of Drogheda.  These offices should be positions to which Oireachtas Members or Ministers would aspire because they would be powerful roles.  In many respects the happiest days I have had in my 20 years in politics were the four and a half years I spent as a member of Kilkenny County Council dealing with matters such as Deputy Lahart's roundabout.  These matters are crucially important.  The Deputy is right.  An issue like that might seem small, mundane and almost trivial but it can be the biggest issue affecting the people concerned when they come into contact with their local representative.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cassells was the first speaker.

I hope I was clear enough in my speech at the start.  The Deputy said that we would be codding people if we did not give directly elected mayors real powers.  He is right; we would be.  I do not want to cod people.  I want the directly elected mayors to have powers.  We are going to have a difference of opinion, however, on the question of planning applications and planning decisions.  If the point that the Deputy is making relates to strategic planning for the future and to that role, I believe it is right that the directly elected mayor should have a function in that area.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also said that directly elected mayors should be signing off on planning applications and he curtly referred to what had happened in the years after the State was founded.  He referred to the clientelism and corruption in the early years of the State and said that we had matured and gone past it.  Sadly, the planning tribunal reports were not that long ago.  I hope, when enough time has elapsed, there will be a time when we are past it.  I will not, however, be supporting or proposing a situation where directly elected mayors are signing off on individual planning applications.  As Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan said, perhaps we could arrive there in the future as the roles flesh out, but I believe it would be wrong to start there.</p></speech>

There is no point in divesting the chief executive role without doing something similar with the director of services role.  That is absolutely right.  I am not going to get involved in the specific case in Dublin but the Deputy went on further to give out that Dublin was not included.  The reason for Dublin&rsquo;s non-inclusion is that it is different from the rest of the country.</p><p>It is complicated by the fact that there are four local authorities.  Where do we fit the directly elected mayor's piece into the rest?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said it was a good idea.  He questioned how it would interact with the existing structure.  I give a commitment to him and to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who spoke later, that once the Government has considered the memo, we will come back.</p> <p> I completely refute the argument that somehow this will be a platform for personalities or sports people to be elected.  The public will have the power to elect whoever it wants.  If it is a sports person, a personality, a regular Joe, a business person or whoever, we cannot second guess that.  Deputy O'Sullivan went into detail and said that the mayor should be somebody from Limerick city.  The directly elected mayor will be a person elected by the people of Limerick city and county. That might be somebody from Abbeyfeale.  In the context of population distribution, one might think it unlikely to be a person from Abbeyfeale, but I would not prescribe that it would have to be somebody from the city who is elected to hold the position.</p> <p> Deputy Wallace is correct on the issue of groupthink and it is never any harm for someone to say something different.  People may sometimes accuse Deputy Wallace of saying something different just for the sake of saying something different.  I would never do such a thing.  The Deputy is also right about local government reform.  The move to take some of the control in local government and give it to those who have been directly elected is a substantial local government reform.  Deputy Wallace quoted Tony Blair, of whom he is not a fan, and it was interesting that he thinks that local government works in the United States of America and in Britain.  It does not work.  The Deputy also referred to the Hartlepool United football mascot H'Angus the monkey.  I must inform the House that H'Angus was not a directly elected mayor with executive powers.  The mascot was directly elected but did not have the executive powers.</p> <p> Deputy Eamon Ryan welcomed the plebiscites but expressed reservations about Dublin's exclusion.  The Deputy was absolutely right when he referred to the opportunity that exists in our regional cities to develop those city centres again, especially in the case of brownfield sites that exist in many of those city centres.  In my own city of Kilkenny the brewery site is to be redeveloped.  There are cities in those regions that have dockland sites.  The north quays in Waterford form one such very prominent site with a huge city centre location that can bring businesses in and people back to live in our city centres.  I have never once questioned that Waterford is the capital of the south east and it will help the rest of the region.  It has always struck me that the south east lags behind the rest of the State economically despite having some obvious advantages.  Part of the reason is the lack of coherence when viewing it as a region in comparison with the west.</p> <p> Deputy Ryan spoke in favour of the new procurement framework-style bidding system for the funding of projects at local level into the future, and he emphasised the focus on certain areas such as transport, planning, enterprise, policing and education.  One of my predecessors, the European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, gets a lot of criticism about his time as Minister, but he brought the enterprise issue directly into the remit of local government through the local enterprise offices.  That was a positive measure and has worked very well.  Is my time up?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for the time she took last week to meet and update me on the progress of the implementation of the current drug and alcohol strategy.  During that meeting we discussed a number of issues.  One issue I highlighted was my concern at the level of funding the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces receive.  That funding relates to regional and local drug and alcohol task forces.  I believe that the Minister of State is sympathetic and that she understands the problem.  The problem is that we have to convince the Minister of State's colleagues and members of Government that this issue needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  It is worth putting onto the record of the House that the proposed funding for 2019 is exactly the same level of funding that was made available in 2018.  The 2018 finding was the same as the 2017 budget, as it was for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  For all of those years the budget allocation has been the same.  In 2014, there was a reduction on the previous year of 2013.  I understand and acknowledge that we have had a recession but we have come to a point in recovery.  Drug and alcohol task forces are primarily funded by the HSE and the Department of Health.  Funding going into the parent Department is increasing significantly year on year, but these projects are being left behind.  The projects are struggling to survive and maintain the existing level of service, to pay the salaries of those people employed, and to meet new and emerging challenges.  They are under huge pressure.</p>  <p>  I have asked these questions in the past and I am aware that in her reply the Minister of State will say that additional one-off funding has been made available to improve the organisational effectiveness of the task forces, and that towards the end of the year there was additional funding.  I put it to the Minister of State that if this additional one-off funding had been built into the base as core funding, we would have seen growth year on year.  I have very real concerns about the effectiveness of one-off funding.  It is a challenge for task forces to engage and introduce new programmes to spend that money.  In real terms, when the funding runs out, the problem remains to be dealt with.  Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that the work done by the people involved in drug and alcohol task forces and the programmes that they support in our communities is a continual demand.  It is regrettable but it is the reality.  We will be facing addiction treatment and minimising its impact for a long time to come.  If these programmes and projects are to be supported, they need to be supported financially.</p>  <p>  I can see no reason at all, when the health budget has been increasing year on year, why the base core funding going to task forces has remained the same since 2014.  I find this incredible.  Apart from the physical strain it puts on the providers of these programme projects, the lack of support also undervalues them.  People feel that they are being ignored, the work they do is not being recognised, and they do not get the same recognition as other groups.  I do not know of any other group or programme, be it for capitation fees in schools or the recipients of grants given out by the Minister, Deputy Ring, to RAPID areas, that has been left static for that period of time.</p>  <p>  I do not blame the Minister of State for this whatsoever.  I genuinely believe that she realises the work being done by the task forces, but between us, and I include the other Members of the House in that, we need to convince the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance that the funding made available in budget 2019 is inadequate.  Rather than coming at the end of the year with a Supplementary Estimate, that budget needs to be amended at the start of the year so the money can be spent wisely in a managed and effective way to achieve the programmes set out.</p></speech>

I know he is very passionate about it, as am I.  I will go through my speaking notes first and then I will address some of the issues raised by Deputy Curran in his contribution.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.  Providing additional resources to enhance service provision is a key objective of the strategy.  I welcome the additional funding provided for integrated treatment services for people in addiction and mental health issues in the HSE 2019 national service plan.  The service plan also commits to improving healthcare services for people who are homeless.  The service plan will also deliver more integrated and effective models of care for people with complex healthcare needs and who are experiencing severe health inequalities.</p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of substance misuse in their areas, and in supporting community responses, as part of a co-ordinated approach involving all sectors at local and regional levels.</p></speech>
