To achieve this target, the Government provided IDA Ireland with the resources to establish offices and hire staff in emerging markets, including Brazil, India, Russia and China, the BRIC countries.  In total, 17 people support the overseas marketing of Ireland for foreign direct investment in the growth markets area, with 11 staff working in the BRIC markets.  In China IDA Ireland&rsquo;s first office in Shanghai has been supplemented with new offices in Shenzhen and Beijing in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  An ICT specialist has been appointed in Shenzhen and a financial services specialist in Beijing.  The intensity of engagement between Ireland and China in recent years is evidenced by the number of memorandums of understanding, MOUs, signed in respect of areas of mutual interest.  In India IDA Ireland established its first office in Mumbai and it has been complemented by a second office in Bangalore.  An experienced IDA Ireland executive has been appointed to lead the team in India.  Representative offices have been established in Brazil and Russia and are staffed by highly experienced local individuals.  The overseas marketing staff are supported by a dedicated high level team in Dublin which works to attract investments specifically from these markets.  This team includes two members of IDA Ireland's executive committee and one member of the management team.</p><p>  The Government has supported this work by stepping up the number of trade missions to emerging markets.  IDA Ireland also proposes that regular intensive marketing trips be made to the region by the global heads of its main operating divisions, including ICT, financial services, life sciences and content, consumer and business services.  IDA Ireland also works in close co-operation with other Departments and State agencies, namely, the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Finance, Enterprise Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency in these particular locations.  I am glad to report that to date this strategy has resulted in 17 projects from the BRIC countries.  Results indicate that IDA Ireland will achieve or exceed the target of 20% of all greenfield investments this year.</p></reply>

Given that the 21 in the USA are doing super work, imagine what could be done if an additional five staff were deployed in China.  The key to doing business lies not in regular intensive visits but in maintaining a constant presence and building relationships.  In the Asian markets, in particular, confidence is built on trust.  As a result, there is a need to foster relationships and connections on a continual basis.  In the context of the traditional markets, particularly pharmaceuticals, the figures for 2013 show that our exports were under considerable pressure.  If we are to be where the action is happening in the next ten to 15 years, we must put in place the foundations now to allow us to establish the links necessary to do in the BRIC countries the work done in the USA in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s in building relationships.  Is IDA Ireland still subject to the recruitment embargo or does it have the capacity to employ new staff?  What level of co-operation will there be in emerging markets between it and the new consulates which were announced earlier in the week and which we welcome?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, a target was set for 2014 and resources have been allocated in such a way as to ensure it will be met.  The strategy is under review and we will be looking afresh at growth markets.  Clearly, there is a need to balance resources against outcomes and look to the long term.  On a man for man basis, the emerging markets would not deliver the same return as the United States.  IDA Ireland still attracts the bulk of its investments from North America.  However, as the Deputy observes, we must anticipate where the growth markets are.  That has been the approach.</p><p>  The Department is bound by the employment control framework.  During my term as Minister we have protected IDA Ireland staff within it.  In other words, all other areas of the Department have taken the hit in order to protect IDA Ireland.  We are looking to the future in the context of developing a new strategy.  The Deputy is correct in stating there will be a need to increase the resources allocated for the markets to which he refers.  We will try to identify creative ways in which this might be achieved.</p></speech>

I presume there are plans in place to recruit a new CEO to replace him.  In setting targets for the new CEO will the Minister insist on the BRIC countries being placed at the front and centre in the context of his or her plans for the organisation in the coming years?</p></speech>

He leaves behind a fantastic legacy of achievement and an organisation that is both professional and extremely strong.  I recently appointed a new chairman of IDA Ireland and the process to recruit a replacement for Mr. O'Leary is getting under way.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy in that 90% of growth in trade will occur outside the European Union.  That is the new reality.  Much of this growth will occur in emerging markets.  It is clear that we must build on the target for 2014 which I am sure IDA Ireland will be successful in delivering on.  There is only one way in which the target can go, that is, upwards.  Obviously, however, we must also ensure we match our resources with the opportunities that arise, both in the short and long term.  That is the balance which must always be struck.</p></speech>

The system that developed during the past 80 years has become unwieldy and complex and is no longer fit for purpose.  There was universal acceptance of the need for a root and branch reform of the existing structures.  The Minister's objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period.  A new two-tier workplace relations structure, comprising two statutorily independent bodies to replace the current five, will be established.  There will be a new single body of first instance - to be called the workplace relations commission - and a separate appeals body which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.</p><p>  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes.  The draft scheme of the workplace relations Bill has been approved by the Government for priority drafting.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting is under way.  The Minister's intention is to publish the Bill as early as possible during the spring-summer D&aacute;il session, with a view to the new structures being put in place during this year.  The legislation will provide for the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to come together within the remit of the workplace relations commission.  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.</p><p>  Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, in so far as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required are concerned to underpin the workplace relations reform programme, including the following measures which have already been put in place: the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department, to be part of the workplace relations commission; a single contact portal; an e-complaint facility; a staffing and structures plan; a new workplace relations website; an early resolution service; adjudicator training and recruitment plans; and enhanced technologies and processes, including the publication of a request for tender for a customer relationship management solution.</p></reply>

This legislation is a long time coming.  In March 2012 a consultation document was issued by the Department and a commitment given that the Bill would be published in the third quarter of that year.  We are still waiting.  The Minister of State has indicated that the drafting of the Bill has been given priority and that it will be brought forward before the summer recess.  I hope that is the case.  The proposed Bill has been included in every legislative programme since the end of 2012 and it is critical that it be progressed without further delay.  Economic recovery cannot be premised on the erosion of workers' rights.  We have seen many cases in recent years, during the Government's term of office, where workers have had to fight for their entitlements.  We see it again this week in the case of Ivan's in Limerick where workers have found themselves obliged to engage in a sit-in in order to secure their rights.  I hope the Minister of State will adhere to the timetable he has indicated to have the Bill published before the summer recess.  We must provide a legislative basis to ensure workers receive their full entitlements.</p></speech>

Reforming a complex system takes time, but we are committed to that reform and the associated legislative process.  From a public service delivery point of view, we must consider the situation as it stands.  Prior to 2012, there were more than 100 possible first instance complaints involving 30 complaint forms which could be lodged with five separate bodies.  The process of bringing everything together under a workplace relations commission is complex.  Practitioners in this area have acknowledged that complexity.  We must ensure the legislative approach we adopt is robust and will stand up to scrutiny.  It is a case of kicking the tyres, so to speak, before we proceed.  The workplace relations Bill will give statutory effect to the reforms we are bringing forward, but the enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary Acts, 12 specified Parts or sections of Acts and 71 statutory instruments.  We are committed to implementing these reforms.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that we have been assured in every session since the third quarter of 2012 that the Bill would be published in that session.  Every time that does not happen it damages the Minister of State's credibility in this matter.  If this legislation really is a priority for the Government, it should get on with drafting and publishing the proposals that are necessary to protect workers.</p></speech>

Sixty-five were laid off last week, with the remainder to go in the coming weeks and months.  I am asking on their behalf whether the Government intends to do anything to seek to save and maintain this highly skilled workforce and the skills base they represent in an industry the Government has designated a priority.  In addition, will the Minister address the question of the pension deficit left behind, in a context where, as the workers understand it, &euro;40 million of IDA Ireland money was given to the company?  What has become of that money and can some of it be retrieved to fill the pension gap or maintain the plant and the jobs it provides, thereby facilitating Ireland's involvement in this industry?</p></reply>

In fact, I met senior company executives several times, including just before the announcement.  The position is that the company has had to undertake a global review of its operations in the light of shrinking revenues and declining market opportunities.  This decision was taken by the parent company on strictly commercial grounds in the face of a declining business that had also caused the closure of some of its plants in Germany. </p><p>  The plant to which the Deputy refers carried out skilled maintenance on the engine casings of jet engines, which requires a particularly skilled and high value level of expertise.  This work is crucial for the ongoing safety and efficiency of aircraft engines.  Lufthansa has several plants worldwide engaged in this aspect of engine maintenance.  However, owing to changes in the industry worldwide, including modern engines requiring less maintenance, over-capacity in the industry, increased competition from Asia and contractual obligations imposed by both aircraft and engine manufacturers, the company is facing over-capacity which necessitates the closure of several of its operations worldwide, including the plant at Rathcoole. </p><p>  The Government is committed to the retention and expansion of skilled manufacturing jobs in the economy.  Our new manufacturing strategy document which I launched last year sets out an ambitious target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in the sector by 2016.  Key recommendations of the strategy have been incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs and are being pursued by my Department and the enterprise development agencies.  While employment in the overall sector has increased by almost 8,000 jobs in the past year alone, parts of the aircraft maintenance sub-sector are under severe pressure owing to the changing dynamics of that industry.  Nevertheless, we have several vibrant companies involved in various aspects of aircraft maintenance, employing some 4,000 staff.  The strategy for the new Shannon Airport operation envisages the development of a vibrant aerospace sector at that airport.  Part of that strategy has identified maintenance, repair and overhaul activities as a potential sector for development.  Lufthansa's two other maintenance operations at Shannon employ a total of 770 staff.</p><p>  IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, has been actively seeking to pursue new employment opportunities for workers being made redundant by Lufthansa in Rathcoole.  The agencies have been targeting and engaging with existing and prospective clients, highlighting the skills and capabilities of the Irish-based employees as a key attractor.  The agencies have had ongoing engagement with the relevant education and training bodies to evaluate potential training and upskilling supports for Lufthansa employees.</p><p>  The question of settling the level of redundancy payments to the former employees was considered in the Labour Court recently.  Payment of the recommended terms is now a matter for the company.</p></reply>

The idea that we have a contracting market opportunity is nonsense.  The reality is that the aircraft industry is booming.  The Government's commitment to seek investment and expand employment in this area is proof of that.  The Government is taking that approach because it knows it is an industry that is expanding.  Therefore, we should not take too seriously what Lufthansa is stating.  This is a strategic closure in its own interest by a company which, at a large meeting in Hamburg on 10 December, spoke about the ambitious growth plans to be implemented in the coming months and referred to its dominant position in the market and so on.  That is the reality.</p><p>I am glad to hear of the Minister's commitment to protect skilled jobs in this industry.  In that context, it makes absolutely no sense to allow these jobs and this skills base to be lost and for the plant to be stripped down, as it will be, if we do not intervene in some way.  The workers particularly want to know about the &euro;40 million that was put in.  They understood that &euro;40 million was conditional on the plant being maintained.  The State is a shareholder in Aer Lingus.  The workers also tell me that a load of CFM engines will come on the market soon for maintenance and overhaul and that this work could be done in Rathcoole if we were to maintain the plant and these jobs.</p></speech>

If a grant is provided and the company does not fulfil the conditions, the grant is repaid.  The obligation to repay grants ceases when a company that spends many years in Ireland fulfils its programme of activity.  That has always been the approach.</p><p>  In any sector there are parts going down and rising.  For example, some pharmaceutical plants have got into difficulty because their product sub-sector is in decline, but other areas are growing.  It is not dissimilar in the aircraft sector: there are areas in difficulty and this is one of them.  The evidence is strong and it is backed by our advisers in IDA Ireland that this sub-sector is in difficulty globally.  Other areas, as the Deputy rightly says, are growing.  In every sector our challenge is to make sure we can move our resources into the areas that are growing.  It is not possible to keep every plant open if part of its business is no longer viable.  That is the reality with which we must work in all companies.</p></speech>

They tell me there could be a glut of the engines in which they specialise in the market soon and that work could be done in Rathcoole but not if the plant is stripped down.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the workers and hear their side of the story to see if there is anything that can be done.  The Government is a stakeholder in the aircraft industry and these were Aer Lingus workers.  It seems that where there is a general commitment from the Government to this industry and maintain the skilled jobs in it, we must do everything we can to see if these skilled jobs can be maintained.</p><p>  What can we do to fill the pension deficit about which the workers are very concerned, given that a large sum of public money was given to Lufthansa?  Can we put pressure on it to fill that gap?  Can the State intervene in some way?  I urge the Minister to meet the workers to discuss what can be done.</p></speech>

We seek and have sought to work with Lufthansa to put transformation programmes in place to support it.  That has been a constant feature in recent years.  I have met Lufthansa to make sure this offer is always on the table.  Decisions of this nature are made ultimately by the company, not by me or IDA Ireland.  The Labour Court recently considered the issue of redundancy payments and the conditions of former employees and payment of the recommended terms is now a matter for the company.</p></speech>

Between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland recorded a 22.5% loss of competitiveness, fuelled by an unsustainable consumption and property boom.  Since 2008 it has regained some of the cost competitiveness it had lost.  Much of the improvement in Ireland's cost competitiveness since 2008 is accounted for by the favourable exchange rate movements.  However, there have been falls in relative prices in a number of areas.  Labour is the most significant cost for most businesses and the latest EUROSTAT figures show that the labour cost index in Ireland fell by 1.6% in quarter 3 of 2013, compared with quarter 3 2012.  In the two year period 2011-12 there was a very significant improvement of almost 20% in our unit wage costs relative to the rest of Europe.</p><p>  Construction and rental costs for both office and industrial space have fallen dramatically for new businesses since the collapse of the property bubble.  Rental costs for office space, for example, declined by 45% between 2007 and 2011.  Similarly, the Forf&aacute;s report shows that the cost of the majority of business and professional services in Ireland has fallen since 2006.  The cost of legal services is a notable exception, but the Government is continuing to press for reform in this area through the Legal Services Bill. </p><p>  My Department has identified measures to simplify the administrative burden on businesses to the potential value of over &euro;207 million per annum.  Programmes such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s LEAN Business offering and innovation supports are helping companies to address competitiveness issues and improve productivity.  Through the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and 2013, the Government has focused on creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland.  The action plans have included a range of concrete measures to address issues which impact on our competitiveness position.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s exit from the troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is finalising the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government which will build on the progress made in recent years and will include further measures aimed at reducing costs for business.</p></reply>

Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien and I were spokespersons on justice in December 2011 when the Legal Services Bill was first brought into the House and it is still meandering its way through the Houses.  The T&aacute;naiste said yesterday that it would be finished &ldquo;when we are ready,&rdquo; that is, when the Government is ready to finish it.  It is a serious cost issue for small businesses, as the Minister of State said.  We have welcomed the potential of the new Companies Bill in this area.  When will we see the impact of that Bill or the Bill itself?</p><p>  Our energy costs are still out of sync with those of our international competitors.  A survey of businesses in Waterford shows a potential increase of 60% in rates after the Government&rsquo;s revaluation of rates which is under way, for which they get nothing in return.  Health insurance costs have increased by 10% in the past 12 months, much of it driven by tax changes.  Small changes are happening quietly, but when they combine, it is too late and they are costing jobs.  The rates increases are costing jobs.  For what people will have to pay in rates they might have to pay somebody to come to work in their premises in Waterford.  They cannot do this now that they have to pay increased rates.</p></speech>

Rates have not increased in all local authorities, even though their budgets are being agreed.  Across the country rates have remained the same.  One of the key features of local government reform is that there will be derogations.</p><p>It will be important for local enterprise offices that there will be critical involvement of local government in the establishment of the development of towns and villages.  They will have discretion to encourage development where there is vacant property.</p><p> Most important, I am conscious of the pressure on business.  Fully 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced the annual rate on valuation, ARV, or kept it at the same level as 2012, with an average decrease in the ARV from 2012 to 2013 of 0.34%.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to the Local Government Reform Bill.  As the Minister of State is aware, many rates will increase in the coming years as town and borough councils merge with county councils, where rates are higher.  The rates problem is with the revaluation process that is under way.  The valuations are being changed.  There is a limited appeals process.  There is no sharing of information.  I accept this is outside the Minister of State's jurisdiction but perhaps he will offer his thoughts on the Legal Services Regulation Bill from the point of view of his Department.</p></speech>

That was when the rates were decided based on the value of properties.  The rates will not change but perhaps property valuations may change.  However, they will not change dramatically in towns and villages.  There may be a different value on property in large urban centres.  That is taking place throughout the country.</p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill is very much a priority for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.</p></speech>

There are many new legal offices which have opened up and which are competitive.  In recent times many start-up solicitor firms have emerged and people have started their own businesses.  I spoke to a gentleman during the week in Ballina who has set up a small practice there very effectively.  He has been given effective rates.  There is a good deal more competition coming into the market.  People have seen the pressure in offices and they are now establishing sole practices, which, in one sense, is bringing competition to the market, and that is welcome too.</p></speech>

The latest live figures show that there are now almost 24,000 people unemployed in the city and county out of 52,000 unemployed in the entire south-east region.  Since 2008 some 2,441 IDA Ireland jobs have been lost in Waterford and only 581 jobs have been created.  Last year more than 1,100 IDA jobs were created in Cork, 700 were created in Galway, almost 300 were created in Limerick and more than 500 jobs were created in Dundalk.  Will the Minister explain why Waterford is always lagging behind the other major urban centres when it comes to foreign direct investment?</p></reply>

There are currently 28 IDA client companies employing more than 5,000 people in Waterford city and county.  The number of net IDA jobs in Waterford increased in 2013, the first increase in six years.</p><p>  During 2013 there were two significant IDA investment announcements for Waterford.  In February, Sanofi announced plans to invest &euro;44 million in Genzyme's biotechnology campus in Waterford.  As the Deputy is aware, that will gear the company up for a new and diverse range of products.  In March, Nypro Healthcare announced plans to establish an additional state-of-the-art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 high-quality jobs in the coming years.</p><p>  As the Deputy knows, following the closure of TalkTalk in Waterford, I have put a particular focus on the south east.  I published a south east employment action plan and established a forum of all state agencies and local players to set out actions to increase employment in the area.  I have met regularly with IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the forum to review progress.</p><p>  IDA has announced plans to build new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford to enhance the offering in the area and win new business.  To support its marketing efforts for the region, IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focusing on the south east region and Waterford.  The number of site visits by prospective IDA clients to the south east and Waterford has increased substantially.</p><p>  The employment strategy for Waterford and the south east has not only focused on foreign investors.  Companies such as Eishtec, Dawn Meats, FeedHenry and Danone have been supported by my Department in creating almost 900 jobs.</p><p>  IDA has ambitious targets of 50% of investments in regions outside Dublin and Cork, but this has proven to be a difficult target to meet.  There are complex factors influencing investor location decision-making, such as the increasing preference for big cities with large-scale populations and significant challenges from lower cost locations.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>  I have called on IDA and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department in order that we can explore what further initiatives to take to ensure a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our foreign direct investment strategy, which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland's strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU state aid rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA's strategy from 2015 onwards.</p></speech>

It aims to have 50% of new jobs based in locations outside Dublin and Cork.  Will the Minister admit that this plan has since been quietly shelved?  Research at NUI Maynooth has found that many of the 82% of jobs created here by overseas firms in recent years have been centred around Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Surely the obvious way to achieve the targets of Horizon 2020 would be to improve the regional aid for foreign companies investing in areas of high unemployment.</p><p>  We invest vast sums of money in IDA Ireland, whose job description is to attract and create companies in the south east and to direct them there.  I am referring specifically to the IDA in the south east.  Many people in Waterford consider that the agency is not doing its job and I agree on the basis of the statistics I have given to the Minister, which are reasoned statistics that have come to light from Government sources in recent weeks.  They indicate that jobs are not being created in Waterford and that the IDA Horizon 2020 project is a failure when it comes to the south east.</p></speech>

It has not been possible to achieve that.  That is not because the company has not been seeking to deliver it.  The agency reports and makes efforts to promote the other regions.  Unfortunately, the nature of mobile foreign investment has changed.  We can see this in the type of wins the agency is getting.  The sector has shifted and unfortunately that shift has favoured large cities in particular, such as Dublin and Cork.</p><p>  The reason I put the spotlight on Waterford and the south east was in recognition of the difficulty.  The site visits of prospective IDA clients have almost trebled since I put that spotlight on.  Undoubtedly, there is a new emphasis by IDA on the south east and Waterford in particular.</p><p>  We do not have it open to us to set different regional aid packages for Waterford as against other areas.  Regional aid packages are set by EU strategy and we must comply with the rules.  I am reviewing the foreign direct investment strategy and I will be looking at how we seek to achieve it.  One of the things we have done which, I believe, is innovative, is the development of ConnectIreland, which uses the resources of regions and their international contacts to help lever new investment into those regions.</p></speech>

The Minister has a difficult situation and I recognise that it is remarkably difficult for him.  My criticism is directed primarily at IDA.  We are told by IDA that it cannot direct companies to locate in any particular region.  Surely the logical thing to do would be to examine why companies are not locating in places such as Waterford and then address that.  For example, it has been acknowledged repeatedly that university status for Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, is a key marker for the development of the city and region.  Yet we have still to see the Government keep its promise to fast-track this development.</p><p>  We pay the IDA substantial amounts of money and the staff get high salaries in particular regions for a job description that amounts to directing jobs into those regions.  If the Minister speaks to any Member, councillor or person from Waterford he will ascertain that we believe we are not getting our fair share and that the IDA is not doing its job.</p></speech>

This is borne out by the increase in site visits and additional activity.  The IDA is correct: the agency does not direct companies on where to invest.  The companies come with a well-known list of what they need.  Typically, they use advisors to identify where they can get the right fit.  The IDA does not move the pawns around the board, so to speak.  That is not the way international investment works.</p><p>Through the forum, we enhance the promotion of Waterford's assets more effectively.  The WIT is a major asset, which has spawned FeedHenry, for example, and has very good technology.  We need to leverage that sort of asset to attract additional investment, which is what we are seeking to do here.  It is not fair to criticise individuals or organisations.  This is a team effort and we have created a sense of teamwork within the south east.  That is the route to resolving these problems and not an alternative.</p></speech>

On the recent trade mission the Taoiseach congratulated Saudi Arabia on its election to the UN Human Rights Council, but did not challenge it on its human rights record.  We are not talking about something that happened 30 years ago, but something that is happening today.  Is it right to leave all principle outside the door when we participate on a trade mission?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300007#E00500"><p>The primary focus of the recent trade mission to the Gulf, as with all trade missions, is to encourage business-to-business links and encourage investment and employment opportunities.  I believe that if we want to be effective in addressing human rights issues with countries, we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon.</p><p>  Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and especially through the European Union and the United Nations.  We have never shied away from addressing these issues.  We will continue to be a strong advocate for higher global standards that improve human rights, and encourage the highest standards of business conduct and corporate social responsibility.</p><p>  In recent weeks there have been calls for the Government to raise human rights issues more forcefully on trade and investment missions.  This would represent precisely the kind of token gesture that Irish governments have avoided over the years &ndash; undermining the missions&rsquo; crucial objective of delivering trade and jobs for Ireland, while achieving nothing on human rights.  Trade missions are not the place to raise human rights issues effectively.</p><p>  The trade mission to the Gulf region which the Taoiseach and I led earlier this month, accompanied by 87 Irish companies, is part of a strategy targeting &euro;1 billion in further exports to the region by Irish companies in the medium term.  This would represent an increase of &euro;600 million.</p><p>  The trade mission to the Gulf states including Saudi Arabia saw Irish companies announce the initial outcome of their investment in market development, including the creation of 95 new jobs in Ireland, and new contracts and business developments worth more than &euro;65 million.  Further investment, trade and jobs can be expected. </p><p>  Throughout the trade mission, Irish companies from a wide range of sectors concluded deals, prospected with hundreds of potential buyers, developed relationships with key influencers and networked with local experts and buyers in what was the largest ever Irish trade mission to the Gulf.</p><p>  The success of our exporters abroad and the support they receive from agencies such as Enterprise Ireland are not traded off against human rights.  The Government continues to push for higher standards of human rights around the world.  Where these are undermined we seek to have the issues tackled and addressed by the most effective means possible. </p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>  In this regard, Ireland is an active member of the EU human rights group in Riyadh which co-ordinates EU policy on human rights issues within the kingdom and progresses implementation of the EU&rsquo;s human rights country strategy for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>  I believe the cause of human rights can be promoted through trade.  Included in EU free-trade agreements, for example, are provisions that promote human rights, labour standards and other issues about which we are rightly concerned.  These agreements make provision for committees involving civil society to monitor their operation.  This means that our interests in promoting greater opportunities for exporters can work in tandem with promoting higher standards of human and labour rights in the countries with which we trade and invest.</p></speech>

Authorities continued to violate the rights of 9 million Saudi women and girls and 9 million foreign workers.  As in past years, authorities subjected thousands of people to unfair trials and arbitrary detention.  In 2013, courts convicted seven human rights defenders and others for peaceful expression or assembly demanding political and human rights reforms.</blockquote>The Minister says we should use appropriate ways to raise human rights issues and should not make token gestures.  However, money talks louder than anything.  If we tell these people they should not do certain things but continue to do business with them, do we really think anything will change?  Would apartheid have been addressed without the boycott of South Africa?  This country supported the war in Afghanistan on the basis that the Taliban was engaged in human rights abuses, despite the fact that the Taliban was supported by the Saudi royal family.  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable for us to make our philosophy to suit our financial ambitions?</p></speech>

When we go on trade missions we bring companies that are seeking to create jobs here at home for Irish people.  That is a challenge.  We have 12.5% unemployment and the growth is shifting to new markets.  When we enter free-trade agreements with countries through the EU, each of those agreements seek to have changes in the way they conduct their businesses.  There is a long record that shows opening up to business drives changes and that is the approach we take.  When we are on a trade mission with representatives of almost 90 companies seeking to do business, it is not appropriate to use that as the occasion to lecture about changes that ought to happen in those countries; that is a time when we are trying to do business.  However, there are other fora where we can legitimately put those issues on the agenda, for example through the human rights forum and through the trade negotiations, which is what we do.  There is a proven track record that this is the way to achieve change in human rights as well as enhancing integration of peoples and opportunities across the globe.</p></speech>

How has Saudi Arabia changed how it does things in the past 20 years?  As far as I can see nothing is changing.  As long as it can do business with everybody it will be under no pressure to change anything.  We approved of the EU sanctions on Iran because we wanted to force it to the negotiating table.  Why does everybody turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia?  Is it because it has so much money?  It would be ridiculous for me to ask if money rules the world - of course it does.  There was a time when Ireland would have taken a more ethical stance on such matters.  I do not suggest we should not trade with people, but, by God, at least we should not be afraid to raise these issues even if it is on a trade mission.  I do not agree with the Minister's argument that we should leave it outside the door when on trade missions, as it would undermine our potential to increase jobs; that is not a good way forward.</p></speech>

When we became more open to trade and integration in Europe we dramatically changed human rights in Ireland.  The record is there.  We saw change come here as a result of much of the integration and trade that occurred between Ireland and the EU.  That is the objective.  We do not ignore Saudi Arabia, which will be a member of the UN Human Rights Council.  In October Ireland made two recommendations during Saudi Arabia's examination under the Council's universal periodic review mechanism.  Ireland is not inactive over human rights in countries with which we trade.  However, there are two separate tracks and we need to pursue the human rights through the appropriate mechanism.  Increasing trade and integration will, over time, drive those changes because if a free-trade agreement is negotiated, as has been done in some Gulf countries, it imposes conditions.  That is a sound and tested route to bring change as well as developing mutual opportunity.</p></speech>

Data are compiled on an annualised basis and aggregated at county level.  The information is provided by companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only.  It is, therefore, not possible to provide the information the Deputy seeks.  It should be noted, however, that there is free movement of labour within the EU and persons recruited from outside the EU must comply with employment permit legislation.</p><p>  Global companies continually examine their markets, supply chains and expansion opportunities, and seek to align them to best advantage.  Ireland sometimes loses from such changes such as when companies have excess capacity and sometimes Ireland gains.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s availability of skilled labour is one of the primary reasons cited by IDA Ireland&rsquo;s clients for establishing their operations in this country.  Each investment project has a set of unique and specific skills requirements.  While some of the skills required will be available from within Ireland, others such as language skills may involve relocation from overseas or a transfer from within existing companies.  The ability of Ireland&rsquo;s skills base to help to support the ongoing evolution of FDI companies in Ireland and allow them to bid for new corporate projects as they arise is critical to maintain and build their long-term employment impact in Ireland.  This is true both of the direct jobs created but also indirectly through the downstream jobs impact on Irish sub-suppliers and the economy in general.  Through considerable effort by Irish managers and workers, the improved business environment in Ireland and the strong work of IDA Ireland, we are enjoying record growth in foreign direct investment.  Our challenge is to ensure we are competitive, particularly in sectors we have targeted with significant growth potential, and work with existing companies to ensure they continually improve their capacity to be leaders in their sectors.</p></speech>

Foreign direct investment is critical to the recovery of the economy.  Apple Computers Limited is a significant employer in my constituency.  However, what I would like to focus on is not the role and value of IDA Ireland but the companies relocating here.  When we hear about companies that are to relocate here, we also hear about the broad number of jobs likely to be created.  However, we do not receive any follow up detail of how many of these jobs have been filled by way of internal transfers.  We are lacking this information.  The Minister mentioned languages as an area in which Ireland does not have the required skills set for some of the companies opting to relocate here.  There is a job of work to be done in that regard, particularly by organisations such as Solas.  In formulating policy in this area, if we do not have information on the number of jobs filled by way of internal transfer, how are we to grasp the skill sets we need to develop?</p></speech>

The high level group on skills forecasting works very closely with Irish and foreign owned companies in identifying skills required.  For example, we have, through the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, committed to doubling the output of ICT graduates because IT is a key sector.</p><p>  A US company relocating to Ireland that wishes to bring with it employees from the United States must apply for work permits for them in the normal way, as part of which process it is required to show the posts cannot be filled by people from within the European Union.  The work permits process provides us with information on the areas in which there are skills bottlenecks.  We have a very good window to where the skills needs are.  To be fair, the education system is seeking to respond by way of initiatives such as Springboard and Momentum, as well as the ICT initiative and the apprenticeship review launched earlier this week which provides an opportunity for businesses to identify areas where a new two-year apprenticeship could be developed.  We have a good window to the challenges encountered in this area.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that information is not available, but he has also said US companies relocating to Ireland must apply for work permits for employees they propose to bring with them from the United States.  Is it possible to get that information?  We know how many jobs are being created, but we do not know how many of them are being filled by way of internal transfers.  It is important we have that information.  Can work be done with the companies concerned to get that information?</p></speech>

We should not pretend that it is unacceptable for a company relocating to Ireland to bring with it employees from its head office as part of that relocation.  While such companies may start with a core, they quickly become Irish-led.  One of the reasons they come is the talent available here.  That is key.</p><p>  We do have data for work permits.  The number of work permits issued has fallen dramatically, from 23,000 at its peak to 3,000 last year.  Huge numbers of employees from non-EU countries are not coming here and those who are brought in have particular skill sets.  Almost 1,700 of the 3,000 jobs for which work permits were granted last year were in the IT sector.  It is possible for us to identify the positions companies are filling by way of internal transfers or recruitment from outside the European Union in order to meet their needs.  These are the skills on which we need to focus.  Our target is to become more self-reliant in these areas.</p></speech>

I presume the Minister will be hosting some type of singing and dancing event to officially launch what has been already leaked.  Perhaps the Taoiseach who is on his annual jaunt to Davos will come up with some gem while there.  Does the Minister intend to implement the forum's report which contains some interesting and challenging recommendations around the taxation treatment of entrepreneurs, in particular.  Has he had an opportunity to consider that matter and engaged with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, on how tax entrepreneurs are taxed here and how that model could be changed.  I accept that it is too soon to be talking about budgets, but does the Minister have a timeline for implementation of the report?</p></reply>

It is a good document which contains inputs, ideas and recommendations which will make a valuable contribution to the development of the Government's national entrepreneurship policy statement which the Minister will shortly bring to the Government for consideration and approval.  Many of the forum's recommendations fall within the responsibility of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and will be immediately assessed.  Some of the 69 recommendations contained in the report are good.  Others fall within the remit of other Departments.  The Minister is consulting the Ministers concerned.</p><p>  A feasibility and operational assessment is required to facilitate informed decision-making on the recommendations and their suitability for inclusion in the forthcoming national entrepreneurship policy statement.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is about entrepreneurship, in respect of which new local enterprise offices, LEO, are being established.  Many of the recommendations, including those in relation to mentoring pools of talent, encouragement of developments in third level colleges and collaboration, are well suited to the roll-out of the local enterprise offices in each county.  Many of these recommendations will not impact financially on the State and will be assessed by the Minister.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Sean O'Sullivan and the forum for their outstanding report.  Many of its recommendations which have been arrived at from a thinking outside the box perspective apply across government and will be closely monitored and assessed.  Those that can be implemented will be implemented quickly.</p></reply>

Some of the recommendations leaked include that the sharing of maternity leave between partners be allowed, an issue on which Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a Bill last year which was voted down by the Government; the tightening of rules around banks using personal guarantees in lending, which I am sure everybody would welcome, given what has happened during the past few years; and that Ireland become a European trade hub for China.  A number of projects in this regard have been floating around for a number of years.  This is the type of agenda that could be driven forward relatively quickly.  Relevant to this is whether the Department has the necessary resources in China.  Is there a timeline for delivery of the recommendations contained in the report?  It would be a shame if the recommendations made by someone with the expertise of Mr. O'Sullivan and his team on mentoring, an issue on which Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins has done a great deal of work, and the involvement of unemployed persons entrepreneurship were not implemented.</p><p>Will there be a timeline for delivery?

The new action plan to be announced shortly will incorporate several very effective ideas.  As the report of the entrepreneurship forum highlights, the development of entrepreneurs in Ireland is not confined to the State's support system.  Many ideas emerge outside of the State's management structures.  Everybody has a role to play in nurturing, connecting, inspiring, celebrating and expanding our entrepreneurship policy and in developing solutions to the challenges of creating a truly entrepreneurial Ireland.  Collaboration is necessary among all stakeholders in the public sector, industry and representative bodies.</p><p>  The action plan is driven by the entrepreneurship budget, which the Minister introduced to encourage enterprise.  The new revolution in business and the backbone of this economy are small companies.  Yesterday I visited the National College of Art and Design, where I met a number of bright young people with great new ideas.  They were entrepreneurial in every sense.  The real action by this Government is to encourage enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and all the State bodies under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are focused on supporting high potential start-up companies.</p></speech>

The funding for county enterprise boards in 2013 was &euro;18 million, while IDA client companies received &euro;89 million.  That &euro;89 million is well spent but the figure will have to be considerably higher if we want to see more companies of the type that the Minister of State encountered yesterday.  I followed his Twitter feed as he described several very innovative companies.  They will be starved of resources, however.  The local enterprise offices are the most anticipated development since I do not know when but, while I know the Minister of State is personally committed to ensuring they will deliver, when we revisit the issue this time next year I hope that some of the recommendations from the entrepreneurship forum that do not require legislative change will have been implemented without delay as a statement of intent on the part of the Government that it is taking the report and, more important, the people who compiled it seriously.  It could, for example, accept our proposal on shared paternity leave.</p></speech>

The new Action Plan for Jobs already incorporates some of these recommendations and we are getting there year by year.  I thank Sean O'Sullivan for his work on coming up with good ideas that do not cost large sums of money and attract the involvement of business people.  For example, successful business people could mentor those who are starting up companies.  By this means people can give something back to the State.  I am very impressed by the 69 recommendations in the report.  All of them will be assessed and immediate action will be taken in respect of some of them.</p></speech>

The aim of the action plan is to create a supportive operating environment for businesses in order to allow employment to grow across all sectors, and for people of all abilities.  The plan is working. </p><p>  Apart from the measures which are aimed at increasing employment across the economy as a whole, action 240 of the 2013 action plan is specifically aimed at promoting the employability of groups that have experienced labour market disadvantage, including those with disabilities.  This action is being progressed by the Equality Authority, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  An update on this commitment was included in the second progress report on the 2013 action plan, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A further update will be provided in the fourth progress report, which will be published shortly.   </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection also provides a range of labour market services for people with disabilities, including training and employment programmes.  In more general terms, many of the schemes which have been introduced by the Government to help people progress into employment,such as the new JobsPlus scheme and the JobBridge internship programme,are open to people with disabilities.  </p><p>  I am currently finalising the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs for the Government&rsquo;s approval and I hope it will include new actions to support the employment of people with disabilities.  My Department&rsquo;s officials had a very constructive meeting recently with the National Disability Authority on how actions to support the employment of people with disabilities could be integrated in this year&rsquo;s plan, based on the authority&rsquo;s own activities and objectives for 2014.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs will be published shortly, following approval by the Government.</p></reply>

People with disabilities have a right to work and to the dignity that work provides, and their exclusion from employment increases their dependency on the social welfare budget.  As the lead Minister for job creation, can he give an assurance that he will include in the 2014 action plan measures to provide greater accessibility and support to people with disabilities to allow them the dignity of being active citizens by participating in employment?</p></speech>

Programmes are in place to help people with disabilities take advantage of employment opportunities.  Many of these programmes are administered through the Department of Social Protection and, specifically, INTREO.  Available supports include the employability service, training programmes and the wage subsidy scheme.  We have sought to build on these programmes in the 2013 plan.  One area on which we focused was technical support for equality mainstreaming for providers of further education and training and labour market programmes.  Funding was approved for six equality mainstreaming projects in June 2013.  The flow of work continues and we need to use the action plan for jobs as a whole of Government initiative to build on the progress made thus far.</p></speech>

In no area of our employment strategy are we happy that we have reached our desired destination.  It must be acknowledged, however, that enterprise has created more than 58,000 job opportunities over the past 12 months, or 62,000 if one nets out the decline in the public sector.  Clearly that changes the environment by creating a better arena in which people with disabilities can succeed.  We are certainly not content with our current position in respect of our job targets or integrating people into opportunities, however.</p></speech>

Targets are not set for individual sectors or the gender breakdown of job opportunities.  However, I intend placing a particular focus on manufacturing in 2014.</p><p>  The sector had lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010.  It has seen a modest return to growth in employment over the past few years, with an additional 8,000 jobs having been created in the past year alone.  There are now 213,600 directly employed in the sector in Ireland and when account is taken of indirect jobs supported, it now supports more than 427,000.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s strategy for the manufacturing sector, which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, commissioned, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report was also published on skills needs by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>  Arising from the strategy and the skills report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by the Department and relevant agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the strategy recommendations which include delivering a national step change initiative to strengthen Ireland's manufacturing base across all firms, addressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.</p><p>  As the Deputy will realise, innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors, but it is not possible to disaggregate the contribution made by innovation towards overall job creation in those sectors.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support.  These programmes help companies become more innovative and encourage and support competitiveness.</p><p>  Taken together, we are confident that the measures I have outlined above will help grow sales and exports in the manufacturing and services sectors which in turn will lead to sustainable employment and a reduction in the live register.</p></speech>

With the ESB entering the broadband market, and the Government's decision to allow it to use the electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services, the Minister is doing a good service to the countryside.  By putting forward this opportunity, the ESB, in seeking joint venture partners to provide this much needed service, is certainly moving in the right direction.  The introduction of this Bill, which will allow use of the electricity network for communication purposes, is most welcome and I look forward to further details being published by the ESB with regard to what exactly will be its next move after the introduction of this Bill.</p><p>  I certainly do not want a situation where commercial telecommunications providers will cherry-pick service areas in Ireland, as we must have fair distribution of telecommunications services throughout the entire country.  Whether one lives in Valentia Island or Blackrock, in my book one must have the exact same type of services if we are to give fair and equal employment opportunities to all.</p><p>  At present, many townlands and villages, and even towns, have poor services and commercial operators are not willing to invest the funds required to improve these services.  I stated last night that having an adequate broadband service is now as essential as the road going up to somebody's house, and that is no exaggeration.  People would have never believed that such is the way the world would go, but that is a fact.  Having proper telecommunication services and fibre-optic capacity going to areas is as important as the road network.</p><p>  I welcome the proposed amendment by Deputy Michael Moynihan, as it is only right that the speed and quality of services advertised by broadband providers are reflective of the actual speed and quality of the broadband the consumer receives.  In many instances, and this comes back to the issue of cherry-picking, service providers like to give the impression that they are providing a service to all, but they are not.  For example, in south Kerry, there is an excellent fibre-optic cable going to Caherciveen which was put in place for the great company, FEXCO.  I take this opportunity to compliment and thank FEXCO for the significant amount of jobs it has provided, not only in County Kerry but throughout the country.  It is a great employer.  We are proud that it is a local businessman who started that business many years ago and has really done his best at all times to keep jobs in County Kerry in places such as Killorglin and Caherciveen.  Surely it is not beyond the realms of possibility to put loops off of the fibre-optic cable going to Caherciveen which would provide an excellent service to all of that area.  There are employers below, in Valentia, Ballinskelligs, Portmagee and Mastergeehy.  In all of these places, residents want to run small businesses from their homes and cannot do so because of the lack of proper broadband facilities.</p><p>It is very nice to live in these rural locations which have a great deal to offer.  While the tourism business was good last year and the Gathering was particularly successful, we need sustainable jobs because we cannot eat the scenery.  We want our young people who are going to school to have the same facilities as those living in cities and larger towns where there are excellent broadband services.  </p><p> I take the opportunity to thank the Minister for being here again today to take the Bill.  I want to speak briefly about the Shannon LNG project.  I welcome very much the statement made by the Minister last night, albeit belatedly, given that when he was asked on many previous occasions to intervene in this matter, he said he could not do so, but now he has said he can.  I genuinely look forward to his intervention which, to me, is a no-brainer.  Jobs can be created in the Ballylongford area and I would like to see this happen under the Minister's watch.  I would like him to become more involved and take a leadership role.  Obstructions are being put in the way of the company in that it is being asked to pay for something it is not going to use.  That is not fair; it is not right and would discourage any person from coming to that location.  The Minster knows that we desperately need these jobs which would offer a lifeline to County Kerry.  The Government should intercede and intervene in any way it can.  This would happen in another country if there was a fear of a loss of jobs, particularly in an area like County Kerry.  The people living in the Ballylongford area have been crying out for this development to go ahead for many years.  The only reason obstacles are put in the way is for people to remove them and use their heads to think of a way around them.  What the Minister said yesterday was quoted on our great radio station, Radio Kerry, this morning.  I thank him for what he said, but now I want him to act on it.  Surely there are mechanisms whereby a Minister can intervene to allow this project to go ahead.  The difference this would make to the local economy in terms of a spin-off from the project would be massive.  If it was to go ahead, we would nearly put up a statue to him.</p></speech>

I concur with the sentiments expressed on the importance of this infrastructure in the modern era.  I compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.  It is a recognition of the need to ensure there is long-term planning of vital infrastructure for the foreseeable future.  One of the problems that has bedevilled our society since the foundation of the State relates to our inability, for some unknown reason, to plan sufficiently ahead.  We tear our hair out, beat our breasts, bemoan emigration and ask ourselves questions as to why people emigrate when there is an economic downturn, but we should recognise that unless we have the basic infrastructure now required for the future, this will become a very difficult place in which to provide jobs and employment opportunities for a new and emerging generation.  We can live in the past, pretend we are all right and say to ourselves we do not need any of these things when, in fact, we do.  If we do not have them and sufficient investment in technology, we will not be in the marketplace.</p><p>  It was only 15 years ago when a number of member states of the European Union did not have a basic mobile phone service, but now they have a better service than we do.  That is one of the issues that determine the reasons people invest here, particularly where they invest.  If there is one thing that is basic to industry and economic expansion, it is communications.  I recall learning at a conference held in Brussels many years ago of the huge benefits fibre optics would bring, but, for some unknown reason, we never got on the train.  There are many places in this country where one has to move around one's own home to get a better mobile phone or broadband signal.  I said recently, rather jocosely but intentionally, that some broadband speeds could be compared to waiting for a kettle to boil.  It is appalling that we failed to recognise this necessity in times past.  We failed to plan ahead and because we failed to do so we now have an emergency.  </p><p>  It is hugely important that the Minister has grasped this nettle and decided to deal with the issue in a way that is consistent with best policy.  We will avail of an existing service and the assistance of a major service provider in the country.  In that regard, those who know me well know that I am not and never have been a great supporter of removing basic utility services from the public sector.  They have done a great job in service delivery.  I compliment the ESB on the work it has done done in the past. Even during the recent emergencies throughout the country its workforce were out day and night in appalling conditions to try to restore services against the odds.  They have a tremendous record to such an extent that they have assisted in other jurisdictions on numerous occasions.  A tribute should be paid to them for being ready, willing and able to provide services, sometimes at great risk to themselves, in the most atrocious of conditions.  </p><p>  The potential in utilising the ESB as a anchor in the provision of this service is immense and I hope there will not be too long a wait before it gets off the ground.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, there are countless parts of the country that urgently need a reasonable broadband service.  There is not much point in saying people will have it in ten years time, as opportunities pass.  We cannot wait for things to happen; we have to make them happen.  The way to do this is to show encouragement by providing the basic infrastructure required.  Apropos the parliamentary questions we have just finished, great emphasis was placed on the need for modern technology and modern communications systems and the numerous other options that open up in areas that have access to such services.</p><p>  The provision of telecommunications services is not as easy as it is in smaller countries or bigger cities.  There are countries smaller than this one, despite what some might think.  In bigger cities it should be possible to provide a good service.  We are now competing in a global economy and those involved in industry here have to complete with everybody else worldwide.  The world is now a much smaller place.  There are people in Canada, the Middle East, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in the world who are all competing for the same product.  We now recognise that exports are our business.  We can export from the food, technology and pharmaceutical sectors to a huge extent.  In that context, it is obvious that we require top-mark telecommunications, particularly broadband services, which are of huge benefit to industry, in medicine, hospitals, elsewhere in the health service and education.</p><p>High-speed broadband is available almost everywhere, except here.  The difference between that and a top-of-the-mark service is chalk and cheese.  Those who wish to invest will go for the best place and those who wish to export go for the best place.  Those who wish to receive communications on a global basis may achieve this if they happen to live in a good broadband area.  Digressing for a moment, I have often raised questions in the House about broadband and mobile telephony, as have other Members.  In my house, if I move around I get different quality reception and sometimes I get none if I move too fast or if I do not move fast enough.  With our scale of hope and ambition over the past number of years, and having come through a boom that led to a bust, it is crazy that we are back with the rabbit ears to get the best reception.  That used to be the way with the old black-and-white television when people used to put a coat hanger on top of it to improve reception.  It is of utmost importance that we achieve the best quality of service in this area in the shortest possible time.  I am not blaming the Minister because what has stymied mobile telephony was people's serious concerns about how masts were damaging to health.  There were concerns, but other countries have the same system and have embraced it, and they are progressing as a result.  If we do not do that in this country we will suffer as a result of our leprechaunism.</p><p> We need ongoing development in mobile telecommunications because we are in a changing situation and what suffices today may not be sufficient tomorrow.  It is hugely important to recognise the need to invest in this area.  From time to time I listen to various commentators talking about matters, and I heard someone announce that we do not need infrastructure and that we have enough.  How foolish.  If we continue with that attitude, in 100 years we will still have the same problems and we will be exporting our population.  We will not have sufficient to meet our needs and we will not be able to have a long-term economic plan because we will not have the basic infrastructure.  </p><p> The purpose of the Bill is to allow a major company such as the ESB to engage, now or in the future, in the installation and operation of electronic communications networks and services, either alone or in conjunction with another company.  The benefit of the ESB is that it has the expertise.  It has worldwide renown and has proved the point many times.  It provides a very effective and efficient service, although people carp about the cost and the alleged preferential wage structures.  The ESB provides a service in all conditions and circumstances.</p><p> The enabling legislation is very much in the spirit of the Government's national broadband plan.  It will provide high-speed, modern broadband services throughout the country without exception.  Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned various spots throughout the country that suffer deficiencies in that area, as they always have done.  That should not be the case.  Modern technology should enable us to bring the most modern telecommunications technology to all areas of the country at the same time.  Things have moved on.  We can communicate with the moon and with people in space.  What prevents us from doing the simple things we can do at home, which are of huge benefit to the economy?</p><p> It is not before time that the legislation comes before the House.  The Minister made reference to the &quot;opportunity to significantly enhance the quality and availability of modern, resilient and future-proofed broadband infrastructure through the use of the ESB's extensive electricity networks, potentially extending the reach of fibre to the home and further enhancing broadband connectivity in Ireland&quot;.  The Minister rightly indicates the importance of this step.  If this had happened ten years ago, it would not have been too early.  It would have been hugely beneficial in the drive towards economic recovery for which we now have responsibility.  The country, the people and the Government are responding to it.  It is no harm to recognise the huge deficiency and the fact that, if it had been addressed some time ago, we might not have had the difficulties we had during the downturn.  It might even have been possible to be more competitive at an earlier stage and to prevent the downturn.</p><p> I do not want to digress into other areas, but we need to carry out assessments from time to time to ascertain the areas in which we are most deficient and most likely to be challenged in the future, which may be mobile telephony, broadband, telecommunications or transport.  Not so many years ago, people were tying themselves to trees to prevent roads from being built.  The roads are there but if we did not have them we would be further back down the ladder in terms of competitiveness.  All of these things add up.  The provisions in respect of telecommunications are such that everyone recognises they will play a huge role in the future of our economy and the global economy.  Some countries are more aggressive and competitive in the area than others and they will gain an advantage.  The Minister is fully aware of this and supports the proposal.  We need to identify each sector and element in the communications sector where deficiency exists and we need to identify areas of the country with specific deficiencies.  We need to address this and invest in them now.  Most of all, we need to be able to say to ourselves that we have a modern telecommunications service that is efficient and fast and available to everyone and all sectors.  That will also have the benefit of providing a capability in areas that may be deficient in other infrastructural respects.  In today's world, not everyone has to work in the workplace all the time.  People can work from home or in smaller communities but only if they have the proper telecommunications.</p><p> We have all responded to people in our constituencies complaining about an inability to access an adequate broadband service.  Some people want to use a home computer but the complaint also comes from small businesses.  They find themselves at a disadvantage, which is hugely frustrating.  The speed of broadband is painfully slow and frustrating.  People have sent us e-mails, texts and messages to tell us about it.  It is hugely frustrating to watch the band moving along the line, stopping and breaking down in the middle of a transmission.  I have had to wait a couple of hours to get an e-mail.</p><p>We have a serious deficit in the area.</p><p> The next generation broadband task force report, which was published in 2011, identified the various provisions required to progress to meet future market demands.  The Minister referenced the various towns, villages and communities throughout the country which may not be able to gain access to investment.  The ESB has a network that reaches every part of the country, with one or two notable exceptions that we hear of from time to time.  Generally speaking, it goes everywhere, meaning the company is in an ideal position to be able to carry alongside the cabling a system that will facilitate this piece of technology.</p><p> As the Minister has indicated, the national broadband plan recognised that a number of commercial and non-commercial State bodies are already leveraging their existing assets to provide infrastructure and services to the telecommunications market.  These assets continue to play an important role in improving broadband services and the plan commits to exploiting any further opportunities that arise with a view to accelerating the roll-out of high-speed broadband.</p><p> I will conclude on that thought.  Accelerating the rate of roll-out for high-speed broadband is crucial to our future existence.  If we do not have that element of communication at our fingertips, we will lose out on investment, global communication and international stature.  This country has been beset by emigration over the years, so it would be nice if we could get a good quality of service to communicate with emigrants, of whom there are very many.  I do not wish for us to have to live with the prospect of constant emigration and the introduction of a proper telecommunications system could be the way forward in ensuring adequate job opportunities at home.  Instead of having young people going to Australia, Canada or New York, they should be able to do the same job here in their own communities.  They need access to a proper communication system in order to do so.</p></speech>

They did a tremendous job during the severe weather we experienced over Christmas.</p><p>  The piece of legislation before us today is not the most important piece of legislation we will deal with this year but is probably the most important piece of legislation that will be dealt with by the Parliament in this decade.  The significance of the legislation cannot be underestimated.  It is not just because it will be responsible for extending the fibre network to an extra 500,000 homes in Ireland or because it provides for the potential of &quot;wireless&quot; fibre networks in order to provide decent broadband to people who do not live in those 500,000 houses.  There is potential for broadband connectivity within electricity cables, and getting the ESB involved will help drive forward that idea.  With that process, we would not need to install extra physical infrastructure, and we could bring broadband to every home in Ireland that is connected to the electricity network.</p><p>  We cannot underestimate the importance of broadband.  Internet connectivity today is as important for employment and the needs of Irish society as electricity was 60 years ago.  There is a demand for greater bandwidth and speed, which is the main issue.  Everybody who spoke earlier mentioned rural broadband, which faces problems with speed.  I have been trying to formulate an analogy to help explain to people what we are talking about in that respect.  We can imagine trying to travel from any part of rural Ireland to Dublin without being able to use the motorway or the national road network.  That means we would have to drive a rigid-body truck with a trailer, for example, on icy roads.  That is what the broadband service in many parts of rural Ireland is like.  If fibre networks were brought to the door, however, instead of driving the rigid-body truck on an icy back road, it would be like driving a luxury car with cruise control on a 36-lane motorway with nobody else on the road.  That example brings home to people what we are talking about and the potential of the provisions being debated in the House today.</p><p>  People can probably survive with current speeds if they are surfing the Internet or sending e-mails.  Contention - or in plain English, congestion on the line to Dublin - continues to be a problem.  Current broadband speeds are grossly inadequate if people are using Skype, submitting online documentation such as that required for the single farm payment application or using the Internet as a study tool.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in bringing industrial-strength broadband to every secondary school in Ireland.  He is to be commended because he started on the west coast and worked backwards to Dublin; every initiative up to now has always gone the other way.  We now need to ensure that when those students leave school and go home they can have decent broadband speeds to do tutorials or submit homework online.</p><p>  The current Government target of ensuring every rural home in Ireland has a broadband connection of at least 30 Mb per second will be difficult to achieve, and we must redouble our efforts in that regard.  The target set out by the ESB on foot of the passage of this legislation will bring super-fast broadband to those currently within the catchment of the fixed-line broadband network.  People should not think that we are currently discussing will resolve the problem for rural broadband.  It will not do so, as the objective is to bring fibre broadband to an extra 500,000 homes in Ireland, meaning that rural communities are still excluded.</p><p>  Work to address the issue of rural broadband connectivity must continue by focusing not just on getting the connection working but on issues of contention as well.  Technologies exist that provide broadband to people, but the difficulty is that although speed is achievable, it may only be after midnight because of congestion.  That is not much good if one is trying to operate a business from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.  Satellite technology can address some of the problem, and its use is a major step forward.  There are some very good operators that can deliver up to 20 Mbps, but they do not provide a long-term solution.</p><p>  Wireless technologies in conjunction with a fibre network can address the immediate problem and provide 30 Mbps.  This is known as wireless fibre.  The ESB already has a network of masts and sites around the country that could be used if fibre lines are connected to the sites.  Wireless fibre could be produced by these networks.  As an incentive, the Minister should hand over the semi-State broadband network to the new operator.</p><p>That would act as an incentive to roll out fibre to the transmission sites in order that wireless fibre could be available throughout the country.  Much of it is unlit.</p><p> Let me give an example of the problem we face.  Monksland, the second biggest town in my county, is located at the edge of Athlone which has an eircom fibre network with an excellent service.  It has WiMax, 4G and UPC services and a number of fibre backbones passing through it, including the BT fibre backbone.  The State fibre network is also coming into the town, yet the people of Monksland do not have a basic broadband service.  Within a few hundred yards of that community, there are the Irish Rail and Bord G&aacute;is fibre networks, the MAN fibre network and the ESB transmission network that has been providing an Internet service up to now.  Much of this is unlit.  Since there is no connectivity between the networks of the various semi-State companies, they are all competing against each other, instead of sweating the asset in the interests of the State and consumers.  I urge the Minister to intervene in this regard.  This initiative would ensure people could use a number of devices in their homes, be it to watch television online, operate an iPad or computer, or play a video game.  It would provide a reliable service.  Probably the three main beneficiaries are businesses, younger people and older people.  Previous speakers have spoken about business.  Whether one is working in Tokyo or Tulsk, County Roscommon, one could be on an equal footing, with needed supports provided for rural businesses and enterprises.</p><p> One area of rural enterprise is agriculture, in respect of which broadband connectivity and penetration is only at about 53%.  Farmers could make applications online if they had access to broadband.  With the Minister's proposals for the new GLAS scheme, farmers will have to gain access to online tutorials, but they will not be able to do so if they do not have broadband.  The reality is that most of the people who will apply to join the scheme are in the more disadvantaged parts of the country where there is no broadband access.  I hope the Minister can redouble efforts to ensure that, in tandem with the introduction of the GLAS scheme, people will be given access to the relevant tools to allow them to avail of the online tutorials.</p><p> As I stated, the Minister has brought industrial strength broadband to schools, but it will not reach its full capacity unless it is available in homes for pupils.  Remote access for children outside school would ensure they could connect to the school server and gain access to texts and library resources.  If children were sick and absent from school, they could learn what was covered in their school on the day in question.  They could still do their homework and this would prevent many students from having to go for grinds.  They would be available to avail of grinds online.  A child's family&rsquo;s financial resources will be irrelevant if children can access resources online, thus putting them on an equal footing with every other pupil in the country.</p><p> In smaller secondary schools pupils who are not taking chemistry or agricultural science could actually take their course online from home or sit the leaving certificate examination in the same way as anyone else.  The same applies to adult education that requires access to online courses.</p><p> The initiative has the most significant potential in addressing the issue of rural isolation and the needs of the elderly.  In the next few years one in four will be over 65 years.  That is a significant cohort.  Owing to economic circumstances, many of them will be living alone and they will not have the family supports or networks they require.  In my constituency one third of all pensioners living in County Leitrim are on their own.  In County Roscommon the figure is 31%; in County Mayo, 30% and in County Cavan, 30%.  The figure for Galway is 27%, while those for counties Westmeath and Offaly are just slightly lower.  Some 60%, or almosts two thirds, of older people believe technology has left them behind.  Technology would provide them with much greater potential than anything else in society.  If they could be provided with fibre broadband of a sufficient speed, we could ensure they could be stimulated educationally and kept more active.  Furthermore, tele-care and health care services could be provided.  High blood pressure, for example, could be monitored on an ongoing basis.</p><p> There is a very good initiative in Wales whereby an older person can actually speak to a health profession in the local hospital through a video link on his or her television if he or she is concerned about his or her blood pressure reading or not having taken his or her medication.  The same applies in the case of diabetes in that a blood sample can be put on a reader connected to an iPhone and the results fed back to the local medical centre, the staff of which can say the patient needs to increase his or her insulin intake because of a particularly high blood sugar level, for example.  There is great potential to develop tele-health services by putting sensors in homes and linking them with remote servers connected to hubs where medical professionals can monitor large numbers of people in rural areas.  This would reduce rural isolation and significantly reduce the cost to the health sector.  One would not have to send an ambulance to bring a very sick patient to an accident and emergency unit if the illness could be diagnosed and treated much earlier.  This might mean that the local public health nurse would have to call out to the individual, but it would make it less likely that he or she would have to go to the general practitioner or hospital.  We could have a genuinely connected society, but to achieve this we need to go one step further than is envisaged in this proposal.</p><p> Connecting 500,000 houses is very welcome, but there is great potential to go further with wireless fibre which should be brought to rural homes in order that residents may, for the first time, be given a level playing pitch.  People had to fight hard to receive a public water supply.  They received an electricity supply 60 years ago and it turned society around in rural areas.  Broadband could do the same, but the Minister needs to ensure this.  He could be the No&euml;l Browne of this generation.  I urge him to take that suggestion and run with it.</p></speech>

The involvement of the ESB in the market will help consumers and encourage more competition in the market.  Having multiple providers such as UPC and Sky has ensured service of a better quality, better coverage and, crucially, lower prices for consumers.</p><p>  The issue of broadband is raised regularly in this House.  Multinationals ask the speed of broadband in particular countries and regions.  It is measured regularly by the National Competitiveness Council.  It is important for businesses, particularly those that are constantly on the move, to have proper connectivity.  To date, broadband has been patchy in certain parts of our constituencies.</p><p>I would be very hopeful that over time, between the targets in the national broadband plan and what the ESB is planning to do, we will be able to deal with the deficit that exists.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, there are parts of Raheny, which is only four miles away from the city centre, which have significant problems.  Broadband speed in some parts of Raheny is only at 3bps while in other parts it is 48mbps.  This problem has occurred because of the refusal by Dublin City Council to give permission for the installation of cabinets by Eircom to improve its broadband service.  Such barriers should not exist if we want to improve the situation for businesses and households and enable them to get instant connectivity.  From the consumer's point of view it is unacceptable because they are being charged the same price for a lesser service.  They want to have access to a decent, fibre-optic broadband service.</p><p> The Government has been very proactive in this area and the Minister has announced a number of initiatives to improve the situation.  The national broadband plan outlines the Government's objective of ensuring that at least 50% of the population will have access to broadband speeds of between 70 and 100 mbps by 2015.  Some might argue that such a target is merely aspirational but it is important to set targets so that everyone knows what we hope to achieve.</p><p> It is good to see that the ESB is moving with the times and is willing to diversify, to move into a new area and offer new products and services.  I wish the company well and join Deputy Naughten in thanking the staff of the ESB for their good work over the Christmas period when they reconnected so many homes affected by the storms.  I am also delighted that the staff did not go on strike in the run-up to Christmas.  That could have caused a lot of reputational damage to the country and huge inconvenience to consumers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1021" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kenny" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300015#N00200"><p>I wish to share time with Deputies Kevin Humphreys and Anne Ferris.</p><p>  I pay tribute to the work force in the ESB for the sterling work they did during the recent storms to restore supply to the communities that were affected.  Indeed, tribute must be paid to them for the work they do all year round, 365 days a year.  </p><p>  This Bill provides a legal basis for the ESB to engage in the business of installing and operating an electronic communications network and to provide electronic communications services in the future, either alone or in partnership with another company.  The Bill makes appropriate provisions in respect of the ESB's existing powers in the context of its operation in what is a fully open and liberalised telecommunications market.  This is important for the State, as it is also a competitor in this market.  The costs associated with the Bill are purely administrative, relating to the legislative proposals themselves and pursuing them.  No additional or recurring costs to the Exchequer have been identified as this legislation is merely providing for something that will occur in the future.</p><p>  The Bill is straightforward in that it merely points the way forward and is not actually setting up an electronic communications network at this point in time.  The legislation gives the ESB an explicit legal basis to engage in the business of electronic communications networks and services, either alone or in conjunction with a partner company.  The Bill also enables the ESB to provide any company with access to its electricity infrastructure for the purposes of developing electronic communications networks and services.  Care must be taken to ensure that ESB infrastructure is kept in State ownership.  Sustainable financial gain must be made by the ESB in return for the use of its assets or services.  Due to the nature of the electricity network, elements of the ESB infrastructure are laid out across private land.  As we are seeing at the moment, this is a fairly sensitive political issue.  In that context, great care must be taken to ensure that local communities are not only informed as to what is going on but also genuinely give their consent to it.  The existing Electricity Supply Acts provide statutory way-leave rights to the ESB which allows it to cross private lands, subject to the payment of compensation where appropriate.  Given that the ESB proposes to utilise its existing electricity distribution network for telecommunications purposes, such way-leave rights across private lands will be necessary, where the ESB provides access to its infrastructure under this Bill.  For that reason, the legislation extends the ESB way-leave rights across private lands in instances where access to infrastructure is granted by the ESB to another company.  This section has been modelled on section 49 of the Electricity Regulation Act of 1999, where such powers are subject to the consent of the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p>  In conclusion, this Bill is a positive development.  As legislators we are often accused of having too much concern for the short term and not enough for the future, an accusation that has some merit.  However, this Bill is a welcome demonstration of making provision for future developments.  It opens the way for the State to become involved in what is a profoundly important area of commercial activity, as technology develops and society becomes even more connected than it is already.</p></speech>

It must be very nice for the Minister to sit in the House and hear very clear support for this measure from all sides.  What is rare is wonderful.  Some of the investment in infrastructure over the last decade was very poorly planned.  Our population is projected to grow into the future and we face clear infrastructure deficits in terms of water, broadband services, transport, electricity and so on.  There are serious problems in these areas and we must face up to them.</p><p>  This Bill allows for the smarter use of current infrastructure.  It will result in increased competition and will allow for the provision of broadband services in areas which currently have no access to such services, particularly in rural Ireland.  Deputy Terence Flanagan referred to a lack of competition in Dublin and I hope this Bill will go some way towards addressing that issue.  Deputy Flanagan also spoke about the difficulties surrounding the erection of cabinets and the requirement to seek planning permission for same but that did not happen by accident.  In the past, contractors erected such cabinets in inappropriate and in some cases dangerous locations.  While the requirement to seek planning permission for cabinets may slow things down, it is far better to get it right than get it quickly.</p><p>  I very much welcome the involvement of the ESB in this because the company has a fantastic record.  The ESB's extensive network of overhead lines penetrates practically every part of the country.  Deputy Naughten spoke about the positive impact that access to broadband can have on rural Ireland and I agree with him in that regard.  Broadband access also has a positive impact on those who are known in my area as &quot;silver surfers&quot; - elderly people who use the Internet.  Across the inner city and in other deprived areas, elderly people have taken to using the Internet in a big way.  While rural isolation is well documented, urban isolation also exists and the Internet is a fantastic tool for breaking down such isolation.  It enables elderly people, for example, to interact with grandchildren who are not living nearby and so forth.</p><p>The ESB runs those cables into areas of Dublin that the commercial sector has never looked at.  I do not want the exercise to be considered as a purely rural experiment, as urban areas present real possibilities also.  I congratulate the Minister on the initiative.</p><p> We have been dealing with legacy issues.  When the Government came to power it looked at the poor extent of broadband in schools across the country.  Deputy Naughten said we needed to roll out the programme more quickly.  When the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, came to power there was no broadband in the vast majority of schools.  In spite of the mess that had to be cleared up, the matter was corrected in a short period through his initiative with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.</p><p> This morning I read in the newspaper that the only criticism of the Bill is that it is not moving fast enough.  I say in response to the Deputy who advanced the opinion that if we did not have to clean up the unholy mess that was created over the past 14 years we would be much further down the road.  Every committee meeting that has taken place since Christmas has dealt with legacy issues - the lack of broadband services, the lack of transport, the fact that the water infrastructure is dying on its feet - yet all we hear is criticism.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il promised a constructive Opposition.  All I can ask is this: where is it?  In fact, where is the Opposition?  It has been extremely poor and lacking in ideas.  The only thing it can manage to do is criticise.  As the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has discovered, even when he comes up with good initiatives the Opposition scratches around and comes up with the complaint that the roll-out could be quicker.  We have an extremely poor Opposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1105" speakername="Anne Ferris" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300016#O00200"><p>The legislation before the House today is about giving the ESB a legal basis to engage in the business of electronic communications services.  Instead of using the wires, poles and pylons that form part of the national grid just for the provision of electricity, the legislation will enable the ESB to use the same infrastructure for telecommunications purposes - in other words, the business of mobile phones, computer data and television broadcasting.  The Minister has already spoken about proposals to expand the remit of the ESB into broadband provision.</p><p><b></b>I welcome the potential broadening of the commercial scope of the ESB.  Ireland's electricity distribution system has come a long way.  I doubt if the engineers who back in 1915 first investigated the possibility of generating power from the waters of the River Shannon could have envisaged the scale of the technological advances that have occurred since.  Allowing the ESB to compete fully in this growing sector and to facilitate competition by opening access to infrastructure is a good thing for consumers and also for the future of the ESB in what has become a technically and legally complex sector.</p><p>  However, in considering today's Bill it is nigh-on impossible to ignore the proposal by the ESB's sister company, EirGrid, to double the capacity of the national grid by 2025.  Such a significant change to the capacity of the future ESB network will have a significant bearing on the commercial scope of the ESB within the new parameters set out today.  It would be by all means right and correct for ESB management to take this new legislation and to make commercial plans based on the existing capacity of the national grid.  However, the ESB would be well advised to exercise caution in terms of any commercial agreements for broadband or any other form of telecommunications which relies on the expanded national grid infrastructure proposed under Grid25 and Grid Link.</p><p>  Before Christmas I made a personal submission to Mr. Fintan Slye, the current CEO of EirGrid.  Among other matters I requested the most up-to-date analysis EirGrid has of the technical need for the Grid Link portion of the &euro;3.2 billion Grid25 project.  I asked if he could show me the calculations behind the recommendations to build Grid Link.  I got a surprisingly swift reply enclosing a link to a 400-odd page report called the Ten Year Transmission Forecast Statement 2013.  It is about the same thickness as an old telephone directory and, to be frank, just about as interesting to read.  Perhaps Mr. Slye thought I would not read it.  In fact, the EirGrid report just confirmed what I already knew.  The reason for the proposal to spend &euro;3.2 billion of taxpayers' money to double the capacity of the national grid is to support a massive increase in renewable energy, mainly from wind power.  Only a fraction of the wind energy generated would have anything to do with keeping on the lights in the State.  EirGrid wants to double the capacity of the national grid mainly for the purpose of facilitating the export of wind energy abroad.</p><p>  The numbers are very revealing.  I am not an electrical engineer so I have no intention of getting technical but, very simply, according to EirGrid's calculations Ireland needs approximately 3,500 MW of wind energy to meet our EU renewable energy targets.  We all know that a lot of wind farms have already been built and operate in this country, particularly in the south and west.  Approximately 1,800 MW of generating capacity are already in place.  Since 2010, according to EirGrid, the regulator has approved a massive 5,500 MW of wind turbine capacity.  Even more surprising is the number of new wind energy applications currently before the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, awaiting approval, amounting to an amazing 23,000 MW.  In order to meet the targets Ireland only needs 3,500 MW.  The regulator has already approved twice what is needed and has another staggering 23,000 MW waiting in the wings.  The only reason that is happening is because EirGrid is proposing to invest billions in the national grid for the purpose of exporting power abroad - in theory, to the UK and France.</p><p>  In my submission to Mr. Slye I also asked for the market analysis that had been carried out to confirm that the UK and France actually need this power.  According to the Irish Academy of Engineering there are many doubts about the existence of any market for this power.  It appears there is enough wind in Scotland and nuclear energy in England to meet UK needs.  EirGrid declined to make any comment on its market analysis for exporting power.  I am beginning to wonder whether it exists at all.</p><p>  I will conclude with one final point that was recently made to me by a constituent in County Wicklow.  The wind energy for export strategy that has such a significant influence on EirGrid's &euro;3.2 billion plans was conceived during the reign of its previous CEO, Mr. Dermot Byrne, who departed the company in September 2012.  Barely a year after he retired from the position of EirGrid CEO, Mr. Byrne was appointed to the board of Element Power Ireland, one of the companies that has plans to carpet large swathes of the Irish countryside with wind turbines for export.  It is time we had a second opinion.</p></speech>

I have tried to be constructive in what I have said, even if I have tried to push the boat out and see a vision the Minister would ultimately share with me - that we be known as a small island with the ultimate in broadband connectivity.  Barriers exist which frustrated me in government and which no doubt frustrate the Minister.</p><p>  The Minister comes from a background of union involvement.  Unions were traditionally very supportive of the view that where basic infrastructure was involved, there was nothing wrong with the State getting involved and ensuring that ordinary citizens had basic services.  That is a very old view in this State.  It is one that has served us well, particularly in the area of electricity supply.  I refer to the idea of a universal service provided at an equal standard right across the nation.  It is strange to say that if we go back 100 years the postal service went to every house without question for the same value stamp.</p><p>When telephones were introduced, no matter how far up the hill one lived, so long as one was willing to pay the connection charge, one could make and receive telephone calls from anywhere.  After the Second World War, a decision was made to bring electricity to every building in the country.  In my time as a Minister, I was delighted to finish off the last of that programme in bringing electricity to very isolated areas.  It is time now, despite European rules, that we made it absolutely clear that Internet connectivity, essentially connectivity to the world, should be universally available.</p><p> When we discuss this issue we must acknowledge increased mobility and that for high-end people the office is often wherever they are.  I congratulate the Minister on the web summit held in Dublin last autumn.  When our guests from Silicon Valley were here, there is no doubt they were accessing the Internet through fibre-optic connections to continue their worldwide business, taking into account that Tokyo and Singapore are so many hours ahead while west coast America is so many hours behind.  A fair number of these people wound up on Achill Island for the weekend of the summit and I can testify they had a tremendous time there.  However, it remained that when they were on Achill Island on Friday afternoon, it was early day on the west coast of America, and on Monday morning when they left, Japan, Singapore and the Far East had nearly finished Monday.  These people would have been anxious to plug in to do business across the world and expected the same level of connectivity as they had in Dublin.  That is their lifestyle.  However, as well as catering for high-end Internet users, good connectivity is important for the convenience of those of us who live in rural areas.  Access to broadband is important.  No matter where one is, one should be able plug in.</p><p> I remember having endless arguments when we were in government - arguments the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, had when he was in government before - about broadband roll-out.  I know the Minister has the target of 30 Mb/s as being good enough broadband provision for rural areas.  I also know that is probably not his choice but that he has been forced into this corner by some ridiculous European rule that one cannot specify the type of broadband provision one wants.  We all use smartphones all the time and I am a great believer in radio broadband whether it is in an urban or rural setting.  I believe we need 30 Mb/s everywhere but it is not a substitute for having access to 100 Mb/s in one&rsquo;s home.  With the development of technology, the idea is ridiculous that we will continue to live in a two broadband-speed world where people in Dublin will have several choices for getting their television, telephone and limitless Internet access through a fibre-optic cable to their house while those living further from urban centres will have to be satisfied with multi-providers.</p><p> These days fibre is cheaper than copper.  If we were able to run copper to every premises in the country, then surely, with new technology, it should not be beyond our ability to run fibre to every house.  The Minister claims there will be an enormous cost to this but it might not be.  I understand that 90% of the cost of rolling out fibre underground relates to ducting while only 10% relates to the actual fibre cable.  One could hang it along the electricity transmission lines without having to plough it underground.  Now, there is the possibility of the ESB using a machine to run the fibre cable along its main transmission cables.  Running fibre out is much cheaper than running a copper line out.  This is a good step forward by the ESB.</p><p> When we look at broadband penetration in other countries, we see they opted for fibre over copper because it gives limitless Internet access, maintains good speed and does not interfere with the quality of television reception or Skype, for example.  We should set the target to be the first country in Europe to bring fibre to every premises.  We should look at the barriers associated with cost, technology and European Union rules and overcome each of them.  Working out much of this will happen commercially but there will be areas that will require subsidies.  It should be remembered, however, that the areas of the most dispersed populations tend to be the areas of greatest community effort and co-operation.  Many of them have all sorts of social schemes that have delivered from footpaths to streetlights.  There is also the new rural development programme coming on stream that could be tapped for funding.</p><p> If it were decided to underground the fibre roll-out, then it should be remembered ducting will make up 90% of the cost.  There could be self-help schemes providing the ducting to a national standard.  Then the Minister could ask the telcos to provide the fibre.</p><p> I welcome this Bill and the probable entry of a very successful semi-State company into the telco industry again.  I hope it will provide good competition and that through commercial forces it will roll out fibre with ever better and cheaper technologies as far as is possible on a commercial basis.  I believe our vision has to go further, however, and that we should use the same vision and common sense that in 1944 saw the roll-out of electricity to every house.  As Deputy Naughten said, fibre is today what electricity was in the 1940s.  There were many in the 1940s who did not believe electricity would play such a part in their lives.  When the ESB was canvassing people on the roll-out in the 1940s, it had a great difficulty in getting people to accept it.  Once they got it, very few said they no longer wanted electricity and could live quite happily without it.  The same is true for fibre.  In this small island that only measures 150 miles by 130 miles, I believe our ambition should be fibre for all.</p></speech>

This was the first time this was mentioned in the House and all Members are aware there is a pending High Court case involving Rehab and the State.  There is no doubt but that this information is in the taxpayers' interest and everyone believes there should be value for money.  In 2013, the Rehab Group received &euro;2.5 million from the Exchequer in the charitable lotteries scheme, which was a reduction from the &euro;3.9 million received the previous year.  The group produces consolidated accounts that give combined activities of various businesses within the group and there undoubtedly should be more openness and transparency with regard to how the group spends its money, most of which is made from its business ventures that prioritise the employment of people with special needs.  What is confusing is the motivation behind the release of information itself as the Minister, Deputy Shatter, did this intentionally during his Private Members' speech.  In the first instance, Members must be conscious that more than 80,000 people use and rely on the services provided by the Rehab Group and that 3,800 people are employed by it.  However, the key question is, what was the motivation behind the intervention by the Minister, Deputy Shatter?  What was the motivation behind the Government's intervention?  Is it concerned about misappropriation of funds?  Is it concerned about the national lottery and the matching funding or what is the motivation behind the continuous spin in this regard?  Does it relate to concerns about individual salaries or is there a broader concern about how Rehab operates?  Alternatively, does the motivation pertain to the national lottery scheme and matching funding, which is provided for by the State or are there broader general concerns?</p></speech>

The people who depend on their services value the work they do and in whatever approach one might take or in anything one might say, one should be careful not to undermine public confidence in charities or to undermine the confidence people have in making donations to them.  I do not believe the Deputy is correct in stating it was the first time the issue of the wind-down of the lottery payments had been raised in the House.</p></speech>

The issue is that when one is talking about the disbursement of public moneys, there obviously must be accountability for that.  Under the charitable lotteries scheme established in 1997, the promoters of certain private charitable lotteries that have products similar to those sold by the national lottery have received annual payments from the State to supplement their income.  The total annual funding available peaked in 2009 and 2010 at approximately &euro;8.6 million.  As the allocation of funding is based on gross ticket sales, the Rehab Group typically receives approximately two thirds of the funding available each year.  The scheme now is being wound down and a reduced total of &euro;4 million was disbursed in 2013, while the allocation for 2014 is &euro;2 million.  I understand the decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality to wind down the scheme was communicated to the relevant charities in October 2012.  The scheme is being wound down over a three-year period to afford affected organisations the opportunity to make any necessary changes to their fund-raising activities to ensure they are more directly profitable.  It is not unreasonable that the State would examine how it spends public money in supporting charities.  Between 2011 and 2013, Rehab received &euro;10.4 million in public money for its lotteries.  If it is the case that the State is spending several million euro per annum to support fund-raising in the tens of thousands, then it might be better to consider whether those millions could be used elsewhere, for example, in front-line services.</p></speech>

This has been a common practice for many years and many voluntary or charitable organisations have been receiving matching funding.  For example, sporting clubs nationwide receive matching funding in the context of other schemes; this is not unusual.  However, I find it amazing that the Taoiseach is running out of adjectives to describe his shock that this information has been unearthed, when the information on the number of tickets sold on an annual basis was freely available in the Department of Justice and Equality for many years.  The implication that the matching funding in some way is being misappropriated is almost the speak that is coming from the Government.  What is the Government's concern and what is the concern of the Minister for Justice and Equality?  Even though the State is before the High Court with Rehab with regard to compensation being sought by the latter, the Minister came into this Chamber to make what was a very unusual intervention, to say the least.  The implication that this information was unearthed simply is not the case, as it has been sitting inside the Department of Justice and Equality year on year.  I reiterate the key questions, namely, what is the concern of the Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality with regard to the matching funding being provided?  Are there concerns there has been misappropriation of funding or is it simply a concern regarding insufficient openness and transparency?</p></speech>

As for the arrangement whereby State funding was provided to certain organisations that were running lotteries, the decision to wind down that funding over a three-year period was communicated to the organisations back in 2012.  It is being done over a three-year period and as I stated, at the peak in 2009 and 2010, it involved a sum of &euro;8.6 million in total that was being paid to such organisations.  It was decided to wind that down over a three-year period to give the organisations the opportunity to make other arrangements, including other fund-raising arrangements, and so on.  This has been ongoing for some time and so there is nothing new in that.  In the course of the debate here in the Chamber the other evening, the Minister for Justice and Equality drew attention to what was happening in that area.  At a wider level, the Government must ensure the controversies that have arisen around some charities in recent times do not undermine the important work those organisations do and the services they deliver-----</p></speech>

Second, it must ensure the controversies do not undermine public confidence in them.  This is the reason the Government brought in legislation to provide for a charities regulator.  This is the reason the Government is proceeding with the putting in place of that regulatory regime and it is the Minister's intention that this will be in place, hopefully, by the end of February.</p></speech>

The Government has refused for three years to implement the Charities Act 2009 and again last night, its Members voted against the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, which would have resulted in a supplementation forthwith.  Ongoing revelations of excessive pay to charity chief executive officers, serious questions over fund-raising, and a lack of transparency and accountability have deeply angered citizens, particularly those suffering at the end of the brutal austerity cuts in recent years.  I believe what has been uncovered at the CRC, Irish Water, Poolbeg and elsewhere is a toxic political culture of top ups, bonuses, jobs for the boys and contracts for the elite.  Again, one reads in the newspapers today of a former chief executive officer of Rehab and long-time adviser of Fine Gael billing the company for consultancy services using a dissolved company.</p><p>That all suggests something rotten in the state of Denmark.

In December, the Minister for Justice and Equality got sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed with the filling of the post of CEO of the new charities regulatory authority and a number of other administrative posts from within existing resources by the end of February.  The Minister is issuing a call for expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons who wish to be considered for appointment with a view to having these positions filled by Easter.  This will enable the authority to proceed with the preparatory work necessary ahead of its formal establishment by ministerial order later in the year.  The focus of the new authority in its early phase of operation will be on the preparation of a statutory register of charities for publication.</p><p>  This move represents an important part of the work we are doing in government to rebuild trust and confidence in our charity sector.  The charity sector can show leadership in this area through demonstrating good governance and transparency in their own operations.  It is important we underline again the good work charitable organisations are doing.  It is important that the public can have confidence that when they make a donation to a charitable organisation it is going for the purpose for which it is made and is going into the services.  That is why we will have a regulatory system and authority for charities in place.  It is the intention that the key posts will be filled by the end of February and that the authority will be in place by Easter.  That work is proceeding and there will be a regulatory regime.</p><p>  I am in favour of transparency.  I am in favour of organisations making known in their accounts the salaries they pay to their CEOs.  I see no reason salaries paid to senior people in charitable organisations or other bodies should not be made available by way of public information.</p></speech>

This has allowed charitable organisations to provide core health services.  Those Governments, and the current one, must bear significant responsibility for the situation.  While the State has provided much of the funding, an arm's length relationship allowed poor accountability to flourish.  In St. Vincent's hospital there was one chief executive for both the public and private hospitals.  Considering the amount of public money that has gone to support the activities of Rehab, does the T&aacute;naiste agree that it would be more cost-effective for the services it provides to be provided directly, as they should be, by the State?</p></speech>

It was this Government that commenced the audit, through the HSE, of the various organisations funded by the State, and that audit shone light on the salary levels and various other arrangements.  We are putting in place the regulatory regime I have described.  Progress has been made on that.  The relevant staff will be in place by the end of February and the authority will be operational by Easter.  That will be the first time that will have been done.</p><p>  It is the Government's view that there must be accountability for the spending of any public money, and that it must represent value for money and the best outcome for the taxpayer.  If we feel public moneys can be better used, more effectively deployed or can deliver a better service for the public by means other than channelling that money through particular organisations, that will inform our policy decisions.  Our view is guided first by the need for the public to get the best possible service for the spending of any public money irrespective of how it is spent, whether through a State agency, a voluntary agency or a charity; and second by the need for transparency around the way taxpayers' money is spent.  That is why we have taken the approach we have taken and we will continue with that until there is a satisfactory outcome to all these matters.</p></speech>

I, and many others, supported these changes because the clinicians leading the reconfiguration unanimously believed that it would save lives.  The HSE gave us repeated assurances that St. Vincent's University Hospital would be given sufficient resources to absorb the extra workload from Loughlinstown hospital.  Despite these assurances, the following letter appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> from a registrar in St. Vincent's:<blockquote>The real scandal at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is the overwhelming increase in acutely unwell patient volume since the effective closure of St. Columcille&rsquo;s Loughlinstown to out-of-hours admissions.  [This] has led to a doubling of medical and surgical admissions to an already stretched but otherwise efficient and well-run public hospital.  Clinicians of all grades and disciplines are working flat out to cope with the increased demand.</blockquote>I followed up with clinicians in St. Vincent's and they said ambulance arrivals and GP referrals to the emergency department there are up approximately 50%.  Overall admissions are up approximately 50% and have doubled in out-of-hours.  They say that in spite of this the emergency department has received no additional nurses and only a token complement of doctors.  Just last week staff that were promised from Loughlinstown to St. Vincent's have been pulled, so the emergency department in St. Vincent's is dealing with a 50% increase in volume with only a handful of extra medics, contrary to the assurances we were all given.</p><p>  That is not the only problem.  St. Vincent's has not been given the additional ward beds to deal with the additional volume either.  Patients at Loughlinstown who become very sick are referred directly to the intensive care unit in St. Vincent's, which is also bringing that to over-capacity, according to the medical staff there.  Not only is the emergency department working flat out, there is nowhere in the hospital for them to send the patients once they have stabilised them.  The letter ends:&quot; The end result is an unsustainable, overcrowded and unsafe mess with significant compromise in delivery of care.&quot;  Patients are suffering and some will die.</p><p>This is outrageous.  It is unacceptable to me and I have no doubt that it is unacceptable to the T&aacute;naiste that this has happened.  Why have the additional resources, which we were promised would be put in place, not been put in place?  Why has a situation been allowed to develop in St. Vincent's hospital which clinicians are now telling us will lead to patients in the T&aacute;naiste's constituency, my constituency and many other places dying?</p></speech>

However, I suggest a meeting is probably not enough at this stage.  We have been given many assurances.  I was given an assurance by the HSE that the combined budgets of the three hospitals involved, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Loughlinstown hospital and St. Michael's Hospital, would increase as part of the reconfiguration.  One year later I was told that not only would the budget not be increased, it would be decreased.  We were given assurances regarding the timing of when this would happen, but they did not come to pass.  Now we have an extremely serious situation where a medical registrar and medical staff are saying people will die.  They are telling us the assurances we were given by the HSE have not been met.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the 50% figure is correct, whether ICU is operating at overcapacity, whether GPs are referring patients or whether there has been a doubling of admissions out of hours, but we need an urgent and independent review.  I have two requests to make of the T&aacute;naiste.  I thank him for saying he will arrange a meeting, but as well as this, will he ask that an independent review be commissioned immediately and a report provided?  Will he also commit that if the review finds that the allegations have substance and that the necessary resources have not been provided for St. Vincent's University Hospital, the Government will provide them immediately?</p></speech>

It might be a good idea to ask the registrar concerned to come and tell us directly and probe the issue and statements he is making with the managements of the hospitals.  We must establish the factual position.  We can then set about resolving the issue.  The outcome we want is to have is the highest level of service being available to the public.  The Deputy mentioned beds.  I understood beds in Loughlinstown hospital were to be used for elective cases which would, in turn, free up beds in St. Vincent's University Hospital and enable a throughput of patients through the accident and emergency service.  The Deputy is aware that by the time the changes were made in Loughlinstown hospital, the numbers attending the accident and emergency ward at night were very small, because for some time if an accident occurred on the N11, for example, the patient was brought directly to St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I would like to probe the facts to establish the position.  We can do this and, if necessary, then ask the registrar who has written about these matters to come and give us the information he has available.</p></speech>

There is also the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill on Second Stage in the Seanad.  I ask Deputy Ellis to pursue the matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport because I am not sure which Bill addresses the issue he has raised.</p></speech>

I could paper his house with all the representations I have sent to his office on the broadband issue over the years.  He knows well how patchy broadband service is in the midlands.  The Bill's primary function is to provide a legal basis enabling the ESB to engage in electronic communications networks and services such as the provision of improved broadband services.  High-speed, high-quality and reliable broadband has become a critical component of modern society and the use of the ESB network to provide broadband will help with the roll-out.</p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and the speed of the national broadband infrastructure.  Ireland's telecommunications market, which was liberalised in 1999, has developed into a well-regulated market supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The State is not a service provider in this market and can only intervene in cases of demonstrated market failure.  A combination of private investment and State intervention, including the national broadband scheme and the rural broadband scheme, means that Ireland has met the European Commission digital agenda target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by the 2013 deadline.  The focus must turn to accelerating the roll-out of high speed broadband.</p><p>  The Bill, hopefully, will enable the use of ESB's infrastructure to speed up the roll-out of broadband across the country under the national broadband plan.  The plan was published in August 2012 and commits to the delivery of high-speed broadband throughout the country.  This commitment is to be achieved by ensuring the environment is right to maximise investment by the commercial sector and through State-led investment in those areas where it is evident that the market will not deliver.  The plan also specifically commits to the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high-speed broadband infrastructure and services and recognises the role commercial semi-state companies can perform in accelerating the roll-out of such infrastructure.  It is essential, therefore, that the plan be fully implemented by 2015 as planned, and I intend to monitor this closely to help ensure full delivery for the Longford-Westmeath area, where broadband service is extremely patchy currently.  The Ceann Comhairle is smiling, because he has had experience of this.</p><p>  Ireland's small and dispersed population makes the provision of competitively priced broadband more challenging.  This can be helped by timely implementation of the national broadband plan and prioritising the removal of barriers to enable private sector investment and parallel State intervention by the Department.  While UPC has invested significantly in upgrading its cable networks in the main urban centres, businesses, particularly SMEs, in a large number of medium-sized towns do not have access to competitively priced advanced broadband services, and this is affecting the provision of badly needed jobs, particularly in the midlands and the west.</p><p>  Children and adults in rural areas who do not have access to a high-quality broadband service are currently disadvantaged and will become even more disadvantaged as all of our educational provision is slowly moving onto a digital platform.  The future prosperity of economic and social life in peripheral and rural areas depends significantly on high-speed broadband availability.  Broadband deficiencies have militated against potential investment in our peripheral and rural areas.  Almost 90% of the EU is covered.  Ireland is close to the bottom of an EU league table for broadband availability in schools, as we rank 20th out of 27 member states.  Local rural communities will die as young people are leaving broadband deserts.  The lack of modern services and broadband roll-out is leading to rural depopulation, with young people leaving to access urban facilities.  Young people in rural Ireland are suffering huge educational disadvantage due to the lack of broadband access.  They are experiencing difficulties doing homework and projects due to the lack of Internet availability.  More schools from the midlands participated in the Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition ten years ago than do so now because of the lack of broadband, and this issue needs to be examined.  Several schools in rural areas are making repeated applications for broadband services, to no avail.</p><p>  Young people without broadband are also disadvantaged in terms of social interaction.  They are unable to socialise with friends on websites such as Facebook, which can provide a major social outlet for those living in remote areas.  I am concerned that there will be a two-tiered society in the context of broadband access.</p><p>Ireland's widely dispersed population could deter some providers from supplying broadband in rural Ireland and fears have been expressed that rural Ireland could be left behind.  Under this Bill, the involvement of ESB will bring about the upgrade of broadband services in rural areas.  The national broadband plan for Ireland should facilitate the provision of high speed broadband to every home and business in the State, no matter how remote, but according to the chief executive of BT Ireland, the construction of a national rural broadband network faces intractable difficulties.  He stated: "from a network point of view, the Irish rural housing stock is a nightmare...You might have a [broadband] cabinet that services 30 homes and some of those homes could be up to 6 km from the cabinet.  But once you get 2 km from a cabinet, it becomes very hard to deliver high-speed broadband."  I ask the Minister how he intends to tackle this issue.</p><p> There is potential for increased competition in the electronic communications networks and services market.  Vodafone and BT Ireland are seeking to partner ESB in building a &euro;400 million super fast fibre network.  A more competitive market will increase consumer choice and reduce prices.  A significant development has been the entry of Sky to the Irish retail broadband market with very competitive retail offers.  We are on the cusp of a new digital era where we are strategically placed from a geographic, infrastructure and knowledge perspective to herald the dawn of the next phase of Ireland's economic growth.  It is important that we receive a consistent and competitive electricity supply, along with technological connectivity.  I welcome this Bill, which will speed up the provision of broadband in rural areas by allowing ESB to use its existing infrastructure.</p><p> I wrote to the Minister on several occasions regarding the dreadful situation in the midlands in regard to broadband access.  I do not want to be personal but my own home is not serviced by any form of broadband.  I have to travel 16 miles to my office to access broadband.  I fully understand the plight of small businesses in the midlands but I am confident this Bill will help them.</p></speech>

We should not underestimate the importance of broadband to the future development of this country.  It is probably as important to us now as the Shannon scheme was to rural electrification between the late 1920s and the 1950s.  It is a pity the Bill has not received the amount of media coverage it deserved.  As previous speakers have noted, rural areas are at a significant competitive disadvantage when it comes to the delivery of services and carrying out commercial activities.  This is the case even when it comes to basic levels of online services, such as those provided by the Government, or educational facilities.</p><p>  The Bill will help by allowing ESB to use existing national infrastructure.  It is relevant to speak about national infrastructure because the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, would not be introducing this Bill were it not for the botched sale of Eircom by a previous Government, whereby everything from the service to the infrastructure was disposed of.  Had we retained the infrastructure in State ownership we probably would not need this legislation.  We are, however, lucky that the infrastructure of poles, lattices and pylons, even if the latter is a dirty word at present, in every parish, electoral division and townland that can remediate the damage done by the botched sale of Eircom.</p><p>  Most of the people I represent live in rural parts of County Limerick.  My constituency has a network of small towns and villages but there are now urban centres of the 20,000 or 30,000 people scale.  The population base I serve is dispersed and topographical features such as hills, mountains and castles can interfere with wireless signals.  This puts businesses, schools and private individuals at a disadvantage.  However, outside everyone's door there is an ESB pole which can potentially carry a fibre-optic cable.  Whether one lives in Ballsbridge or Ballingarry one should be able to access the same level of service.  A new utility, Irish Water, has recently been established.  The Bill before us should not apply solely to the ESB.  Every company or body involved in laying infrastructure, be it Bord G&aacute;is, Irish Water, the National Roads Authority or Irish Rail, should be encouraged to develop joint ventures that take advantage of existing infrastructure to roll out broadband.  This would also increase competition. </p><p>  The benefits of broadband access are obvious.  Certain primary schools in my area have difficulty accessing basic broadband speeds for use with interactive white boards.  Last Monday I had  a discussion in Limerick Institute of Technology with a company that uses new technology in a games based environment to teach basic principles of maths and science to students at primary level and junior certificate level.  The new junior certificate will make the child an active agent in his or her own education.  What better way to be an active agent than to have access to high speed and reliable broadband?  I refer to the broadband service that is currently available in many parts of the country as &quot;bogband&quot; because of its slowness and unreliability.  We can expand children's horizons by allowing them to interact with children in schools in Ireland and around the world so that they can draw on the experience of other teachers and schools.  If one can access high speed broadband in Ayer's Rock, in the middle of Australia, why is it not available in rural parts of Ireland?</p><p>  I note that the Fianna F&aacute;il benches are empty.  Deputies from that party have been critical of the speed with which this issue is being addressed.  The Minister's focus has been on clearing up other messes but the delivery of a service that is currently unavailable to many communities will be a legacy project for this Government.  </p><p> There are other big benefits that can be gained.  One of the issues of concern to me, as someone who comes from a rural area, is that of rural isolation.  In the recent past there have been questions asked about, for example, alarm systems for those living on their own.  A high speed quality broadband system that allows safe access and is reliable will provide the infrastructure for those living on their own to be protected, including man-down alarms, closed circuit television systems or basic communication methods.  Recently I met a woman in her 70s who informed me that she had received an iPad from her daughter who was living in Australia and that she now used FaceTime.  That is the type of technology that is of importance to such persons.  They might not have people calling as frequently as they did because we are living faster lives and do not have the time we used to have years ago to spend with our neighbours, but if they at least had this infrastructure on which they could rely, it would provide a safety net for many of those who feel isolated.</p><p> Retail businesses all over the country are finding it difficult owing to the collapse of the economy.  Access to a quality broadband system would also enhance their capability to carry on business online that they might not necessarily have done to the degree it can be done in other countries.  The Irish retail sector is lagging behind that in other European countries when it comes to online business and e-commerce.  There is an opportunity for the Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and John Perry, and their Department to encourage such companies to engage in more retail activity online with a view to reaching out to those who cannot be reached at present.</p><p> I had the great pleasure of visiting Ardnacrusha to mark the 75th anniversary of the River Shannon scheme, on which my grandfather had worked.  I was delighted to meet the former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, whose father, Mr. W. T. Cosgrave, had laid the scheme's foundation stone.  This shows how far we have come in the building of infrastructure.  At the time it was said they did not need this and that they were &quot;happy out&quot;, but technology has evolved.  The one critical point that has been proved since the 1920s concerns the importance of the ESB in the provision of national infrastructure.  The use of that infrastructure in the future cannot be underestimated, which is why I believe that in any change in governance of the ESB it must be clear and categorical that the infrastructure is sacrosanct and must be maintained for posterity in State hands.  We see in this Bill the potential of that infrastructure to do more than merely switch on a light.  As a stated, in the future high speed quality broadband will be every bit as important as water and electricity in how we go about our daily lives.  This is a simple but empowering Bill.  In some ways it is probably reflective of the yardbrush mentality that we as a Government have where we have to sweep up what has been left behind following the botched sale of eircom.  However, it is being done, and at a time it will be welcomed.  From my point of view, as someone who represents a constituency that has been put at a major disadvantage in terms of infrastructure, I welcome it.</p><p> I will make one final comment.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who is not in the House spoke about his commitment to the provision of broadband, which I do not for one minute deny.  In fact, at a meeting of a group once upon a time in the Devon Inn Hotel in Templeglantine, County Limerick when I was a member of Limerick County Council and he was Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs he bemoaned the fact that there was not a broadband scheme in west Limerick, from where I come.  At the time I challenged him, asking him if it had anything to do with the fact that the Government had sold off eircom and the infrastructure, but I did not recevie an answer.  Perhaps he might like to revisit that issue and indicate why that sell-off has left the people at such a disadvantage which we are trying to remediate.</p><p> This is good legislation which is badly needed.  In terms of the needs of education, business and members of the community who are trying to go about their daily lives, it will be welcomed.</p><p> I would like to make one final point.</p></speech>

Ireland has been far behind in the provision of broadband services compared to other European countries, a fault that can be traced back, as has been referred to by previous speakers, to the privatisation of eircom in the late 1990s.  Since that time, Ireland has being playing catch-up with our European neighbours in providing broadband services for all citizens.</p><p>  It is welcome that the ESB is entering the telecommunications market, which can only be seen as a positive step.  The ESB has a wide number of skilled staff who have developed a trusted relationship with households over many years since the formation of the company in the 1920s.  It is a valuable State asset in terms of the Government's coffers and I hope its extension into the telecommunications market will ward off any thought of privatisation the Government might have.</p><p>  Broadband is extremely important in developing an indigenous economy that is vibrant and competitive.  It has enabled innovation and growth.  It is estimated that the Internet contributes up to 6% of GDP in advanced economies and generates significant employment growth.  Through online activity, the potential for participation in global trade is largely unlimited by location.  Access to quality broadband can make distance much less relevant and be a catalyst in dispersing economic activity.  The small and medium-sized enterprise sector is particularly important, accounting for 72% of manufacturing and services employment in Ireland.  However, poor upload speeds have prohibited the use of video-conferencing, which is a particularly useful tool for businesses located on different sites and can significantly reduce business travel costs, especially for those located in more isolated areas.</p><p>  In the national interest, growth in all regions should be optimised.  To do this, all regions need to have a strong infrastructural base enabling them to compete, as well as to attract and retain investment and jobs.  Arising from the liberalisation of the telecommunications market, private investment has been driving the roll-out of broadband infrastructure and services, nationally and internationally.  Just like other types of infrastructure provision, population density is a determinant of the cost of delivery and potential returns.  In County Kerry, for example, there is poor or even no broadband coverage in the more sparsely populated areas.  While there is broadband in my area, it is very slow and does not enhance the prospects of small indigenous industries of being able to compete from there.  County Kerry has often been the last to benefit from the provision of Government infrastructure, with those living in the Black Valley only receiving the benefits of electrification in the 1970s.  The campaign for proper broadband access is the same as that fought 40 years ago by those who campaigned for running water and electricity.  It seems to be a long time ago, but when one looks back, it is recent.  With many services being rolled back in rural areas, including banking, post offices and Garda facilities, it is becoming increasingly important for households to have access to adequate broadband services.  Unfortunately, it is also the case that parents need a functioning broadband connection when trying to communicate with their children who have emigrated to Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, never more so than in the past five, six or seven years when many young people, particularly from more isolated areas, left their homes to work very far away.  The most effective and, probably, intimate way people can keep in touch with each other is through a good broadband service.</p><p>  County Kerry is one of the main tourism spots in the country.  Broadband is now a staple that any visiting guest expects when he or she books into bed and breakfast accommodation or a hotel.  What message does it send to visitors to the country if broadband does not come as standard?  The Bill is a step in the right direction.</p><p>Semi-State companies investing in broadband access is a positive move and, hopefully, this will help correct the mistake of selling off Telecom &Eacute;ireann and other mistakes of the past.  </p><p> We in Sinn F&eacute;in will support this legislation.</p></speech>

Therefore, the thrust of this legislation, which provides expressly for ESB laying fibre-optic cable alongside power lines which crisscross our country, is a very practical step to provide the geographical reach of broadband to these rural areas, and I compliment the Minister on it.</p><p>  The recent announcement in my home county by Emerald Networks, a private company, that it intends to proceed with its plans to develop a high-speed and high-capacity, fibre-optic transatlantic cable called the &quot;Emerald Express&quot; between the United States and Ireland and, ultimately, on to the United Kingdom, and that it has confirmed its preferred landfall site as Killala, has generated a great deal of excitement, as the Minister can imagine.  This is a project I have supported since it was mooted in 2011.  </p><p>  This is a massive opportunity for Mayo and for our country.  It will facilitate the provision of state-of-the-art, high-speed broadband infrastructure and connectivity for Mayo and will open the county up to attract investment and to develop industry and jobs based on the information and communications technology sector, which has been identified as one of the main pillars for current and future growth in our economy and has proven to be so with job announcements nationally on a regular basis.</p><p>  To operate and compete in the global village the world has become, communications infrastructure such as this is critical.  While it is imperative at this point that the company sets out its plan for the route of the fibre-optic cable when it hits land and how the communities it will pass through will be affected and benefit, it is equally imperative that the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the county council, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, under the auspices of the Action Plan for Jobs, together with private broadband service providers such as Eircom, BT, Vodafone, O2 and others, put in place plans to maximise the benefit to as much of the county as possible and in particular towns such as Killala, Ballina and Crossmolina, which immediately adjoin the landfall site, and Belmullet where it was originally thought the cable might land.  We already have fibre-optic cable in the ground in parts of the county, which was laid along much of the gas pipeline and we have metropolitan area networks in towns such as Ballina and Kiltimagh, which can be connected to the transatlantic fibre-optic cable.</p><p>  I note the Government has recently obtained the consent of the EU Commission for the use of existing publicly-funded, fibre-optic cable for such a project.  These are exciting possibilities especially in the old Asahi brownfield site in Killala in the realm of cloud computing and data centres where it is also proposed to develop also a biomass - combined heat and power - power plant.</p><p>  In a nutshell, in light of the announcement by Emerald Networks that it would develop this transatlantic cable, I ask that we immediately examine where this cable will go once it hits land, how the benefit can be maximised for the towns surrounding it - Killala, Ballina, Crossmolina and further afield - how it can be part of a solution to improve connectivity for the county and part of the realisation of the Minister's plan, namely, that there would be high-speed broadband connectivity and infrastructure throughout the country under the national broadband plan.  I ask that the Minister work with Mayo County Council and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, under the Action Plan for Jobs, and commercial broadband service providers to map out how we might achieve this connectivity and use some of the existing fibre, which can complement what is provided in this legislation, which would see the ESB putting in place fibre-optic cable along distribution power lines.  This is part of that formula and it is something to which we need to address our minds for the maximum benefit for County Mayo and for the country.</p></speech>

In essence, it will allow the ESB to install and operate electronic communication networks and services.  This is quite an easily understood concept.  If it is effective, it will lead, in part, to Ireland finally achieving a modern fit-for-purpose future-proofed broadband infrastructure, something to which we have only aspired in the past.  This is a very fast moving area.  Therefore, the Bill is certainly very welcome.</p><p>  The ESB has the infrastructure, a skilled workforce and, equally important, the organisational structures to deliver on this concept.  ESB Networks also has an excellent history of communicating properly with the relevant stakeholders.  I note it has a prominent position every year at the ploughing championships and it puts significant people and resources in there to discuss with landowners any issues that may have arisen.  Over the years it has built a very trusted position, and that is a welcome development.  I have dealt with it over many years and I have found its approach to be second to none.  There is a willingness to engage, identify the areas of concern and deal with them.  I wish I could say the same for EirGrid but we will monitor it and hope that it will prove as capable of following the manner in which ESB has communicated.</p><p>  Due to the fact that the ESB has physical connections to virtually all homes and businesses in the State, the opportunities here are vast.  One of the aims should be to get as many fibre connections to homes as possible.  The Minister mentioned that the ESB had identified this opportunity to use its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services to the Irish market.  The challenge for us in government is not to wait for others to identify possibilities but to identify novel areas of potential ourselves.  The challenge to all of us is to examine what can we offer in this area.  We need to take a fresh look at all State assets and to critically assess them in a holistic manner.  This needs to be broken down in a number of subsections, namely, what is the social benefit these assets could deliver and what are the entrepreneurial possibilities with regard to how can we encourage businesses, both small and large, and, ultimately, how can we provide new jobs.  </p><p>  This legislation will allow the encouragement of joint ventures, pooling our resources and seeing how can we create something novel where nothing else existed beforehand.  These are all challenges but we are up to them.  We have a well educated workforce.  It is testimony to our excellent education system that in the course of only two generations has delivered people from primary education to fourth level - it is a staggering transition.  The best thing one can deliver to one's children is a good education and this country has allowed us to do that.  I look forward to more open discussion on how we can maximise and use the possibilities of our State assets.</p><p>  This Bill fits perfectly with the national broadband plan, which was published in 2012 following on from the next generation broadband taskforce report in 2011, and this report identified five main areas, some of which include target speeds, spectrum and the role of State assets.  We can see the development from those thought processes into legislation, which is very welcome.  We also need to reflect on the reason we have lost ground with regard to our broadband infrastructure.  Why did that happen?  As many Deputies have mentioned, this all goes back to 1999 when Eircom plc was floated on the Irish Stock Exchange, in London and in New York. </p><p>A lot of first-time investors were encouraged by the Government to buy shares.  It was a classic stock market bubble where many first-time investors like myself lost out.  Unfortunately, it was not just a private loss.  Since privatisation in 1999, the company was loaded with debt and asset-stripped.  It was quite a shocking situation and another malaise like many others in the country.  Since coming into government, we seem to be rolling back layer after layer and tidying up a mess.  People realise what we are doing and the fact we are doing it in a methodical fashion.</p><p> The necessary investment to deliver proper broadband services never materialised.  Ireland lost out, especially rural Ireland.  I have regular calls from constituents frustrated by the lack of service.  There is nothing more annoying than a connection freezing.  One wonders sometimes if one should continue at all.  The Minister fully realises that it is hindering the development of many SMEs and their potential for online sales, which could deliver many jobs.</p><p> The ESB has suggested it will deliver a 100% fibre network and that it will connect directly to 500,000 homes offering speeds in excess of 150 Mbps.  These are guaranteed upload and download speeds because it is a fibre network.  These upload and download speeds are, if Members will pardon the pun, light years away from the current speeds, which are sometimes lower than 2 Mbps.  Being in business, it is frustrating to pay for 7 Mbps and find, after speed checking, that one gets a fraction of this.  There are no winners.  The Government, through its Action Plan for Jobs, is providing many support to SMEs, including promoting Internet sales and businesses growth and infrastructure development, but this will really help.  The area is developing at such a phenomenal rate that what we regard as standard today will be completely different in a few years.  Over Christmas, I saw one of the old Star Trek movies in which the characters were talking on little phones.  That was futuristic back then.  Where will we be in another 30 years?</p><p> We must be flexible.  Due to our climate, we have huge opportunities in the development of data centres.  For a small, open economy such as ours, infrastructure such as this is as essential as water and electricity.  The legislation will allow our highly educated workforce to blossom.  We have a cluster of people who can display their talents to the world as they have not have the opportunity before.  This will increase rural employment, lessen travel and bring about better lifestyles.  It will help to regenerate rural communities because it allows people to live close to where they work.  In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  It is a sensible measure and I look forward to seeing its benefits over the coming months and years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300026#Y00200"><p>I propose to share time with Deputies Frank Feighan and Anthony Lawlor.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister in the House.  Prior to the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann, as it was, it was no secret that we had the cutting-edge technology of the day.  It was the leading information technology network in Europe.  If the network had been allowed to make remain in public ownership, we would not be debating this Bill today.</p><p>  It is strange, yet inevitable, that we are depending on an electricity network to help us deliver an information technology infrastructure, particularly to the more rural and peripheral areas.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister to provide legislation to allow the ESB to look at partnerships and joint ventures to provide access to its network to companies that will provide, ultimately, broadband through fibre to the home.  It is a lot to ask and a massive potential investment but the investment must be examined as a long-term dividend for many parts of the country.  The information technology network is as critically important today as road, rail and water infrastructure was in previous times.  Its importance should never be underestimated.  Around 90% of the network, particularly the fibre network, is not challenging to deliver.  The market will ultimately deliver it.  The remaining 10% is in difficult areas and each additional 1% is infinitely more difficult to deliver than the previous 1%.  That is the challenge for the Department and the Minister.  The initiative will go a long way towards providing for it.</p><p>  Provision must be made for compensation from companies to the ESB.  It is too easy to overlook the point.  I submit that the compensation offer to the ESB should not be weighted on the capital costs alone but in respect of the number of houses, companies or units that the service provides for.  If we are going to achieve fibre connections to homes in more rural areas, it is not fair to allow compensation to the ESB of the entire capital costs where they can be offset against less challenging delivery projects in more densely populated areas.</p><p>  At the meeting of the select committee yesterday, which the Minister attended, I mentioned a successful school broadband scheme delivering 100 Mbps per second to second level schools throughout the country.  It is a major success and will have a huge results for students.  Now, it is time to take a jobs and economic focus.  Some second level schools have access to 100 Mbps per second while a small business park, industrial unit or commercial centre less than 1 kilometre from the school has a broadband service that is not fit for purpose.  The inevitable conclusion is that it will close and that businesses cannot compete.  We should change our focus.  A new scheme should look more closely at those issues, including the economic benefits of rolling out 100 Mbps per second to the areas that do not have it.</p><p>  Another issue concerns the available information on the advertised speeds companies say they can provide.  This applies particularly to the DSL network and the satellite system.  Companies offer from 1.5 Mbps up to 6 Mbps from the DSL exchange.  I live in a small town less than 1 km from the exchange and, although I am routinely told speeds of 3 Mbps are available, when I test the speed it is rarely over 300 kilobits per second.  That is okay for personal and domestic use - to look at Facebook, send e-mail and look at YouTube - but it is not acceptable to deliver jobs or drive economic activity.  It is not okay for companies to say one thing while customers are getting something entirely different.</p><p>I can see the potential to access the ESB's networks in order to provide for a fibre exchange to the home or business service, which will be critical in driving the economies of local areas.  That should not be underestimated.</p><p> In talking about providing a broadband service, particularly a rural broadband service, we must grapple with the idea of insisting on a minimum service.  We can do this on a contract basis, but I would prefer to see it being placed on a statutory basis.  This service should be at least 10 Mbps.  Perhaps there could be a public service obligation in that regard for rural areas.  If we do not give ourselves that challenge, we will be grappling with the issue of delivery of rural broadband services for the next 60 years; it will be similar to the experience of electrification in the Black Valley in County Kerry.  We would all like to avoid that scenario.</p><p> There is a good example of the challenges we face and it can be highlighted in the context of further negotiations with the ESB.  Approximately 18 months ago people, including Councillor Mary Hegarty in Bantry, approached Amazon about a very exciting initiative.  The company would provide 26 jobs in rural areas in Bantry and the peninsular areas of west Cork in a support service to what was a very successful company.  It provided training, support and equipment with the jobs, as promised.  The problem was that although the minimum 5 Mbps minimum service required was achieved at times, some people had to give up their jobs because the service was inconsistent.  That was very disappointing and it sends a very negative message when we are trying to attract jobs for the likes of architects and engineers.  The people concerned could return to their native areas if they could use a service, leading to what would almost certainly be a better quality of life.  Unfortunately, we are meeting these obstacles in trying to deliver jobs, which is very disappointing.</p><p> According to the 2011 census, in my constituency of Cork South-West there were approximately 30,000 homes, over 18,000 of which had a broadband service.  That is all we know; we do not know the quality of the service provided, the consistency of the service or the challenges being faced by these households.  It is 2014 and we could probably increase the 18,000 figure by 50%, but we still lack the knowledge and mapping information when it comes to quality and consistency of service.  That is replicated throughout the country.  In negotiations between the ESB and the Department we must get the most up-to-date information on what is happening on the ground.  Without this information, we could lose much of the initiative to be gained from the Bill.</p><p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will be familiar with the development of the Wild Atlantic Way from County Donegal to west Cork.  One of the initiatives being discussed is the development of a phone application to explain or interpret the various parts of the route.  I am sorry to say the application would be largely redundant in the pockets of most travellers as the telecommunications service would not be up to delivering it.  That is a good example of the challenge facing the Minister.</p><p> I know the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has appointed Mr. David Puttnam, a constituent of mine, as information czar for the country.  It is wonderful to see his achievements from his studio at his home in Skibbereen.  It is a global communications effort.  However, 2 km from his house it is like living in the Black Valley.  I hope the Minister will face up to these challenges and deal with them in the new contracts.  I welcome him and wish him well.</p></speech>

There will be a legal basis to ensure the distribution of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services in Ireland.  Where have we been for the past ten or 12 years, when all of these promises were made and Ministers told us Ireland would be the gateway to the European communications sector?  Unfortunately, we have had to pay through the nose for broadband services and been second to last in OECD ratings in the provision of broadband.</p><p>  More than ten years ago in my home town of Boyle we were very anxious to receive broadband or more effective telecommunications services for the town.  As other speakers have stated, the break-up of eircom certainly did not help.  We were told no broadband service was available and in order to avail of the services of another operator, we sought funding from one of the Leader companies.  Approximately ten or 12 businessmen, members of the community and politicians had to take modules twice a week for six months on how to draw down the funding.  They were both extensive and difficult.  Approximately two weeks before we were due to receive the funding, eircom announced that the broadband service exchange had been activated and would be enabled.  That was a crazy process.  When the electrification process was ongoing, the Government of the day felt private companies could not deliver the service because the private sector would pick and choose the services it would deliver, determining if there was something in it for them.  That is why the public sector must become involved.  I congratulate the Minister on his innovative thinking.  This will certainly help smaller towns and rural areas.  There are significant challenges and these areas are under severe pressure from the bigger population centres.  They need every tool in the box to compete effectively, including online services, Internet banking, retailing and other services.  Once again, the Minister is doing, instead of talking.  Unfortunately, the last Government talked for too long.</p><p>  This process is comparable to the provision of electricity.  I do not think I am that old, but I remember many times going to houses as a young man and even as a teenager and finding that some in my area did not have electricity.  Even if most had electricity, some did not have fridges.  My house did not have a fridge until I was ten or 12 years old.  That was the way it was and it is amazing how much we have moved on.  It is incredible that in September 2013 there were more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers in Ireland.  This is the way of the future and not just for businesses and entrepreneurs.  These services are for citizens who demand the best possible connections, which should not be too costly.  Unfortunately, some of the utility companies would have thought of a price and doubled it, thinking the Irish taxpayer would pay it.  We will not do this any more.  </p><p>  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this innovative Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1053" speakername="Anthony Lawlor" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300028#AA00100"><p>It is interesting to see that only Government Deputies are present and none of the Opposition Members.  It demonstrates that this is a good news story.  Whenever there is a bad news story, plenty of Opposition Members caw away on the other side of the House.  Today happens to represent a very good news story.  The strange point is that it would not have been if we had not sold off and privatised Eircom, particularly Eircom networks, a number of years ago.  The sad part is that perhaps ten or 15 years ago we could have had broadband in all rural areas throughout the country.  I welcome this initiative.  This is an exciting time.  We may bitch and complain about the ESB and ESB Networks but this is definitely a very positive and welcome story.</p><p>  Only yesterday I received a communication from an individual who was having problems with broadband.  I am from the constituency of Kildare North, which people will say is very urban.  However, there are places within my constituency where people find it extremely difficult to get broadband.  This initiative will certainly help to combat the problem.</p><p>  The Government is encouraging people to get back to work.  People like to work from home.  As highlighted by Deputy Harrington in respect of west Cork, people in rural areas, including west Kildare and along the Kildare-Wicklow border, have very poor access to broadband communications.  Commercial entities, including Eircom, mainly target areas of population where they can make a quick profit.  That the ESB is coming on board is very much welcome for those in rural areas.  It is in the business of providing a service rather than generating a profit.  Being involved with a commercial partner, it may be driven by commercialisation.  It is said the service will be rolled out in urban areas first, but it is most important that it be rolled out as much as possible in rural areas.  This is one of the pillars of the Government's broadband strategy.</p><p>  It is important that ESB Networks and its partner engage with the agricultural community.  The quicker they do so, the quicker we can get the broadband structure put in place.  I urge the Minister to encourage in any way he can the management of ESB to engage with the IFA and various farming bodies so we can put the structure in place as quickly as possible.</p><p>  It is important that the Bill be passed as quickly as possible.  When it is passed, the timescale for the rolling out of broadband by the ESB will be important.  It will be vital for industry that it be rolled out as quickly as possible.  We should encourage the ESB along these lines.</p><p>  I welcome this initiative.  It is great that we are using existing infrastructure for another purpose.  It is a pity previous Governments did not examine this idea.  I support the Bill but I am disappointed that no members of the Opposition are present to listen to a good news story today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300028#AA00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to welcome this good news story, as Deputy Lawlor called it.  I commend the Minister and ESB for acting so swiftly on this matter.  In the 15 years for which I have been a public representative, broadband provision has been the main issue, apart from the economic problems of recent years and the issues that arise continually in the health service.  As with other Members, I constantly receive communications from individuals and businesses with broadband issues.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Anthony Lawlor that emphasis should be placed on rural areas when the system is rolled out.  While displacing existing services in urban areas might be commercially advantageous, it is most important that the legislation enable the large tracts of the country that do not have any operational broadband service at present to enjoy the prospect of its becoming available.  I agree with previous speakers on the economic importance of rolling out broadband.  A great number of people work from home in rural areas.  If there were access to high-quality broadband services, more people would be able to work from home.  I have been struck by the number of people in my part of the world, south County Kilkenny, who travel to work in Dublin.  If high-quality broadband were available in their area, they would be able to work from home more often.</p><p>  There is a social aspect to be considered.  The economic difficulties of recent years have required so many to emigrate all over the world.  This affects families in every corner of the country.  Daily and weekly, they try to keep in contact with their children in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, for example.  Owing to inadequate broadband facilities, making contact is very problematic for some.  Therefore, it is not just a question of business, although business is vital if those who emigrated to far-flung places are to have something to come home to.</p><p>  I remember my first interview as a national politician, a member of the Seanad, in 2002.  I happened to be on a talk-show on a leading national station with two Seanad colleagues at the time, Senator David Norris and former Senator and Minister Mary O'Rourke.  I brought up the privatisation of Eircom.  As the current Minister will appreciate, this evoked a rather strong response from Ms O'Rourke.  I had forgotten - I was a second level student at the time of privatisation &ndash; that she was the Minister in charge of what was ultimately to be the most disastrous privatisation in the country.  There was a disastrous decision to separate the network from the telecommunications business.  The privatisation of the telecommunications network across the country led to circumstances in which much of Ireland still does not have an adequate broadband service.</p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington stated that the really important aspect of this legislation is that it promises definitive action.  The predecessor of the Minister, Mr. Eamon Ryan, launched with fanfare two or three initiatives to roll out broadband to rural areas by satellite or other means.  Mobile broadband companies entered into agreements with the Department at the time but broadband did not seem to penetrate rural areas.  The ESB network, the existing network, extends to every corner of the Twenty-six Counties.  The possibility that the ESB has unveiled - that is, that the network could be used to establish a new 21st-century telecommunications network for broadband - is to be greatly welcomed.  The Minister's speedy introduction of this legislation is to be greatly welcomed also.  I hope the ESB, with whatever commercial partner will come on board, will be in a position as soon as possible to ensure this initiative is rolled out across the country.</p><p>  Areas currently without adequate provision are of the utmost importance.  These areas are often not in the big urban centres.  Obviously, commercial issues will arise in that the partner of the ESB will be seeking maximum volume.  However, the most important aspect of this legislation is that it has the potential to ensure broadband will reach everywhere in the country.  It is important that the rural areas that do not have a proper service at present be served.  Deputy Harrington's example of the fate of the Amazon jobs on the peninsulas in Cork is a shocking indictment of the network as it currently exists across the country.</p><p>There are many people who have good ideas and who might be in a position to open their own business in their own home but cannot do so because adequate broadband facilities are not available to them.  This legislation is really welcome because it presents the definite prospect of those particularly rural communities having a decent broadband service, and for that reason I wholeheartedly welcome it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300029#BB00200"><p>It is not often in the House that a measure being introduced is so warmly welcomed by Deputies from all sides.  I thank colleagues who have contributed to this debate from all of the political parties and groupings in the House.  That measure of consensus demonstrates that there is an awareness and appreciation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the significance and capacity of broadband technology in continuing the modernisation of this country.  It is an essential tool in continuing to transform the economy and aid economic recovery.  I thank, in particular, Deputies Michael Moynihan and Michael Colreavy, the main Opposition speakers, and I am very glad that so many Deputies chose to contribute to the debate.</p><p>  The fact that there is such a broad welcome for the Bill would indicate that we will be able to see it pass through Committee Stage relatively speedily.  I hope the Chief Whip will be able to accommodate it in the schedule as soon as Members have had a reasonable opportunity to examine the Bill in more detail and to advance amendments to it should they see fit.  In that regard, I acknowledge that Deputy Moynihan indicated that he would want to table two amendments, the first relating to the installation of a complaints mechanism in the context of access to private property.  While I am not trying to deter Deputy Moynihan - nor would he be so deterred - from bringing forward any amendment that he wishes, it is important to say that it is not envisaged that intrusion on private property is going to be a major issue, or, indeed, an issue at all.  What we are talking about here is using the existing supply structure of the ESB to roll out fibre-optic broadband to different parts of the country.  In that sense, new incursions onto private lands ought not to be a major issue.  </p><p>  The second matter raised by Deputy Michael Moynihan related to ensuring that the speeds advertised by telecommunications providers generally are complied with.  In other words, when a company undertakes to provide a service at a particular speed, it should be obliged to do so.  We can tease that issue out further on Committee Stage but my initial reaction would be that it might be inhibitive to seek to enshrine that in primary legislation.  It might cause difficulties because there are, as some speakers have adduced, particular reasons that promised speeds in different circumstances cannot always be achieved, for reasons of contention ratios, among other things.  At the same time, I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  </p><p>  It is clearly the case that many Deputies in the House appreciate the significance of this legislation in terms of meeting a need in rural Ireland.  A great many Deputies have criticised the existing service in parts of rural Ireland.  However, it is important to note that Ireland has met the target set by the Digital Agenda for Europe in terms of providing a basic broadband service to all citizens by 2013.  While I accept that basic can mean very basic in some circumstances, I would argue that there are two facts that are inescapable in this context and once we accept that, we should move on.  One is the fact that the we suffered a decade of lost investment following on from the manner of privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  As a result of what happened subsequent to that privatisation, investment that might have taken place at a critical stage did not take place.  The second fact is that there are parts of the country that constitute a considerable challenge in terms of connectivity of any speed.  I take the points that Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who has the good fortune to live in a village like Moycullen, made but they are not true of his Galway West constituency generally.  Undoubtedly, there are pockets in the Galway West constituency where, for topographical and other reasons, the problems highlighted by Deputy Kyne are real.  I am very conscious of that fact.  Several other Deputies referred to similar problems in their constituencies, including Deputies Michael Healy-Rae, James Bannon and others.  These are not problems that are unique to Ireland, however.  One must accept that we are where we are, in the clich&eacute; of the day.  What happened in the case of the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann has happened and is behind us now.  Other countries with similar population dispersal patterns to ours are encountering precisely the same difficulties.  The targets fixed in the Digital Agenda for Europe for 2013 in terms of a basic broadband service to all have been met here.  </p><p>  We are taking this exciting initiative to improve connectivity in rural Ireland because the Government, from day one, has acknowledged that there are parts of provincial Ireland where the service is not nearly as good as what is required today.  I was very struck by the contribution of Deputy Heather Humphreys, who made the point in passing that immediately across the Border from her home there was, in County Tyrone, an excellent broadband service.  She argued that if the issue was not addressed in terms of the topography of the stony grey soil of Monaghan, businesses would relocate out of Monaghan to Northern Ireland.  The approach taken by the Northern Ireland authorities back in the day in terms of the job done there by BT was entirely different from the one taken down here.</p><p>There is no doubt that at the time the job done by BT for Northern Ireland was superior.  A lot of the investment in this country, however much criticised, was necessary at the time.  It has provided a service in parts of the country where there would not otherwise have been a service.</p><p> The investment in the metropolitan area networks, MANs, has been justified as they have come into their own.  When I came to the job less than half of the MANs were lit and now only three or four remain to be lit.  From memory, there is a total of 88 MANs and of those, 83 or 84 are functioning.  Without the access provided by the MANs, major industry in Wexford town, for example, would not have been able to function.</p><p> I accept that the national broadband service has not worked perfectly everywhere but it has provided a basic service in parts of the country that would otherwise have been deprived.  Many Deputies, including Deputy John Browne, raised the significance of the scheme in rural areas.  I acknowledge the thoughtful and comprehensive contribution by Deputy Denis Naughten who gave us his vision of a connected society and what it might do for rural isolation.  He adduced the figures for living alone in such counties as Roscommon, Cavan, Mayo and Kerry.  He set out the capacity of the technology to deliver services that could transform the lives of the way people live now.  I agree largely with the analysis he advanced but I disagree with his conclusion that we should hand over in its entirety to the ESB the task of meeting the challenge in rural Ireland based on an initiative such as this and that we should build out extra infrastructure, as he put it, to accommodate that.  We live in a market economy and we are governed by certain rules that are supervised by the European Union.  It would not be possible to do what he and some other colleagues in the House suggested.  One cannot intrude in that fashion into the marketplace in an exclusive way.  This is a wholesale, open access initiative that will be a significant additional player in the market.  It will provide more competition but European rules would apply in terms of the solution with which Deputy Denis Naughten concluded his submission.  It is important to say this.</p><p> The target of half a million homes is a significant one in the context of the number of homes in Ireland.  Between commercial investment and State intervention we have pretty much full coverage of a basic broadband service at this stage.  What we are doing in the Bill will significantly improve that.  What we are doing must also be seen in the context of the national broadband plan.  The plan, in its analysis, has concluded and acknowledges that the commercial sector is providing a service comparable to anything in any other urban conurbation in Europe.  Urban Ireland, by and large, has a service that competes with the best.  There is no gainsaying that.  The problem relates to the more thinly populated parts of the country.  In the national broadband plan it is acknowledged that the situation can only be tackled through State intervention.  It is that process in which we are engaged, because if there is to be State intervention there must be European clearance.  We must get clearance in respect, for example, of State aid and we are in the middle of a detailed mapping exercise, the purpose of which is to secure European approval to get on with the implementation of the national broadband plan.</p><p> I compliment the private operators in terms of the ongoing investment programmes they are following.  That is making a huge contribution to improving the situation obtaining in Ireland now.  Notwithstanding the rocky times that it recently endured, eircom has maintained a significant investment programme and continues to do that.</p><p> In terms of my replying in particular to the points raised by Deputies who used certain data, I would find it very difficult to do that because nobody gave me references or the particular reports to which they referred and I would need to have such information in front of me.</p><p> The international study which is published quarterly by Akami, acknowledged by the telecommunications sector as a leading service provider, measures connection speeds in real time.  Its report for the quarter up to June 2013 ranks Ireland 16th globally and 10th highest within the European, Middle East and Africa region for average connected speeds at an average of 8 Mbps.  That is marginally behind countries such as the United Kingdom, which has an average speed of 8.4 Mbps and is ahead of Germany, which is ranked 22nd, and Spain, France and Portugal which are ranked 35th, 37th, and 40th, respectively, in the global comparison.  I ask Deputies to reflect on the very considerable progress that has been made in recent years in terms of both coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure.  A combination of private investment and State intervention, including the national broadband scheme, means that Ireland has met the European Commission digital agenda target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by the 2013 deadline.</p><p> I accept there is universal agreement that the focus must now turn to accelerating the roll-out of high speed broadband.  I am pleased to advise the House that since the publication of the Government's national broadband plan there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which it originally committed.  In that regard, eircom<b></b>has extended its plans for the roll-out of high speed services with speeds of up to 100 Mbps to be delivered to 1.4 million homes.  UPC<b></b>has also increased its minimum and top speed products to 120 Mbps and 200 Mbps respectively.  Additionally, mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings with Meteor and Vodafone<b></b>having launched 4G mobile broadband services.  Vodafone is also upgrading its 3G services to provide nationwide 3G coverage.  Just this week, 3 Ireland<b></b>also announced its plans for imminent 4G roll-out.  Other operators continue to invest and Sky has entered the broadband market, offering services over the eircom network.</p><p> When one adds the investment in the MANs, the ongoing investment in high speed broadband in second level schools, the money put into the national broadband scheme, as well as the very firm commitment of the current Government to again intervene to ensure high quality broadband services are available to anyone who wishes to avail of it, irrespective of location, it is fair to say the picture is not lacking in positivity.</p><p>In an effort to address the unacceptable digital divide between rural and urban areas, my Department is engaged in intensive technical, financial and preparatory work to define the scope of the State-led investment which will facilitate the widespread availability of reliable and guaranteed high speed broadband.  In parallel, a comprehensive mapping exercise of current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is advancing.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services in the coming years and, consequently, the precise areas that will need to be targeted by the State-led investment.</p><p> I accept the view expressed by several colleagues that we are, to a large extent, playing catch-up.  I have dealt with that issue in the context of the experience of my friend, former Deputy, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s tour of Moore Street selling Telecom &Eacute;ireann shares one time.  That is now history.</p><p> Several Deputies asked about timelines and were of the opinion that the Bill was more of a futuristic plan.  That is not the case.  I would be disappointed if the ESB were not in a position within the next month to announce which telco partner had been selected from the invitations for expressions of interest process.  Immediately thereafter the work envisaged by the Bill will get under way.  It is not futuristic but an immediate, practical and exciting initiative.</p><p> I accept the points made by several colleagues on rural isolation and the capacity of this technology to help to combat it.  </p><p> Deputy Michelle Mulherin raised the question of international connectivity and the role of Emerald Atlantis Limited.  The Government is anxious that this project to develop a high speed and high capacity  fibre-optic transatlantic cable, the Emerald Express, between the United States and Ireland commence.  Where the cable might emerge from the Atlantic in County Mayo is of secondary importance.  The Government will facilitate this project in any way it can.</p><p> Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s contribution ought to be studied by newer Members.  The tenor of it was immensely constructive and I do not disagree with much of his vision.  The sting is in the tail, however, when he told me to get on with rolling out fibre to every home in the country, as that is a tall order for reasons of cost and so forth which people will understand.  The Deputy admitted himself that, even after 14 years in government, he had not managed to achieve it either.  We will give it a go and see how far we get.</p><p> Deputy Anne Ferris made a contribution about EirGrid which had nothing to do with the Bill.  One has to say fair play to her if the Chair let her get away with it.  I have done it myself in the past with varying degrees of success.  I do not know the source of the statistics she used and other arguments she made.  They are not in my possession.  I reassure her there is no question of the ESB relying on extra transmission build-out to deliver this project.  It is not being delivered on the transmission system but through the supply infrastructure.</p><p> I agree with Deputy John Browne on the capacity of this initiative to deal with the problem of broadband provision prevalent in rural areas.  He was one of the Deputies who queried why the ESB did not go it alone.  I have explained this in the context of the market restrictions on us.  He requested that we be sensitive in the matter of wayleaves.  This matter is constrained in the Bill and ought not to be a problem.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly that the issue at stake, fundamentally, is about job creation.  Quality connectivity offers parts of regional Ireland the capacity to develop employment and retain people in the regions in opportunities unheard of before.</p><p> I am sure I have omitted to respond to some colleagues who raised other points.  We have a record of them all, however, and there has been a high measure of consensus and agreement.  We will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease through all provisions.</p><p> Deputy James Bannon raised concerns about broadband access for schools in Longford-Westmeath.  I know there are pockets that are difficult to access, but this does not apply to second level schools.  Every second level school in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency has been equipped with broadband of at least 100 Mb/s, which is almost industrial strength.  In the arrangement agreed with the Minister for Education and Skills, my Department will continue to bear the running costs of this measure for 12 months and, thereafter, the Department of Education and Skills will take over responsibility for them.  I am only mentioning this because the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is beside me.</p><p> I do not want to be dragged into the latter part of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae&rsquo;s speech about the Shannon LNG project.  It is a separate issue, but I assure him it is the Government&rsquo;s wish that the LNG project contemplated for Tarbert would proceed.  It would be an additional string in our bow in terms of energy security while providing badly needed employment in north Kerry.  I am subject to the European regulatory framework in this regard.  It was the company, not me, which took the matter to the High Court.  There is a High Court judgment that explains why the regulatory framework operates as it does in the interests of consumers and pricing.  Having said that, I am more than willing, as I have said before, to be of assistance to the company if, after 31 January, it decides it will not appeal the judgment, in continuing this project.</p><p> When Deputy Finian McGrath says they speak of little else on the streets of Marino, Raheny and Clontarf than this Bill, I am in no position to contradict him and I am glad to hear it.  I join him and various colleagues who paid tribute to the work done by ESB workers during the difficult weather conditions over the Christmas holiday period and in acknowledging the contribution of other groups of emergency workers such as eircom and other workers.  It was good to hear such praise from some Deputies for these workers because some Members have joined others in very unfair criticism of workers employed by Bord G&aacute;is, for example, and Irish Water, talking about a bonus culture and other nonsense.  There is no bonus culture in Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water.  In fact, the contrary applies.</p><p>In 2012 an agreement was entered into by management and unions in Bord G&aacute;is that brought in a pay freeze until 2016, abolished increments, terminated allowances and other plus payments, shut down the defined benefits pension scheme, opened a defined contribution scheme for new employees, installed a performance-related element in respect of employees' basic pay, as well as doing other things.  It is little wonder that workers are appalled at some of the commentary they have attracted recently about the bonus culture in these companies.  There is no bonus culture in it and like the ESB and eircom workers, they have made an important contribution in recent times.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300032#EE00900"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  Since taking office, the Government has consistently shown it is committed to the rehabilitation and stabilisation of the public finances and the recovery of economic sovereignty.  All Members are aware of the enormous impact of the difficult decisions the Government has been forced to take due to the parlous state of the public finances that it inherited.  These actions were necessary for the very survival of the State and these decisive actions have been used by the Government to stabilise the deficit.  Moreover, Ireland was able to exit successfully the troika bailout last December because of those decisions.</p><p>  No public servant has been immune.  The Members of this House themselves have seen large and necessary reductions in their pay and other supports necessary for the democratic machinery of this country.  In line with this reform agenda and as stated in the programme for Government, there also is a clear need for change in our political system and for those in authority to lead by example.  The Government has done so.  Significant reductions have been effected to the pay and allowances of Members of the Oireachtas through a number of measures since 2009, most recently through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, which came into effect on 1 July last year.  The Government has imposed a policy of strong pay reduction and restraint since taking office in March 2011, with the pay of all members of the Government voluntarily reduced from its first day in office.  The cumulative effect of the reductions applied is that, in a point that often goes unnoticed or at least without comment, the net annual salary of the Taoiseach, that is, the salary following the implementation of the various Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Acts, has been reduced by more than 40% in the period since 2009 and that of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers by more than 35% in the same period.  The pay cuts that have been applied will of course follow through into a reduction in the pensions that will be payable to each of them when their time comes to claim such pensions.</p><p>  As every Member present will be aware, the system of allowances paid to Members of these Houses was substantially overhauled by the Government in 2011 on taking office.  The rates of allowances payable to specified positions in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, to Chairmen of Oireachtas committees and to commission members all have been reduced.  In addition, the number of committees has been reduced.  The estimated current cost of these allowances is now less than &euro;300,000, compared with a cost in 2008 of &euro;1.436 million, which is a reduction of nearly 80%.  The new Oireachtas expense allowance system began on 1 March 2010, replacing 40 years of legislation with a single parliamentary allowance system to cover the parliamentary and representation costs of Deputies, Senators and Ministers.  This major reform was in addition to the reductions imposed on Oireachtas Members' expenses in 2009.  It was not, however, transparent enough and I changed the system further from 1 January 2013.  I reduced the travel and accommodation allowance by an average of 10%, with a higher cut of 25% for Dublin-based Members.  The expenses paid under the public representation allowance are now vouched, in a reform long overdue, and the limit reduced by an average of 20%.  The secretarial allowance scheme also was amended to require evidence of all expenditure.  In overall terms, the most recent changes I introduced will save about 11% or approximately &euro;1 million per annum on the overall cost of expenses.</p><p>  This Bill is an important further step in the reform of the supports provided to the parliamentary leaders of qualifying political parties and to Members of the Oireachtas who were elected as independents.  The Government is determined to ensure greater transparency and accountability is associated with political funding, as the people should be able to see that the money they provide is used in an effective and proper fashion.  With this in mind, this Bill also delivers on the Government's commitment to abolish severance payments to certain ministerial and parliamentary offices.  Current and future holders of such offices, including all the members of the current Government, no longer will receive severance payments at the end of their term of office.</p><p>  A key objective of the Government is to rebuild public trust in the State through a comprehensive programme of political and legislative reforms.  It has been pursuing a wide range of reforms aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government, underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to help rebuild trust in government and the institutions of the State.  Many of the commitments in the area of political reform set out in the programme for Government and in the public service reform plan published in 2010 are now in delivery phase and real progress has been and continues to be made.  This ambitious programme of reform consists of a number of significant legislative initiatives which, taken together, comprise a suite of openness, transparency, accountability and public governance measures that I believe will strengthen good government across the system.  This is being delivered on several different fronts, including, as Members will recall, the extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and powers through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  This legislation came into effect last October, resulting in the most significant expansion in the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman in the 30 years since the original legislation created the office.  As for provision of a detailed legislative framework for parliamentary inquiries, Deputies will recall the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act was enacted in July and commenced on 25 September 2013.  This legislation enables a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework as determined by the people.  In respect of the regulation of lobbying, Deputies again will recall the general scheme of the regulation of lobbying Bill 2013 was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and its report recently has been received by my Department.  The drafting of the Bill has commenced and the views of the aforementioned joint committee will feed into this drafting process.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in the first quarter of this and hopefully will be enacted in its second quarter.</p><p>  There will be extensive reform of the freedom of information, FOI, legislation, through proposals that currently are before the House, thereby consolidating and modernising it to improve the functions of the Act and to improve the structure of the legislative framework around freedom of information.  In tandem with the drafting of the FOI Bill, work is well advanced in developing what I consider to be really important, namely, a code of practice to support the implementation of the new Bill once enacted.  On the introduction of legislation protecting whistleblowers, the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, which passed all Stages in the Seanad last November, will be introduced into the D&aacute;il in early February.  I believe the Bill, which reflects best international practice and addresses a significant gap in Ireland's anti-corruption framework, will provide comprehensive protection to whistleblowers in all sectors of the economy.  The overhaul of the ethics legislation is being progressed and is aimed at supporting and promoting ethical conduct and creating an environment in which ethical issues and conflicts of interests are managed effectively, while corrupt and unethical conduct is severely discouraged.</p><p>The programme of reform will also include the publication of a consultation paper on strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.  An extensive public consultation process has been initiated, led by the independent panel on accountability that I have established.  The aim of this process is to bring about change and reform to the current accountability arrangements.  I invite Members to make submissions to that expert review because it is important we get political, as well as cross-societal input into that process.  The publication of this paper begins an extensive public consultation process on the key issue of who is accountable and answerable and who is responsible for what in the Civil Service.</p><p> My Department is also leading on the Open Government Partnership, OGP, which serves to complement these existing objectives and provides an important international complement to national reform efforts.  The intention, as I have previously indicated to the House, is that Ireland will become a full member of the OGP in May 2014.  Membership of the OGP will reaffirm Ireland's commitment to governmental transparency and reform.  This Government embraced reform from the very beginning, demonstrating a strong commitment to facilitating open, transparent, responsible and, I hope, accountable governance.  These are just some of the areas in which we are working to restore faith in our political and administrative systems.</p><p> The reforms we are undertaking in this legislation fit firmly within these two aims of democratic reform and fiscal efficiency.  The allowance governed by this legislation, what has been called the party leader's allowance, first came into being in 1938, approximately 75 years ago.  It was born from the recognised need for the State to support the political system and the democratic process, and introduced the provision of funding to Opposition parties.  Over time, and through changes introduced by a number of Governments of all political colours, the allowance provided through this legislation has changed and evolved to become a significant source of funding and support for all parties and Members in this Parliament.  The main goal remains the same, however - that is, to support the proper functioning of our political system.</p><p> I have already made it clear that no aspect of political funding can remain immune from the financial corrections and savings that have necessitated the changes I have outlined.  With this in mind, this Bill will reduce the rates of the allowance paid to both parliamentary leaders of parties and Independent Members by 10%, a measure that will result in a direct saving of approximately &euro;840,000 in a full year.  It does not sound like a lot of money, but it is important that everybody is seen to carry the burden.  As I have already stated, the scope of the allowance payable under the existing legislation has grown over time.  What was once an allowance purely for the leaders of Opposition parties to spend as they saw fit is now an extensive support provided to parliamentary parties, as well as Independent Deputies and Senators, for use exclusively in their parliamentary activities and research.  To reflect the evolution of the allowance, and following a suggestion by some of the Independent Members of the Seanad during the consultation process preceding the drafting of the Bill, the Bill renames the allowance as the &quot;parliamentary activities allowance&quot; to better reflect its true purpose and intent.</p><p> The Government has already implemented significant reforms to political funding through the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which was brought before the Houses by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  That Act brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation.  This Bill builds upon the changes to the Electoral Act by improving the transparency and accountability for the money from the public purse received by parties and Independent Members for parliamentary activities.</p><p> The most recent primary legislation on this allowance was passed in 2001.  Following public concern about how the allowance could be used, that Act introduced a limited requirement for leaders of political parties to account for the money spent from the allowance received in a statement of expenditure, to have that statement audited and to submit these documents to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consideration.  Under this Bill, the commission will be given more extensive powers to examine the statements of expenditure provided in respect of the allowance and to offer guidance on its use.  By allowing for the publication of guidelines, those in receipt of the allowance will be given certainty as to what they are permitted to use the funding for.  This should ensure that all money received is spent in an appropriate and proper manner.</p><p> Up to now, Independent Members of the Oireachtas in receipt of this allowance did not have to account for the funds received.  In the current climate, and with the increased scrutiny on all public expenditure, this is no longer acceptable.  The Bill provides that Independent members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be subject to the same reporting requirements that apply to party leaders and significantly enhances the level of accountability for those in receipt of the money.</p><p> With the permission of the Chair, I will go through the provisions of the Bill in some detail.  Section 2 is based on current provisions and provides for the payment of the allowance to parliamentary leaders of qualifying parties and to qualifying Independent Members.  It sets out the criteria for entitlement to the allowance and provides for a reduction in the current rates.  It clarifies that the amount of an allowance payable to a parliamentary leader of a qualifying party is calculated on a tapering basis rather than a flat rate being applied to the total number of that party.  The allowance may be used to fund the parliamentary activities of the party, such as policy formulation, the procurement of technical advice or support services, or for research and training.  The main restriction on the use of the allowance is that it cannot be used for, or to recoup, electoral or political expenses on elections.</p><p> During the passage of the Bill through the other House, it became apparent that there was a misconception as to the meaning of this section, particularly the calculation used to determine the level of funding that should be made available to each political party.  The figures used for calculation purposes are not allocations for individual Members of that party and do not have to be spent in respect of any particular Member at any stage.  Rather, they are part of the metric by which the funding of parties, which form a vital part of our political system, is determined, and which takes into account the views of the electorate as expressed at the ballot box.  It is for parties to determine how they will use that money, within the categories permitted, and it is parties that the funding is to support, not the individual Members who comprise that party.</p><p> It has been suggested that in the event that a Member of a party loses the party Whip, the parliamentary party should have its funding reduced.  Not only does that suggestion miss the point that the money given to the party, reflecting the wishes of the electorate, is not the individual's and was never theirs to control or spend in that fashion, it would also have negative repercussions for those employed on the understanding that the funding would be available, and could cause legal and contractual issues for political parties.  Such a measure could disproportionately affect smaller parties, for whom the tiered calculation is designed to provide additional support.  A reduction of &euro;25,754 to a party with more than thirty Members has a very different effect than a &euro;64,368 reduction to a party of only two or three Members.</p><p> The section includes two new provisions.  The first new provision provides that qualifying expenses arising out of parliamentary activities will only be regarded as qualifying expenditure where such expenditure is not otherwise reimbursed or provided for.  The second new provision provides that, in view of our obligations to the Central Fund and for administrative efficiency, where an allowance is due and payable and a period of six months expires without the parliamentary leader or Member having claimed the allowance or part thereof, the part of the allowance for that period in excess of six months shall no longer be payable.</p><p> Section 3 inserts eight new sections, 10A to 10H, into the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938.  I will deal with section 10B first as it contains the provisions whereby leaders of qualifying parties and Independent Members in receipt of the allowance must provide a statement of expenditure and accompanying auditor's report to the Standards in Public Offices Commission.  This section also outlines the procedure when a change in party leadership or the death of a party leader or Independent Member in receipt of the allowance occurs.</p><p> Section 10A provides that a recipient of the allowance who fails to provide the required statement of expenditure and auditor's report within the required deadline of 120 days after the end of the financial year to the commission will receive no further funding from the allowance until such time as those documents are provided.</p><p>The section also provides that should the commission find that the statement of expenditure does not comply with the legislation, the allowance will not be paid to that recipient until such time as the issues underlying that non-compliance have been addressed to my satisfaction.</p><p> Section 10C provides for the retention of documentation by party leaders and Independent Members in support of the statement of expenditure provided for the commission.  Section 10D provides powers for the commission to examine and assess the statements of expenditure provided to it and to make inquiries as necessary to do this.  The section also outlines the process by which the commission may report its findings in regard to the statements of expenditure received by it.  Section 10E allows for the setting of a date when these provisions will come into effect for Independent Members and for party leaders.  This is in recognition of the fact that the necessary documentation may not have been collected prior to its being required by this legislation, and that some advance notice of these requirements is necessary.</p><p> Section 10F provides that in the event that a party or Independent Member of the Oireachtas in receipt of the allowance loses its, or his or her, entitlement to the allowance, any unspent amounts received must be repaid within 120 days of the end of the financial year.  Section 10G provides that the commission may formulate and issue guidelines in regard to the allowance and the statement of expenditure to be prepared by those in receipt of the allowance.  This provision has been requested by the commission for some time, as there was previously no formal advisory role given to the commission in regard to the allowance.  By allowing for the publication of guidelines, those in receipt of the allowance will be able to ensure that the money received is spent in an appropriate and proper manner.</p><p> Section 4 amends the existing legislation so that any general round decreases which apply to the Civil Service will also apply to the rates of the allowance.  Previously, only general increases could be applied.  This was not due to design, but the fact that at the time of drafting the existing legislation, it was not envisaged that decreases would be implemented.</p><p> Section 5 delivers on the Government's pledge to abolish severance payments for specified ministerial and parliamentary officeholders. These officeholders include the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader of the Seanad and the Attorney General.  The abolition of these payments will apply to both current and future holders of the offices in question.  There are currently no persons in receipt of these payments.</p><p> The Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013 is a short Bill and its provisions are in keeping with the Government's objective of continued stabilisation of the overall cost of the public service.  As part of this objective, it provides for a reduction for the first time in the rates of the allowance and for the abolition of severance payments.  Greater transparency and accountability in the use of expenditure from the allowance will also be achieved and the money received from the allowance will not only be spent appropriately but will be seen to be so.  At the same time, the Bill sets out an agenda of reform for the future, ensuring the transparent and accountable use of funds provided by the Exchequer to support the democratic process.</p><p> I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Members on it.  I will consider any ideas proffered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300034#GG00200"><p>I wish to share my time with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013 and have a number of points to make on it.  We welcome the Bill and I doubt anybody in the House will have a problem with it.  The Bill is designed to provide for a reduction of 10% in the rate of allowances payable and this is in line with changes that have occurred across society.  Perhaps it is even a little more than agreed in recent pay agreements, but we must lead by example.  The Bill also provides for the auditing of the parliamentary leader's allowance for Independent Deputies and Senators.</p><p>  The issue of this allowance came to light some time ago when the Committee of Public Accounts was examining allowances across the public service, and of course it looked at the Oireachtas.  It was never a secret that these allowances were paid to Senators, but it was not well known.  Few people knew of it, including many Members of this House.  I expect those in receipt of the allowance were fully aware of it, but I doubt they broadcast it too loudly.  The system was in place, and it is only right that it should be included under the general rules and guidelines and that the moneys be properly accounted for, audited and reported to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I welcome the Bill and Fianna F&aacute;il will support Second Stage.  However, we have a number of questions to raise and will probably table some amendments.  I am sure the Minister will understand my thinking on these, though he may not agree on all of them.</p><p>  We support the principle of the legislation, but would like the Minister to clarify some issues in his summing up.  The party leader's allowance is being renamed the parliamentary activities allowance, but whose name will be on the cheque and who will be the payee?  I suspect that formerly the name of the party leader was on the cheque, but who will be the payee now?  Second, I intend to propose an amendment in regard to the parliamentary activities allowance, as the Bill provides that the allowance be made from the Central Fund to the relevant party leaders and Independent Deputies in respect of categories of expenses arising.  I do not believe this allowance should be paid from the Central Fund.  It should come through voted expenditure, like all other expenditure that comes through this House each year.  I have raised this issue several times.  The Government will spend approximately &euro;50 billion this year.  Some &euro;40 billion of that is voted expenditure, through the line Departments and various State agencies.  However, &euro;10 billion of expenditure is not voted through this House at all.  It is not discussed in the House and there is no formal mechanism for discussing it here.  The Government may say that it or the Opposition can choose to initiate a debate on the issue, and perhaps we should.</p><p>  It is wrong that &euro;10 billion of taxpayers' money is spent each year without discussion or being voted on in the House.  The main element of the &euro;10 billion is the payment of interest on the national debt and we understand there are complications in that regard.  We understand that when the NTMA, on behalf of the State, borrows at a particular rate, the people who lend us money may not be comfortable if the annual interest owed to them may have to be voted through the House of Parliament, especially in difficult times.  I understand the complication in this regard.  However, in regard to other payments, such as the payment to politicians, it is wrong that they should not be voted through in the House each year.  It is wrong that these payments are put through the Central Fund and that this expenditure is not brought to the House to be voted on.  It is wrong that payments to judges are not part of voted expenditure.  I understand the independence of the judges and the Constitution has been well tested in that regard.  It is within the competence of this House to vote on the costs of administering the system.  </p><p>  Certain other payments under the electoral Acts, including the free postage scheme and payments to returning officers for various elections, are paid through the Central Fund.  This expenditure should be voted through the House.  It is wrong that there appears almost to be a slush fund that is not discussed here.  The Central Fund is not under the remit of the Minister for Expenditure and Reform but that of the Minister for Finance.  I suggest that all of these moneys, other than the interest on the national debt, should be under the remit of the Minister for Expenditure and Reform.  I believe it is his job to be answerable for expenditure relating to the political system, payments to the courts and other payments.</p><p>  Payments we must make to the European institutions and our contribution to the EU fund also come through the Central Fund account each year.  I know the contribution is set, but if, for example, we have to make a payment of &euro;1.5 billion, there would be nothing wrong with putting that figure in the Estimates each year and discussing it, and if the figure rose or fell during the year that could be dealt with.  Whatever the case, we should have a debate on the payment.</p><p>We have debate after debate here and in committee rooms about payments, schemes, Pillar 1, Pillar 2 and single farm payments, but we do not debate the amount of money paid out by the Irish taxpayer to European institutions.  There is a one-way debate because the money we pay out is never voted through a line Department.  It does not even go through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is an anomaly as not all of the money is due through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; some of it could be for the Structural Fund or the Social Fund.  The biggest amount is with regard to agriculture.  The funds paid by the Irish taxpayer to the European institutions should go through the line Departments rather than through a central fund which is not discussed by the Oireachtas on an annual basis.  Perhaps there is a halfway house, as we should have a formal debate on the Central Fund each year.  I believe they should be voted through, but we should definitely have a halfway house.  We should have a formal debate and perhaps as spokesperson on public expenditure and reform, I will initiate it.  I have given the Minister a flavour of what is in the account. I  am speaking from recollection, but I know from examining it last year that improvements could be made.  It is not right that the funds should be paid without being voted through the House each year in the same way every other public expenditure is voted through.  We will table an amendment in this regard.</p><p> The big issue referred to by the Minister in his opening comments was that the payment was calculated on the numbers elected in the preceding general election, which brings us straight to the crunch issue about Members who leave a political party.  We will propose an amendment in this regard.  On the one political point to which he did respond, the Minister stated this suggestion missed the point entirely because the money given to a party which reflected the wishes of the electorate was not an individual's and was never theirs to control.  The party did not stand for election; the individual did.  He or she might have been a member of a registered party, but it was the name of the individual which was on the ballot paper.  We do not have ballot papers with Fianna F&aacute;il in two spots, Fine Gael in another and the Labour Party in another.  As names are attached to the ballot paper, the fund should attach to the people concerned.  The legislation provides for a halfway house on this issue, while section 2(12)(<i>a</i>) on page 5 deals with a party dissolving.  The legislation includes arrangements for the establishment of a new party after the dissolution of a party and amalgamation is agreed, whereby members of the previous party are now members of the new party.  The principle of money moving to a new organisation, whether a party or another mechanism, is provided for in the legislation and the same should apply in this case.  It is not right that Deputies who fight an election campaign are forced out of their party for abiding by that election campaign.  When one considers the votes received in an election, the individual must be considered.</p><p> It is proposed that the combined allowance for parties in government be reduced by one third.  This is a long-established mechanism, but just because it has been in place since 1938 does not make it right in 2014.  This reduction is not sufficient in this day and age.  Not only does the Government have the support of the entire Civil Service, press offices in Departments and specific allowances covering transport and the allocation of staff in parliamentary and constituency offices, but Ministers also employ special advisers, many of whom receive payments above and beyond the normal payments in the public service which were personally approved by the Minister.  On top of this, a huge amount is paid through the parliamentary allowance.  I consider this extra payment to be a top-up for Ministers.  It is not enough that they have the full Civil Service and special advisers, but they also want a major top-up from the allowance.  There should be a substantial payment for parties in government and by definition parties in government will always be the biggest parties because they would not be in government if they did not have a majority.  I propose that the amount be reduced by 50% rather than the 33% proposed by the Minister in the legislation.  He agrees with the principle of a reduction for Government parties, as I do, but I am being more specific.</p><p> I understand the issue regarding the allowance not being subject to income tax, but I do not see anything in the legislation whereby the fund into which its is paid should produce a tax clearance certificate each year.  This is an important issue.  Those of us who stand for election obtain a tax clearance certificate when we are elected, but for each of the five years in between elections one is not required to produce a tax clearance certificate.  I do not suggest we should do so, as we go before the electorate and must do it again at the next election, but there should be a mechanism whereby the fund has tax clearance.  It should be a straightforward procedure.</p><p> I am not sure about the arrangement which applies when a person who is elected as a member of a political party then becomes the Ceann Comhairle.  Is the amount for that person deducted from the payment to the party?  It should be because it is nonsense.  Let us clear this anomaly.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position.  With no disrespect to the current incumbent, if the Taoiseach receives tens of thousands of euro in respect of the membership of the Ceann Comhairle who was elected as a member of the Fine Gael Party, it is ridiculous, absurd and not right.  Any reasonable person will accept if it is the case, the practice must cease forthwith.  I hope the Minister will accept what I state in this regard.</p><p> We will discuss the points I am making on Committee Stage.  Section 10G(5) states that when the commission comes forward with its proposals and guidelines, the Minister may refuse to approve them or may amend them.  Essentially, the commission is the puppet of the Government and if it does not do what it is told, the guidelines will not be approved.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, is a trustworthy organisation and we had a good discussion on it yesterday.  A new chairman has been appointed and it has respected members, including senior officers such as the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  They are absolutely impartial and nobody could question this.  If we stitch into the legislation that if this body comes up with something and for political reasons a Minister chooses to refuse to adopt the guidelines, the power should be taken away from the Minister because he or she would be meddling in an area in which everybody would agree SIPO should be the competent authority.  The Minister should not be able to get back at it on such an occasion.</p><p> I made the case on Independent Members having to be audited and everybody accepts this.  Will the Minister clarify the issue of the 120 day timeline?  If an election is called in April, people will be on the hustings and a party could have a new leader by June or July.  It might be difficult in a general election year to get the accounts in on time.  </p><p> I appeal to the Minister, as I did yesterday, to find a mechanism to have a gender balance on the Standards and Public Office Commission.  It has six members, five of whom happen to be gentlemen; there is one lady.  I realise some of them are set offices, but there was an opportunity to appoint a former female member yesterday instead of the former male member, given that it had so few lady members.  It is something the Minister should consider.</p><p> I accept that increases or decreases should be in line with those of the public service, but will the Minister specify what type of increase would be involved?  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI, this year will see a different range of increases or decreases.  It starts at 4% at &euro;62,000, with a larger cut at &euro;85,000; the higher the amount of money, the bigger the cut.  The Minister has not stated where will this fit into the threshold.  General increases in payments in the Civil Service depend on FEMPI.  Does this mean that when FEMPI no longer applies, the decreases will be paid back?</p><p> At the end of this month we must all fill in forms and depending on whether we have nil or actual donations, some forms go to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and some go to SIPO.  Will the Minister, please, make life easy and have all the forms go to one place?  I must scratch my head in figuring out whether a form goes to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or SIPO.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300036#JJ00200"><p>I commend the Minister for bringing formally to the House the decision to abolish severance payments.  At the end of the previous Government, it was decided that former Ministers who were sitting Members should forgo the allowance.  That should form part of a more general reform that is not provided for in the legislation.  I was surprised on the first occasion I was appointed Minister of State to find I had two employers - the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department in which I served.  I was paid two different salaries and I received two P60s.  Ministers are appointed by the Taoiseach but the appointments need to be approved by the House.  There might be a good historic reason for Departments footing the bill for ministerial salaries but it has never been apparent to me.  When I explained to people that I received an Oireachtas allowance and a separate ministerial salary, they were surprised.</p><p>  In the interests of transparency, when information is provided regarding the salaries of everyone in the House, many people are surprised to find, for example, that the Minister earns the same salary as every other Member but they know that is true.  They do not realise they should have asked a second question about the salary from the Departments.  To tidy up this procedure, ministerial allowances should be part of a Member's salary.  When one is appointed to office, one's Oireachtas salary should increase and Ministers should have one employer.</p><p>  I refer to an amusing incident a number of years ago.  I was not amused when I received the letter but it was amusing that a Department could make this mistake.  When I ceased being a Minister, later that year the tax man wrote to me to say I had underpaid the USC.  I have never checked the calculation of the charge in my payslip.  The Oireachtas had not spoken to the Department or <i>vice versa </i>and the 4% USC rate that applies to the lower portion of a salary had been applied by both the Oireachtas and the Department without me realising it and, therefore, Revenue asked for a refund.  That highlights how bizarre the system is, given two Departments could not get right.  The notion of two employers and so on creates unnecessary complications and the next time the Minister introduces reforms, he should amalgamate these payments under one Department.  He will no doubt be given 50,000 reasons not to do anything because that is always the case.  Civil servants provide various explanations as to why something cannot be done and so on.  It is time that we did things in a way that is intelligible to ordinary people who are not familiar with the more complicated ways everything works in the bureaucratic system.  That would be a small but visible change.</p><p>  If somebody asked the Taoiseach's Department what is his salary, he could honestly answer he was in receipt of a modest salary because it would not include his Oireachtas allowance.  This system is open to misunderstanding and unnecessary duplication.  The legislation is an attempt to simplify the system and refers to shared services, etc.  I am sure the Oireachtas would be more than happy to write the foot the entire bill for each Member</p><p>  I have not had an opportunity to examine the Bill in minute detail but I presume some Members will still be worth more than others under the Leader's allowance provision.</p></speech>

This is not true because many people vote across party lines.  There were 17 candidates in my constituency the last time and electors could ignore the party system and vote along personal lines.  That happens at every election and, therefore, people vote for a series of people who go before them and not for a party.  The logic is that the money should follow the Member.  If somebody dies, the funding will cease under the legislation.  I refer to the notion that this could not be done because it might have had negative repercussions for those employed by Members.</p><p>The reality is that the money can change halfway through and all of us have to employ people on contracts providing that the job ceases if the money is no longer available.  As there is no guarantee as to how long a D&aacute;il lasts, every party leader's contract with his or her staff provides for a sudden termination in the event that the money dries up when an election is called and a Member is not returned.  The arguments in this regard are ridiculous.  There should be one rate for Opposition Deputies and a lesser rate for Government Deputies.  Ministers do not need this money at all because they are well looked after.  The money should follow the Member and if it is signed into a party fund it should remain there until such time as the Member ceases to be a member of that party.  If he or she becomes an Independent Member, the money should follow.  That would be a fair and equitable system.  If a voluntary organisation lost half of its members, it would not expect to receive their subscriptions on a certain day in five years time.  People would be screaming that it was not democratic or accountable.  Further debate is needed on the provisions of this Bill and I hope there will be genuine engagement on Committee Stage with a view to developing a system that is fairer and more equitable.</p><p> It has become fashionable to cut the financial supports we need to do our job.  If we do not have a well resourced Oireachtas we, who are trying to hold the Government to account, will not have the resources and back-up we need to carry out research on legislation and other issues or to make meaningful contributions.  I do not go along with the idea that there should be further cuts to resources for operating this House.  For example, the support given to committees by the Library and Research Service is vital.  The idea that the Oireachtas could hold the Executive to account without adequate resources is penny wise and pound foolish.</p></speech>

The Bill deals with a number of anomalies in the political system relating to pay, State funding of politics and accountability.  State funding of political parties is part and parcel of a functioning democracy, as are the mechanisms built into the system to account for such funds.  Independent Members should be subject to the same scrutiny as political parties and the rules of accountability should apply to all Members of both Houses.</p><p>  In the past six years citizens have been subject to drastic reductions in public services, but the human cost has yet to be properly quantified.  While the scale of the cuts and those targeted to carry the heaviest burden is a debate for another day, it is the context within which the Bill is framed.  We welcome the Minister's decision to reduce the leader's allowance.  Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposals for 2014, which were published in advance of the Government's October announcement, included a measure to cut the leader's allowance by 10%.  As politicians, we cannot propose reductions in expenditure without first looking to ourselves.  We would like to see the withdrawal of the committee chair allowance.  Participation in D&aacute;il committees should be made compulsory, with no additional allowance, because it is an intrinsic part of the role of Deputies and Senators.  These moneys should be redirected to resourcing the committees with additional staff and expertise.  The committee system is one of the positive parts of our parliamentary system and it adds real value to our work.  I believe citizens have more faith in this aspect of our work.  Leaders' Questions Time frustrates citizens and is often viewed by the outside world as little more than a set piece.  The Topical Issues debate follows an even more rigid format and Ministers have thus far failed to live up to their commitments of 2011 in this regard.</p><p>  This legislation should also deal with ministerial pay, which remains high in comparison to our European counterparts.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a package of pay reductions for the Taoiseach, Ministers and Oireachtas Members which would have saved an additional &euro;3.7 million and brought salaries in line with those in comparable European states.  Office holders often justify their salary scales with comparisons to the private sector, which of course is not the correct comparison.  If one's wont in life is to maximise one's earning potential, politics is not the right career.  Politicians and office holders are paid well for the service they give and it is my party's view that their salaries could be reduced.  We would like the Minister to go further in this regard.</p><p>  Independent Members will now be subject to the same reporting requirements as party leaders in that they will have to prepare a statement of expenditure on the moneys they receive, have the statement audited and provide documents to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I studied with bemusement the amendments submitted in the Seanad which argued against this measure.  The proposition that any Member should be subject to less scrutiny than his or her colleagues makes little sense.  For a number of years Sinn F&eacute;in was the only political party in this state to make public our audited annual accounts, as we do in the North.  For some time in the North political parties have been required under law to provide a full annual financial statement of income and expenditure to the electoral commission.  We have always commended this requirement and called for the same in the South.</p><p>  Much of the mistrust of politics is because of the public perception that politicians get an easy ride.  The leader's allowance and other payments are, as the Minister stated, used for parliamentary activities, but until there is a completely transparent mechanism to make public all revenue and expenditure data relating to political parties the mistrust will remain.  However, while the Government has a way to go before we even come close to an open data culture, this legislation is a small step forward.  Expanding the role of the Standards in Public Office Commission is the right decision but it must be complemented by increased staff numbers and training.  Introducing legislation to enhance oversight of public moneys will be meaningless if these same oversight bodies are not fully resourced.  My colleague Deputy Mary Lou McDonald has raised this matter repeatedly with the Minister as he was overseeing a significant further reduction in staff numbers.  I cannot emphasise enough the need for adequate resourcing and training of the bodies to which we entrust oversight.</p><p>  Abolition of the severance payments to Ministers and parliamentary office holders is welcome, and it is long overdue.  It is a shame the Minister has not shown the same enthusiasm for dealing with the gold-plated pensions that continue to be paid out to former Taoisigh, Ministers and office holders.  Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposals to deal with these pensions would save the state &euro;14 million annually.  The majority of former public sector workers receive modest pensions for the service they gave but a small cohort still enjoy very generous packages.  The vast majority of Secretaries General and city and county managers will receive additional lump sum payments and up to ten added years on retirement.  It is not good enough for the Minister to state this is their entitlement; nor is he correct to say property rights act as a barrier to fundamentally reforming pensions for those at the top.  This is the same argument used by the board of CRC to justify its former CEO's pension package that has outraged the country, as well as many Ministers.</p><p>  It is also disappointing that the Minister has not used the Bill as an opportunity to introduce a fully vouched system for all Oireachtas Members' expenses.  It would be a welcome development if the Minister gave us a commitment today that this is something he intends to do during the lifetime of the Government.</p></speech>

It aims to reduce the Leader's allowance by 10%; to introduce auditing and vouching of the leader's allowance; and to abolish severance payments for Ministers.  I support all three of these aims.  The leader's allowance should be reduced.  It should be subject to auditing and all expenditure should be vouched, and severance payments to Ministers should be abolished.</p><p>  It is unclear why it has taken three years to bring this Bill before the House, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it might be because certain Government backbench TDs enjoy heckling Independent TDs about the leader's allowance.  Of course, what most of them probably do not know is that the Government has twice voted against reducing the leader's allowance and making it vouched.  It voted against it in the Seanad when an amendment was tabled by Independent Senators and it voted against it again in committee, when Deputy Catherine Murphy and I tabled an amendment to reduce it and to make it vouched.</p><p>  While I welcome the purpose of the Bill, the problem for me is that it is unambitious.  Why a reduction of only 10%?  Why a reduction to only the leader's allowance?  Why will there still be limited transparency on how public funding of politics is spent?</p></speech>

The truth is that political funding in Ireland is funding for the parties, by the parties and because of the parties.</p><p>  Let us look at the numbers.  There are three sources of political funding in Irish politics: Exchequer funding, the leader's allowance, and additional party staff.  The total funding for all parties and politicians after this Bill is passed will be almost &euro;16 million per annum.  This funding breaks down as follows: Fine Gael will get 34%, or &euro;5.4 million; Fianna F&aacute;il will get 23%, or &euro;3.5 million; the Labour Party will get 22%, or &euro;3.4 million; Sinn F&eacute;in will get 13%, or &euro;2.1 million; and Independents and non-party TDs, who are far greater in number than either Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in, will get &euro;855,000.</p><p>  Once this Bill is passed, the average funding per TD will be &euro;84,000 per year.  Each Independent TD will get &euro;37,000, or approximately half the average, while &euro;65,000 will be provided for each Fine Gael TD, &euro;80,000 will be provided for each Labour Party TD, &euro;140,000 will be provided for each Sinn F&eacute;in TD, and Deputy Martin will get &euro;166,000 for each Fianna F&aacute;il TD.  In spite of all the talk about the Independents' and leader's allowance, the reality is that public funding for Independent Deputies is a small fraction of that for party TDs.  Even though the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach have the full resources of the Government and the public sector at their disposal, the Taoiseach will get three quarters more per Fine Gael TD than Independent TDs get and the T&aacute;naiste will get, per TD, over twice what Independent TDs get.</p></speech>

Why is that?  Is it not because the Government thinks they are worth it.  How is this democratic?  How is this healthy?  How is it a fair and proper allocation of funding to Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?</p><p>  We tend to hear that it costs money to run a party and, therefore, Deputy Martin should get per TD four and a half times, over &euro;160,000, what is provided to Independent TDs.  When, in committee, we have asked what is this for, we were told it is for research, policy development, training and administration.  Independent TDs carry out all those functions too, yet we are asked to do it for four and a half times less than party TDs, without any of the economies of scale that parties have.</p><p>  Let us not forget that this funding goes to and stays with the parties even when members of those parties leave or are expelled.  I have run the numbers on the Labour Party Deputies and Fine Gael Deputies and Senators who have left or been expelled from their parties, and it turns out that the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach will get approximately &euro;2.2 million over the course of this D&aacute;il for TDs who are not in their parties.  That is easy money.  I would say there are many businesses out there that would like to know how they can get &euro;2 million from the Exchequer for staff whom they have had to let go.  In his speech, the Minister addressed this.  He stated:<blockquote>It has been suggested that in the event that a Member of a party loses the party Whip, the parliamentary party should have its funding reduced [Deputy Catherine Murphy, myself and many others have suggested exactly that].  Not only does that suggestion miss the point that the money given to the party, reflecting the wishes of the electorate, is not the individual's and was never theirs to control or spend in that fashion...</blockquote>The Minister and I have debated this previously and we have fundamentally different views on it, but I put it to him again that the electorate does not vote for parties.</p></speech>

As I laid out, parties have three sources of funding, two of which have been completely ignored by the Bill.  Whilst I agree that the leader's allowance should be reduced and have previously tabled amendments to have it reduced, the other sources of funding should be reduced as well.  There are two reasons for this.  First, it will save the Exchequer money at a time when there is very little public money available.  Second, by reducing only the funding available to non-party TDs, the Minister has increased the disparity between what party leaders get for each of their TDs and what Independent TDs get.</p><p>  In his response, the Minister might address the following questions.  Why is total political funding not being reduced by 10%?</p><p>Why is Exchequer funding not being reduced?  Why are Oireachtas resources to parties not being reduced?  Why is it only the leader's allowance that is reduced and why is it only being reduced by 10%?  Could we not go further and reduce it by 15% or 20%?  Why will ex-party TDs not be given funding?  I believe it is because this Bill is a sop.  It is like a lot of other so-called political reform, it is pretend reform because it is political expedience, it is cynical and it is box-ticking.  In spite of all of that I am going to vote for the Bill because it goes a tiny fraction of the way that we need to go in upgrading political funding, but if this is the only real change we are going to see in political funding from now on, it is very disappointing.</p><p> This Bill serves to protect and strengthen the existing political cartel.  In its lack of ambition it has failed to create a fair, transparent, cost-effective and fundamentally more democratic funding of politics in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister will take on board some of those points, although I doubt it, and bring them forward as amendments on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I support the reduction of the leader's allowance and absolutely support the vouching of moneys spent.  It is wrong, and has been wrong, that the spending of public moneys is not properly vouched and that the process is not transparent.  I put forward amendments to other legislation in recent years to try to achieve that but they were not accepted by Government, and I was surprised about that.  I can present the Minister with the amendments and the legislation concerned if need be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300039#MM00400"><p>It is right that we have to account to the Standards in Public Office and that records are kept.  It is right also that the severance payments to Ministers is discontinued.  Those are the broad elements of the legislation and I am supportive of them.</p><p>  I will try not to cover much of what has been said.  The way political funding is allocated requires a substantial change.  The Electoral Acts date back to 1938 when de Valera was Taoiseach.  Such funding was about providing something like a first-class ticket on the train; it was very modest and that is from when it dates.  It was only in the 1990s when the economy was perceived to be doing very well that there was a change in respect of the amount of money that began to be allocated to the political system and it increased considerably.  I support the idea that a large part of politics must be funded publicly because we have seen that we pay a price for relying on, for example, donations from particular sectors and where one or two sectors had a disproportionate impact on public policy by virtue of the relationship between political donations and the decisions that were made.</p><p>  I was amused by what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about the leader's allowance because I do not believe he has not researched how it works for Fianna F&aacute;il which does very well out it by virtue of its size.  On the leader's allowance alone, it would average in region of &euro;64,000 per TD, Sinn F&eacute;in does better with &euro;67,000 per TD and there is a one third discount for the parties that are in government.  What is provided to Independent TDs is substantially below that.  The spending of the allowance should be vouched and it should be spent on areas that fall within the various categories, for example, developing policy, communications and a range of other areas that comprise normal parliamentary activity.</p><p>  Another issue needs to be addressed and I referred to it yesterday when I spoke on the motions on the nominations to the Standards in Public Office Commission and obviously some of us strayed from speaking about the individuals who had been nominated.  I refer to the issue of how political parties are not declaring the donations they are coming in.  A Bill's digest for another item of legislation last year stated:<blockquote>A key problem with the current political finance regime in Ireland is that it has been relatively easy for parties to raise funds from private sources without disclosing them, thereby defeating the purpose of the regime in the first place... In spite of parties declaring over &euro;10 million in campaign expenditure for the 2007 general election, just over &euro;1 million was disclosed in donations.  </blockquote>That is according to a SIPO report of 2008.  That Bill's digest goes on to note that &quot;none of the three main parties disclosed any donations in 2009 in spite of the fact that it was an election year&quot;.  None of the three main political parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, disclosed any donations in 2010.  The SIPO report on expenditure in February 2011 revealed electoral expenses of &euro;9.2 million disclosed by candidates and parties.  The three main parties were the biggest spenders, with Fine Gael at &euro;3.1 million, Fianna F&aacute;il at &euro;2.1 million and the Labour Party at &euro;1.9 million.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> produced a comparative report fairly soon afterwards under a headline referring to the cash political parties did not tell people about, and reported that &euro;5 million has been handed over in the past decade.  The resourcing and ability of SIPO to investigate seems to be constrained.  These needs to be a change in that respect.  It cannot be a question of forever pushing that off into the future.</p><p>  An area that is rarely mentioned in terms of the funding or resourcing of political parties is that of staffing.  That comes under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I have talked to the Minister about this on a number of occasions.  Some of the staffing is allocated on that basis of parties that would have common policy platforms.  I do not have an issue with that and that is work that needs to be done.  Some of the work involves the co-ordination that must take place for this House to function in an effective way.  The Technical Group is a recognised group in the context of Standing Orders, yet its ability to function as a technical group is not provided for by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  For example, I act as the Whip for the Technical Group and I deal with the Bills Office, the questions office, the committee secretariat, the Journal Office and the Superintendent.  Various Ministers ring from time to time and to avoid having to ring 15 or 16 people, my office is where the telephone call is made.  We collectively hired two people to do that.  It cannot be done with any fewer and it is really right at that.  Such work is about the normal functioning of this House, yet no provision is made for it because it requires a change to primary legislation in order that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission can then provide for it.  I will be putting forward an amendment in that respect to this Bill and I hope the Minister will accept it.  Matters such as continuity planning require us to engage and it is not fair to ask any one of us to do that internal work without someone to assist with it. </p><p>It requires us to have an accountant to work out taxation.  The contracts are less advantageous to the people we are hiring than those doing exactly the same work as Members of the Oireachtas.  There is a good argument that the resources available should be shared in a way that allows the Houses to function.  I am not making the argument that it should be on a par with parties because it is not a policy platform and merely concerns the functioning of the House.  We are a large group, amounting to one third of the Opposition.  It is one of the basic things required.</p><p> Although something has been done about the category of travel and accommodation, I do not take a travel allowance.  I can get the bus or the train into town and I have a car park space provided.  If I was working anywhere else, I would not expect an allowance to turn up to work.  I have no difficulty with people receiving allowances where they must travel significant distances and provide accommodation away from home.  It is entirely different but people find this arrangement incredible.  There are several different travel categories.  Living 20 miles from the D&aacute;il, one can claim an unvouched sum of &euro;26,000.  That is wrong and it needs to change, as do some other allowances.  If Members are in here, they are not doing two jobs as there are only so many hours in the day.  For example, I see no reason why a separate allowance is paid to Members who act as Whips.  We are not provided for in this respect, nor am I looking for it, but I do not see why it should be paid.  People understand these things and while there is criticism about the extent of the salary, much of it is taken care of through taxation.  The other moneys on top of salary are what people find difficult to comprehend and accept.</p><p> Yesterday, during Leaders' Questions, Deputy Joan Collins spoke powerfully about an individual whose contributory widow's pension had been withdrawn because a review was being carried out by the Department.  She had a legitimate expectation of the widow's pension but the only people with a legitimate expectation are those with the wherewithal to go to court.  In respect of excessive pensions in the past that have been reduced, people do not understand why they have not been reduced further and why the legitimate expectation argument is not used in that context.  It is used because they have the money to go to court.  The courts are not available to those on a widow's pension or social welfare payment because of the cost of going to court.</p><p> A number of things must change.  It is right and proper that public money must be accounted for and open to scrutiny.  Independent Members should be no different to any other Member.  Not only have I said that, I made an effort to change it by tabling an amendment to legislation.  I hope there is some element of understanding in respect of the nuts and bolts of the running of the House.  The Houses of Oireachtas Commission should not be precluded from a fair allocation of resources.  Some 78 people are employed under that heading and none of them are provided to the Technical Group.  It concerns allocating speaking times and doing the things that ensure the House functions properly.  It does not stray into the policy area and it is reasonable to seek.  I will seek it in the context of an amendment to the legislation, which I support.</p></speech>

I have raised this with the Minister for a considerable period of time and I thank him for the manner in which he addressed it.  The concept of a leader's allowance has been knocking around since the foundation of the State and is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most abused forms of payment anyone has had the pleasure of receiving.  It was used as a form of patronage when a certain party in the House could not cobble together a majority.  Before we knew where we were, every Member was in government, every Member was a leader and every Member was an equal partner.  Some were given secret deals and some deals were so secret someone managed to leak the terms of the deal to constituents in Dublin North-Central.  When push came to shove, the occupant of the Taoiseach's office from Dublin Central was no longer flavour of the month and the Member walked away from him but the leaders allowance remained.  It is mind-boggling that in 2010, an Independent elected to this House received &euro;41,152 into the hand and Independent Senators received &euro;23,383 into the hand without any receipt.  Likening it to net income, it amounts to almost &euro;80,000 gross income, in addition to a Member's salary, for the benefit of being elected as someone not within the party.  The concept of the allowance has been totally abused and has gone out of control.</p><p>  From 2001 to 2013, figures released as an answer to a parliamentary question show some &euro;4,190,854.83 was paid to D&aacute;il Members.  Some &euro;1,691,944.25 was paid to Senators, amounting to a total of &euro;5,882,799.08 without a single receipt.  In the context of what the country has gone through over the past years, having that system in operation was a scandal.  The Minister's Bill will go a long way to addressing it.  People can huff and puff about how they tried to raise it with the Minister and tried to get the Minister to introduce legislation but, of the &euro;5,882,799.08, I do not think any of it was returned or refused.</p><p>  The Minister touched on a number of key points, one of which was vouching.  The public will no longer accept Members being in receipt of public moneys without vouching.  The difference between the leader's allowance for parties in contrast to Independents is that there is a vouching system for parties.  They must, rightly, vouch for the money to the Standards in Public Offices Commission, SIPO.  That does not exist for Independent Deputies and Senators and the money can be spent on anything.  Theoretically, it is supposed to be used for political work but in Westminster MPs use it for draining moats and installing PVC windows.  The sum of &euro;41,152 could be used for anything, which is wrong.  This week, Members received notifications from the Oireachtas one-stop shop and SIPO about 2013 expenses incurred and the register of our interests.  This is right.</p><p>This is the last edifice of the culture that must be eliminated.  It was the type of issue that gave politics a bad name.  I have no problem with people being well remunerated or paid a good salary as, in fairness, everybody in this institution - be they Deputies, Senators, staff members or clerical officers - works hard and deserves to be paid appropriately.  In 2014, we cannot justifiably retain a system where a person would retain in excess of &euro;40,000 without a single receipt being presented.  That is unacceptable.</p><p> In his speech the Minister referred to what would happen within 120 days of the end of the financial year, and if there are issues of non-compliance, the Minister can arrange to have the leader's allowance suspended until the issues are rectified.  As the Bill moves through the House, will the Minister consider the matter in more detail?  What happens if there is an absolutely flagrant abuse of the allowance?  If somebody were to drain a moat or buy new gutters or PVC windows, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should have some mechanism of clawback either in salary, the parliamentary representation allowance or other mechanism.  After what we have seen in the past three or four weeks with certain individuals in the charities sector, we know a rigid procedure should be put in place.  There should even be the possibility, if the process is abused beyond the guidelines as outlined by the Department and the Standards in Public Office Commission, of criminal penalties.</p><p> Ultimately we are trying to achieve absolute fairness.  The political process should be adequately funded so people should not feel they must go out with a begging bowl to ensure they can adequately perform in their job as a Deputy or Senator.  By the same token, if allowances are used for purposes for which they are not intended, there should be retribution in the form of penalties.  The best way of enforcing a penalty in this regard is by taking back the money.</p><p> The Minister also indicated he is standing over the basis on which people can find themselves as Independents having come from a political party, and I agree with those sentiments.  There cannot be a system in politics like we could have in the HSE, where money would follow the patient.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility that a person could be elected to party A before winding up as an Independent, going to party B and perhaps falling out with that party to become an Independent again.  The accounting mechanisms required to follow such a pattern would be too onerous, and the process would not reflect the wishes expressed through the ballot box of the people who elected the individual in the first place.  There is no way of knowing how people will end up politically when we vote for them but we must trust our instincts.  If people vote for a person in a political party, there is an expectation that although the person might not wind up continuing in the party, the funding stream should remain with the party.  Staffing levels, research facilities and all the structures in place cannot operate on the idea that &quot;they come and go&quot;, as it would be grossly unfair to staff.  None of us knows when this may affect us but if we are realistic, if a person is elected as a member of a party to which funding is allocated, it should stand as such.  Otherwise there would be a mentality of &quot;they come and go&quot;, which would do nothing for staff members or in trying to instil some financial discipline in the area.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy made some comments regarding the Technical Group, and some of the reports in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>are quite worrying.  If, for argument's sake, a person is essentially kicked out of the Technical Group and removed from a committee because of a failure to provide payment in respect of services provided by the Technical Group, it is a worrying development.  What differentiates the Technical Group from parties?  Members might argue that it is not a party but if it quacks, walks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is a duck.  There is obviously a whip system in force in the Technical Group, meaning that people can be kicked off committees.  A person can be unfortunate enough to sit in this Chamber and vote himself off a committee; that is the first time I have seen such an act.</p><p> This indicates there is a bit of work to be done in defining what is an Independent Deputy and the Technical Group.  I have brought the matter up as a Topical Issue and in oral questions to the appropriate Minister, who has always been up-front with his replies.  We must be honest with people.  The Technical Group has leaders, whips, people who could be considered spokespersons and slots on committees.  It also has a levy placed on members to fund its activities.  That is a party, and the Minister should examine the mechanism for registering the group with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  That is if the reports in yesterday's newspaper are correct and Members are expected to pay &euro;260, as I am only going by what I read, and not everything in it may be accurate.  People have a right to know where the money is going, to whom it is going and its purpose.  If a person wants to know anything about Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour or Sinn F&eacute;in, he or she only needs to go to the Standards in Public Office Commission to get chapter and verse of everything that a party does, including staff numbers, costs, where people are based, the names of general secretaries etc.  That is the way it should be.</p><p> It is different if a person is kicked off a committee or votes to kick himself off a committee because he did not pay &euro;260 for a service.  Nobody on this side of the House knows what the Deputy is getting for that, and perhaps it was right that he was kicked out.  I do not know.  There should be an accounting mechanism for those kinds of activities.  If a person is an Independent, that is fine, but if a person is pretending to be an Independent while part of a party called the Technical Group, it should be clarified.  The Technical Group should operate on that basis, and the structures of the House should reflect that.  It is not happening now, which is regrettable.  The Technical Group has had clear issues with leadership, which is its own matter.  It is different if a person is kicked out and removed from a committee.  There are serious questions to be asked in that regard and there may be an opportunity for some of the people from the group who have already spoken or will speak to enlighten us on what the &euro;260 per month, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, is used for.  As the Minister knows, the report may not be accurate.</p><p> I welcome this Bill, which is timely or perhaps long overdue.  There was a time when patronage had crept into Irish politics to a degree.  We saw this with convenors or assistant convenors of committees and chairpersons of sub-committees.  There was a time when everybody on this side of the House had a job, except for two unfortunate Deputies in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who seemed to fall out of favour with a certain individual.  It is not a bad thing that this practice has stopped.  We have a way to go and further improvements must be made.</p><p> Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly is correct in that the 10% figure may not be sufficient.  Given the unvouched amount that currently applies, the Minister could go a bit further.  I welcome the process will be vouched from now on.  The Minister might reconsider the penalties, rather than just suspending the allowance for failure to comply with regulations and guidelines set down by the Minister or the Standards in Public Office Commission.  If a person knows the money will be clawed back or there will be another adequate penalty, he or she will consider the process in a different guise.</p><p> I welcome the Bill.  I know there will be minor amendments to be made throughout the course of its passage, and in the Seanad there was a suggestion to change the name from the leader's allowance to the parliamentary activities allowance.  That is a good idea and some of the Senators, in particular, made some good contributions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-01-23a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300041#OO00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this legislation and I welcome its principle.  There are many good aspects to this, and it will bring about additional accountability in how public funds are distributed and accounted for.</p><p>That is extremely welcome.  I welcome the principle of the Bill on that basis.</p><p> A number of issues arise and I hope that during this debate, each party leader will answer to the House on the funding he has been receiving in recent years.  I would like to know from each party leader whether staff have received pay increases from public funding since 2007.  Have any of those staff received top-ups or bonuses in that period?  We have seen problems with charities in receipt of public funds.  Not all the money is obtained from public sources, as some money is raised through charitable donations.  This is the case with political parties in that they receive both State funds and contributions from members of the public.  I hope every party leader will clarify whether all of his staff are in compliance with Government pay guidelines.  This is a basic requirement.  I hope every party leader will put on the record his position on the moneys his party is receiving.  I hope we see fully audited funding of all political groupings and parties where State funds are involved.  If an organisation receives even &euro;1 in State funds, all the funds it receives should be accounted for.</p><p> I, as a democratically elected Member of a sovereign national Parliament, am denied the right to sit on an Oireachtas committee because I happened to stand up for a clear commitment concerning my constituency given by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health.  That commitment was rescinded by them six or eight weeks later in the Parliament.  The way that some members of this House are being restricted from sitting on parliamentary committees and receiving basic access to independent funding for research to carry out their role as parliamentarians is unconstitutional.  It is not right that because I happen to have been elected as a member of a political party, I am not entitled to access to independent research in order to contribute to this and every other debate in the House.</p><p> Every single Member, whether he is in a party or not, should be concerned by the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>by Niamh Horan and Fionnan Sheahan on 19 January.  Members will know that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are allocated significant public funds on the basis that I and my non-aligned colleagues were members of the party at the time of the general election.  It is important to highlight this matter because it indicates the attitude within Government parties.  Quoting a senior Fine Gael source, the article states that the party is making every effort to replace Deputy Creighton for the next general election.  It is stated that every assistance and resource will be provided.  The reality is that, in practical terms, public funds are being used in this regard.  They should be returned to the Exchequer.  Not only are they being denied to me but they are being used to undermine my constitutional role in the Parliament and the work I do on behalf of my constituents.  That is fundamentally unconstitutional.  I ask the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to follow the example of their colleague on the Opposition benches, Deputy Joe Higgins, who handed back the party funding he received on behalf of Deputy Clare Daly, who has left the political grouping.</p><p> The system of public funding of the political system represents a cartel that is being controlled by the political parties.  It does not make any difference who is in Government.  The Government in power can do no wrong, and the Opposition is of the view that everything is wrong.  If adversarial politics were so good in this country and if the D&aacute;il worked, why would 100,000 people be leaving this island every year because they cannot get a job here?  Political debate should be seen as good and it should be ensured that every Member of this Parliament has an equal capacity to contribute.  This should be not only allowed but encouraged.</p><p> The figures presented and published by Deputy Stephen Donnelly are interesting.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are receiving more than &euro;900,000 per annum in public funding for Members who are no longer in their parties.  This is far more than Mr. Paul Kiely received in a lump sum from the Central Remedial Clinic.  His was a once-off lump sum but in this case there is an annual payment to the leaders of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  This amounts to more than &euro;2.5 million in the lifetime of the Government.  Let me put that in context.  It is the equivalent of more than 2,500 medical cards, which are currently being denied to sick children across the country.  These children could have medical cards if the money went back into the Exchequer rather than being absorbed by the political parties.  It should rightly be returned to the Exchequer to support vulnerable and sick children.</p><p> The structure of party funding has been commented on by a number of eminent people, two of whom I will quote.  Political party funding of &euro;14 million is not fully accounted for or transparent, but it should be.  Professor David Farrell in UCD has described the current structure in the country as &quot;a functioning political cartel&quot;.  If that is not a damning indictment of the system in place, I do not know what is.  A former colleague of mine and former member of the Government, Mr. Ivan Yates, calls it &ldquo;an insiders-only rule&rdquo;.  He said:<blockquote>It's farcical that Fine Gael and Labour are still drawing down cash on the basis of TDs who have left their party since the election.  These TDs are denied the &euro;41,152 allowance that independents get paid annually... They seek to operate a closed shop more effectively than any trade union or cartel.</blockquote>The members of the Government, particularly the party leaders and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, should reflect on those comments.</p><p> The Minister will argue that funding must be based on the date of the election, but that principle is broken in this legislation.  Section 2 introduces a new section 10, subsection (12), which contains amending legislation covering the Workers&rsquo; Party and the Progressive Democrats.  This amendment, being proposed by the Government, breaks a principle and allows for funding to be switched with a group if the party in question is dissolved.</p><p> It is an illusion that people vote for political parties, as the Minister argues.  What a load of rubbish.  The vast majority vote based on the candidate on the ballot paper.  The majority of the space on the ballot paper is devoted to the candidate and his or her profession and address rather than his or her ideology or political party.  Can we justify the argument that Deputy Penrose is elected because of the Labour Party vote in Longford-Westmeath?  I doubt it.  I do not believe a Labour Party Deputy had been elected in that constituency prior to his election, and there probably will not be one again, because the vote was a personal vote for Deputy Penrose.  Can one argue that the Labour Party Deputies elected in 1997 were elected based on the Labour Party vote?  They actually went against the trend and were elected to the Parliament.</p><p>The same is true in my own case in 2002.  Had I relied on the Fine Gael vote in 2002, it is outside this House I would be sitting, not inside it.  Every other Fine Gael Deputy who was elected on that occasion bucked the political trend at the time.  It is the same with the Fianna F&aacute;il Members of this D&aacute;il who were elected in 2011.  They were not elected on the basis of the Fianna F&aacute;il vote.  </p><p> On a personal level, I find that comment derogatory.  In my own case, the Fine Gael vote is a relatively small percentage of the overall number of votes that I get.  In fact, any literature I have ever distributed has had a very small Fine Gael logo on it, either during a general election campaign or between elections.  I pride myself on representing every single constituent, regardless of his or her political persuasion.  If I can help someone, I will.  I have had card-carrying members of Fianna F&aacute;il come to my constituency office who will go out and canvass against me in a general election, but if I can facilitate or help them, I will do so.  I believe I have a constitutional obligation to represent them and their views in this Parliament.  I take that very seriously and that role is recognised in the Constitution.  I have a role as an individual among 166 individuals in this House.  For the record, when the Taoiseach came to open my constituency office and announce the closure of the accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital, there was no Fine Gael logo because I pride myself on representing every individual.  To say I should not be entitled to independent research because I was elected as a Fine Gael Deputy and that the people of Roscommon and south Leitrim voted for me because I was a Fine Gael candidate is insulting.  The people voted for me because I am prepared to stand up and call a spade a spade, which is what I did and now I am being penalised for it.  </p><p> It is not right that money is going to the Fine Gael Party for the Ceann Comhairle who is supposed to an independent arbitrator in the Chamber.  He is an independent arbitrator and it should not be the case that funding is going to the Fine Gael Party because he was elected as a Fine Gael Deputy.  He does not have access to the funding put in place and that is not right.</p><p> Most Deputies in this House would honestly agree - although they might not say it - that the biggest problem we have in this Parliament is the Whip system.  </p><p>Everything is subject to a three-line Whip.  One never hears about a two-line or a one-line Whip in voting on certain issues in this Parliament.  Admittedly, there must be a three-line Whip in government on issues of economic stability, confidence in the Government and so forth, but a very interesting incident happened here yesterday when legislation was being brought through the House.  The legislation in question was the Local Government Reform Bill and an amendment tabled by a Fine Gael Member and a Labour Party Member was taken on board by the Minister.  That is virtually unheard of in this House because people are afraid of the Whip system.  Every single Member, regardless of party-political persuasion, should be actively participating in the enactment of legislation and making changes, as is standard practice in every other parliament in the world.  However, because of the Whip system, Members are afraid to actively participate in debates and table amendments to legislation.  That undermines the power of the D&aacute;il and weakens government because Ministers are relying on their independent researchers and do not have to justify decisions here in a proper debate in the House.  Members who happen to stand up on a particular issue, whatever it may be, and say, &quot;No, this is not the right way to go,&quot; are penalised.  The Minister for Health came in and blatantly misled the House with figures.  He has consistently refused to come back in and correct the record, even when the matter was brought to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle.  He used the information to close an accident and emergency department and because I was not prepared to stand by the untruths in this Chamber and turn a blind eye to them, I have been denied the ability to actively participate in debates on an equal footing with every other Member.</p><p> We should be encouraging debate.  Almost 60% of people did not vote in the referendum on the Seanad.  In the last general election 40% did not vote.  Surely it makes far more sense to encourage political debate rather than undermine it.  In recent weeks I have been asked on numerous occasions about the Reform Alliance and whether it is a political party.  I am blue in the face saying, &quot;No, it is not.&quot;  It is a group of like-minded politicians and Members of this House who are coming together in order to be able to have a voice in this Chamber because we have been deliberately blocked by the Government.  Thankfully and thanks to the Ceann Comhairle, we have been given speaking rights.  I would not have had the opportunity to speak in this debate were it not for the intervention of the Ceann Comhairle who ensured we were given speaking rights.  </p><p> It is wrong that I do not have a role in parliamentary committees.  I stand by my record in parliamentary committees and defy any other Member to say I did not actively contribute to the debates and the work of any committee of which I was a member since I was elected to this House.  In fact, if one looks at my parliamentary committee record, one will see that it would shame many Members in the context of attendance, never mind participation, yet I am not given the right to speak at committees.  However, tt is not just me who has been affected.  A full one tenth of the Members of the D&aacute;il are denied speaking rights in the parliamentary committee system.  Various Ministers and members of the Government have said the committee system is the way forward.  They have said they are giving the system the teeth and the resources it needs, but at the same time, they are denying one tenth of the Members of the D&aacute;il the right to participate on an equal footing with their colleagues.  That is not right and no one should try to defend it.  </p><p> All we are looking for is fair play.  Money, far in excess of the amount given to Mr. Paul Kiely on a once-off basis, is being given on an annual basis to the Government parties.  That money should go back into the Exchequer and be spent on sick children in order that they can have a medical card; that their parents do not have to fight tooth and nail and literally sweat blood to get a medical card for their terminally ill child.  That would be a far better way of spending the money.  Representatives of every political party should come into the House and explain how they are spending it.  They should tell us if they have given salary increases or top-up payments to some of their staff from the &euro;14 million they receive in public funding.  They should also tell us if they have given top-up payments from moneys raised through fund-raising activities, over and above the public funds they receive.  The same questions that arise in relation to charities also arise in relation to political parties.  If it is good enough for charities to have to come out and explain what is going on, it is also good enough for political parties to do the same.  </p><p> Just because we want to work as a group to try to maximise our contributions to this Parliament and our participation in debates, we are being ridiculed by members of the Government.  I could not care less what they think because I have been given a constitutional role to speak on behalf of the people who elected me.  When I say &quot;the people who elected me&quot;, I mean every single person in my constituency.  I also have a responsibility to the people of the country as a whole.  I take my constitutional role very seriously and do not believe it is right or legal for any Government to undermine that role and my ability to participate in this House.  I urge the Government to look at this issue seriously and bring forward an amendment to the legislation on Committee Stage.  Let us treat every Member equally and give every Deputy an equal opportunity to speak in this House in informed debates.  Let us bring back relevance to this Chamber.  Let us bring back pride into it and have real political debates.  Let us make decisions that benefit the country and young people that will enable them to find a job here.</p></speech>

Such disillusionment is felt right across the population but it is particularly the case among younger people, who are witnessing the kind of stuff we have heard in recent times such as the Irish Water debacle, the CRC, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and going back to the Kevin Cardiff situation and the Anglo tapes.  All of those cases show up this country in a bad light and hold up a mirror for us which shows the scale of the problems affecting what is supposed to be a modern democracy in this country, and the fact that we have a very long way to go to have an accountable and transparent democratic system.  That in itself is very demoralising for many people and it is certainly disillusioning for many.  The most concerning aspect is the sense that there is no indication that the culture will change.  That underlies part of the reason so many young people have left good jobs in this country and have gone to live abroad.  The big challenge for us in the future when jobs come back on-stream and the economy eventually takes off again will be to try to create the type of country that our young emigrants will want to come back to.  The main thing that sickens people is the lack of accountability in this country and the fact that we still have a very healthy cronyism that permeates all aspects of life.  That is such a turn-off and is so demoralising for many Irish people.</p><p> The legislation is supposed to be about introducing reform to the political system and the way in which we fund politics and there are elements to it that cannot but be welcomed.  I refer to the arrangements for improved auditing of the party leader's allowance, the reduction of 10% in the allowance, provisions for inspection powers for the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, arrangements for the return of unspent moneys and other technical changes and the elimination of severance payments.  However, they indicate a mere scratching of the surface.  Another speaker referred to it as a box-ticking exercise for the reform of politics and the funding of politics.  It is literally only to say that the task has been completed and the Government introduced the Bill when we know that what is contained in the legislation does not go anywhere near what is required in terms of restoring confidence in the political system.  The Bill is exceptionally unambitious.  It is really a pretence of reform.  It only deals with one element of the political funding system.  There is no reference to the whole question of State funding and the need to reform that area or the staffing allowances which are very much stacked in favour of the political parties.  It is a far cry from the notion of any kind of democratic revolution or reform of Irish politics.</p><p> The Bill predominantly deals with the party leader's allowance, which will be renamed as the parliamentary activities allowance.  That is a more accurate name.  I will return to that.  The party leader's allowance is costing taxpayers approximately &euro;5.5 million per year.  It has been at that rate since approximately 2008.  The figure has not been reduced throughout all of the period of the recession.  Everyone, across society has had to make reductions in their personal spending.  Family incomes have experienced severe austerity but the reality is that there has been no austerity at all for political parties because their substantial funding has not been reduced throughout the period.  I venture to suggest that it is only now at this point when the parties in government are making strenuous efforts to try to restore some respectability to their activities that they are coming up with this figleaf or pretence at some kind of reform.  The basis on which we were told the party leader's allowance increased up to 2008 was that it was to keep in line with Civil Service remuneration but when it got to 2008 it remained at that level up to the present even when Civil Service remuneration was being reduced during the recession the party leader's allowances were not reduced.</p><p> The second serious problem I have with the party leader's allowance is the manner in which the weighting system operates.  The weighting system remains the same.  There is a weighting in place for Government Deputies and it has been reduced by 33% but that is too little.  I support the proposal made by Fianna F&aacute;il that the reduction should be increased to 50% for Government Deputies in order to reflect the huge armoury of the State in many respects as the Civil Service works with the Government in the Departments.  In addition, there is a separate system of political advisers.  They are paid from the public purse and in most cases get a top-up, which calls into question the mock outrage we heard in recent times about organisations such as the CRC and so many others that are paying top-ups because, in effect, many of the current Ministers pay top-ups to their advisers.  A pay limit is supposed to apply to ministerial advisers and a lot of noise was made about that when the Government was formed but that has been honoured in the breach rather than in adherence to it.  It is interesting to look at those figures.  Many Ministers have no credibility when it comes to talking about the need for people to tighten their belts and to live within the guidelines and the rules because they have made cases for their own political staff to receive top-ups.  The Government parties have the Civil Service and the whole ministerial advisory system at their disposal and for that reason it is only reasonable that there would be a stronger weighting for Government Deputies, which should be at 50%.  I would be supportive of amendments in that regard.</p><p> There is huge variation in payments among Opposition Deputies.  The way the system currently operates is that for each of the first ten members of a party, the party leader gets an allowance of &euro;71,000.  Even with the weighting, the allowance for each of the first ten party members who are Government Deputies is &euro;47,680.  Independents get &euro;41,000.  I do not know the justification for that other than to bolster the strength of the parties and to weaken the influence of Independent Members.  Again, it is fundamentally undemocratic to have a funding system that operates in such a manner.  Everyone who comes into this House is honoured to be elected by his or her constituents.</p><p>Every Member has an equal mandate and should be treated equally when it comes to supports for performing their parliamentary duties.  To do otherwise is fundamentally undemocratic in my view.  We have a system that does not treat Members equally.  Some get an opportunity to play a fuller part than others because the House is dominated by parties.</p><p> The idea people vote for some candidates because of their party membership is nonsense.  It is very far from what is on people&rsquo;s minds when they cast their vote.  We have seen that where in spite of a big swing against a particular party, individual candidates from the very same party have held their seats comfortably.  The whole point of Independents being treated unequally is wrong and needs to be dealt with.  I will be tabling amendments to that effect on Committee Stage.</p><p> There are some Members who were elected under a party banner but who, for various reasons, resigned from both their parliamentary and political party to become Independent Members.  These Members, including myself and my colleague here beside me, Deputy Mathews, have been disgracefully treated in that the funding provided, in theory, to support us in our parliamentary duties and responsibilities has been withdrawn.  I do not know the basis for this move or how it could stand up to any legal challenge, given all Members have an equal mandate.  Why does the funding system favour certain Members while completely disregarding others?</p></speech>

He suggested some Members missed the point because this funding, designed to support parliamentary activity, should reflect the wishes of the electorate.  Yes, I agree wholeheartedly that it should reflect the wishes of the electorate.  Some of us, however, are now Independent Members, ex-party Members, because of our determination to reflect the wishes of our electorate.</p><p>  In my own case, part of the reason people voted Labour in the last general election, was because the Labour Party at that point stood for the allocation of resources on the basis of need.  When this principle was completely disregarded and trampled upon in the Department of Health, to be fair to the people who elected me, I believed I had no choice to resign from my ministerial position and, indeed, from the Labour Party.  I was very much reflecting the views of the electorate.  Other Members who find themselves in a similar situation would argue the same point where they stood by commitments given by their erstwhile parties but now find themselves excommunicated, unable to play a full role in this House.  That is fundamentally undemocratic and unfair.  It is wrong and the Minister knows that is the case.</p><p>  Even if one were to go along with the Minister&rsquo;s argument about the principle, it can be thrown by the wayside because of some of the principles of the new provisions in this Bill.  For example, if Members of a party that was dissolved form a new party, the funding of the dissolved party can be restored to the new entity.  Accordingly, there is a recognition that the status of Members can change during a D&aacute;il.  Deputy Donnelly provided some interesting figures during his contribution.  He made the point that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, through the leader's allowance, are in receipt of approximately &euro;80,000 per annum for each one of the Members who had left or had been expelled from their parliamentary parties.  There is no basis for those public moneys continuing to go to those party leaders.  I call on the party leaders to return that money to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

As Deputy Naughten said, that funding is actually being used by the two parties to undermine the role being played by these Independent Members.  These Members are serious about carrying out the mandate they received from the electorate and playing a full part in the House&rsquo;s business but there are party workers working away to undermine this.  It is fundamentally undemocratic to continue the payment of this allowance.  I call on the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to refund these moneys to the Exchequer because they are receiving it under false pretences.  That is wrong and those moneys should be returned forthwith.</p></speech>

It raises fundamental issues about the nature of our democracy and the Whip system.  The threat of removing the kind of research, technical and press supports, supports on which all Members depend upon to fulfil our roles in this House, which are available as result of this funding is part and parcel of the three-line Whip system.  It is all or nothing.  It plays into that threatening and bullying culture that exists in this House, operated by some of the party Whips.  It is a case of doing it their way or one will find oneself out on a limb with no supports and they will make life really difficult.  That is the message given to Members who have the temerity to stand up to their party leaders and go against their parties, acting on their own conscience as to what they believe is right and elected to do.  This culture undermines the democratic process in this House.  It is wrong and should not be tolerated.  It is a glaring omission in this legislation that needs to be addressed.  If we are serious about restoring confidence in the democratic system in our Parliament, I believe we have no choice but to change that arrangement and introduce a system that treats every Member equally and fairly, equally recognising the mandate each of us has.</p></speech>

There is a feeble attempt at something in this legislation, and while I do not wish to sound dismissive of an attempt in any way, I must be honest and state it is a feeble attempt.  I wish to speak in the language I would use with my family, whom I respect, about these matters.  This is my mandated and serious family of 166 people.  I am not in the business of playing with words, but I am here because I put myself forward as honestly as I could as a candidate for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The mode of conveyance was the Fine Gael party, which I thought still had the remnants of The Just Society and all that went with that, but my experience has been disappointing.  I did not seek trouble but was hoping to help mend the mess in this country because of the dark clouds of what one can only describe as occult behaviour that are coming across one's horizons at present in little glimpses.  I refer to the Central Remedial Clinic, Rehab and so on, but as Deputy Shortall mentioned them all earlier, I will not go through them.  However, it is shockingly disappointing.  Were Members serious about reform in the area of this Bill, they would start with a clean slate.  They would ask what they wished to do in this regard.  Members would note the House has 166 people who are dedicated to parliamentary arrangement and work for the people of Ireland, would note that they need resources and would start from scratch.  Instead of this, Members are tinkering with stuff dishonestly under a pretence.  Deputy Naughten put in more hour power on the Joint Committee on Health and Children than anyone else.

The issue pertains to the difficulties and concerns of families with children who have narcolepsy and the need to provide them with assurances that they will receive the necessary supports as the children grow into adulthood.  To put this into context, this arose from the administration of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine Pandemrix a number of years ago.  While this affects a small number of children nationwide, their whole lives were turned upside down and they will never be the same again.  Within a short time of the vaccine being administered there was a noticeable change in their behaviour, such as falling asleep at school or at home at regular intervals, even though they may have had ten hours' sleep the previous night.  In addition, there were mood swings, temper tantrums, facial twitches, drooping eyes, weight gain, slurred speech and many other symptoms.  My understanding is this affects approximately 60 families, although the Minister may be able to update that figure.  While the confirmation of this illness takes time, it is not expected that there will be a limitless number of cases.  In other words, a solution will not be prevented by the potential opening of the floodgates to an enormous number of cases or anything like that.  However, it is a life-changing experience for those affected - that is, the children themselves and their entire family.</p><p>  In fairness, the Minister indicated in April 2012 that a package of supports would be put in place to support the children and families affected, which was both welcomed and necessary.  I have met one family involved in particular and the families sought some form of security and certainty that on confirmation of the illness, there would be automatic access to supports by way of discretionary medical cards, educational needs and home tuition.  Such supports encompassed several Departments, such as the Department of Social Protection in respect of carer's allowance.  In the case of the family with which I dealt, the father gave up his job and now is at home looking after the needs of his son.  Difficulties sometimes have occurred in this area on foot of a lack of joined-up thinking between different Departments, such as the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection, with regard to different interpretations of what is needed in particular cases and how to get access to it.  There also is the issue of the children reaching the age of 18, because people of 18 or 20 need supports in a different context and setting as they move on with their lives.</p><p>  The most recent issue was triggered last December when, just before Christmas, a number of the families involved received letters stating that certain services were being withdrawn.  My understanding is that they were pursuing legal action and the umbrella group that represents them, Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder, SOUND, was obliged to appear before the High Court, where those letters were set aside.  Effectively, my role today is to highlight this issue and to get certainty for the families who are going through this trauma.  While the number affected may be small, it is a huge matter in their lives.  I seek final clarity as to what is meant by the setting aside of those letters.  Does it mean they could be reinstated at a later stage?  One can imagine the fear and anxiety caused by the receipt of such a letter and I ask that this be clarified today.  In addition, I seek clarity on what supports are in place for the families and whether they still will be available after the children reach the age of 18.</p></speech>

First, I acknowledge the impact of this on those diagnosed with narcolepsy following administration of Pandemrix influenza vaccine, as well as the impact it has had their families.  I have heard directly from the families and the parents regarding their personal experiences.</p><p>I note with optimism that the earliest indications from scientific and medical research into this condition suggest that the prognosis for children may be better than previously indicated and that they should be able, with appropriate medication and supports, to reach their potential.  It is important that these children continue to receive effective treatment and supports.  Second, I commend the dedication and commitment of the officials in the HSE advocacy unit and the regional co-ordinators in providing those affected and their families with tailored services and supports to address their specific individual needs.</p><p> As Deputies are aware, a number of families have recently initiated legal action alleging personal injury in which they are claiming the development of narcolepsy resulted from the administration of the pandemic vaccine.  It is inappropriate for me to comment further on these cases, but I support their absolute right to do so.  Following the receipt of letters from solicitors representing a number of individuals indicating their intention to initiate legal proceedings, legal advices were obtained by my Department.  The advices obtained recommended delegation of the management of these cases and, any subsequent similar cases, to the State Claims Agency.  I approved this course of action in June 2013.</p><p> A Government decision was required to give effect to this approach.  The Government decision was obtained in October and allowed the Taoiseach to sign the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions)(Amendment) Order 2013 on 15 October.  The management of the cases was transferred to the State Claims Agency upon the order coming into effect.</p><p> Public and media confusion around the provision of health services and supports, including the provision of discretionary medical cards, arose from communications by the HSE.  The HSE has apologised for any distress or upset caused and has clarified the situation with the families involved.  I understand that regarding individuals who have initiated legal proceedings, the HSE has advised that all expenses associated with narcolepsy will continue to be reimbursed on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis until the litigation process is finalised.  My priority, and that of the Government and the HSE, has been always to ensure that individuals affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination receive the health care and support they specifically need, regardless of whether they choose to take legal action.</p></speech>

That is very necessary and welcome.  The family that came to me about this has no wish to go the legal route but does wish to get absolute clarity and supports that will be continued right after the child grows to adulthood.  Will the Minister address the issue of supports for over-18 year olds and adults?  A few days ago the family in question received a letter stating their medical card is being reviewed.  I know about the medical card review process but it increases the fears for families.</p><p>  It is a limited number of people but their lives have been turned upside down and will continue to be so in the future.  The main message is security and certainty into the future.  The issues that have arisen seemed to have been solved a couple of years ago with the package the Minister announced but, from the recent letters that have been sent out, that does not seem to be the case.  While the media may have misinterpreted it, it is important that there be clarity and joined-up thinking between the Departments, and security and certainty for the families.</p></speech>

The whole scheme is based on financial hardship, as the Act states.  I have no wish as Minister for Health to be involved in any situation which makes life more difficult for those who have suffered as a consequence of vaccinations that were produced, administered and received in good faith.  I have discussed with the chief medical officer the need for a no-fault compensation scheme to be put in place, particularly for the victims of vaccine damage.  It is through no fault of their own and they are contributing to the common good by allowing themselves to be vaccinated.  This protects not just themselves but others in the community who may not be able to avail of a vaccine, but who will not be faced with exposure to a particular disease because it has been nearly eradicated.</p><p>  Staged payments is an important issue because in this situation the original prognosis for this condition has improved and should continue to improve over the years.  However, Deputy O'Mahony's very genuine and legitimate concern on behalf of those parents is what will happen to those children when they pass 18 years of age if they are still seriously impeded as a consequence of this condition.  We will continue to support them in every way we can.  Even though they be over the age of 18 or 25 they may very likely still have educational requirements.  We must support them in that.  There has been great co-operation between me and the Minister for Education and Skills in providing a broad range of supports and services.  They should remain in place for as long as they are required as well as any other facilities made available to those who have suffered as a consequence of the vaccine.</p></speech>

It received funding from both Arts Councils on the island.  According to the Arts Council:<blockquote>The scheme aims to challenge and inspire creativity, experimentation and artistic excellence.  Each applicant can apply for a maximum of &pound;5,000 or the euro equivalent.  The grants are to enable the production of new work.</blockquote>The scheme is managed by Belfast based Arts and Disability Forum, ADF.  The decision to withdraw the funding by the Arts Council was revealed in a letter to Chris Ledger, chief executive of ADF, which has managed the scheme on behalf of both Arts Councils since the year 2000.  The Art's Council's letter stated that as a result of an 11% reduction in its own funding it has decided to explore alternative ways of meeting the needs of the arts and disability sector in Ireland and it decided to withdraw funding altogether.  The scheme has allocated a total of &euro;640,565.45 to 216 projects on the island since its inception in 2000.  The scheme had been valuable in promoting the careers of disabled and deaf artists.  The future is now uncertain for disabled and deaf artists as the cuts in funding signals the end of the ADAI.</p><p>  ADAI is a unique cross-Border scheme which has benefitted dozens of disabled and deaf artists.  It will come to an end unless the decision to withdraw funding is reversed.  Artists from both sides of the Border who have received ADAI bursaries have gone on to win awards, commissions, recording or publishing deals and major grants.  For example one artist was short-listed for the Hennessy literary award last year, two albums were released, a Wellcome Trust award was granted and an artist who got started with an ADAI grant has won seven international awards.  Each of these is a success story in itself.</p><p>The ADAI programme has been extremely valuable in providing dedicated year round support for disabled and deaf artists who are on a professional career path.  It has enabled them to compete in a very tough market.</p><p> The ADAI scheme itself is a past recipient of an Aisling award for cross-Border co-operation.  One artist who benefited from the grants scheme, Cathy Henderson, recently completed a commissioned project with the internationally renowned Robert Ballagh to design a commemorative artwork celebrating the centenary of the 1913 Lockout and the establishment of the ITGWU.  If we are serious about commemorating 1913 and all it stood for and represents in our history, we must set about establishing an inclusive society and must ensure artists with disabilities are supported and included.</p><p> I appeal to the Minster to use whatever influence he has, both financial and political, to ensure that funding is restored to this worthwhile project.</p></speech>

I remind her that primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the national agency for funding, developing and promoting the arts in Ireland.  The council was established in 1951 to stimulate public interest in and promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts.  It is an autonomous body, under the aegis of my Department.  The Arts Council is funded by my Department, but it is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations.  This includes independence in its funding decisions.  In 2014 the Arts Council will receive an allocation of &euro;56.9 million in current and capital funding.  I cannot intervene in Arts Council funding decisions.  Indeed, I am statute barred from doing so.</p><p>  The 2014 allocations, which were made in the difficult economic climate in which we now find ourselves, provide for almost &euro;123 million for arts, culture and film.  As well as the funding of &euro;56.9 million to the Arts Council, other significant funding for agencies and bodies that operate under the aegis of my Department include &euro;14 million to the Irish Film Board, &euro;11.5 million to the National Museum and &euro;7.5 million to the National Gallery of Ireland.</p><p>  For 2014, there has been a core reduction of approximately &euro;16.9 million, or 7%, in Exchequer funding to the Department.  Therefore, difficult choices had to be made with regard to funding for 2014.  Notwithstanding this, and even with a reduced departmental budget, every week more than &euro;2.3 million will be invested in arts, culture and film this year.  This allocation will help to maintain and support the important role played by the arts in innovation, cultural expression, job creation and economic recovery.</p><p>  As I mentioned previously, under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and neither I nor my Department has a role to play in its executive or funding decisions.  In a wider context, the Arts Council support for a range of art forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013.  This strategy document, which is available on the council's website, lays out the key strategic principles that inform the council's funding decisions.</p><p>  I understand that in light of the current funding environment and the changed landscape for arts and disability practice in Ireland, the Arts Council took the decision to cease its support of the arts and disability awards with effect from January 2014.  I also understand that the Arts Council has for some time been considering these supports and is exploring more effective ways of using resources so as to meet needs of the sector and ensure optimum value for money.  I am informed that the Arts Council remains committed to supporting arts and disability practice and to delivering on its policy in this area.  I am also informed that in 2014, notwithstanding the council's own funding reductions, it has maintained funding to Arts and Disability Ireland, the national development and resource organisation for arts and disability, at 2013 levels.</p><p>  Furthermore, in addition to other supports which it offers, over 2013- 4, the Arts Council developed and invested in Ignite, a new commissioning initiative to facilitate the creation of ambitious new work by professional artists with disabilities, which represents the largest ever investment in Ireland's arts and disability sector.  Ignite is managed by a partnership involving the Arts Council, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland, Cork City Council, Galway City Council, Galway County Council and Mayo County Council.</p></speech>

This is a serious issue and it was important to discuss it here today.  To be honest, I do not care whose remit it comes under.  Deputy Deenihan is the Minister and I believe he can intervene and appeal to him to do so.  He can, at least, discuss the issue with the council to find out what else it will do to support people with disabilities.</p><p>  This is not a normal cut to funding.  This 11% cut is not in line with the cut to the Arts Council.  I see it as a slash and burn approach and yet again it is people with disabilities who are getting burned.  Across all Departments, there seem to be serious cuts to services for people with disabilities.  This is unjust and unacceptable.  I know the Minister recognises this is wrong and I appeal to him once again to intervene on this important issue.</p></speech>

It is 6.2%, and if we remove the figure included for the Irish Presidency, it is less than 5%.  Since becoming Minister, I have managed the reduction in Arts Council funding as much as possible.  The first year's reduction was just 3% and last year it was just 4%.  The new Ignite programme and initiative aims to facilitate the creation of new work by professional artists with a disability.  This initiative represents the largest investment ever in Ireland in the arts and disability sector.  While the Arts Council may have discontinued the particular programme mentioned by the Deputy, I advise her to consider the Ignite programme and the fact it has been well resourced and funded.  There may be opportunities in that for the people she represents.  I agree with her that people with disabilities deserve as much special treatment as possible and suggest she looks at the Ignite programme to see if those she is representing can be supported by it.</p></speech>

President Yanukovych continues to abuse power against his people.  The introduction of laws to prohibit any kind of demonstration against the government has directly deprived Ukrainians of their most basic civil rights.  These provisions have resulted in the turmoil we are seeing on our television screens daily.</p><p>  Yesterday, things took a darker turn and we witnessed the first fatalities in the on-going protests taking place in Ukraine, as tensions between the government and opposition parties heighten further.  Up to five people are reported to have been killed in Kiev.  Media reports state these protestors died from gunshot wounds.  This is a deeply upsetting and a regrettable turn of events.  Even in the days of the pro-democracy Orange Revolution in 2004, no fatal violence was seen on the streets of the Ukrainian capital.  Today, barricades are still burning in the city while billowing black smoke rises from the piles of tyres that now mark the front line between the riot police and the protesters.</p><p>  I understand that Ukrainian opposition leaders are due to meet President Yanukovych today to seek out a compromise on the way forward.  Unfortunately, agreement seems a faraway prospect. </p><p>The opposition threat to go on the attack unless concessions are made by President Yanukovych is unlikely to yield an agreement.  The claims by the government that the protests are being led by ultra-nationalists and terrorists show how wide the divide between the two sides in this crisis has become.</p><p> The increasingly authoritarian style of the Ukrainian Government should be of great concern to all democrats who support the concept of basic human rights.  The European Union has a responsibility to exert pressure on President Yanukovych to stop the implementation of dramatic new laws banning almost all forms of protest activity and the violent enforcement of these laws.  The reports this week that the body of opposition activist Yuri Verbitsky had been found in woods outside Kiev and had signs of torture are deeply troubling.  It is a wake-up call for all of us in the European Union.  This crisis is on its doorstep and the Union is a central actor in the political crisis which has arisen.  The anti-government protests flared up almost three months ago in late November over the President's decision to pull out of a landmark treaty to enhance political and economic co-operation with the European Union which must use its voice to support those in the Ukraine who support human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  It must stand with those who believe in a better future for all in Ukraine.</p><p> I am glad that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs is here to respond.  I request him, his colleagues in government and our officials in the European Union and other international organisations to use Ireland's voice and influence, particularly at the Foreign Affairs Council, to call for targeted sanctions against the Ukrainian authorities for the continuous abuse of human rights and the increasing violence being used against its citizens.</p></speech>

It is one in which I have a very strong interest because I had the opportunity to attend the partnership summit in Vilnius at which the agreement to which he Deputy referred did not materialise.  A number of weeks afterwards I attended the OSCE ministerial Council in Kiev and saw at first hand the pressures in the country to which he referred.  On the evening of the Council I spent a number of hours on Independence Square speaking to people who expressed their huge disappointment at the government's decision not to sign an association agreement with the European Union.  Since I was there three very important developments have taken place and the Deputy touched on at least one of them.  The European Union made it very clear after the partnership summit that the door was open to a future agreement and finding a way of working with Ukraine.  That is still the case.  In the immediate aftermath of the meeting Ukraine signed a number of agreements with Russia to tighten integration.  </p><p>  The second development to which the Deputy directly alluded was the enactment of new laws which went through Parliament on the status of groups in Ukraine.  This also impacted on the right of assembly of groups and resulted in changes to the immunity granted to Members of the Ukrainian Parliament.  </p><p>  The third and most worrying development has occurred in recent days.  It concerns the number of people who have lost their lives and the allegations of torture which have surfaced with regard to people who were protesting against the stance of the government.</p><p>  I reiterate to the House Ireland's message on all of this: violence cannot be a solution to break the impasse.  We send this message to everybody involved in the dispute in Ukraine.  However, it is very clear that President Yanukovych and his government have a particular responsibility to ensure violence ends before we see a further escalation.</p><p>  On the Deputy's point and question about Ireland's participation in this regard, the T&aacute;naiste participated at the Foreign Affairs Council which took place on Monday, at which a very extensive discussion took place on the situation in Ukraine.  The Council expressed its deep concern about the legislation which had been passed and called on the Ukrainian Government to reverse the measures taken and ensure they were brought into line with the country's European and international commitments.  The Council also stated that the only way in which this crisis could be resolved was through a democratic solution and dialogue.  </p><p>  With regard to the actions of the Government today, members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Ukrainian ambassador to reiterate the views I have just expressed.  We must call for the utmost restraint; there has to be an immediate end to violence; and serious talks must begin between the government and the opposition to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p></speech>

He is obviously very well informed after his visit to the area and seeing at first hand what was happening on the streets of the Ukrainian capital.  The mass demonstrations and protests began more than two months ago and directly resulted from the postponement by the President of an historic EU deal.  Instead he opted for closer ties with Russia, creating huge instability and, unfortunately, violence and, sadly, the loss of life.  What is the European Union doing to press for the release of the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko?  If the Minister of State does not have up-to-date information on the matter, he can come back to me.  Some time ago the European Union described her imprisonment as justice being applied selectively with political motivation.  It is another issue in this country and region that we need to keep on the European Union's agenda and that of the international community.</p></speech>

The Deputy may be aware that a number of mediators were appointed by the Union, including Mr. Pat Cox, who invested a huge amount of time in travelling to Ukraine to deal with figures in the political sphere to find a solution.  This did not happen and the wider crisis has escalated significantly.  As I mentioned, I was on Independence Square and one could not help but be struck by the tens of thousands of people who were there in sub-zero conditions.  I got there very late at night and saw the huge array of people waving Ukrainian and EU flags, which was a very striking sight.  They were waving them as an expression of their hope for better days and better government for their country.  We reiterate the need for restraint.  The Government communicated this directly today via the Ukrainian ambassador, emphasising the particular responsibility of the Ukrainian Government in this regard.</p><p>Earlier, the EU external action service, which is the common diplomatic representative arm of the Union, stated it would send a delegation to Kiev to see what further role we can play in resolving this crisis.</p></speech>

Everyone will be familiar with the coverage in the national press today of the remarks of Judge Anthony Halpin in Tallaght District Court regarding a breakdown of social order.  During the sitting, he suggested that there is a necessity for the Civil Defence to become involved in policing the area.  I reject that entirely.  I am one of the almost 100,000 citizens who live in Tallaght and I can confirm no such situation exists.  His remarks have incensed the local population and residents are furious about them for good reason.  By implication, if he suggests that social order has broken down and proposes something that bypasses the existing policing framework, he has strayed too far.</p><p>  The relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community I represent has been built over many years in a progressive and solid way, especially the community policing element of it.  Tallaght is a largely working class area and it has the youngest population of any urban area in the State.  I am on record requesting the judge to withdraw his remarks due to their insensitivity.  He framed his remarks in court because of tragedies that have taken place.  However, unfortunately, there have been terrible tragedies throughout the country since 1 January resulting in loss of life.  To select an area where one incident had taken place and say that all social order has broken down is grossly unfair to the local community.  It is regrettable that these comments insensitively disregarded An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which enjoys the support of virtually all the population in Tallaght.</p><p>  We are constantly reminded as legislators about the separation of powers and not to stray into areas overseen by the Judiciary.  I agree it is no place for us as parliamentarians but, likewise, judges have a responsibility.  In this case, the remarks were grossly insensitive and the House should record that Judge Halpin should withdraw them.</p></speech>

The Minister regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business.  He does not consider it appropriate to comment on remarks made by a member of the Judiciary, apparently during the course of court proceedings.  Law enforcement policy is a matter for the Executive.  Accordingly, I will curtail his comments to the general proposition that the assistance of the Civil Defence is required in respect of policing arrangements in Tallaght or any other part of the country.  I appreciate the strength of the social order in Tallaght and in all parts of our country.  The reason that has built up is the co-operation outlined by the Deputy between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  I see this in my constituency through the operation of policing fora and the engagement between garda&iacute; and residents associations and individual community members.  This is the reason we are fortunate to have strong social order within local communities and the country as a whole during the difficult times we are enduring.</p><p>  The underlying concern is the provision of effective policing, and the Minister for Justice and Equality shares the Deputy's desire that the most effective strategies to counter and prevent crime be pursued in Tallaght and elsewhere.  In this regard, he is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner, who assures him that the significant resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are effectively deployed to meet policing needs in the Tallaght area.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware of these resources through his work but 174 members of the force are assigned to the Tallaght sub-district, supplemented by 14 members of the Garda Reserve and supported by 11 civilian staff.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda national policing plan has a strong focus on active engagement with communities to support crime reduction and crime prevention.  I experience this every day in my own constituency work and I am sure the Deputy has the same experience in his area.  This strategic approach also guides local policing plans, which are tailored to the specific circumstances in each area.   In this regard the Minister is advised that Garda figures for the year 2013 indicate a reduction of 11% in incidents of violent crime as well as a 22% reduction in public order offences in the Tallaght sub-district in comparison to the year 2012.</p><p>  The Minister is, however, conscious of the serious concerns in the Tallaght area arising from two recent violent deaths.  Both incidents are under active consideration, with all the necessary Garda resources devoted to these tasks and several charges have been brought in respect of one of the incidents.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment further on the particular cases other than to encourage anyone with information to come forward.</p><p>  The Minister does not accept the proposition that the assistance of the Civil Defence is required in respect of the policing arrangements in Tallaght or any other area.  The role of the Civil Defence, as a volunteer-based organisation, is to support emergency services in incidents such as dealing with severe weather, flooding, major accidents, fire fighting and searching for missing people.  Civil Defence members are trained and equipped accordingly and their role does not extend to policing or crime prevention matters.  In light of this, the Minister considers that it would not be appropriate or effective to engage the Civil Defence in support of general measures to combat crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the national police force, is the body with the appropriate authority, expertise and resources to combat and prevent crime and rightly has the widespread support of the community in Tallaght and elsewhere throughout the country to achieve that aim.</p></speech>

The information provided is very helpful and clear in regard to the respective roles of the Minister for Justice and Equality and local representatives.  Tallaght is a new town that has evolved over the past 40 years from a country village into a population centre of almost 100,000 residents.  Present day Tallaght is effectively a city and I hope we will be able to achieve city status over the lifetime of this Government given that it is the third largest population centre in the country.  I reiterate that the remarks by Judge Halpin are regrettable and should be withdrawn.</p></speech>

While my knowledge of the area is limited compared to the Deputy's I am aware of the considerable growth it has experienced and of the strength of its community.  In respect to the substantive issue, the Minister is firmly of the view that policing is a matter for the appropriate organisation, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
