    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800003#A00200"><p>Speaking on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; last Thursday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, conceded that the Government will not meet its housing targets for this year.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	In relation to direct social housing building, the target for 2022 is 9,000. ... We do not believe at this juncture that 9,000 will be met. </blockquote>  <p>I take it that he stands over that comment.  His remarks at least shed some reality, in contrast with the assertions made by the Taoiseach and the housing Minister that the Government is on track and its housing policies are working.</p><p>Despite the Taoiseach's repeated refrain that housing is the single biggest social issue facing the Government, what we see is failure to plan and failure to deliver.  The Government promised 9,000 social homes this year.  By the end of June, it had delivered only 1,765.  It promised 4,100 affordable homes this year.  It has delivered only 925 to date.  This means the Government will miss its social and affordable housing targets for the third year in a row.  Those are targets, by the way, that do not come close to meeting the level of housing need in society.  In addition, the Government refused to introduce a ban on rent increases.  These are rents that are crippling tenants, are at record levels and are continuing to rise.  Meanwhile, homelessness is at an historic high.  Even with the ban on evictions, it is likely to rise.  Child homelessness has increased by a staggering 51% since April 2021.  It beggars belief that any member of the Government could claim its housing policies are working.  Does the Minister, Deputy McGrath, accept not alone that the Government is missing its targets but, in fact, that its entire approach to housing has failed?</p><p>To make matters worse, we hear the Government is &euro;2 billion behind in its annual housing spending in its capital spend.  That is not likely to change in the next six weeks.  That means &euro;2 billion sitting there while people watch housing prices go through the roof and know they have no chance of affording their own homes, while young mothers and fathers and their children squeeze into the box rooms of their own parents' homes and while families languish for years and years on council housing waiting lists.  People caught up in the never-ending housing crisis will be shocked and angered by this.  It highlights again that the Government is incapable of bringing the required urgency to deliver the homes that are needed.</p> <p>We now see young people voting with their feet when it comes to housing.  Young people throughout Ireland are leaving because they cannot put a secure, affordable roof over their heads.  It is now time to deliver.  Conas go bhfuil an Rialtas ag tarraingt na gcos le &euro;2 billi&uacute;n de chaiteachas tith&iacute;ochta i l&aacute;r g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime tith&iacute;ochta nach bhfacthas riamh roimhe?  Seo g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ina bhfuil &aacute;r ndaoine &oacute;ga ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il na t&iacute;re i gcomhair seans le saol n&iacute;os fearr a bheith acu thar lear.</p> <p> The Minister is in charge of public expenditure.  He holds the purse strings.  How is sitting on &euro;2 billion for housing happening when so many people are in desperate and unprecedented housing need?  How can the Government claim it is doing everything it can to end the housing crisis, while sitting on this huge sum of money?  It is failure to plan, failure to deliver and, by the Minister's own acceptance and admissions, failure to meet what are at best low-level targets.  Fail, fail, fail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800004#B00200"><p>This Government has acknowledged from the very beginning the scale of the challenge we face as a country in housing and the provision of accommodation for our people, whether it is private housing, public housing, cost rental or affordable purchase.  We have prioritised investment in housing since coming into office in the summer of 2020.  That is delivering results.  Do we believe that more needs to be done?  Absolutely.  The challenge is still immense but it is a challenge we will meet.</p>  <p>  The overall target by way of housing output of all forms in the current year is 24,600 in the Housing for All strategy.  We are confident that this number will be significantly exceeded.  That will be the highest number of new homes built for a very long time in our country.  The Deputy raised the specific issue of social housing.  The target in the Housing for All plan, by way of total additions to the social housing stock in the current year, is 10,500.  That is principally made up of new builds.  The point I will make, in answering the Deputy's question directly, which I always seek to do, is that we currently estimate we will build approximately 8,000 new homes but that will be supplemented by purchases and leases of new homes.  In our view, that will bring us close to, if not in a position to reach, the overall target of 10,500 social housing additions to the stock in 2022, which is the highest number in this country for a long number of years.</p>  <p>  We are tackling the housing challenge using all the levers at our disposal.  As a Government, we are partnering with local authorities and approved housing bodies, and getting back to delivering public housing at scale for the first time in a generation.  That is the right thing to do.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies are welcoming new developments as they are being opened throughout the country, which they are welcome to do, in addition to turning up at the launches of the Housing for All schemes all over Ireland-----</p></speech>

In addition, we are investing in affordable housing for the first time in well over a decade, including new affordable purchase schemes which Sinn F&eacute;in opposed.  The Land Development Agency is now on site and is delivering homes for our people, both public housing and cost rental homes.  Again, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the establishment of the agency.   We also have the help-to-buy scheme, which is there to support first-time buyers whom we acknowledge are struggling in many instances to bridge the gap between the amount they can borrow and the cost of purchasing a new home in Ireland today.  Close to 28,000 new homes were built in our country in the 12 months to September 2022.  There were almost 21,000 house completions in the first nine months of this year.  This is already exceeding the total for 2021, which was approximately 20,500.  We are projected to reach more than 26,000 new homes by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge there is much work yet to be done but we are working very closely with the local authorities and the approved housing bodies to deliver new homes across the country.  We also need the private sector to continue to deliver homes for our people.  We will see Part V affordable homes come on stream again, for the first time in a long time, because of the change in the law brought in by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p> <p>It is challenging for many people to purchase a home.  Many are caught in that rental trap.  The Central Bank's macroprudential rules have made some change and will assist people in that regard.  I assure the Irish people that tackling the housing challenge is a top priority of this Government.  We are providing the investment.  It is delivering results.  We will double down on that to make more progress for our people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800005#C00200"><p>I noticed the glee on the Government benches as Members congratulated themselves on housing delivery.  The Taoiseach was in attendance at one of those great launches, at which one of the families who got the keys to their home had been on a social housing waiting list for 14 years.  That is a generation.  That is the time it takes to raise a family.  As we meet and speak here, there are families, as I said to the Minister earlier, who are raising their children in the box rooms of their parents' homes.  There are kids and families in bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels and so on.  There is a sense of desperation everywhere.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister about the undershoot of &euro;2 billion in respect of capital spend on housing the Government is sitting on.  How in the name of God is the Government falling &euro;2 billion short on its spend on housing and sitting on that &euro;2 billion in circumstances in which people have been on housing lists for a decade and more, living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and desperate, with no real prospects?  That needs to be explained by the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800005#C00300"><p>There is no &euro;2 billion in capital underspend on housing.  As the Deputy knows, it is always the case that the final quarter of the year is the period in which there is the largest delivery.  That is when schemes get closed out, accounts get done and drawdown of payments happens.  There will be no such underspend in respect of housing capital this year.  Any underspend, as the Deputy knows, is subject to a carry-forward provision whereby it can be carried forward, subject to an overall rule in respect of 10% of the ceiling for that Vote into the following year.</p>  <p>  The truth, which the Deputy does not want to hear, is that Sinn F&eacute;in has opposed all the schemes that are making a difference for people who want to buy a home in Ireland, whether it be the help-to-buy scheme, the work of the Land Development Agency or the work of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in bringing forward the First Home shared equity scheme, in respect of which over 600 eligibility certificates have been provided at this point, because Sinn F&eacute;in seems to have a calculation in mind that it is in its political self-interest to sustain the housing crisis.</p></speech>

It is very important that he is representing Ireland at COP27 in Egypt today because it is vital that we see really strong leadership at national and international level on tackling the climate catastrophe.  As COP has got under way, we have been hearing increasingly bleak prognoses from world leaders.  We heard Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, UN Secretary General, say we are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.  He is not mincing his words, nor is our former President, Mary Robinson, in her strong warnings this morning on radio urging far more rapid and urgent implementation of promised measures here and internationally.  While world leaders have committed previously to keep global warming below 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, far from achieving that we are on track to reach a 2.8&deg;C rise by the end of the century, and eight of the ten hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade.  If we miss our global warming targets, we will not have to wait long to see the consequences.  We are already seeing them now, with devastating floods in Pakistan, the devastating famine encroaching on the Horn of Africa, the drought there and the excessive heatwaves in Europe.  Here in Ireland, on a balmy, sunny November afternoon, we can see the consequences of climate change ourselves with the bizarre environmental impacts on our plant life, with real risks to our biodiversity and with unthinkable things happening in our environment and in agriculture.</p> <p>The things we take for granted, like having land that is capable of food production, are now at real risk.  We watched lots of horror movies during the Halloween season but I can think of nothing more scary than the immediate future facing us with this imminent climate catastrophe.  The failure to take international action has generated cynicism among many activists, included Greta Thunberg, but the COP process is the only game in town.  It is the only international forum where we can see world leaders come together to try to achieve change, even at this late date.  The Labour Party believes in the power of that forum to take the necessary collective action but we need to see a resolve from our own leaders that is commensurate with the challenge.  In particular, we need to see the Taoiseach stepping up along with the Minister and the rest of the Government to ensure we do not just set ambitious but necessary targets but deliver on the measures needed to reach those targets.</p> <p>We are just over seven years away from the 2030 deadline.  With the best and most constructive will in the world, it is impossible for many of us to see how we are going to reach our target of a 51% cut by 2030.  We have missed targets, rising emissions, low investment in critical infrastructure and significant delays in generation of offshore wind capacity.  Ireland is the second highest emitter of greenhouse gases per head of population in the EU so we need to see more urgent action.  Will the Taoiseach show a commitment to the polluter pays principle so that those paying the highest price for climate change will see justice?  Will he sign up to and promote the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty while he represents us at COP27 this week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800006#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Bacik for raising this issue, which is significant for our country and the planet.  By now, the Taoiseach will have delivered his speech at Sharm el-Sheikh.  I think he summed up very well the imperative of action and delivery.  This is something he has pinpointed as being the key issue.  Ireland has made significant progress in terms of the overall framework, putting legislation in place, the adoption of the climate action plan, the carbon budget and the sectoral emissions ceilings.  A new climate action plan for 2023 will come before the Government shortly.  Every line Minister will also bring forward a set of specific measures to give effect to all of those targets and set out exactly how we are going to achieve them.</p>  <p>  This is not easy.  We know it is not easy when it comes to transport policy, what our farmers are trying to do in terms of the transition they are buying into, the challenges in forestry, energy policy and everything we need to do but there is hope.  The Taoiseach is right to highlight the importance of pointing to where we have made progress, while at the same time identifying that much more needs to be done.  </p>  <p>  I was struck by the latest report from Wind Energy Ireland which said that in October, wind energy provided 47% of the country's electricity.  This is a real glimpse of the future when you look at the potential in Ireland for fixed and floating offshore wind energy.  These latest figures mean that wind energy has supplied one third, or 33%, of Ireland's electricity demand this year to the end of October.  It is one example but it highlights the potential we have as a country when we all put our shoulders to the wheel and focus on what needs to be done.  In the years ahead, we can become a global leader in this space and a net exporter of energy to our neighbours in Europe.  This is why investments such as the Celtic interconnector, which involves the development of an electricity connection between Ireland and France, are so important for this country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point to the amount of work we have to do not just as a Government, although it is incumbent on us to lead, but also as a people.  I believe the Irish people will lead and deliver on the commitments we have entered into.  I can assure the Deputy, the House and the Irish people that the Government will not be found wanting because the next generation and future generations will not thank us if we shirk this and do not deliver on our commitments to them.</p>  <p>  One specific commitment we gave related to climate finance.  The Government gave a commitment that it will increase from &euro;93 million to &euro;225 million over the next four years as a tangible manifestation of our commitment to supporting developing countries which, unfortunately, are bearing the brunt of the excesses elsewhere in the world.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800007#E00100"><p>I thank the Minister.  He spoke of progress and of the potential for wind energy, but we have been speaking about this potential for a long time without having put in place the necessary infrastructure to deliver at scale on the sort of energy generation capacity offshore wind can provide.  The Minister also spoke of the climate action plan 2023 and said it will go to the Government shortly.  When is that going to come before this House?  I ask because we have previously seen foot-dragging and delays in the production of necessary plans and in the development of the sectoral emissions targets.  Often, these have not been brought before this House and the other House until very late in the day and at a time when we cannot give the plans the sort of adequate scrutiny required.</p>  <p>  I was glad to hear the Minister speak of the Taoiseach's commitment to ensuring a solidarity pact with the Global South.  This is hugely important.  Can we, however, also see the Taoiseach promoting the non-fossil fuel proliferation treaty now being spoken of and being urged upon us by so many international groupings and activists worldwide as a key way to ensuring there is a mechanism at international level to ensure we will see the phasing out of fossil fuel reliance across the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800007#E00200"><p>The truth is that the real test is when it comes to the specific actions that have to be taken to deliver on the targets.  These will present challenges and difficulties at local and national levels but we will provide leadership and we require support from across this House.  I do not think there is any lack of opportunity for input from parties and Deputies in the House to allow them to contribute to how the climate action challenge can be met.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the question concerning wind energy.  The new body, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, will be up and running in quarter 1 of next year.  We are actively recruiting a chair and a chief executive officer for that body at this point in time.  It will, fundamentally, modernise and streamline the consent and licensing system in respect of offshore wind generation.  This needs to be done to ensure it is delivered.  A new planning Bill will also come before the House in the weeks to come.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Attorney General have been working closely in that regard.  The truth is that this comes down to specific and tangible measures that demonstrate our real commitment.  On days like this, words are easy but it is the follow-up and implementation where it gets difficult.  That is the real test and that is where we can make great progress.</p></speech>

I welcome that this funding has been put in place.  County Galway received an allocation of &euro;9 million for the next five years and this process has shown the funding we are getting per head of population is at the lower end of the scale.  We are getting &euro;46.63 per person for the next five years.  A comparative analysis with other counties, for example, the other four counties in Connacht and the average funding they are going to get, shows that if County Galway's allocation was brought up to that average, we would be entitled to not &euro;9 million but &euro;18 million.</p><p>I assure the Ministers that I am not looking for &euro;18 million today.  We are, though, being put at the lower end of the scale.  I do not know for what reason.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is present.  He knows we have the same problem with local government funding.  It seems as if County Galway is being penalised for some reason.  I do not know whether it may have been because we did not join the city and county councils together or whatever the underlying reason might be, but County Galway is getting the lower end of the scale of funding allocation.  For instance, Cork, the county of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is getting an additional &euro;3 million in LEADER funding this year.  This situation cannot continue in a county that is so diverse and has as many different regions and challenges as Galway.  The county is part of the North and West Regional Assembly area, which has been designated by the EU as a lagging region and one that needs positive discrimination in investment to try to bring the amount allocated<i>per capita</i>up to allow the country to have balanced development.</p> <p>The argument here is not about the amount of the reduction; it is about the basis on which we are being funded and how much we are getting <i>per capita</i>compared to everybody else.  I do not begrudge Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo or Leitrim, or any other county, what it is getting but when one sees what they are getting compared to what we are getting, there are many questions to be asked.  I would like to see at some stage the metrics by which this funding is being allocated on a county-wide basis.  It is something that many people in Galway are uneasy about.  The trend is continuing.  Following on from Galway County Council having one of the lowest funding allocations, we have this.  I would appreciate a response.</p></speech>

The first point I want to make is that there is no cut in LEADER funding.  That is not the core point he made.  The point he made is about the <i>per capita</i>allocation.  As part of the new &euro;10 billion CAP strategic plan, the Government has committed significant funding of &euro;108 million to LEADER for the period 2023 to 2027.  When that is taken together with the &euro;70 million provided by the Government for last year and this year, this maintains the &euro;250 million funding for LEADER for the corresponding seven-year programming period from 2014 to 2020.</p><p>All of the &euro;180 million will be allocated upfront to local LEADER areas.  This is a change from the previous programme where &euro;30 million was withheld to fund initiatives delivered at a national level, such as the LEADER food initiative.  When combined with the transitional funding, this means that all LEADER areas, including Galway, have an increased allocation of core programme funding compared to the corresponding seven-year period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>It is only one part of the contribution that the Government and all the bodies that work under our aegis are making to the regions and, indeed, to rural Ireland.  When I look at the current range of schemes principally administered by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, whether it be the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the new community centres fund that is being set up, the town and village renewal programme, the CL&Aacute;R programme, the outdoor recreation fund or, indeed, the record sports capital funding of &euro;150 million that we provided earlier this year, much of the funding went to the regions and to rural Ireland.  When I look at the population figures, I see in Galway the population has risen by more than 7%, unemployment has fallen and we can see the benefits and the fruits of continued investment by the Government and, indeed, by a range of public bodies.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, recently confirmed the extension of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund to rural Ireland as well.  The ability to get direct cash-grant support of &euro;30,000 or, in the case of a derelict home, &euro;50,000 to bring it back into occupancy is something that will be warmly welcomed in rural communities all over Ireland.  The details of that, I believe, will be confirmed shortly by the Minister.  It is a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment to, and support for, rural communities all over Ireland.</p><p>Decisions will always have to be made about the allocation of resources.  The Deputy made the point about the specific <i>per capita</i>amount for Galway.  The approach that has been taken by the Minister is to provide a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to each sub-regional area with the remaining funding distributed based on population and the level of deprivation of the area.  This ensures funding is targeted at the areas most in need of LEADER support.  This approach is similar to the approach taken under the previous LEADER programme with the relevant population and deprivation figures updated to take account of the passage of time.</p></speech>

They are welcome and they create better investment for a better environment to work and live in in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The kernel of my point is not about a reduction; it is about how the funds are being allocated on a county-by-county basis.  The Minister has not answered that question.  For instance, if you tell people in Glenamaddy, Williamstown or in Connemara that there is population growth in their areas, you will be at your wit's end trying to find out where is the population growth.</p> <p>There is something fundamentally wrong with how the funding is allocated when there is such variance.  In County Roscommon it is &euro;97 per head and in County Sligo it is &euro;87 per head.  We are down to &euro;46.  There is no logical explanation for it.  I would like to see a transparent way of doing this so every county gets a fair share.</p></speech>

As he knows, Galway has been allocated &euro;9 million for the period 2023-27.  When we take this in conjunction with the transitional funding for Galway, which is &euro;3.6 million for 2021 and 2022, it gives a total LEADER allocation of &euro;12.6 million for the county for the period 2021-27.  For the corresponding period 2014-20, County Galway had a core programme funding allocation of &euro;12.2 million.  I know the Deputy is not making the case it was reduced because it was not reduced.  It was increased by 3.5% on a like-for-like basis.  The Minister has been open and transparent as to how allocations are made.  It is based on a number of factors with a minimum allocation for each subregional area.  The balance of the funding is distributed based on the population and, critically, the level of deprivation.  There are measures of this and it has been done in an open way by the Department to ensure we can stand over the allocations that have been made.</p></speech>

Currently, recruitment efforts are being surpassed by service demands.  We are told the scale of growth in demand for ambulance services is unprecedented and unexpected.  Over recent days I have spoken to and received correspondence from paramedics in the midlands region and this reflects their experience.  They tell me the service is now on its knees and that it is quite common that ambulance shifts are not covered due to a lack of staff.  This is extremely concerning.  The station in Tullamore has been closed for an entire day or night shift on a number of occasions recently.  Previously this was unheard of.  It is totally unacceptable.  On top of all of this, despite the lack of cover in the midlands those available ambulances are regularly drawn into other areas.  The Edenderry crews are regularly in Dublin, Kildare or the north east.  The Birr ambulance crews spends most of its time in Tipperary or Limerick.  The Portlaoise ambulances are frequently in Wicklow, Kildare or the south east.  The Tullamore ambulance is then left to pick up the pieces in Laois, Westmeath, Birr and Edenderry.  As one of the paramedics said to me, if a house was on fire in Portlaoise would we want the fire brigade to come from Dublin.</p>  <p>  Despite the staffing crisis in the National Ambulance Service the Government has taken action that will, in all likelihood, significantly increase the pressure on it.  I refer to the impact of extending nightclub opening hours.  Allowing nightclubs open until 6 a.m., particularly in cities and major urban areas, is bound to have a knock-on effect on the already stretched ambulance services.  It will certainly make it more likely that rural counties and rural ambulance-based services will be called into those areas and away from rural counties such as Offaly and Laois.  Will the Minister consider pausing these measures to engage with the National Ambulance Service and health services and listen to what they have to say about the issue?  They are important stakeholders.  I want to be clear that while I fully support reform of our licensing laws for pubs and clubs, such reform should not bring about additional strain on vital national services such as the ambulance service.</p> <p>It certainly should not make the working life of paramedics, such as those in Offaly and Laois, more difficult than it already is.  Will the Minister outline the steps the Government is taking to increase recruitment and retention in the ambulance service?  What actions will be taken to address the concern that ambulance shifts are not being covered in Laois and Offaly?</p></speech>

The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is working closely with the head of the National Ambulance Service, Mr. Robert Morton, and they are now very much focused on the implementation of the national ambulance strategy.  We have provided substantial additional resources to the NAS over the past couple of years.  Record investment of more than &euro;200 million was allocated to the service this year, an increase of approximately &euro;30 million on that allocated in 2019.</p>  <p>  When it comes to what we can do directly at the centre of government, we have prioritised the allocation of resources for the service.  In the 2022 budget the service received its largest overall investment to date of &euro;200.7 million, which included more than &euro;8 million for an additional 128 staff, including paramedics, to address baseline capacity and strengthen clinical capacity at the clinical hub.  The NAS staff complement, as of the end of September this year, is 2,032 whole-time equivalents.  This represents an increase of 17% since the commencement of the previous National Ambulance Service strategic plan in December 2016.</p>  <p>  Having said all that, I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy and that there have been instances where the service has fallen short of the standard we expect.  This may well be for a variety of reasons, including vacancies, which the service is seeking to fill, and for an active recruitment campaign is under way.  New investment is going into the rolling stock the service has as well as into upgrading bases.  They are actively recruiting the professionals they need to provide the quality of service the Deputy and I, as well as all the people who we represent, expect.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, response times have been impacted by high service demand, delays in patient transfers at busy hospital emergency departments and the continuing need for ambulance service crews to carry out necessary Covid infection prevention and control measures.  However, where the standard falls short of what people expect, this should be made known to the authorities and a complaint should be made so that a learning can come from it.  We all have experienced individual cases in which the standard was not what we would have expected.  That is not, as the Deputy said, because of the tremendous work of all of those working in the service.  They are working in challenging and difficult circumstances and are doing the very best they can.  I assure them, on behalf of the Minister and the Government, that we will continue to provide the resources they need to ensure the service is up to standard.</p></speech>

I agree with him on one point in that the paramedics are doing an excellent job, but they are being put in an unfair situation.  He did not address the deficits in counties such as Laois and Offaly where ambulance shifts are not being covered, for example.  This is concerning and this is putting lives at risk, while also putting massive pressure on paramedics who were being pulled across the country into the east, south east, and Wicklow.  The Birr ambulance crew has been called to counties Tipperary and Limerick.  This is an unacceptable situation.  The Government needs to take action, as does the Minister for Health, to address the situation at hand before something serious happens and lives are lost.  Every ambulance station should have its shifts covered.  While I accept there are issues around recruitment, which I am glad the Minister mentioned, will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform support the submission made by the National Ambulance Service in respect of recruitment, which calls for the recruitment of an extra 192 student paramedics and the opening of a fourth campus in the south to increase capacity in the system?</p> <p>Will the Minister support all of that?  If he is to be meaningful and true to his word about taking action, surely that would be what the Government should be doing.</p></speech>

It is not a lack of funding; the budget is there.  The service is actively recruiting.  It is bringing people in from other jurisdictions and trying to bring paramedics who qualified here and travelled abroad back to Ireland.  However, there is a global shortage of paramedics and advanced paramedics.  The service is doing all it can to make sure places are filled.  Through the education system, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, are working closely together to ensure we have a pipeline of people coming through the education system with the training and skills they need so they can join the National Ambulance Service and fill the gaps that are there.  It is the case that shifts should be covered and there should be a full complement of professionals at all times to provide the service to our people.  We are conscious that this is a service that people only ever call on in an absolute emergency, very often at the darkest of moments of crisis in the life of an individual or family.  That is why we will do all we possibly can to make sure the service is of a standard that people expect.</p></speech>

It is an extremely important Bill which the Labour Party wants to support, but it is problematic in parts.  In order for it to pass successfully through the Oireachtas things have to be done right, but we are not doing that.  I ask that the Office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Office of the Ceann Comhairle assist us in doing legislation properly.

Cork University Hospital, CUH, which the Minister will know, had the highest numbers yesterday after University Hospital Limerick, which serves half of County Tipperary.  All of the accident and emergency departments are under chronic pressure.  We are six or seven weeks away from the Christmas holiday period.

It makes sense to have a debate when the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, report back to the House having attended COP27.  We can have an informed debate when we know the outcomes of COP27.  We do not yet know what those outcomes are.

That is my view on bringing that idea to the Business Committee.</p>  <p>  The matter raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in with regard to the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill sounds unusual.  The origin of the issue is the scheduling of Committee Stage by the committee.  Perhaps there can be some discretion or leeway shown.

For the first time in our history, we have had a summer trolley crisis, with record wait times.  We have seen people aged 75 and over waiting for six or nine days on a trolley.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said just this afternoon that more than 100,000 patients have waited on trolleys so far this year.</p> <p>It is clear we need more hospital beds, yet one in four beds that are funded have still not been delivered.  Over 1,000 patients in hospital cannot get access to home care and so their discharge is delayed.  What we have is chaotic.  We need investment in our hospitals but also in home and community care.

It is the case that we are faced with an unprecedented number of presentations.  In our children's hospitals, according to reports in the news yesterday, there has been, I think, a 50% increase in presentations relative to 2019, which is extraordinary.  In our acute adult hospitals we are seeing more older people and people who are more frail and sicker presenting.  This underlines the need for us to continue to increase capacity.  We have added over 900 new acute hospital beds, 73 sub-acute beds and over 340 acute beds since coming into Government.  We have increased staffing in the public health service by 15,000 people in the past two and a half years and we have brought about a reduction of 40% in the number of people waiting for home care.

Yesterday in Limerick, I saw a promised housing site that has lain idle for decades, despite being in public ownership.  It is now in the control of the Land Development Agency which, apparently, has are no plans even to commence the planning process until 2028.  That is an extraordinary delay.  The Government must overhaul the planning and public construction system.  As we look at the shambles at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is the Government planning a radical overview of the board?  A few moments ago, the Minister said the Government would have a planning Bill before this House in the coming weeks.  Will that Bill include the necessary reforms to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  These reforms were recommended in a 2016 report commissioned by Deputy Kelly when he was Minister.  It provided a series of vital recommendations that, had they been implemented then, would have prevented the shambolic system we are now seeing in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

It is urgent legislation.  Separate from that, we have the outcome of the work being led by the Attorney General and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the planning system generally.  That will also come in the form of a new consolidated planning Bill, which I expect will be brought to the House in the coming weeks.  Capacity is the issue.  It is about delivery.  The problems we have faced have been in planning, labour shortages, construction material inflation and bottlenecks in the system.  The Deputy is right that we need to do everything we possibly can to remove these and build more homes, which our people need.</p></speech>

This is an issue not only of climate justice but of basic fairness.  However, the concept of loss and damage has been around since 1991 and there has been no progress on it.  I ask that the Government take a leadership role at COP27 when it comes to loss and damages and that we establish a fund ourselves.  We should take our lead from Denmark, which has recently done this, and allocate additional funds for that fund so we are not renaming or relabelling existing funds to which we have already committed.  Additional funds should be provided to assist developing countries with compensation.</p></speech>

That is according to Transgender Europe, which is a network of more than 200 trans rights organisations funded by the EU.  Waiting times here are longer than in any of the other 26 EU countries.  The time it takes from requesting to see a specialist to getting to see one is between two and a half and ten years.  In most other EU states, the wait is less than one year.  Trans and Intersex Pride is organising a trans day of remembrance on Saturday, 19 November, when a protest will take place outside Leinster House.

They are not acceptable for trans people and in many other areas of healthcare provision.  I met recently with some of the healthcare providers.

However, it has come to light that on 25 October, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, recorded the highest number of patients on trolleys in 2022, when 669 people, including 28 children, were without a bed.</p>  <p>  I raise with the Minister the issue of hospital overcrowding this winter, specifically in County Louth.  Although the winter plan for 2022 to 2023 makes significant promises on additional capacity and improved pathways of care, community emergency departments have become warehouses for admitting patients who are waiting to be moved to a hospital ward.  By keeping patients in emergency departments, the capacity of those departments to function as they should is completely invalidated.  Our acute bed capacity is 2.8 per 1,000 of population, whereas the OECD average is 4.3.  If nothing is done about this, along with the 40,000-plus waiting time breaches, it is the complete opposite of what was promised in the national service plan.  I want the Minister for Health and the Government to confirm they will listen to the practical solutions and measures put forward by the emergency department task force and will implement solutions immediately to prevent this entirely predictable situation.</p></speech>

I was in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, last week and met with the senior clinical team, including the emergency department nursing and consultant staff.  I fully agree the resources that are needed have not been in place for a long time.  The Deputy will be aware I have sanctioned a doubling of the number of emergency medicine consultants in Drogheda.  We have launched phase 2 of the safe staffing framework, which will increase the number of emergency nursing and healthcare assistant roles.  We are also talking to the hospital about additional capacity and, arguably more importantly, providing more step-down facilities in order that patients, when they are ready to be discharged, can be taken to a suitable clinical setting, meaning there will be more capacity in the hospital and for emergency medicine.</p></speech>

Despite having severe needs, being an acute priority and requiring, at a minimum, weekly respite, the child has received just three hours of respite since last May and just one overnight stay.  It is appalling.  The children's disability network team, CDNT, and disability services are failing him.  Respite services are practically non-existent and his need for shared residential care is being completely ignored, with the HSE saying that is the last resort.  This family has reached a place of last resort.  I salute the child's mum and dad.  They are in crisis and they cannot be ignored any further.  I have had an eight-page letter from the child's mother, which I have just handed to the Minister.  I ask him, please, to act.  It is an appalling situation.</p></speech>

I will ask the HSE for a detailed note on it.  A significant additional number of healthcare professionals need to be hired in disability services.  Sanction is in place for several hundred posts that are currently unfilled.  The HSE has found it harder to fill the children's healthcare roles in disability services and mental health services than the adult roles.  I am engaged directly with the HSE on this matter.  It is looking at different service provision models.  Ultimately, the solution to this is to hire into the roles that have already been sanctioned and make sure this child and all the other children waiting for care get it quickly.</p></speech>

Since January of this year, SUH has had the third highest number of people waiting for beds.  The headline for figures for Cork are worse, but bed capacity in Cork is more than twice that of Limerick so in real terms, in terms of capacity, SUH is second only to Limerick.  Time and again I have been told the winter plan will deal with the problem.  However, seven of the proposed actions in the winter plan for SUH entail recruitment of more staff.  That will not happen in time.  It is winter already.  The INMO has proposed a four-pronged approach, including the use of private hospitals for non-urgent elective care.  Will the Minister use private hospitals right now?  If he will not do it nationally, will he at least do it for the five worst-hit hospitals, two of which are in the north west, in Sligo and Letterkenny?  The Minister mentioned step-down facilities.  I remind him that 16 private voluntary care homes have closed this year already.</p></speech>

There has been quite an additional increase in staffing as well.  There are new beds.  Deputy Harkin will be aware that I pushed very hard for four new ICU beds to be opened up.  The HSE is now moving to staff them directly.  In direct response to Deputy Harkin's question on whether we will use private capacity to get people the care they need, we will do so and we are doing so.  Significant funding is in place through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the waiting list action plan to use that.  We want to use public facilities wherever possible, but given the number of people waiting, we are using all of the available private healthcare facilities for now.  Ultimately, we are in the middle of the biggest expansion in capacity in the public service since the foundation of the HSE to make sure the public service can handle all of the demand from the country.</p></speech>

It is a focus of this Government to improve public transport and encourage people to use it.  For that to happen, we need a public transport system and a bus service that is fit for purpose.  The Kinsale to Cork city bus service, the 226 service, is not fit for purpose.  There are capacity issues.  Students who want to access third level education in Cork city are being left on the side of the road.  In the terrible weather we have seen recently, that is a horrible situation.  There is also an issue with the move of the bus stop in Cork city to a location that has no bus shelter.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to solve this problem.  This is in the hands of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I ask the Minister to facilitate and arrange a meeting so that the NTA will meet with me, with Senator Tim Lombard, who has also been working on this issue, and with the community in Kinsale so that we can solve this problem.  That is all I ask.</p></speech>

I would be happy to do that.  In my experience, when the frequency of a service is improved, such as the 220 service between Cork city and Carrigaline, the use increases dramatically.  When the service is provided, if the need is there a significant uptake occurs.  I will be happy to work with Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to the 226 service between Cork city and Kinsale.</p></speech>

I refer, for example, to the announcement on Thursday that half of Twitter&rsquo;s Irish staff were being summarily dismissed via email.  It has rightly been highlighted that a hard-fought right of workers - the requirement for an employer to notify the Government of such actions - has not been adhered to.  </p> <p>I am aware, as the Minister mentioned, that the T&aacute;naiste is to meet with Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, in relation to the matter shortly.</p> <p> What is the point of having law on the Statue Book if it is not being adhered to?  Can the Minister commit to ensuring that employment law is adhered to, that workers are afforded the dignity of a proper notice of termination and that provisions of Irish law that permit prosecutions and fines to be imposed on such a company be seriously looked at to ensure that such rogue behaviour that I believe has taken place will not be tolerated?</p></speech>

The provisions of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 are very clear when it comes to collective redundancies, such as the requirement for the 30-day consultation period with the workers and their representatives and also the need to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the proposals at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes effect.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission is the body in Ireland that has the statutory powers in respect of the enforcement of employment law and I have no doubt that it will not be found wanting in fulfilling its responsibilities in that regard.</p></speech>

I spoke to a number of families who took part in that programme.  One such parent, Paula, from Cavan, lost her son, Tadhg.  Some 17 months after she buried her son, she received a cold call from the HSE to say that the child&rsquo;s organs were still being retained against and without her knowledge.  It is devastating.</p>  <p>  I spoke to other parents as well.  She asked me to ask the Minister directly whether he can give me and those families a clear, straight answer on when we will see the human tissues Bill.  It was promised 15 years ago and we still have not seen.  Enough is enough and I am sure the Minister has to agree with that.  I know this is something that was a scandal in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency in Cork as well and he has met parents.  When will this Bill once and for all be published and passed through this House?</p></speech>

I want to be very clear about this.  This extremely distressing situation should not have happened.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the human tissue Bill directly, there is very extensive work going on now between the Office of the Attorney General, my Department and the Department of Justice to bring this into the House as quickly as possible for all of the reasons we understand.</p></speech>

Budget 2023 provided for up to 30,000 farmers to take part initially.  The applications have been open since mid-October and will run until later in November.  It is a very tight timeframe.  Farmers are engaging planners and advisers to put together the application, but there is a scramble to make that date at the end of November.  If advisers and planners want to go on-site and see the ground to put together the most informed plan, there is pressure with the number of applications, the weather, the late evenings and so on.  Farmers are asking whether there is an opportunity to extend that tight deadline so that they can make the most informed plan and be engaged in that agri-climate scheme at the first possible opportunity.</p></speech>

Indeed, it has been warmly welcomed and embraced by farmers across the country.  It is a logistically tight timeframe in relation to making applications.  It is necessarily so because of the timeframe involved in getting approval for it from the European Commission and also having the application submitted in time for the end of this year so we can have as many farmers as possible in this scheme for full payment next year.  I am aware of the challenge for advisers, in particular, in relation to the 21 November deadline and I have been monitoring it closely.  There may be some scope there for a slight extension of that, which I am looking at at the moment, and I will revert to the Deputy on that and bring clarity to that matter in the next couple of days.</p></speech>

The Castlebar campus is also home to the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board headquarters and accommodates up to 700 students.</p> <p>It is well below an acceptable standard, however, for an inclusive and vibrant learning environment.  It has submitted an application to SOLAS under further education capital funding.  I support that application.  A new further education and training campus in Castlebar would provide mutual beneficial opportunities for Mayo College of Further Education and Training and the Atlantic Technological University at Castlebar, in line with current strategies, including SOLAS strategies.

I point out that the south east has 9% of the population.  Where can we see &euro;900 million within the Government's capital tracker?  We cannot see it.  The dashboard is useless in terms of showing where money is being spent.  In the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, the university sector in Cork has received &euro;300 million but we in the south east have received nothing.

The track record of AIB with its customers can, at least, be questioned.  When AIB closed its Schull branch many years ago, the people of Schull and the Mizen Peninsula were promised a mobile bank but AIB is now using every excuse to avoid showing its face in the town.  A few months ago, AIB decided to make a huge number of its branches, including those in Castletownbere, Dunmanway and Kinsale, cashless.  I am looking for a straight "Yes" or "No" answer.  As one of the two Ministers with responsibility for finance, and in light of the State owning 71% of AIB, was the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, aware that AIB planned to making its branches cashless before it announced that decision?</p></speech>

I will ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to revert to her because it falls under that Department as well as the Department of Education in terms of the rates that are paid to contractors to make sure that vital service can continue.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shanahan has raised on several occasions the issue he addressed today.  I hear what he has to say in respect of the online projects tracker.  It is not designed to capture all of the investment but, rather, only that relating to projects above a certain threshold.  He will be familiar with the report that is produced on a regional assembly basis, including for the southern region.  In Cork, Cork County Council commissioned a piece of work to look at the totality of funding streams from national government to see if it could come to a conclusion as to how it was faring.  Perhaps that is something the Deputy and I can discuss offline.  I am open to new reporting channels so that we get a better handle on the proper spread and distribution of resources, which is a Government objective.  If it is not being delivered, that is something we would like to address.</p>  <p>  I will ask the relevant Ministers to revert to Deputy Costello regarding the reporting of private family law cases.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clarke raised an issue relating to the NAS and the change to the regime in respect of Covid testing.  I understand from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that there is a move to a system which is clinically led, based on an assessment of the need of the area.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins raised the issue of AIB and the changes that were announced and subsequently reversed.  I am not the line Minister and so did not have any involvement in that regard.

Ten people going about their daily routine had their lives cut short in an event that spread across the world.  The lives of young Shauna Flanagan Garwe and her dad Robert Garwe, Catherine O&rsquo;Donnell and her son James Monaghan, Leona Harper, Jessica Gallagher, James O&rsquo;Flaherty, Martin McGill, Martina Martin and Hugh Kelly were lost, and we mourn them.</p>  <p>  Donegal people stretch far beyond the 4,800 sq. km and 166,000 inhabitants of the county.  The Donegal people and our diaspora spread to the four corners of the globe.  What links the people of Donegal who are in the county with those acting as ambassadors for our great county across the world is their sense of community, compassion and togetherness.  This is especially the case in the tight-knit community of Creeslough.</p> <p>It is a village known throughout the country for its warmth, hospitality, kindness and sincerity.</p> <p> While a terrible shadow has been cast across our county, we have seen the best of Donegal people in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy and since.  Within minutes of the incident, the emergency services were on-site at the filling station.  There was no time for them or the locals to think, only act.  Each of our emergency services working with local people were heroic in their efforts.  They risked their own lives to save those in Creeslough.  The people of Donegal will never forget their heroism and commitment to their fellow people.  Superintendent David Kelly and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, chief ambulance officer, John Joe McGowan, and the first responders, consultant in emergency medicine, Mr. Gerry Lane, and Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy and the Letterkenny University Hospital, LUH, team all played an enormous role immediately after the explosion and in the hours and days that followed.  Specifically on healthcare, I sincerely thank the ambulance drivers, paramedics, doctors, surgeons, the county coroner, Dr. Denis McCauley, nurses, porters and all the staff at Letterkenny University Hospital, and all those who treated the injured and dying in their of need.  They saved lives and gave us hope and comfort.</p> <p> The Donegal services were led by Mr. Garry Martin and county manager Mr. John McLaughlin from Donegal County Council.  Emergency services were co-ordinated by Mr. Brian &Oacute; Fearraigh, the regional advanced paramedic supervisor.  We must also thank the urban search and rescue team from the North, one of the many examples of cross-Border co-operation following the tragedy, for its work.  The role of the local community was to the fore in the immediate response.  This was typified by the digger driver who worked late into the night without a break to help work through the remains of the building and try to rescue and recover those inside.</p> <p> Of course, volunteers of all ages played a huge role in keeping the community, people and emergency services together over the time.  Our thoughts, at all times, have never left those who have lost their loved ones and whose lives are irreparably changed and altered forever.  Our thoughts are also very much with those who continue to recover from their injuries on that day, in particular, the two survivors who remain in hospital.  When An Taoiseach visited the site the day after the explosion, he was very much moved by how the volunteers were so giving of their time as part of the search effort as well as ensuring that everyone at the site was looked after.  In particular, he asked me to mention Siobhan Carr and her team in the Coffee Pod caf&eacute;, which stayed open day and night to offer food and a place of refuge for those carrying out the search.  A warm heart through the tears and a cup of tea was what so many people needed and valued that weekend.</p> <p> The spirit of support and volunteerism also resulted in a contribution of more than &euro;1.6 million to two separate support funds.  This will be a real help to those in the local area in the time ahead.  I also express my sincere thanks to those who offered accommodation and supports, those who helped out at religious services and everyone who helped and supported in any way.  I recognise, in particular, the immense support provided by local clergy to the community in its time of immense need, in particular the leadership and role played by Fr. John Joe Duffy, who was a tower of strength throughout, and to Bishop Alan McGuckian and Bishop Andrew Forster as well as Fr. Brian &Oacute; Fearraigh and Fr. Michael Carney, who conducted the funerals and supported families with many of their colleagues over the course of that week and since.  At a time when their people needed them, they stepped forward to support.  They knew and did their best to provide comfort and ease the pain of those who lost their loved ones, which was very much valued by all.  I also recognise the presence of our Uachtar&aacute;n in attending and being present in support of the community at those funerals and wakes over the course of the week, and also the visit of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p> The Government will continue to back the people of Creeslough and we will stand with the community for as long as it takes.  Through my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, we are extending the humanitarian assistance scheme to households damaged by the explosion.  The funds will provide financial support to people who have suffered damage to their home and property.  The HSE is providing counselling to those who need it.  The impacts of this awful accident may only start to affect people from now on so I urge anyone who needs to talk to someone to reach out and do so.</p> <p> From being in Creeslough with fellow Oireachtas Members over that week, and attending each of the funerals, I know just how heartbroken is this small village of 400 people along the N56.  This is a pain that will remain with the local community and bereaved families for the remainder of their lives.  It is now that the local community is trying to start to pick up the pieces and reconnect with some semblance of normal life.  It has been good to see the efforts under way the Lafferty family to reopen a shop at the heart of the local community.  I was heartened, in particular, to see the return to some small semblance of normality with the St. Michael&rsquo;s under-13 team, who were recently three-point winners over Naomh Conaill in the division two Donegal cup final.  The team, which counts all-Ireland winning manager Jim McGuinness in its backroom team, has lifted the spirits of people locally.  Never before did a community need an under-13 league final as much as this.  Jim&rsquo;s son, Mark Anthony, captained the young men to the cup and said in his speech that the win was &ldquo;for the community&rdquo;.  Those words and the actions of St. Michael's, its chair and volunteers deserve special mention too.  Similar words were also brilliantly spoken by Ireland soccer hero Amber Barrett who has a deep connection to the village.</p> <p> One month on, Donegal still mourns for the people of Creeslough.  One year on, Donegal will mourn for the people of Creeslough.  Donegal will always remember the people, the community and the togetherness of Creeslough.  A shadow may have been cast but the sun will rise again.  We will all stand by the people of Creeslough and never forget those ten people who died simply going about their daily lives or their loved ones whose lives have been so unalterably changed as a result.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p></speech>

They were 14-year-old Leona Harper, who went into the shop to buy an ice cream, excited about the sleepover she was about to attend that evening; Robert Garwe and his five-year-old daughter, little Shauna Flanagan Garwe, who had gone into the shop together to buy a birthday cake for Shauna's mother; Hugh Kelly, who had driven Shauna and her father, Bob, to the shop, a simple act of friendship that reflected his kindness and generosity; young Jessica Gallagher, who had embarked on her journey as a fashion designer and had just posted a card to her sister Lisa; James O'Flaherty, who had gone into the shop while his 12-year-old son waited in the car on the forecourt for his father's return; Catherine O'Donnell and her young son James Monaghan, who she had just met off the school bus before they made their way into the post office; Martina Martin, a loving mother of four, who was working that day, described as a friend to everyone and the mammy of the workplace; and Martin McGill, known for his kindness, who had gone into the shop that day to run errands for his mother.  This deep loss now reflects just how full and beautiful their lives were.  They truly left their mark and we remember them all.</p>  <p>  Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured that day, those who remain in hospital and those who are recovering at home.  The grief felt by families in the community of Creeslough is the grief of this nation and beyond its waves.  Their loss is a loss for the nation.  They have also offered us a glimpse of what the nation is and what it means through their bravery and strength and the instinct to help their neighbour with whatever resources were at their disposal.</p> <p>Many were local people without training or experience who found themselves in the middle of the rescue effort.  First responders raced to the scene to offer help and comfort.  Nurses and healthcare workers who live locally were driven by their innate sense of service.  Fr. John Joe Duffy, the rock, the tower of strength, himself a first responder, has provided so much support, comfort, consolation and hope to the families and the community.  Local businesses opened their doors, offering their services and premises to the first responders and others in the village.  The Garda, the fire services, Donegal County Council and many other first responders were on the scene and acted with such compassion and understanding.  They included those who rushed from the North to provide support and to take part in the rescue efforts.  Many of them refused to leave right until the end.  This is a community that, despite the devastation of loss, has galvanised to support and comfort one another.<br/><br/>Despite their strength and resilience, however, they cannot do this on their own, I believe.  We need to ask ourselves and one another what the families and the community of Creeslough need now and in the time ahead.  First, we need to respect their privacy.  Second, we need to recognise that the physical hub of the community is destroyed.  It lies in rubble.  We need to listen to the community and to provide the infrastructure, both physical and social, that is needed for them to ensure the families affected in the community at large can begin the slow process of healing in the time ahead.  Counselling services must be available for a sustained period, as and when they are needed, for those affected by this tragedy, not only within the community of Creeslough but further afield.  While the main road will reopen in the time ahead and a new shop will open its doors to service the community again, rivers of tears will continue to flow in the community and its hinterland because the people there have faced a great trauma and tragedy that has deprived them of their loved ones in such sudden and tragic circumstances.  In their grief and their love and support for one another, they have cast a light not only on the beautiful lives of each and every one of those who lost their lives but also on the fragility of life and the strength of community.<br/><br/>I will finish by quoting the words of wisdom spoken by Hamish, the son of James O'Flaherty.  He told us as we attended the funeral mass of his father:</p><blockquote>	We should be grateful.  For your families, cherish them ... because they won't be there forever, so use up the time you have wisely.  Also, be grateful for your life because that too will not last forever.  But be grateful for you will be able to rest after your hard work. </blockquote> <p>Those words of Hamish have such power because they are the words of truth.  We remember Leona, Robert, Shauna, Martina, Jessica, James, Hugh, Catherine, James and Martin.  We pray that their families and friends will find comfort in their grief.</p></speech>

As the hours moved on, we started to hear indications that there was significant loss of life.  Then the full horror was revealed.  The nation and, obviously, the people of Donegal knew the number of people who had lost their lives, but then we heard their stories and we moved through the wakes and the funerals over one of the most solemn weeks I can ever remember.</p>  <p>  It was, however, deeply humbling because in the worst, most unimaginable tragedy that could happen, an appalling and horrific tragedy, the best of people was brought out.  Sometimes the worst possible thing that can happen brings out the very best in people.  We witnessed the love and solidarity of the immediate community, the wider county of Donegal, our nation and our diaspora - good people all around the world.  I will never forget that kindness.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the unbelievable heroism of the local community.  They were the very first on the scene and, with no thought for their own safety, showed the instinct to try to save lives and to go in to remove rubble.  What started with a handful of people quickly became hundreds working as a team to remove the rubble.  Then the digger driver, with incredible dedication and skill, took away the heavy masonry.  The people did everything they could to try to save lives in the most horrendous of circumstances.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the emergency services, the fire and rescue services from both sides of the Border, the ambulance service, the Garda, our hospital staff and Donegal County Council.  I am sure there were others.  Of course, our wider health and mental health services have been there for the community.  They need to be there continually now.  I know they have said they will be there for as long as people need them.  I repeat the call Fr. John Joe Duffy made in recent days for people to avail of those services, to talk about what has happened and to get the support they will need.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to Fr. Brian &Oacute; Fearraigh and Fr. Michael Carney, who took responsibility for two of the masses.  They were a tremendous support in those two cases to the O'Flaherty and Harper families.  Fr. John Joe Duffy has been and continues to be an incredible support to his community.  The eulogies he delivered at the various funerals told a story of a man who is at the heart of his community and who has a love and compassion for his community that is inspirational.  He and his team will need support moving forward.  Bishop McGuckian should be given great praise for his tremendous support, quietly supporting Fr. John Joe in particular throughout the week.  I am sure he will continue to do so, together with all the priests from the surrounding parishes.  At times we have had to criticise the church in this State, and rightly so, but where there are priests behaving like they did and giving the support they gave, that is worthy of support and admiration.  To have see that at close hand over that week was an absolute privilege.</p>  <p>  As for the next steps, the community will need supports in the form of mental and physical infrastructure.  We need to restore the buildings, get people back in their jobs, get people back in their homes and build community facilities.  It is the best tribute we can pay to those who lost their lives.</p></speech>

Even a month on, it is still unbelievable for all of us to recall just how suddenly and brutally ten lives were lost on that day.  The names of those who perished have been read into the D&aacute;il record.  Those lives lost were James O'Flaherty, Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan, Hugh Kelly, Leona Harper, Martina Martin, Robert Garwe and Shauna Flanagan-Garwe.  Many other lives were severely affected, many others were badly injured and many families will carry the wounds of the explosion and the disaster for years to come.</p>  <p>  Like others, I pay tribute to the emergency services, the heroic first responders and the volunteers and professionals who did so much in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and in the days and weeks since.  Clearly, however, the hurt and pain and the loss caused will be with the area long after the physical debris is removed and the physical damage repaired or demolished, even after survivors have been physically healed.  We are all conscious that the Garda investigation into what exactly happened is still ongoing.  We have seen experts from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Analysis Service and Technical Bureau involved.  I understand that a specialist company from outside Ireland has been hired to assist.  It is good to see such collaboration and interagency work.</p> <p>I am sure all of us want to urge a speedy resolution.  Hopefully, some answers will be forthcoming that may provide some sense of why this happened to those so badly affected.  Even definitive conclusions cannot help address the trauma of such a random explosion that robbed so many people of their futures - women, men and children.  The question of "what if?" may always be there in the back of all our minds.  The one thing that may come out of any report of the investigation is that there might be recommendations that could be applied to prevent similar terrible events or incidents reoccurring.  </p> <p> As the glare of public attention moves on and the families and the community deal with their grief and loss in the privacy so many are seeking, we must ensure the community receives all the assistance necessary to recover as best it can and to rebuild some of what was lost.  Ongoing mental health and counselling supports and resourcing for communities will be needed.  Healing can take place in a number of other ways.  We have seen reports of joy like the local St. Michael's GAA u-13 side winning the division 2 cup final last Sunday week, which gave people in the area a much-needed lift.  We have also seen enormous generosity from people here and around the world with significant resources and support funds collected.  Undoubtedly, public investment in the community will be needed to help people find positive ways forward.  </p> <p> The strength of the local community has been severely tested but it has shown its collective meitheal in the days and weeks since the terrible explosion.  In the months and years ahead, we must ensure that the families affected and the local community continue to be supported and to receive any necessary State and public supports in recognition of their needs.  </p> <p> The loss so suddenly of so many loved ones on such a scale has been unprecedented in our country in recent years.  As we enter the dark days of winter, our thoughts, sympathies and solidarity will remain with the people of Creeslough as they continue to live with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.</p></speech>

Families who are directly affected will hurt due to this enormous loss and tragedy.  I am very conscious that this is extremely raw.  It is very raw for the people who are still grieving.  We are in the middle of the months' minds and while this opportunity has been afforded to us parliamentarians to speak on this issue, I am conscious that there are people who are in tremendous pain and are hurting following the loss of their loved ones - their relatives, neighbours and friends.</p><p>From the Friday night, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was on-site with many other emergency services.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine pointed out, the council played a very active role in ensuring there was an immediate response in conjunction with the community.  An inspector was appointed on the Friday night by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the families who were going to be directly affected.  I acknowledge the immediate response of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the aftermath of that appointment, Garda liaison officers were appointed to deal directly with the families.  It is important that we reassure the families that those Garda liaison officers will remain with them in the days, weeks, months and years ahead.  It is important to emphasise this.  Regardless of the response, the one thing we must be conscious of is that it is must be victim-centred and victim-focused.  One thing I have learned in my 23 years in politics is that words can be comforting or lead to difficulties.  It is important that whatever words are used in the future emphasise the point that victims will be central to whatever plan is put in place for the community in Creeslough.  </p><p>I acknowledge Donegal County Council for appointing a liaison person on-site, which was also important.  They were very proactive in setting up their group at both executive and county level to ensure that there is a mechanism there.  I acknowledge Padraic Fingleton and his team from Donegal Local Development Company, who have been proactive in meeting with different representatives from the community and leadership within the community to figure out a way forward.  From speaking to Mr. Fingleton, it is clear that we are struggling regarding what the best thing to do here is.  As a Donegal Deputy and a neighbour of Creeslough, I am struggling to figure out what the next best steps are.  From my own experience and my experience in community development, I think the best thing we can do is to ensure the community of Creeslough is not forgotten.  Regardless of what the response to this community is, it must be a community response so we need to ensure at all times that whatever is needed in the future is provided.  </p><p>I am also conscious that whatever we do or whatever plans or visions we have for the future will not change what people have lost in terms of family members, neighbours and friends so we must all be very cognisant of that.  My colleagues, Deputies Doherty and MacLochlainn, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have emphasised the importance of community response and listed numerous examples of people who responded in the immediate aftermath.  I join them in expressing those sentiments and in acknowledging the role of Father John Joe Duffy and Reverend David Skuce, whom I got to know during the week.  I join my colleagues in praising the work done at a pastoral level.  We need to support them too.  I spoke to a lady today who said:</p> <blockquote> 	Joe, we're living with this every day.  Every morning we wake up, we're still living with it and we know we're going to be living with it for a long time into the future. </blockquote>  <p>As parliamentarians, we can ensure we continue to communicate and let people know they will not be forgotten.  We can do this not just through words but through actions and this is something I will endeavour to do.  </p><p>We have a lot of examples internationally where communities have had to deal with enormous trauma and tragedies in different forms that have left a massive legacy.  A lot of people have been reaching out from Wales to Scotland to the North.  On that Friday night when I spoke to many young men and women from the emergency services in the North who joined our own emergency response, they were very shocked by the whole thing.  These were men and women in their thirties who would never have had to deal with this type of tragedy in the North.  This shows how things have moved on in the North and how collectively we can learn from the North's past and people like Reverend Norman Hamilton from north Belfast who reached out directly to the community and want to help it.  We have a role to play as parliamentarians in using our own networks to do that.  I acknowledge Malachy O'Neill from Magee University and Eddie Friel, who will facilitate a meeting - an initial conversation - to figure out the best thing to help the community in the medium to long term.  At the moment, there are nuts and bolts issues that need to be dealt with.  There needs to be proper communication for local businesspeople who want to get their businesses to a place to serve the community knowing what the plan is.</p> <p>I refer to whatever communication An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the safety authorities can provide regarding the investigations, once complete.  It is important that these lines of communication are led from the front.<br/><br/>To conclude, I again extend my deepest sympathies to the families and the Creeslough community, to the families and relatives of the deceased, to those critically injured and to all the people directly impacted by this tragedy that arrived on our doorstep. <b></b>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.

Ten lives are gone.  The impact of such a loss has now truly hit home.  For at least ten homes, it will never go away.  The truth is that Creeslough will never be the same.  A semblance of normality will return, but from now on Creeslough will always be a place marked by sorrow for everyone who lives in, visits and drives through the town.</p>  <p>  It will also, though, be a symbol of the best of humanity, of Ireland and of Donegal.  It will be a symbol of a community coming together and of resilience and solidarity.  I again commend all those who ran to assist in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.  I refer to volunteers and those in the emergency services, who worked alongside each other in a desperate bid to save lives.  I again commend all those who provided such crucial leadership in the month that has followed this awful explosion.  I also again commend Fr. John Doe Duffy and other clergy, as well as other leaders, in GAA and other sports clubs and community organisations.  In this, I include the local Oireachtas Members who stood by and with the community through a very tough period.  I commend the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, for his speech today.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I especially commend Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn.  Like other elected representatives, they have gone through what must have been, on any level, the very traumatic experience of having had to stand beside so many families who experienced such devastating loss over such a short time.  I have no doubt that all these Oireachtas Members and local elected representatives will continue to advocate for the needs of the people they represent in Creeslough and the surrounding areas.  These needs must be met.</p>  <p>  After all the news stories have been written, families and communities must have full recourse to the resources they need and any answers they require.  I am conscious this State has not always delivered these things for families that have experienced such tragedies in the past.  I hope, however, that the unity of this House, which we heard expressed in the statements in the immediate aftermath and again today, will ensure there is a different legacy and a different story when it comes to Creeslough.  I also wish to be associated with the remarks of sympathy conveyed to the families of Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Leona Harper, Robert Garwe, little Shauna Flanagan Garwe, James O'Flaherty, Martina Martin, Hugh Kelly, Catherine O'Connell and James Monaghan.  We shall remember them.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse. </p></speech>

In an instant, the lives of ten people were snatched away and the lives of those left behind were changed utterly.  On that terrible day, we lost James O'Flaherty, Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Hugh Kelly, Martina Martin, Leona Harper, who was just 14, Robert Garwe, and his little daughter, Shauna Flanagan Garwe, Catherine O'Connell and her teenage son, James Monaghan.</p>  <p>  For the families involved, such appalling loss is unfathomable and unimaginable.  The grief and pain are still desperately raw.  This week marked another difficult milestone for the families and friends of the victims as the months' mind masses got underway.  The sorrow is absolutely palpable.  The entire community has been impacted by this disaster.  For such a small and close-knit area, the deaths of ten people in such a shocking incident will leave indelible scars.  Everybody in the town knows those who died and those who were wounded.  Every family is in some way touched by this appalling tragedy.</p>  <p>  People across the country also got to know the victims.  We know Robert and five-year-old Shauna, who had just started school a few short weeks before her death.  They had stopped at the shop to buy a birthday cake.  Leona, a talented rugby player, was looking forward to a sleepover that night and was in the shop to buy an ice cream.  Martin, a devoted carer for his mother, was at the ATM to get money for a takeaway.  Jessica, a talented young designer, was due to start a new job and an exciting new stage in her career a few short days after the explosion.  The whole country was moved by the eulogy of 12-year-old Hamish O'Flaherty for his dad, James, who he described as a "great man".  Hamish had sage advice for us all.  He said we should be grateful for the families we have, and that we should cherish them and be grateful because, as he reminded us, they will not be here forever.</p>  <p>  It is difficult in the wake of an event as appalling as this tragedy to find words that seem adequate to describe fully the intense heartbreak and incomprehension everyone feels.  Perhaps the best description came from Creeslough's parish priest, Fr. John Joe Duffy.  He said the community had been hit by what he referred to as "a tsunami of grief".  The grief continues of course.  It is immense, relentless and overpowering.  In moments of deep despair, we can also look for signs of hope, a chink of light to illuminate the darkness.  This light came in the form of the strength of the many members of the local community who worked tirelessly to save as many people as possible and to retrieve the remains of those who had died as swiftly as possible in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.  We can also see light in the response of the members of the emergency services, who acted with such diligence and sensitivity at such an unspeakably awful time.  We see light as well in the work of our healthcare workers, who treated the injured with such care and kindness and who continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Now, we must ensure that those who are wounded, bereaved and otherwise impacted by this terrible tragedy continue to receive the support they so desperately need.  This support must be offered to those caught up in this devastating incident and living not only in Creeslough but also in Letterkenny, Dunfanaghy and other surrounding areas.  Local schools dealing with the grief of students who lost classmates and parents also require long-term and ongoing support.  This support must be available and there must be no question of this.  It must include intensive mental health services and counselling.  There can be no question of this support being withdrawn before the need for it ends.  This support must be made available and continue to be made available.</p> <p>My thoughts and sympathies and those of all Social Democrats members are with the community of Creeslough and surrounding areas and those who have worked and will continue to work over the coming weeks and months to support them through this desperately dark period.</p></speech>

Our thoughts, prayers and support go out to them in what must be a very difficult time as they head into a month's mind to recall and treasure their lost loved ones.</p>  <p>  I was fortunate to be able to visit the village of Creeslough on Sunday two weeks ago when I attended mass in St. Michael's Church.  Fr. Seamus Murphy stood in as substitute for Fr. John Joe Duffy who, not surprisingly, had Covid because in the previous weeks he had so much contact, literally in touch in every way.  Pope Francis described the role of the priest as like someone in a field hospital.  Fr. Duffy helped people of the community through a very difficult time.</p>  <p>  Through Fr. Duffy, I was lucky to meet Margaret Anne Dolan and Brian Dolan, members of the Creeslough Community Association.  Through them, I had the great honour of meeting various people in the village who had been heroic in their response.  From listening to them, what stayed with me was the instantaneous response after the explosion when the community, the people of the village, arrived at the most unimaginable scene and had the incredibly arduous job of getting people out and trying to prevent any further casualties or loss of life.  The heroism the people of the village showed at that time touched so many people here and all over the world.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the village is cut off.  I was talking to Deputy Doherty last week about the need to reopen the road as soon as we can.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.  At the same time, garda&iacute; standing guard at the scene are making sure the incident is investigated in a thoroughly professional and proper way.  That is fair but I hope the road will reopen shortly.  My Department will do everything we can to help restore connectivity and ensure the community is supported, as it needs to be, through counselling, to which Deputy Shortall referred, and every other measure and means available to us.</p></speech>

The close-knit nature of their community was what I was most struck by in the early hours and in those early days after this tragedy.  In times of grief, we all know that those first few days and weeks can feel like a blur.  It is the presence of others that gets us through it but, one month on from the tragedy, I am sure the bitter reality of life without their loved ones is settling in for the community of Creeslough.  That is why it is so important that society and we as parliamentarians remember those lost and continue to keep their names, spirit and legacies alive and continue to offer small condolence to grieving families and friends that, as life moves on, their loved ones will never be forgotten by their families and friends or the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I commend all the local Deputies and councillors, including Deputy McHugh, who provided such support to the community and continue to do so.  In particular, I commend the work of Fr. John Joe Duffy who has been a rock for his parish in Donegal.  In recent weeks, we have seen the worst of the church in Ireland being highlighted but Fr. Duffy's example is in such stark contrast and represents the best of the church and of community leadership.  I was glad to read Fr. Duffy's recent comment that he was quick to avail of the counselling services offered to Creeslough residents.  That is truly leadership by example.</p>  <p>  I commend the HSE on acting so quickly to make these services available and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Frank Feighan, who was on site, with Deputy McHugh, in the early days to put that emergency response together.  I hope that a plan for long-term support will be established to continue to provide residents with the help they need in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  The impact of an event such as this on a community is immeasurable.  There is the absolute randomness of it.  There is the cruelness of people being taken away while doing ordinary everyday things, such as going to the local shop, visiting the post office or buying an ice-cream or birthday cake.  These are things the people of Creeslough would have done every day without a second thought.  They are things all of us do every day without a second thought.  We cannot rationalise this kind of tragedy.  I hope the community will continue to avail of professional help to assist them.</p>  <p>  The education and training board has submitted an application to the Department of Education for support services to provide additional grief and counselling in schools.  I ask the Minister for Education to look at that, as local representatives, including Deputy McHugh, have already done.</p>  <p>  The hub of the Creeslough community was the local petrol station and shop.  Its loss is no doubt a constant reminder of the tragedy and the lives lost.  I commend the businesses that made donations to the temporary shop in the community to keep people going with essentials and the contractors working around the clock to get a new shop up and running and restore community facilities.</p>  <p>  Creeslough is an exceptionally strong community.  We have all seen that.  I have no doubt that while people grieve the loss of their loved ones and keep their legacies alive, they will learn to laugh and smile again and there will be times of joy again.  I was heartened to hear that on 30 October, the people of Creeslough lined the streets once again, but this time to cheer on the arrival of the victorious St. Michael's GAA club's under-13 team.  They stopped to pay tribute to those lost on 7 October.  While they did this, I am told the local church celebrated the baptism of three babies - a symbol of hope for the future of Creeslough.</p>  <p>  I sincerely hope that the people of Creeslough feel the support of all of Ireland behind them.  The Government, the people of Ireland and people beyond Ireland are with them.  Most importantly, I hope they know that the lives of Shauna, Robert, Catherine, James Monaghan and James O'Flaherty, Leona, Jessica, Martin, Hugh and Martina will never be forgotten.</p></speech>

It was one of those moments where the island was united in shock and in grief.  It was one of those moments when we look at our own lives and the people in them and take the time and opportunity to tell them how much we value and love them and how unbearable it would be to imagine life without them.  This is exactly the present and future for the families of those who lost their lives in Creeslough.</p>  <p>  I am of the generation who did not go around saying "I love you" to family members or hearing it from them, but we all knew it.  I said it to my dad a few weeks before he died when he was having a serious operation and I remember the two of us were bawling.  I am so glad I did but at least I had notice.  What happened in Creeslough was not expected.  It was an ordinary day.  A simple trip to the shops, a good turn by a neighbour or a quick nip in for an ice-cream or birthday cake ended the lives of their beloved and changed forever their own.  No more than my daddy and I both knew it, those people were loved too.  For the surviving loved ones, they must know that.</p>  <p>  No matter how long or short our lives, no matter how happy, simple or complex they are, our lives begin and end with a set of numbers - our date of birth and the date of our death.  The first we celebrate year in, year out, while the second comes more slowly and we do not know when it will come.  It arrived for the people of Creeslough on 7 October 2022.  I wish comfort and healing to the families and the community.</p>  <p>  I pay special tribute to the Garda, the fire service, the first responders, ambulance service and the priests in the parish of Creeslough.</p> <p>They showed that at times of deep crisis there is a welcome and a place for us all, whether our faith has lapsed or we have no religion.  I am not a very religious person but I believe the whole island was struck by the shocked and broken-hearted people coming and going to the church to find some comfort, answer or meaning.  I pay tribute to Fr. John Joe Duffy and the priests of the surrounding parishes.  I know and remember the comfort it brings when we lose somebody we love.</p> <p> I often hear people of Donegal say the county is up north and forgotten but it is not.  We will never forget the victims, families and friends from that fateful day.  Donegal is loved throughout the 32 counties of Ireland.  From the people of north Kildare I send to the people of Creeslough my deepest sympathies.  I extend my sympathies to my D&aacute;il comrades Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn and Teachta&iacute; McHugh, McConalogue and Pringle.  Whether our counties win or lose, we all feel it.  Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Leona Harper, Robert Garwe, little Shauna Flanagan Garwe, James O'Flaherty, Martina Martin, Hugh Kelly, Catherine O'Donnell and James Monaghan; ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800023#V00200"><p>A month ago today, the images that flashed across our screens and were transmitted on social media left us all feeling cold and anxious about what had happened and what it was all about.  Looking at local people moving through rubble with their bare hands and local contractors moving in machinery and refusing to stop working until they completed the rescue operation was reminiscent of something we are familiar with seeing in Palestine, Ukraine, Yemen and during our own troubled past.  They were scenes we did not get used to but they were frequent enough.  Something really tragic, desperate and unusual happened in the beautiful county of Donegal.  There could have been no contrast greater than that between the scene at Creeslough and the absolute beauty of the local environment.</p>  <p>  I pay credit to the first responders, the local people and the front-line workers who helped all of those injured and killed.  It says a lot about humanity and what human beings are capable of when we see such a brilliant response to such a really dreadful tragedy.  I understand the counselling services offered to the local people have been accessed more than 200 times and that the HSE is expecting a surge in the demand for these services in the lead-up to Christmas.  This is perfectly understandable.  Christmas is a time for family, joy and togetherness.  It will be very tough.  All of our thoughts should be with the family and friends of those who died, those who were injured and those who ended up in hospital and perhaps are still in hospital or may have to continue to attend hospital.  We should remind ourselves that the trauma they will have to live with is very deep.  People may have heard Fergal Keane on the radio this morning speak about the post-traumatic stress disorder he has suffered and how he has attempted to grapple with it over many years as a war correspondent.  We could not but be very moved by his advice never to feel alone and not to give up searching for acceptance and peace.  I hope this will be inspiring to the families in the coming period and particularly to the survivors and those injured.</p>  <p>  Many of us know the families of the victims and survivors of the Stardust fire.  Although these were very different circumstances, we understand how important it is to be remembered, not to be forgotten and to have closure on a dreadful tragedy.  Nothing can compare to the abrupt and untimely ending of life for these ten people.  Really and truly, our hearts have to go out to them.  As month's mind masses take place all over Donegal in the coming days, we should remember Shauna Flanagan Garwe and her father Robert, Catherine O'Donnell and her son James, Leona Harper, Jessica Gallagher, James O'Flaherty, Martin McGill, Martina Martin and Hugh Kelly.  Not to be forgotten is terribly important.  People should be fully supported by all of the services that can be made available to them.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha uaisle.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very difficult and solemn debate to which I have listened intently.  This is one of those moments when all of us in the House reflect the mood of the entire nation, north, south, east and west, on the sheer upset and hurt caused by the devastating tragedy in Creeslough.  We look at the requests and responses that have come from this.  As Deputy McHugh said so eloquently, it is about ensuring the support services are there for as long as they are needed and they will be needed for so much longer.</p>  <p>  The victims of this tragedy must be remembered.  That this tragedy occurred almost seven years to the day since a tragic fire in my constituency in Carrickmines when ten people also lost their lives brought home just how much this will occupy the hearts and minds of the entire nation and not only the families of the victims, the immediate community and the emergency services.  The emergency services deserve particular credit for the fact that they rushed to deal with it from throughout the island.  They showed unwavering commitment to the cause.</p>  <p>  This event is devastating and everyone can see themselves or their family members in the images of the victims.  They try to put themselves in the shoes of the family members, friends and community.  They ask how they could possibly deal with such unfathomable devastation.  People say time is a healer but it does not bring back loved ones.  What is the responsibility of all of us in the Oireachtas?  It is to ensure we continue to speak about this and continue to support our Oireachtas colleagues from Donegal, who have spoken so eloquently and emotionally this afternoon, as well as councillors and local authority members to ensure supports are provided for the entire community.</p>  <p>  I mention in passing a family who live on the same road as me in Dublin as it shows the breadth of this tragedy and how it affected so many people.  They lost their little cousin and her father in the tragedy.  Their immediate response, of course, was great upset.  These are young children of national school age.  They also wanted to do something to remember their cousin who was not with them for particularly long.  They baked cakes and got the school community in Stepaside to contribute to ensure there would be a permanent memorial in the school and preschool of their little cousin.  The question is what can we do when we get like this.  Doing something is often the hardest thing.  We saw the action of very young children who will live with this for the rest of the lives.  They will live with it much longer than the rest of us.  We can look at the motivation to provide hope for all families and all victims, to keep the memories alive and to provide supports.</p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned the victims of the awful Stardust tragedy.  There was also the Carrickmines fire in my constituency.  There are many more such tragedies for which there is no explanation.  The memories of those lost must not only be kept alive among their loved ones, family members and communities but, crucially, among the nation as a whole.  It was telling that we saw condolence messages come to the community in Creeslough from around the world, including from the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, the Ceann Comhairle and many other people.  This showed how much this tragedy hit home for so many people.</p>  <p>  I will finish with a particular reference to the Oireachtas Members and public representatives in Donegal who stood up here and made very difficult comments.  I saw Deputy Doherty on the evening news several hours afterwards.  I was struck by how tough it is to act in service of the community and State at these times.  All of them have done so with such levels of dignity and compassion.  Those of us in politics who perhaps have become a little bit cynical about life should always remember that our duty is to our constituents at all times.  If we can carry ourselves half as well as they have done in recent weeks, we will be of some credit to our own constituencies.</p></speech>

There was an outpouring of grief but also an outpouring of solidarity.  The air was heavy with grief and trauma.  Having called to the various centres, I could see that a plan had been put in place by the emergency services, the local authority in Donegal, the HSE and many volunteers.  I pay tribute to them for the way in which they quickly dealt with the situation, went to the shop within minutes of the explosion and saved many lives.</p> <p> Father John Joe Duffy said, "While we cannot take that pain away for you, we want to walk with you&rdquo;.  The people of Ireland - North and South - were united in their grief for and solidarity with the people of Creeslough and Donegal.  Across the United Kingdom, Europe and the world, Creeslough was on most people's minds.  There was a huge sense of hope after lives were suddenly taken away in this random act.  Hamish O'Flaherty, the 12-year-old son of James O'Flaherty, called on everyone to cherish life and family.  We all know how deeply important those few words were.</p> <p> To the men, women and children of Creeslough, I say that Creeslough is everything that is beautiful about our country.  Unfortunately, this random act has transformed Creeslough.  Out of that, Siobh&aacute;n Carr and the staff at The Coffee Pod provided an oasis of comfort.  They showed great respect for and stood by the people of Creeslough.</p> <p> The HSE will continue to offer counselling to those who need it.  It was a difficult time for everybody.  All the resources must be made available throughout various Departments for the people of Creeslough and Donegal.  Life moves on, but we cannot forget.</p></speech>

We all watched and waited and, unfortunately, our worst fears were realised as the truth came out about the people who died and the families who were impacted.  I do not think any of us will forget that.  I was involved in many community activities in County Louth the following day and all people wanted to talk about was this.  It was county final season and not only did the GAA recognise what happened at Creeslough with a moment's silence but it had a fundraiser, as many others had.  This was an attempt to do something about this absolute tragedy.  We know the families have been devastated.  The community of Creeslough and surrounding areas have been impacted greatly and the people of Donegal felt this pain.  We all felt it but not to the same degree as they did.  We must ensure the counselling services that are required are provided by the HSE as necessary, because dealing with tragedy and grief is an ongoing, long process.  We must ensure we are with those people for the long run, and that is something we are required to do.</p>  <p>  As other Members have done, I commend those who rushed to help, volunteered and were involved with the emergency services, North and South, and with the HSE.  All of us have heard multiple stories of people who did that extra piece and stayed that bit longer because of this tragedy.  We all know of people who were injured and impacted by this, such is the nature of the small island in which we live.  We all have connections to Donegal.  My granny on my mother's side was from Falcarragh.  My grandfather played Gaelic football for Donegal, a skill set I did not inherit, which will not come as a shock to anyone who saw me play.  The fact is that we all felt this pain, but we must ensure those who felt it greatest are provided with the necessary services.</p>  <p>  I commend those who showed leadership, particularly Father John Joe Duffy and the Members of the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il.  Deputies Pearse Doherty, P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Charlie McConalogue, Joe McHugh and Thomas Pringle have to be commended on dealing head-on with this tragedy, which was on a huge level and was incredibly difficult.  We all welcome what happened with St. Michael's GAA, and how Amber Barrett summed up the feeling for us when she said, "This is for Creeslough; this is for Donegal."  I offer my thoughts and prayers to the families of those who are gone.  We must remember but we must also make sure we follow through on doing what is necessary.</p></speech>

Is deas &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il ar ais anseo ar&iacute;s.</p><p>I begin by reiterating my deepest sympathies to the people of Creeslough and the wider Donegal community.  Most especially, I convey my deepest sympathies, and the sympathies of my colleagues in Aont&uacute;, to the families of Leona Harper, Robert Garwe, Shauna Flanagan Garwe, Jessica Gallagher, James O'Flaherty, Martina Martin, Hugh Kelly, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan and Martin McGill.  All of them were simply going about their normal, everyday lives, such as choosing an ice cream, purchasing a birthday cake, buying messages for the week, collecting a pension, or visiting a loved one.  That normal life was shattered in an instant, one which will last forever.</p><p>This shocking explosion has devastated families, broken the hearts of so many people around Ireland and left an unfillable void in the communities affected.  I still find it hard to believe.  I remember listening, hour after hour, to the news reports from Creeslough on that fateful day.  I felt that the worst possible scenario was being realised in every news report released.</p><p>I pay tribute to the emergency services that struggled to save so many lives a month ago.  The staff of those services went through thick and thin in very difficult circumstances that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.  They did not give up until they had saved or, at least, retrieved every loved one who was lost that day.  I pay tribute to the parish priest, Father John Joe Duffy, who did his best to offer support and solace to the families in these toughest of circumstances.  In recent days, Father Duffy said that the numbness and shock is beginning to wear off and the pain of loss and trauma is becoming more acute.  That is the difficulty in this regard.  In many ways, that pain and trauma will manifest itself further in families in the weeks after this event.  He also said:</p> <blockquote> 	Healing in a community like ours is a multi-faceted thing.  It comes through what we offer as a church, with what the HSE offers, with what the soccer club, the youth club, the dance classes, and the GAA club offer.  It&rsquo;s about members of the community talking together or at least doing things together. </blockquote>  <p>That is a really important issue.  Through that community experience, people will achieve some level of healing in regard to this.</p> <p>I know Creeslough very well and stayed there a number of times with friends from the village.  On that fateful day I spoke on the phone to many of our cumann members who live there.  I pay tribute to the community in Creeslough, the people of Donegal and the elected representatives from the county here today, namely, Deputies Mac Lochlainn, Pringle, McHugh, McConalogue and Doherty.  As elected representatives, I know this will have hit them hard.  We lost five teenage girls in a school crash in Navan almost 20 years ago.  The hurt that caused is still alive in the community in Navan and Meath today.  I would like to remember those girls now.</p> <p> Nothing can prepare a community for this.  Supporting families and loved ones when someone dies is one of the best traits of the Irish people.  It is something we do well, in many ways.  There is no doubt that supportive trait came to the fore in Donegal.</p> <p> Many people have mentioned Hamish O'Flaherty, a young boy who has been through so much and yet spoke so courageously at the funeral for his father, James O'Flaherty.  He said we should be grateful for our families, cherish them and be grateful because they will not be there forever.  I spoke to people from Creeslough today who told me the month's mind masses have started and the church was full to the brim last night, and will be again over the coming weeks.  The HSE is providing counselling and I encourage people to avail of it and make sure they get the support they need.  </p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, raised the issue of the investigation.  It is of paramount importance that the investigation is carried out to the best ability of those involved in it.  It is important that we know what happened on that fateful day and can learn lessons to make sure it never happens to another community.  The Minister might be able to update the D&aacute;il on progress in the investigation.  He also mentioned the difficulties families are facing with the country roads currently being used in Creeslough, something that has been mentioned to me.  These roads are not suitable for large volumes of traffic, especially on dark winter days.  The point has been made that people would like to see the main road through the village reopened.</p> <p> D&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n ioml&aacute;n &oacute; chro&iacute; le muintir an Chraoslaigh agus Dh&uacute;n na nGall.

We have to salute each and every person in the vicinity of the shop, passers-by, neighbours, first responders, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ambulance crews, the fire brigade, council workers, hospital staff from the North and South and everybody else who tried to help.  There was a real sense of the meitheal.  They are normally organised but on this occasion in Creeslough it was spontaneous.  The late Bridie Gallagher sang &quot;The Homes of Donegal&quot; and what else would we expect from the area?  Bh&iacute; siad iontach i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.</p><p>The local parish priest, Father John Joe Duffy, was a source of great comfort and strength to the bereaved families and entire local community as his church became a focus for everyone's grief in the close-knit Creeslough community.  Father Duffy officiated at six of the eight funerals of the ten victims and became one of the most familiar representatives of the shattered community.  From our observations, it is very easy to see that he is very well respected and liked and a pillar of the local community.</p><p>I thank the Minister, D&aacute;il colleagues, Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, Deputies McHugh and Pringle, local councillors and anybody who tried to help lessen the burden and share the grief.  It was a true grief.  As I said, this happened a month ago last Friday.  A month after the devastating blast, the impact on the quiet community of Creeslough in County Donegal is still real and raw.</p><p>In a weekend edition of the <i>Irish Examiner, </i>Father Duffy said it is still very sad and the whole community is shocked and numb.  The devastating impact of this tragedy on the families and loved ones of those directly affected is life-changing and heartbreaking.  It is fair to restate that the impact of this is life-changing in so many ways for the community in Creeslough and north Donegal.  </p><p>It is important to have support.  Father Duffy said on radio yesterday he was one of the first to go for counselling.  Goodness knows he needs it.  We are all proud people and may say that we do not need any support like that, but we all do.  Father Duffy showed great courage and dignity in saying that.  I compliment any clergy of all denominations North and South.  I thank the Government and Taoiseach.  They did their best.  There is not a lot anyone can do but be physically present representing the community in this House.</p><p>Those who passed away are James O'Flaherty, Jessica Gallagher, Martina Martin, Leona Harper, Shauna Flanagan Garwe and her father Robert, Hugh Kelly and Catherine O'Donnell and her son James Monaghan.

I sympathise on behalf of my entire family and the people of Kerry and send our sincerest sympathies to everyone.  I pay tribute to elected members in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in Donegal and those who helped in every way.</p>  <p>  When this unspeakable tragedy happened, Irish people all over the country and the world were horrified.  We never dreamed it could happen in any part of our country.  Donegal is much like Kerry.  We are the same kind of people, living with the Atlantic Ocean to our backs.  We are horrified by what has happened.  May God give the families strength to carry on and live for tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I wish to say to the families that it is good to have known the loved ones they have lost and to try to carry on and do their best.  If there is any way the D&aacute;il can help those left behind, we should do so.  It is an unspeakable tragedy.  We know all of those who lost their lives are in heaven.  May God be good to the families who are left behind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800026#Y00100"><p>I welcome the Ceann Comhairle back to the House after his recent illness.</p>  <p>  Yesterday marked one month since the devastating explosion took place at the Applegreen station in Creeslough.  Donegal has not been the same since that day.  I speak on behalf of the entire county when I say that our hearts are broken and our thoughts are constantly with those who passed and their friends and families.  A community was changed forever on 7 October and it is unimaginable to think what the loss of ten people is to a community of only approximately 400.  Parents, grandparents, children, siblings, partners, friends, neighbours and colleagues were all lost suddenly and many lives were permanently changed.  It is absolutely heartbreaking.</p>  <p>  Coming to terms with this incredible loss is a very long and devastating process and should be supported in every way possible.  Several month's mind masses will take place over the coming days.  This will be a fresh wave of grief for the community and it is a reminder to the nation of Donegal's darkest day.  For all of us in the county, however, this tragedy has stuck with us every day since.  A dark cloud lingers over the hills and, frankly, I do not think the county will every be the same again.</p>  <p>  In order to help come to terms with this devastating loss, supports should be available to the community during this time and long into the future.  Maybe it is not the right time to say so but I have to say I am very disappointed to hear that supports have been scaled back in recent days.  The grieving process has only just begun for this community and we must ensure the people of Creeslough are supported and given the space needed to grieve.  I call on the HSE to bring back the drop-in counselling support services in Creeslough, not only during this difficult time, but in order to be available at any point in the future.  Twenty days is not nearly enough time for those affected.</p>  <p>  In the past month, the community has been numbed by a sense of shock.  It is only in the coming months and years that people will properly come to terms with the unspeakable nightmare that cruelly visited them on that day.  It has still not sunk in for people.  Many locals say they are struggling with sleep in particular.  Counselling without a GP referral should still be available to everybody.  I heard on the radio yesterday that the HSE has confirmed that counselling will still be available for the community, but to have it directed through the already-creaking GP service is not good enough.  It needs to be available easily.  At the very least, the contact phone number should be maintained.  The weeks ahead are when people will need support even more, as it is attempted to return to so-called normal.</p>  <p>  I think of the children of the area in particular.  No doubt they will have difficulty processing such a tragedy as time and life go on.  I am also thinking of the brave locals who rushed to the scene to help with the rescue efforts.  They show the type of community Creeslough is.  I can only imagine the harrowing scene with which they were met and how this will no doubt stay with them for life.</p>  <p>  I also have to address public representatives.  I am thinking in particular of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the disgraceful tweets she sent which caused distress and annoyance to many Donegal people.  They were alleging sinister motivation within an hour of the disaster happening.  No one was in any way able to make decisions about what could have happened that quickly.  It was in such bad taste that it is hard to understand.  It caused hurt to many people in Donegal.  People have asked me to raise this and that is why I am doing so.  I urge everyone to think before they comment in future because words have an impact.  I take this opportunity to call on fellow representatives, the media and the nation as a whole to respect the privacy of the community at this difficult time.</p>  <p>  The country came together for Creeslough.  The generosity of Irish people at home and abroad was truly incredible.  I know it meant a lot to the people of Creeslough and Donegal to know that the country stood with them in a time of need.  Now the community needs the space to cope with the grieving process and to honour their loved ones.  I will take the opportunity to recognise the efforts of all those who have supported the community in the past month: the clergy; the emergency services North and South; the businesses that offered their services and the surrounding communities that pulled together to support Creeslough.</p>  <p>  We remember James O'Flaherty, Jessica Gallagher, Martin McGill, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan, Hugh Kelly, Martina Martin, Robert Garwe, Shauna Flanagan Garwe and Leona Harper who are forever in the hearts of the people of Donegal and represented the best of our county.  When faced with tragedy, the Creeslough community responded with remarkable kindness.  It demonstrated exactly what it is to come from a rural community in Donegal.  When grief hits, we band together, silently and instinctively.  There is a quiet kindness to the love and care of a community holding each other up and looking after each other without words or question.  That is what being from Donegal is about and what the Creeslough community will be remembered for.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800026#Y00800"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Members for their co-operation in getting the Bill to this stage and the committee for having this Bill prioritised for publication.  I am pleased to bring forward the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2022.  It is further important legislation as part of the Government's efforts to help the wider enterprise sector to meet the considerable challenges presented by the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent significant rise in business costs.</p>  <p>  The main purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, as amended, in order to help businesses to access essential liquidity through their banks and other financial institutions.  The finance is needed as a result of the pressure increased costs have put on viable but vulnerable Irish businesses.  The Bill also includes a short technical amendment to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021.  This will enable the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into further agreements with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises.</p>  <p>  I will explain why this Bill is necessary.  The impact on the Irish economy of the invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects on costs, especially in fuel, have resulted in a surge in operating costs for businesses and a drop in confidence across the board.  With the increasing duration of elevated energy prices, the negative economic impacts are and will continue to be felt by all sectors.  </p> <p>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, consumer price index, CPI, states that costs rose by 8.2% between September 2021 and September 2022.  The highest level of inflation for 38 years was recorded in June 2022 at 9.1%, a level not seen since 1984.  September marked the 12th straight month where the annual increase for the CPI has been at least 5%.  These increased costs will cause significant strains on the working capital position of our SMEs and they will need to spread their costs over the next one to three years to deal with the oncoming price spikes.  It is also expected that the increase in energy prices, as well as other raw materials, and some essential inputs required by Irish businesses such as fertiliser and feed, will drive price inflation for goods heavily reliant on energy and other mentioned inputs for their production.  These developments may damage profitability and growth, thereby resulting in a reduction of economic activities, potential job losses and business closures.  Businesses will need assistance to adapt their operations to a changing business environment and to restructure suppliers and their cost bases.  Confidence is being negatively impacted by the ongoing uncertainty and so an important part of the rationale for Government intervention is to rebuild confidence.  A significant and ambitious credit guarantee scheme will assist lenders in providing liquidity to these companies and send a strong signal of support and confidence to both lenders and borrowers.</p> <p> For context, there are approximately 270,000 SMEs in Ireland, based on CSO figures.  SMEs account for 66.4%, or two thirds of all persons employed in businesses in Ireland.  SMEs generated 43.6% of total turnover in the business economy and 36.9% of gross value added was attributed to these enterprises.  They are the majority of businesses in every county.  They are the dairy farmer, the family-owned newsagent and the software startup.  They create jobs and generate wealth in locations where large businesses do not establish themselves.  They are in every sector and the people who own them and work there are from every background.  SMEs are very much the fabric of Irish society.  They are more than just numbers.  Every time we have this discussion in the House the desire to assist SMEs through difficult times is evident in Deputies from all parties and none.  I recognise that and recognise the support to bring this Bill through as quickly as we possibly can.  That is why I and my Department are so keen to provide any support we can to keep these businesses afloat and help them survive through the next few difficult months.  We hope they will be in a position to thrive thereafter when we get through yet another difficult time for businesses.</p> <p> The Government has been busy in making assistance available to businesses to allow them to tackle and overcome the expected costs pressures of this year and next.  The first of these is the &euro;1.25 billion temporary business energy support scheme announced on budget day.  It will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills up to &euro;10,000 per month.  It will help small businesses most, but also medium and larger businesses.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, backdated to September and will run until at least February 2023.  We hope to be in a position to have that open before the end of this month.  The second initiative is a &euro;200 million targeted Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme and was launched last week by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  This is designed to assist viable but vulnerable businesses in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services sectors that are suffering the broader effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as increasing energy costs.  One strand of the scheme will provide up to &euro;2 million in grant aid for energy-intensive companies impacted by the exceptionally severe increases in gas and electricity costs.  It will be administered through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and eligible businesses must produce an energy efficiency plan which shows how they will get their energy costs down in the months and years ahead.  Operating in tandem with the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will be the new growth and sustainability loan scheme.  This will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to ten years available to SMEs, including farmers and fishers as well as small mid-caps, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000.  A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards environmental sustainability purposes.  Amendments in this Bill to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021 will facilitate my Department in establishing the growth and sustainability loan scheme.</p> <p> This legislation which will make the amendments necessary to implement a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  This will replicate many elements of the highly successful Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  That scheme saw over &euro;700 million in lending to 9,850 businesses.  This helped maintain 81,000 jobs in just 21 months of availability.  In the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, the State will be guaranteeing 80% of the loans included in the scheme.  Lenders will still retain 20% of the risk to ensure they have skin in the game.  Viable businesses will be supported.  The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will include primary producers such as farmers and fishers as well as small mid-caps with under 500 employees.  This is something which we can do under flexibilities from the European Commission in its temporary crisis framework on state aid introduced to respond to the aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  It is very similar to the framework the Commission created for the Covid pandemic and its efforts during Brexit as well.  This Bill is aimed at putting in place State-backed guarantees so businesses that employ up to 499 people can go to the banks and other participating financial institutions for lending across a range of financial products.  We had a mix of lenders involved in the previous schemes, including credit unions and non-traditional lenders, as well as the main banks.  Likewise, we hope to see a similar number of people offering this scheme as well.  As part of the state aid requirements the businesses will pay a fee to the State for a guarantee related to their borrowing.  If a business defaults in its repayment of those loans or overdrafts, the financial institution can then call in the guarantee from the State, which will cover 80% of the outstanding debt.  The financial institutions will still have to carry 20% of that default itself.  The State is providing significant certainty to the banks with this guarantee as we propose also to remove the portfolio cap for the financial institutions.  Due to these measures, it is a requirement that all financial institutions taking part demonstrate a reduction in the interest rate charged to enterprises for those loans and other financial products covered by the scheme.</p> <p> I will go through each of the sections.  Section 1 provides that references to the "Act of 2012" mean the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  Section 2 amends section 2(1) of the Act of 2012 to provide for the inclusion of a new definition of "Ukraine credit guarantee scheme" in the Act of 2012 that is needed for other changes made elsewhere in this Bill.  Section 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2012 to allow for the extension of classes of enterprises which can qualify for the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, to include small mid-caps.  Primary producers, namely, farmers and fishers, also qualify.  Section 4 amends section 4 of the Act of 2012 to include the new Ukraine credit guarantee scheme within certain subsections of that section, thus giving the Minister the power to give guarantees.  This section also disallows section 4(3) and section 4(4) of the Act of 2012 for the purposes of the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme as different provisions are being made for those aspects through the new section 4B, which is being inserted by section 5 of this Bill.  The existing scheme is subject to a portfolio cap of 13% under the 2012 Act, as amended, but there is no portfolio cap for the Ukraine scheme.  The existing scheme has a maximum yearly credit amount which can be guaranteed of &euro;150 million whereas the Ukraine scheme has an overall maximum credit amount of &euro;1.2 billion.</p> <p> Section 5 introduces a new section 4B into the Act of 2012 that gives power to the Minister to give guarantees in accordance with the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  The Ukraine scheme will be open for guarantees to be put in place until the 31 December 2024.  These guarantees will not extend beyond six years in duration.  The maximum amount of credit to be covered by these guarantees will not exceed &euro;1.2 billion and the Minister&rsquo;s liability in respect of those guarantees will not exceed &euro;960 million.  Section 5(4) includes definitions relevant to this scheme.</p> <p> Section 6 amends section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2016 to ensure the maximum liability of the Minister in relation to the existing credit guarantee scheme shall remain at not exceeding &euro;15.6 million and that there will be a separate provision for a maximum liability in relation to the Ukraine scheme of &euro;960 million included through section 4B(3), which I have already mentioned.</p> <p> Section 7 amends the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021, by increasing the aggregate liability limit to &euro;180 million from a limit of &euro;50 million in respect of contributions committed under all agreements between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for the time being in force.</p> <p> Section 8 is the final section and contains technical matters about the Short Title, commencement arrangements and citation.</p> <p> In all parts of Ireland, large numbers of people are employed in small firms.  When we talk about SMEs we must appreciate that these businesses account for over 1 million employees and this represents just over 68% of total employment in the Irish business economy.  It is important people realise when we talk about using taxpayers' money to support businesses it is to support jobs and the jobs those businesses have.  The businesses often take the risk and put all the effort in and there is often great employment there.  We are clear in the Houses, and I think it is supported by everybody, that in supporting businesses we are supporting jobs.  It is an important connection to keep emphasising to the taxpayers whose money we use to assist through these schemes.  By implementing this new credit guarantee scheme we will ensure finance providers can provide these businesses with access to liquidity.  The scheme will be available to the end of 2024 to give SMEs certainty that they can access funding for their working capital needs.  Certainty can breed confidence and we have seen the benefits of the credit guarantee schemes over the last number of years.  I think Deputy Nash was a Minister of State back in 2012 when we working on the original credit guarantee schemes.  It is a pity they were not in place a little earlier because they would have helped in those early years.</p> <p>Fortunately, we have been in a position, with Brexit, the Covid crisis and now the war in Ukraine, to operate schemes of a significant nature that can make a big impact in supporting businesses and keeping jobs in place.</p> <p> The amendment to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021 is important as it will allow the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into agreements with the SBCI to implement loan schemes based on funding available from the European Investment Bank Group to Ireland.  If we want to ensure businesses throughout the country succeed and prosper in the face of the fundamental challenges we face, it is essential that we take the necessary steps to ensure appropriate loan schemes are in place.  This Bill is aimed at assisting the vast majority of businesses throughout the country.  We had a very positive experience in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  We can now replicate that widely available and cost-effective measure.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members.  I hope they can all support the intentions of the Bill.  I look forward to working with them on some of the details on Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

I promise I will not try to do so.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  The Bill is short and fairly technical but, as the Minister of State outlined, it will, when passed, have significant ramifications for business.  Its purpose is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 to support the needs of business to access additional finance in response to the economic challenges resulting from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  It does so by creating a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  The development of such a scheme is very welcome, especially given that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme ceased to operate on 30 June, albeit there was a roll-over of some loans under the scheme.  Given the cost-of-doing-business crisis, the impact of inflation and the war in Ukraine, there certainly is a need for another scheme to go live.</p>  <p>  The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will provide funding to assist businesses that are viable but vulnerable in manufacturing and internationally traded sectors impacted by the fallout of the war.  The focus on viable firms is important as there is an opportunity cost in regard to State moneys.  The focus must be on saving jobs as well as supporting businesses.  The &euro;1.2 billion State backing of the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme is broadly in keeping with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme when we factor in that less than half of the &euro;2 billion allocated for the latter was drawn down.</p>  <p>  The focus on providing low-cost working capital to SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps of up to &euro;1 million on a six-year term, with no collateral requirements for loans up to &euro;250,000, is welcome.  The 80:20 guarantee rate split between the State and the lending financial institution is welcome but I ask that it be kept under review.  If there is an unwillingness on the part of financial institutions to lend moneys as a result of the guarantee rate split, the Minister of State might be in a position to revisit this.</p>  <p>  While more than &euro;750 million was lent out through the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, that represents only 35% of a &euro;2 billion scheme.  When we drill down more deeply into the numbers, we see that as of September 2022, 9,848 micro-SMEs and mid-caps received loans under the scheme.  However, there are 248,344 SMEs in the State, according to the latest figures from the CSO.  Given the level of need of businesses due to the Covid crisis and Brexit for liquidity, working capital, purchase of equipment, new products or processes, fitting out of premises and moves towards energy efficiency, the causes of the low level of take-up of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme should be addressed to ensure the same barriers do not exist in regard to the Ukraine scheme.</p>  <p>  I welcome that there is no portfolio cap under the scheme.  The original decision by the Government to include a 50% portfolio cap in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme was a mistake, which was rectified only under pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in, particularly my colleague, Deputy Doherty.  The removal of a portfolio cap negates a problem whereby banks refused to lend to small businesses in dire need of affordable credit.  Portfolio caps usually mean banks see it as unattractive to lend money through schemes to SMEs and, where they do lend moneys, it usually results in extremely high interest rates.  Not having a portfolio cap should make it easier and more attractive for banks to lend to SMEs through this scheme.  Furthermore, the permitting of moratoriums on capital and-or interest for certain periods of time, specifically up to one year, is also welcome.  However, the decision to leave this choice up to the individual lender, based on its assessment of the customer, must be kept under strict review.  Businesses have a fear lenders will automatically refuse such a moratorium.</p>  <p>  Given that the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment waived its right to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, as acknowledged by the Minister of State, and that we have committed to working with him, the T&aacute;naiste and the Department on the Bill, it is important that the scheme goes live before the end of the year.  Businesses need access to low-cost working capital to help them to spread increased input costs and to limit disruption to supply chains.  There is a similar need for urgency in regard to the temporary business energy support scheme as many businesses are averse to taking on additional debt through loans.</p>  <p>  We are all well aware that the current difficulties being experienced by Irish businesses, especially SMEs and family businesses, are significant and many.  Costs have risen across the board for a variety for reasons but, in the main, due to the increase in energy prices and the all-encompassing effect of inflation.  The horrible war waged by Russia against Ukraine has also caused significant disruption and prices increases for businesses.  Businesses have tried to remain agile to adapt to these changes through absorbing the increased costs in an attempt to remain competitive.  Naturally, this has an impact on the margins of SMEs, micro-businesses and family businesses in the immediate term.  In the long run, this might prove to be unsustainable.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is acutely aware of these difficulties, especially the impact of increased energy costs for businesses.  We have previously met with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on these matters.  We have proposed solutions such as the business energy support scheme and called for the creation of a new SBCI-led and State-backed credit guarantee loan scheme in our alternative budget to help energy-intensive sectors, especially SMEs, micro-businesses and family businesses that are facing the brunt of these increased costs, particularly energy costs.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also lobbied hard over the past year for other measures to address the increasing cost of doing business.  In April, an Teachta Doherty brought amendments to financial motions to reduce the cost of home heating oil, petrol and diesel in response to the cost-of-living crisis.  That move by Sinn F&eacute;in forced the Government's hand in response.  Similarly, we have been consistent in our efforts to see insurance premiums reduced for businesses.  There is a cost-of-doing-business crisis, not just a cost-of-energy crisis, and the Government must remain agile to respond to all aspects of these crises.</p>  <p>  I want to put on the record that the supports the Government is introducing are very welcome.  We will work with the Minister of State to ensure this Bill is passed.  However, he needs to take a long, hard look at how some businesses are treating their workers.  It is all very well to have welfare for businesses.  I do not suggest for a moment, although it has been suggested by others here, that workers' rights can or should be bought.  They should not and cannot be bought because the price of doing so eventually becomes too high.  However, we need to have a conversation about low pay and poor working conditions.  The Minister of State will be aware that following the receipt of a phenomenal amount of State support in some circumstances and a small amount in others, some companies paid out dividends to their shareholders, having been in receipt of supports during the pandemic.  That made people very angry.  While we all want to see businesses that are viable but vulnerable supported to remain in operation, there are some businesses that may not need those supports and will be in a position to absorb some of the costs.  I urge those business owners and employers to have a think about applying for supports when they may not, in fact, need them.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme but I hope the Government pays close attention to the performance reports from the SBCI and stands ready to make changes or adjustments to the scheme as needs be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800028#AA00400"><p>On 24 February, the Russian Federation invaded its neighbour, Ukraine, and unleashed its military forces on it.  The first and main victims of the invasion were and are the people of Ukraine.  The lives of civilians have been upended, with many fleeing their homes and homeland.  Others, who could never have imagined doing so, have joined the military to defend their homeland.  A huge number of Ukrainians have fled their homes and many have landed in Ireland in the intervening eight months.  I want to put on the record that they are very welcome.  Unfortunately, some have tried to pit our people against these refugees and have implied their arrival is impacting on the lives of Irish people who have to compete for services.  To be clear, these forces of negativity and division are wrong and they must and will be resisted at every level.</p>  <p>  As the illegal invasion of Ukraine has progressed, its impact has permeated across the globe.  It has led to a rise in energy and food costs and has exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis in our country.</p> <p>We rightly call for compassion and assistance for households that have been impacted.  While believing that more could have been done for families and workers, it is equally important that SMEs are supported during the most challenging economic climate.  SMEs are the bedrock of our economy and must be supported.  We are now in the winter months and like households, businesses are worried.  Interest rates are rising as are energy and other costs.  We all regularly meet SMEs owners with extortionate gas and electricity bills.  Having rode out the Covid-19 pandemic we would have hoped that the prospects for SMEs would improve.  It was a bitter blow to see the cost of doing business dramatically increase with the onset of the invasion.  </p> <p> SMEs and small mid-cap companies are, as I said, the bedrock of our economy.  SMEs account for 99.8% of active enterprises and 68.5% of employment in the State.  They are crucial to generating activity in our economy and it is right that they are helped during the challenging economic environment.</p> <p> While it would have been desirable to have pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill, I appreciate that given the existing crisis it was necessary to have available supports introduced as promptly as possible.  I was glad that committee members agreed with me on that and we waived that.  The scheme is for SMEs, primary producers and small mid-cap companies.  It allows for an amount of up to &euro;1.2 billion to be made available until 31 December 2024 under the Ukraine guarantee scheme.  Coupled with the loan guarantee scheme, this proposal should aid viable but vulnerable businesses during the time of economic difficulty.  </p> <p> The introduction of offering up to &euro;1 million with collateral and up to &euro;250,000 without collateral is welcome in this environment.  It is worth noting that the criteria for applying are not excessively complicated so as not to deter eligible businesses.  The need to demonstrate a 10% increase in costs versus 2020 figures should be relatively easy for most firms to demonstrate.  In the main the premia on these loans are quite low.  They are less than 1% in most cases.  However, I have a slight concern that a premium of 1.55% for four- to six-year loans for mid-cap businesses may be challenging if the prospects for an individual firm of such a size do not improve.  </p> <p> All of us in this Chamber recognise that gaining energy independence is crucial to the development of our economy.  Investment in an abundance of offshore wind energy producers is crucial to our economic growth and stability in the years to come.  Last Friday, I attended the launch of the review of the port masterplan vision 2021 in Shannon Foynes.  It was an important and timely event.  As a State we need to develop Shannon Foynes as a matter of urgency.  It has the potential to be the Ardnacrusha of our generation.  The days of depending on fossil fuels are over.  The ongoing war in Ukraine has demonstrated that such dependence is a risk to our well-being and development.  While developing our wind energy is a decade-long project, it is vital that we wean our industries off non-renewable resources.  Initiatives to support energy-intensive industry are important.  It is important that they demonstrate increased costs on energy.</p> <p> Part of the proposals I most welcome is the need for firms availing of supports to put forward an energy-efficiency plan.  Such a specification is important to ensure that we as a society are committed to moving to a more renewable energy space.   My party will support the Bill.  It will offer some confidence to our SME base at a time business sentiment among SMEs has fallen from 67.9% to 61.1%.  It offers a limited optimism to these businesses when future optimism in business has been recorded as falling.   </p> <p> It is important that the available offerings are open to as many businesses as possible and as such I encourage the Department to engage in a targeted promotional campaign to ensure all eligible businesses are aware of the supports and are assisted in the application process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800029#BB00200"><p>I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on this important Bill.  Members will be more pleased to hear that I will not use my full 20 minutes.  I will keep to the standard set by previous speakers.  As the Minister of State mentioned in his contribution, I was involved in amending the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  The work I did was in 2015.  The beauty of the parent legislation, if I can describe it as such, is that it is capable of being amended to address issues facing our economy from time to time as they arise.  We have had various iterations and forms of schemes in place since, most recently, of course, the Covid-19 guarantee scheme to which the Minister of State and previous speakers referred.  Systems have evolved since 2012.  Each subsequent scheme has been informed by the lessons learned from the operation of the previous schemes.  That is a good thing.  As the Minister of State said, the previous schemes send a strong signal that the State is prepared to invest and to put money at the disposal of SMEs during rocky economic periods.  Credit guarantee schemes such as the Ukraine scheme will provide SMEs with the ability to spread the increases in their costs arising directly from inflation caused by the illegal war being waged on Ukraine.  It should also have the effect of increasing the appetite risk of lenders and facilitate them in providing additional liquidity to businesses at a time liquidity will be critical for all the reasons we are only too well aware of.  Simply put, no viable business should have to fold because of the war in Ukraine and the increase in energy costs.  As it stands some SMEs may struggle to survive in any case, notwithstanding support schemes like the TBESS and the &euro;200 million Ukraine support scheme referred to earlier, which was initially announced in September.  That scheme provides supports of up to &euro;2 million for manufacturing businesses that intensively use gas and are involved in the international traded sector.  Access to credit and liquidity is vital for business and for jobs.  That is why we need to be open to more agile ways of responding to the needs of jobs and business at this challenging time.  We should not rule out the addition of supplementary support schemes as the need arises into the future and as the challenge evolves.</p>  <p>  When we talk about a credit guarantee scheme, we need to be sure that the rates and the premia are set at the right rate.  What I hear about the banks&rsquo; response in the context of interest rates is that we will ask them to go easy on the interest rate because the reality is that the interest rate has to reflect the reality of the reduced risk that the banks have given the fact that the Government has decided essentially to take on 80% of that risk.  That is not insubstantial.  That is significant State and taxpayer support in any language.  The risk of default is largely borne by the State.  We also know and the Minister of State will know from his own experience that the last thing that challenged businesses want is take on even more debt at a difficult time and, therefore, the conditions need to be as positive and as minimal as possible to allow as many impacted businesses to take up the benefits of a scheme like this.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of concerns, for example, about the uptake of the credit guarantee scheme notwithstanding the figures that he referred to earlier.  I hope that lessons can be applied from that scheme and I have no doubt that they were.  This scheme is targeting the companies most at risk of a downturn in the economy.  We are sure that the rate of economic growth will slow next year and modified domestic demand will be down.  That is bad news for locally traded firms in the everyday economy.  It is important that when the scheme becomes operational that the firms that would stand to benefit most are aware that these supports are available.  There is a job of work to be done then by Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices to promote the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Have Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise office network and the Department more generally undertaken any formal assessment of the number and nature of jobs that are at risk as a result of the high price of gas due to the illegal war being waged on Ukraine?  It is important that as we discuss the Bill that the House be informed of this.  I have no doubt that Enterprise Ireland has modelled some projections in regard to where those jobs are most at risk and what sectors or subsectors of the economy are most at risk.</p> <p>It is important that we design the schemes that are available to us with those companies in mind and that an evidence base informs the design.  That was something that I raised with Enterprise Ireland a couple of short months ago in the work that I did with it, the trade unions and the employer, namely, the Premier Periclase plant in Drogheda, which the Minister of State will be familiar with, that has been in existence since the 1970s.  It is a heavy, intensive user of gas and it has a heavy manufacturing process.  It is an exporting company.  It came out for examinership last May and because of the difficult circumstances relating to the ever-rising cost of gas, to cut a long story short, it let approximately 40 of its 50 staff go and now has a skeleton staff of approximately ten.  By the way, I pay tribute to Enterprise Ireland and the work directly of Mr. Leo Clancy, the chief executive, in working with us to do everything the agency could with the tools it has available to assist the retention of jobs in that employment.  Unfortunately, notwithstanding the fact that under the Ukraine scheme there is a &euro;200 million fund for intensive users of gas in the manufacturing exporting sector, the reality quickly dawned on that company that, in fact, if you leave that aside and while that support is welcome, what that would do is essentially pay two months of its gas bill with the increases it has experienced over the recent period.  This company is transitioning from being an intensive user of gas to more sustainable ways of using energy to fire and power its plant  over the next two years.  It is in the process of doing that.  At that stage, it made a very interesting point during the 30-day consultation process on redundancies, that what would have been even more useful for it in retaining employment was the development of a form of a furlough scheme alongside energy supports to keep people in employment.  <br/><br/>This has been a hobby horse of mine for the past two and half years since Covid hit.  This country needs to create a scheme like the German-style short-time working scheme to target sectors or subsectors of an economy that might be experiencing difficulties at a particular period to keep people in employment.  The German <i>Kurzarbeit</i>scheme was one of the primary reasons the German economy did not go into the kind of recession we experienced and it did not experience as many job losses as we did back in the late 2000s into the early 2010s.  The argument might be made that we do not need a wage subsidy scheme or a form of a German-style short-time working scheme when we are nearing full employment.  The question then is: what do we do to retain skills?  The skills, for example, in the Premier Periclase plant in Drogheda involving fitters, electricians, experienced engineers, experts in quality control and so on, are lost as those jobs are lost now and they will not come back.  Once they are gone, they will not come back.  It is about protecting our indigenous enterprise base and its skills. <br/><br/>We should not rule out the evolution of schemes to assist companies and jobs into the future.  I have said time and time again that one thing that is lacking in the tools available to the State to support jobs and businesses during downturns is that form of a German-style short-time working scheme that was proven successful in that country.  A scheme of that nature could be introduced here to make sure that when the next downturn comes we are not scrambling around to find a new way to support jobs and businesses and we would have a scheme that we can customise and tailor to different sectors of the economy during difficult periods.  <br/><br/>When we do that - nobody has promoted this idea more than myself over the past two and a half years &ndash; why do we not attach conditions to the development and accessing of these schemes by businesses?  It is insane that, despite my protestations, back in March 2020, we did not introduce conditions, for example, as a previous speaker said, or lay-off policies or lay-off conditions to State support.  The idea that dividends and bonuses should not be paid is something that we have to interrogate again.  With the way the economy is going and the reality that we may be at least facing a technical recession next year, these issues will come into public view again and they need to be examined and addressed once and for all. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the Labour Party supports the principles of the scheme.  We are proud to be involved in the development of the previous schemes, which worked reasonably well.  It is important that lessons are learned from the development and practical use of the previous schemes; I think some of those lessons have been learned.  I will reiterate the point that I made earlier relating to premium and interest rates and so on.  On interest rates, it should not be the case of merely asking the banks to do something and go easy on the interest rate.  We should use the power we have to ensure that the interest rates, the premium and so on reflect the reality of the reduced risk for banks given the ratio of the risk the State is taking compared to them.</p></speech>

Through no fault of their own, they are very worried heading into the winter as they face rising costs, higher interest rates and issues with consumer confidence.</p>  <p>  The scheme, which will help those impacted by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, has two strands.  In my constituency, a number of these companies face a difficult future but now have other options to remain viable.  I foresee a number of companies that have contacted me are using the second stream of the Bill, which helps support companies impacted by severe increases in energy and business costs.  This is occurring across the board, but Mayo-based manufacturing companies that trade internationally have found that since the war in Ukraine, the rising energy costs and commodity prices are making it harder for them to get certain materials to keep their businesses running and viable.  </p>  <p>  Those companies with energy costs worth at least 3% of their turnover prior to the war can avail of grants up to &euro;2 million for costs incurred between February and December this year.  That is welcome to keep their businesses afloat and protect jobs, which is vitally important, especially where I am from, in the west.</p>  <p>  The first stream of funding will also be of benefit to small businesses or producers in the west with fewer than 500 employees that are facing liquidity problems as a result of, again, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  They can avail of up to &euro;500,000 in grants, repayable advances, equity or loans, which could be the difference in a business staying open and, therefore, saving jobs.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s work alongside the T&aacute;naiste, in particular, to unlock this &euro;1.2 billion fund in low-cost loans to SMEs and small, mid-cap companies of up to 500 employees under the Bill.  It is important that the scheme is opened before the end of the year to ensure low-cost unsecured working capital is provided where it is needed most for SMEs and primary producers to help them to spread the increased input costs and limit disruption to the supply chain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800030#CC00300"><p>I commend the Minister of State on his work on this.  The Government has moved swiftly.  It is an excellent and measured response.  It is indicative of a fast-paced and reactive Department.  Again, I commend him on his work.</p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation.  We have seen it first-hand at the enterprise committee and it will facilitate the creation of a &euro;1.2 billion Ukraine credit guarantee scheme as part of a suite of additional measures to aid businesses through what is a particularly volatile and disruptive time for many of them.  It is affecting every business, from local shops to SMEs to large producers.  Many food producers and exporters are dependent on the legislation getting through as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  The amendment will allow for the establishment of a new Ukraine credit guarantee scheme with an end date of 31 December 2024.</p> <p>I assume there will be capacity to review that date closer to the time.  Loans can be made by qualifying finance providers under the scheme and can have a term of up to six years from the date of drawdown.  That is to be welcomed by businesses.</p> <p> The proposal will amend the loan guarantee scheme agreements from the 2021 Act, which will increase the limit of aggregate liability in respect of contributions committed from &euro;50 million to &euro;180 million.  That is indicative of the scale of the crisis that many of these producers are currently facing and the reason we need such a response to the situation.  The technical amendment was approved by the Government in September to facilitate designated Ministers engaging in future agreements with the SBCI for the delivery of EIB group-backed SME loans.  This is particularly important in light of ongoing economic uncertainty and the need to promote resilience, investment and recovery.  Those have very much been bywords for enterprise in Ireland, particularly in the export-led community.  That is why, as a Government, it is critical that we stand shoulder to shoulder with these businesses at this difficult time.</p> <p> The proposed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will unlock up to &euro;1.2 billion in low-cost unsecured working capital for SMEs, small and mid-cap companies and primary producers and allow them to spread the cost of an increase in input cost and disruption to supply chains while they move to new suppliers, absorb the cost of disruption and evolve their business models to become much more resilient.  That is indicative of a can-do attitude within the Department of the Minister of State.  He and his officials are to be commended on the fast pace at which they have responded on this issue.  Similar schemes are available in other member states and the proposed scheme will reduce the interest cost for working capital for SMEs in Ireland in a similar manner.  </p> <p> A significant and ambitious credit guarantee scheme will assist lenders in providing liquidity to these companies but, more important, it will send a strong signal of support for and confidence in producers in Ireland.  The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will facilitate additional credit risk appetite from lenders to the SME market, maximising the ability of businesses to access appropriate finance at a time liquidity will be critical.  It has the capacity to enable lenders to begin or continue providing urgently needed liquidity to businesses in every sector and region.  That is the critical aspect of the scheme - the potential it offers for almost every business that is operating in a manufacturing capacity to access it.  That, in turn, will enable them to sustain employment across the country.  It also leverages the knowledge and lending experience of lenders with respect to their customers.</p> <p> It is important to point out that the proposal is similar, in terms of loan type, tenure and credit amounts available, to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, which resulted in more than &euro;705 million in lending going to almost 10,000 businesses since it was launched in September 2020.  In essence, we are going with a proven model that has worked and helped us through a previous crisis.  We know the Department has the knowledge and expertise to ensure this will work.  The loans under the Covid credit guarantee scheme have helped to maintain more than 81,000 jobs to date.  The scheme closed for applications earlier this year in line with expiration of the underlying temporary state aid framework.  Through the proposed legislation, the Government can now, in a widely available manner that proved effective throughout Covid, supply similar lending to businesses in need.</p> <p> Significant progress has been made with the operator of the scheme, namely, the SBCI, and the on-lenders, to prepare for a rapid deployment of the scheme.  The message we are getting from businesses and manufacturers is that once the legislation is finalised, they will need to be able to access this quickly.  Similarly, businesses need to be able to tap into the energy scheme for businesses within hours of the Finance Bill 2022 being passed.  They will need to be able to log on, register for the scheme and get their payments back for September and October.  I am conscious that cannot happen without the Bill being passed but businesses are crying out for this to happen.  I know I am straying off the subject but it is important that departmental officials and the Minister of State take back the message that those payments need to be issued within hours of the Finance Bill passing through these Houses because there are many small- and medium-sized businesses urgently hanging on and desperate to get those payments.</p> <p> I commend the work of the Minister of State on the Bill.  It has been an exceptionally busy time in his Department.  He has faced the challenge head-on.  I appreciate there was some prior knowledge in terms of the work that was done in Covid but it is indicative of Ireland as a country where we do business and are receptive to doing business but, more important, we support and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who want to do business.  We are a progressive modern European nation that stands shoulder to shoulder with our European cousins at a time of crisis but it is important that we also stand shoulder to shoulder with our own people when they are suffering at a time of a crisis that is not of their making but results from a war on a European front.  We need to make a strong statement in that regard and we have done so through our support for Ukraine but also, more important, with the decisive and impressive action to support businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800031#DD00200"><p>Redundancies in the tech sector have been receiving much of the media and political attention in recent days.  It is a serious situation for the people involved and, indeed, the wider economy.  At the same time, I am concerned that we are facing a crisis in small businesses operating in local economies.  Towns and villages in my county of Mayo and elsewhere in the State are in danger of seeing a wave of business closures.  Businesses are hibernating for the winter with the intention of reopening in March or April because they just cannot sustain the high costs, particularly the high cost of energy.  They know that they will not generate enough revenue through the winter months to meet those costs and that if they remain open, they will face into spring of next year with an accumulation of unsustainable debt.  The impact on unemployment and underemployment in these areas is concerning.  Other businesses are making the decision to close permanently.  That is mostly down to the sky-rocketing energy costs, but also the other input costs of insurance and commercial rents.  As most businesses in small towns are interconnected, this is having a disturbing impact on local economies.  People who go into their local town for to visit some shops then go on to cafes and spend the limited amount they have.</p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, and others have stated, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  The legislation will mean the State will be guaranteeing loans with public funding of up to &euro;1.2 billion, with the State fully liable for &euro;960 million of that.  That is the State guaranteeing 80% of the value of the loans.  The significant reduction in risk for the lending banks needs to be reflected in the interest rates the banks charge and in how they treat their customers.  However, many businesses have taken on debt, either during Covid or in the past year, given the unsustainably high energy bills.  They also have Revenue debt from tax warehousing.  Many people are afraid to take on debt as they have seen bills increasing every couple of months for almost a year and businesses are being hit from all sides.  Their costs are going up and they see a reduction in the customer spend.  When workers and families are hard pressed, local businesses struggle too.  To use the language of economists, demand is being destroyed, and that is spreading through local economies.</p>  <p>  For more than a year, I have been calling on the Government to take action to address the artificially high electricity prices that have been crippling households and premises.  I cannot understand its inaction in that regard.  Yes, Putin has been strategically reducing gas supplies in Europe for more than a year, but why does that mean that gas from the Corrib field off the coast of Mayo has to cost eight times as much as it did two years ago?  Indeed, that organisation enjoyed a profit of &euro;560 million for the first half of 2022 alone.  Why does gas continue to set the price for all electricity, including that generated from wind energy?  The cost of energy is destroying small businesses and will do untold damage.  I am genuinely fearful for villages and towns throughout the country as a result of what has been allowed to happen.</p>  <p>  Is a sunset clause built into the Bill in terms of how the evaluation is going to be done so that the spread of the fund across businesses can be measured to ensure it is getting to the businesses that need it, rather than just the ones that have more resources and are able to access it?</p> <p>We need to keep that monitored because this fund needs to get into the heart of the smaller businesses and communities that desperately need it as a lifeline.  I welcome it but I want an even spread and equity in respect of it.  Have evaluations been done of the other business support scheme to see what the spread of it has been and to identify any blocks that might be there as regards access for all businesses that desperately need it? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800032#EE00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill, which will support small- and medium-sized businesses that are the backbone of our economy.  It is vital that we protect these enterprises that are faced with factors impacting on their ability to do business, especially when these particular factors are broadly outside their control.  The Bill will introduce a &euro;1.2 billion State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme that will provide low-cost working capital of up to &euro;1 million on a six-year term to SMEs, primary producers and small, mid-cap businesses, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;250,000.</p>  <p>  As has been mentioned by almost all speakers, the war in Ukraine has had a major impact on the world market and whole industries.  However, SMEs are particularly vulnerable to the uncertainty that this war has given rise to.  It is worth noting that the Central Bank has done a body of research on the potential impacts of the war in Ukraine on the Irish economy.  This research shows that a prolonged conflict would present a significant risk in addition to that which SMEs have already suffered.  We should also be aware of the indirect impact this war will continue to have on Irish businesses.  I am thinking specifically of the economic ramifications for our strong trading partners.  For example, the German economy has had to deal with a greater level of disruption to its domestic economy due to its previous reliance on the Russian oil and gas network.  As Germany is a country with deep trading ties to Ireland, businesses here may lose out.  We could also apply that same logic to our friends across the water who, for a number of different reasons, coupled with the inflationary effects of the war in Ukraine, have seen significant impacts to their economy.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, now elapsed, shows the value of such an intervention and, together with other Government measures, prevented the pandemic from bringing a wave of business closures with it.  Similarly, this credit guarantee scheme will send a clear message to the financial markets that businesses here have the support of the Government.  That being said, it must be noted there are undoubtedly thousands upon thousands of businesses that will carry forward a lot of warehoused debt, perhaps Revenue debt and other associated debt, from the Covid period, when certain businesses were shut down or curtailed in some way for a sustained period.  That is why this particular scheme is imperative.  It is necessary for us, however, to look at the broader picture of the impact on small- to medium-sized enterprises, which remain the very largest providers of employment in this country above and beyond any other sector, whether it is foreign direct investment, FDI, or domestic.  That is worth noting.  The Bill will ensure that a line of credit will be available to SMEs into 2023 and allow them some breathing space to adapt their businesses.  As my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, mentioned, however, the speed of deployment of this scheme is imperative.  I am absolutely certain that with the prerequisite knowledge that was gained during the Covid years, the Department has become adept, along with other Departments and agencies, in rolling this out, but it is imperative.</p>  <p>  Part of this particular scheme has one eye on adaptation as a key principle of the scheme for those who avail of it.  They must show that they have an energy efficiency plan in place within their business.  On that, I think of a quite simple yet frustrating thing, for instance, in the retail sector, namely, open fridges.  We will not get into the nitty-gritty here, but these are an incredibly inefficient way of providing customers with products that need to be chilled.  They also cost a fortune to run.  Many of the retailers I have spoken to in recent months say open fridges are provided by their suppliers and that, often, position within the store is considered, along with other marketing considerations but, frankly, we can make this problem go away with the stroke of a pen through statutory instrument.  We are at that stage, not just as regards the cost of doing business and the cost derived from the energy market, but also from an environmental perspective, as the Acting Chair will know only too well since we serve on the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action together.  A simple measure that would have a real impact would be simply to rule open fridges out, phase them out and, after a particular date, have no new open fridges permitted and get rid of them over a period.  It is something as simple as that.  I think of the retailers who undoubtedly sent the Minister of State copies of their bills, as they did me and other Members, showing dramatic increases of 200% to 500%.  I saw one bill go from &euro;9,000 to &euro;52,000 for a two-month period.  This was a particular retailer who happened to be locked into a very good contract until recently but, when renegotiation came around, was left holding a very different rate for their energy costs, which is debilitating.  As I said, many politicians have received copies of these energy bills from retailers, in particular.  I welcome their campaign because it is entirely necessary.</p>  <p>  That being said, with all the things we have learned during the course of Covid, it became abundantly clear, whether it be through the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, or other supports, that the Department and the Government are acutely aware of the situation that small- to medium-sized enterprises are in.  That is why this scheme and its forebear started quite quickly, once it became apparent that costs were rising so dramatically and that this would force the closure of several businesses.  I commend the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste and other Departments on the work they have done in supporting small- to medium-sized enterprises in the State.  I very much look forward to the passage of this Bill and, more important, the implementation of the scheme as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is a relatively short technical Bill that will amend the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  These amendments will support the needs of businesses to access additional finance in response to the economic difficulties resulting from the brutal war being waged by Putin against Ukraine.  It will do this by creating a specific Ukraine guarantee scheme.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill, which will provide a &euro;1.2 billion State-backed scheme that will provide low-cost working capital to small and medium enterprises.  The scheme will be similar to the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  Businesses are often wary of taking on more debt through loans.  The Government must ensure that the terms and conditions of the scheme are favourable to struggling businesses.  I have spoken to business owners in the past who have been critical of previous schemes, mainly due to the red tape involved.  While there must be checks and balances with taxpayers' money, applying to the scheme cannot be so onerous a task that it puts people off asking for help.</p>  <p>  Irish businesses, especially small family businesses, are operating in a very difficult environment.  Costs have risen across the board, especially the cost of energy.  Businesses have tried to adapt to these changes but it is a constant battle between observing increased costs to remain competitive and keeping their heads above water.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very much aware of these difficulties and has met with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance, in order to push the measures that would help businesses in the face of ever-increasing pressures.  In our alternative budget, we proposed solutions such as the business energy support scheme and also called for a new Stated-backed credit guarantee loan scheme to help SMEs, especially those in energy-intensive sectors.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in stands with small business owners.  In April this year, my colleague, an Teachta Doherty, brought forward measures to reduce the cost of home heating oil, petrol and diesel in response to the cost-of-living crisis.  As a result, the Government was forced to act but as usual it was too little, too late.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also been to the fore in seeking reform that will address the high cost of insurance premiums for business.  On the subject of business supports, the temporary inflation payment scheme that assists nursing homes with energy inflation must go further.  The unfair deal that is the nursing home support scheme needs to be reformed, especially for voluntary nursing homes and section 39 organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800033#FF00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Since the cost-of-living crisis began to emerge last year, there have been repeated calls on the Government to act swiftly.  Unfortunately, the Government's response has not been swift enough for many, but we must acknowledge when it does act.  The Bill is important as it makes &euro;1.2 billion available to SMEs, primary producers and mid-caps that have fewer than 500 employees.  It will therefore provide low-cost unsecured working capital for SMEs and primary producers to help them to spread increased input costs and to limit disruption to supply chains.  That is to be welcomed.  However, I wish to address the concerns that have been expressed to me by a number of businesses which, unfortunately, have had to close some of their branches or shut their doors altogether.</p>  <p>  One such businessman, a butcher who is a member of the Irish Butchers Guild, told me he was forced to close one of his outlets which employed six staff.  That had a significant impact on the local economy.  Only in the past 18 months he invested &euro;150,000 in that shop, and now it and the six jobs it provided are gone.  The shop made great progress towards becoming more energy-efficient and it galls the butcher to see the energy providers record higher profits.  While such businesses were considered an essential service during the darkest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, they feel forgotten about now.  They see the temporary business energy support scheme as somewhat helpful but not enough to offset what they have termed the new astronomical overheads they face.  They also point out that covering the winter months does not assist the sector enough as it is over the summertime that they use the most electricity.  Another butcher warned me that the retail butchers are closing week on week and that time is really running out to save these businesses.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the contents of the Bill, time is of the essence.  Unfortunately, the Government's delay in providing meaningful supports has been too long for many such as the businesses to which I have referred.  If there is one thing I would like to say to those on the Government benches, it is about acting swiftly in the face of a crisis.  I do not mean acting irresponsibly; I mean acting appropriately.  I also mean addressing the other pressures being placed on businesses in order that they have more room to manoeuvre when faced with a crisis such as this.  Take insurance premiums, for example.  There was a large drop in the personal injuries awards recorded by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  It has been calling on the insurance industry to slash premiums in line with the fall in personal injuries awards.  It is only through truly supporting businesses in good times as well as bad that they can have the stamina to deal with crises such as this.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to consider the words of the butcher concerned and to tailor responses that take account of the individual nature of energy use by specific businesses.  For example, assistance during the winter months may help some but not others.  Further loans may be acceptable to some but not be an option for others.  I am thankful for this opportunity on behalf of Tipperary businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800033#FF00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and will support its progress on Second Stage.  Irish businesses are facing into energy price increases on top of supply chain problems in the middle of another significant jump in the official inflation rate.  There are incredible challenges right across the business and SME sectors, particularly for companies such as leisure centres, call centres and food processors, which use large amounts of gas or electricity and whose business model has been completely destroyed.</p>  <p>  For example, Ireland Active, the representative body for leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools and commercial sports facilities, has stated that the cost of heating pools is resulting in extraordinary bills.  In Dundalk alone there are three leisure centres.  Additionally, businesses that during Covid complied with the remote working model now have many employees who have been working from home since the pandemic and who are weighing up their options coming into the winter.  Many consider it more costly to work from home, with heat, gas, electricity and Wi-Fi costs on the rise and are returning to the office.  Businesses will therefore bear the brunt of these price hikes, with some experiencing a 300% to 400% increase in utility costs.  These price hikes could result in layoffs or business closures when the temporary business energy support scheme payment does not even pinch the surface.</p>  <p>  This emergency response credit guarantee scheme will help.  It will be a loan guarantee scheme, similar to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, and will provide confidence to Irish businesses that lending is available for working capital and short-term to medium-term investment purposes.  It is expected that winter and early spring will see increased funding pressures on SMEs.  The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will provide &euro;1.2 billion in low-cost lending to business and will work alongside other measures announced in the budget, such as the temporary business energy support scheme, in supporting businesses through this energy crisis.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for the scheme, borrowers will have to declare that their costs have increased by a minimum of 10% on their 2020 figures and that the loan is being sought specifically as a result of difficulties experienced due to the Ukraine crisis.  Therefore, it is required to prove an increase in input costs, disruption to supply chains or the move to new suppliers.  The scheme will operate under two streams and will provide between &euro;20,000 and &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available in the markets, thereby reducing additional costs for firms.  For energy-intensive companies impacted by exceptionally severe increases in gas or electricity costs, the scheme will provide for a minimum of &euro;20,000 and a maximum of &euro;2 million per firm.</p>  <p>  In my speech on budget day I acknowledged the Government's efforts to improve the circumstances of the business community, and I agree that the amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act are necessary in order to provide for this scheme.  No additional delays should be imposed.  We need to ensure that this legislation is fit for purpose, successfully progresses through the next Stages and is enacted as quickly as possible to facilitate this scheme being available to business for liquidity purposes.</p>  <p>  Under the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021, it is imperative to provide prudent legislative scope, via the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2022, to acquire an appropriate share of European Investment Bank funding.  Currently, &euro;50 million is available to Ireland for SME loan guarantee schemes.  This amendment will increase the limit of the aggregate liability in respect of contributions committed from &euro;50 million to &euro;180 million while also providing the option for relevant Ministers to engage in further agreements regarding loan guarantee schemes with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Therefore, the legislative amendment of the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021 is particularly important as social and economic conditions remain uncertain, and given our pressing needs to assist resilience, investment and recovery within the business sector.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise a few different points about the Bill itself.</p>  <p>  With regard to section 3, I welcome the amendment of section 3 of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, which makes provision to extend the scope of eligibility to cover additional classes of enterprise to include SMEs, small mid-caps and primary producers, that is, businesses with up to 499 employees.  I agree with this change, which will set limitations to eligibility.  For the most part, the flexibility will significantly assist a lot of businesses.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Bill will amend section 4 of the Act of 2012 to include this new credit scheme within certain subsections of this section.  I welcome the removal of a portfolio cap from the current 13% and the increase in the maximum yearly credit amount which can be guaranteed from &euro;150 million to &euro;1.2 billion.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a new section 4B is introduced by section 5, which disallows subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 of the Act of 2012, including different provisions for the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  These amendments, as well as giving the Minister the power to give guarantees, will provide for significant reliefs and guarantees for businesses until 31 December 2024.  As such, I agree with the amendments, which will set guarantee limitations which will not extend beyond six years and will not exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  I acknowledge that the Minister's liability in respect of those guarantees will not exceed &euro;960 million.  Additionally, section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act 2016 is amended by section 6 to ensure that the maximum liability of the Minister in respect of the existing credit guarantee scheme shall remain as not exceeding &euro;15.6 million and that there will be a separate provision for a maximum liability in respect of the Ukraine scheme.  Again, I agree with those changes.</p>  <p>  With regard to section 7, amendments to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021 will increase the aggregate liability limit to &euro;180 million in respect of contributions committed under all agreements between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  These increases to the ceiling of funding under the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme to &euro;1.2 billion are required and provide that the Minister may work with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in making new loans available to SMEs.  This is significant for the SMEs as the objective is to maximise the impact of the scheme for borrowers in the short to medium term and address their liquidity requirements.</p> <p>It will assist viable but vulnerable firms of all sizes in the manufacturing and international trade services sectors that are suffering liquidity problems or are affected by the severe rise in energy costs as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  However, it must be noted that in order to qualify as viable, it must be a new loan with no refinancing.  </p> <p> I fundamentally agree with these criteria and, as such, I agree with the amendment.  I acknowledge that the scheme will therefore assist in the absorption of the cost of disruption to supply chains and the evolution of businesses in becoming more resilient in the face of business shock.</p> <p> In line with Government policy, section 8 contains the Short Title and commencement arrangements.  I have spoken to many businesspeople in Dundalk over recent months and have been flabbergasted at the cost increases they are facing.  Not all businesses will be able to sustain these increases in costs and they will eventually have to be passed on to the end users.  These amendments incorporate provisions to provide up to &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available in the markets and up to &euro;2 million per firm for energy-intensive business.</p> <p> Overall, the Government has made significant strides in aiding businesses in Ireland.  While I accept, as I am sure every other Member does, that we cannot save every business, we need to have a serious look at the businesses that can be saved, particularly those that contribute to tourism and our tourism offerings.  In the budget, we delivered significant funding in the form of the temporary business energy support scheme and today, with these amendments to the Bill, we hope to make an additional improvement to businesses, specifically SMEs, small mid-caps and primary producers.  We must ensure these businesses have the capacity and supports to survive.  I hope the amendments announced in this Bill will make a significant impact for the better.</p> <p> We need to have a clear strategy in what we are trying to do.  I acknowledge the measures introduced by the Government.  However, costs in this country are starting to spiral.  This legislation incorporated in these amendments ensures there is sufficient liquidity available in the markets and up to &euro;2 million per firm for energy-intensive business.  No additional delays should be imposed.  We need to ensure this legislation is fit for purpose, successfully progresses through the next Stages and is enacted as quickly as possible to facilitate this scheme being available to business for liquidity purposes.  This is an unprecedented crisis and more needs to be done to ensure that as many businesses as possible are protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800034#GG00200"><p>This Bill makes amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act and supports the needs of businesses to access additional finance in response to the economic difficulties resulting from the Ukraine war.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and this is something we have been flagging and requesting to be done as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme proposes to provide low-cost working capital of up to &euro;1 million to SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps on a six-year term with no collateral required for loans of up &euro;250,000.  The devil will always be in the detail.  On the one hand, it sounds great - potentially six years moneys are available - but the Bill does not guarantee what the cost of finance will be or any terms and conditions the pillar banks might attach to that.  In order to qualify for the scheme, the borrower will have to declare that costs have increased by a minimum of 10% on its 2020 figures.  I do not think this will be difficult for any business trying to access this scheme.  The borrower must show that the loan is required as a result of difficulties being experienced due to the Ukraine crisis.  I presume this relates to the cost thresholds rising.  It states that the business must be viable and it must be a new loan with no refinancing.  I am not too sure what the statement that a business must be viable is supposed to mean.  In respect of a good few businesses of which I am aware, if energy prices follow their current trajectory, it is very hard to see how these businesses will be viable without additional supports from the Government.  They are certainly not in a position to take on more debt.</p>  <p>  The loan as guaranteed is based on an 80% State-backed guarantee with 20% backed by the lender so it is much the same as what we did during Covid.  The standard facility size varies from &euro;10,000 up to potentially &euro;1 million under the current Act.  The Minister of State says this will remain for the State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  It also sets out that a broad range of facilities will be available from the lender so we are talking about flexibility in financing - overdrafts, term loans and potentially fixed-interest loans.  Yet again, I would have thought that this is down to the individual lending provider.  A premium guarantee of 0.29% of interest payable is required in order to provide that.</p>  <p>  I have concerns that I wish to raise with the Minister of State.  One involves interest rates.  We know that over the course of the next year, we could see another interest rise of up to 0.75% or 1.5%.  That raises the question of what the retail interest rate applied by the pillar banks in respect of somebody accessing this scheme will be.</p>  <p>  Second, many businesses will require restructuring of their business operations.  The problem is that they are going to need capital to keep the lights on but must also undertake restructuring of the business.  This might require the payment of redundancy payments.  Can they use some of this money if they want to downsize and have to let staff go?  I think they probably cannot do so.  How will that help them restructure their business?</p>  <p>  I raised other concerns with the T&aacute;naiste some weeks ago at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I asked him about the status of a company with warehoused debt during Covid.  My understanding was that from about January or February of this year, companies that had availed of the warehousing debt scheme had started to open up and were making repayments on that warehoused debt.  I understand that some of them were slow in getting going because their business had not recovered as they had hoped and there might have been some debt forbearance from Revenue.  However, I believe that has come to a pretty drastic stop in the past three months.  I am informed that the benign attitude Revenue took to businesses impacted by Covid up to now has come to an abrupt end and demand letters are going out for the repayment of restructured moneys, be they PRSI, PAYE or corporation tax, and that there have been demands with sheriff's notes attached.  Certainly the environment has changed, which I presume is down to a tacit decision by the Department of Finance to figure out which businesses are viable and which ones can or cannot be funded into the future.  This opens up the vista of many private businesses having to make decisions about whether they can find capital themselves to support their business activities and avail of this scheme or whether they are throwing good money after bad.  I suggest that without a scheme other than debt financing, it will not be possible to save some of the businesses given that their energy costs have gone up 200%, 300%, 400% or 500%.</p>  <p>  Energy inputs constitute a key measure for a lot of companies.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance and raised the case of a processing company with the T&aacute;naiste two weeks ago.  The company in question has seen its average monthly energy costs go up from &euro;8,000 to &euro;57,000 per month.  It employs 50 people and the increases in energy costs are still not finished.  The difficulty is that this company uses gas and electricity in its processing.  The business is based on heating and cooling and it uses heat for cooking but must also use it for sterilisation of machinery afterwards because it involves food processing.  It requires refrigeration and freezing for the same reasons - to preserve food.  It does not have a hope of making up the difference.  Availing of the maximum of the Government scheme would provide it with &euro;18,000 when the cost is &euro;57,000, so it must find &euro;39,000 every month.  Unfortunately, this is the reality facing many businesses at different scales.</p>  <p>  I also raised the issue of craft butchers with the T&aacute;naiste last week.  We have about 600 butcher shops.  Some of these butchers spoke to the media recently.  Their average energy costs have increased from between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 per month to &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 for the same reason, namely, that they are using heat and refrigeration.</p>  <p>  We are telling businesses that we need them to engage with mitigating strategies - solar panels being an obvious one.  Small shops probably do not have the roof space to put up any solar panels in the first instance.  Second, those trying to access a solar provider at the moment to install rooftop solar panels will find it very hard to get anyone with an installation window of less than five or six months to talk to them.  That is the waiting time they are all quoting at the moment.  Some of them do not have the panels or the workforce so telling businesses to put some solar panels on their roofs and they might get 20% of their energy costs back is not a mitigating measure because they will not be around in six months' time.  </p>  <p>  Another issue concerns people in intergenerational businesses.  By that, I mean a parent or grandparent who started a business and passed it on.</p> <p>I refer to businesses, particularly in the countryside, where a younger family member is working that business and part of the remuneration of the business is still being paid to the founder.  That person might be contributing to a pension, getting a small support payment or whatever it might be.  For people in this situation to find new capital, and it is probably not in the business, the only place it is possible to go is the shop of mom and dad, or perhaps an uncle or aunt if someone is lucky.  The difficulty for these people is that they are being asked to put up capital they are probably trying to keep for their own pension requirements.  They are wondering whether, if they put this money in and things continue to go badly for the next 12 to 18 months, all they will have done will have been to saddle the business with additional debt, keep a business that will ultimately not be viable going and cause their nest egg to go up in smoke.</p> <p> Will the Department of Finance consider some kind of increased credit for such people?  I know of a gentleman now cashing in a 20-year investment policy to put funds into his business as working capital because he has no home to go to in respect of trying to find alternative capital.  The point is that this is money he was putting aside for his retirement, and this man is close to retirement age.  In fact, I think he has already reached it.  This is a hard decision.  It is difficult to ask business owners to stump up in this way and to tell them we will support them with an energy rebate and fixed-cost debt because this is just not going to do it for them.</p> <p> We must do more in the enterprise space in terms of trying to get people out to look at real and professional restructuring.  The small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation has been enacted.  I would love to say that I hope it will not be used by many businesses but I am afraid it will be because, unfortunately, this will be the only way people will be able to get some protection from their creditors while they try to arrive at a new solution.  Even in this context, many businesses will be included.  To a degree, as I said, perhaps the Department of Finance is taking a longer term view of which businesses it should support and trying to see if the strongest can survive in the months to come.</p> <p> From the level of communication I am receiving, I would say there are significant problems among SMEs.  We must do more.  This is a start, but I am concerned that many businesses are not going to get financed.  We could not get the pillar banks to take on risk during Covid-19, even when they were only handling 20% of the risk.  They would not take that on and that was a problem.  It is going to be a problem here as well because many banks are going to look at cash flow numbers, sales projections and margins and tell people their businesses are not going to stand up to all these repayments, particularly when energy costs have gone up by 300% or 400%.</p> <p> I know we are in a difficult position and the Government is trying to do something but, unfortunately, I believe we must do more.  Although this measure is a start, I honestly do not think it will be enough.  We must do something far more significant in respect of energy credits on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 - Review of Health Demand and Capacity Requirements in Ireland to 2031, which was conducted based on lower population growth estimates than transpired, forecasted a minimum of 120 per cent increase in demand for home support from 2016 to 2031, but such demand at that level has already been reached and is expected to increase further;<br /><br />&mdash; 62 per cent of home care is delivered by non-Health Service Executive (HSE) providers, with only 38 per cent of home support services delivered directly by the HSE, amounting to over &euro;400 million in 2021 being paid to non-HSE providers of home care;<br /><br />&mdash; the Minister of State with Reasonability for Mental Health and Older People, committed to the establishment of the full complement of 30 Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) teams by Q3 2022; <br /><br />&mdash; the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to &quot;introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care&quot;

 </blockquote>condemns: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the failure of the previous Fine Gael-led Government and then Minister for Health, Simon Harris TD, and his predecessors, to plan for, train, recruit, and retain enough nurses, healthcare assistants, and home carers to sustainably expand home care services, which directly led to the crisis in home care that is being experienced at present; <br /><br />&mdash; the failure of the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, to significantly advance proposed legislation such as the Health (Amendment) (Licensing of Professional Home Support Providers) Bill and the Health (Amendment) Bill relating to enhanced governance of nursing homes;<br /><br />&mdash; the failure to deliver 1,000,000 home support hours in 2021 which were owed and budgeted for, as indicated in the HSE's National Service Plan 2022; and<br /><br />&mdash; the overreliance of successive Governments on private home care providers, instead of investing in home care as a public health and social care service and career; and </blockquote>calls on the Government to:  <blockquote> 	&mdash; expedite the proposed Health (Amendment) (Licensing of Professional Home Support Providers) Bill and new regulations for providers of home support services to construct a modern regulatory framework for home care;<br /><br />&mdash; establish a commission on care and bring together social care sectors and stakeholders to modernise the home care sector and better align care, including family carers, care in the home, nursing home and residential care, and palliative care; <br /><br />&mdash; fully commission the 30 ICPOP teams and transparently publish their staffing complements, with a view to fully staffing all teams; <br /><br />&mdash; integrate adult safeguarding legislation into new regulations for the home care sector with the Health and Quality Information Authority as the regulator;<br /><br />&mdash;

It is good to see the Ceann Comhairle.</p><p>There is a crisis in home care which many of us have been talking about for many years.  In October 2022, more than 5,100 people were on waiting lists for home care.  Many of these people were in hospitals waiting to be discharged.  We all signed up several years ago to the policy of right care in the right place at the right time.  In the first instance, this means people being cared for in the home.  We have far too many people who need intensive home care packages or home care support and cannot get these supports because the resources and capacity are simply not there.  The truth is that last year hundreds of thousands of hours of home care could not be delivered because the staff simply could not be got.  I have engaged with the organisations that provide the vast majority of home care.  We know these are mainly in the private sector, along with an element of provision in the HSE.  As the Minister of State knows, we rely on the private sector for much of this care.</p><p>There have been real challenges in this are for far too long.  The sector has low levels of pay and is mainly populated by women who do an extremely difficult job.  Talking to carers, especially given that most of them are women, it is possible to get a sense of what they do every day.  This includes having to lift people, change them and care for them.  This is a physically demanding job.  We then look at the levels of pay received for this work.  These people are working in an unregulated sector, one that does not value the work they do.  Is it any wonder then that we have such levels of staff turnover and a retention and recruitment crisis?</p><p>I know the Department undertook work to examine all these issues and there is a report that needs to be implemented.  I put it to the Minister of State that unless we deal with the issue of pay in this area, we will never truly value home care.  I appeal to the Minister of State and her Government to put in place a collective pay agreement for the home care sector.  It is one of the solutions proposed in this motion and one my colleagues and I have been calling for for many years.  This is the best way to level up and create a level playing field between HSE and non-HSE staff and ensure we have pay parity to enable us to recruit the staff we need.  That is important.</p><p>I have also been saying for some time that the problems in our accident and emergency departments in our hospitals will be resolved, in part, by putting more capacity into our hospitals.  I think we all accept that hospitals need more consultants, nurses, healthcare assistants, specialist staff, junior doctors, beds and surgical theatre capacity.  Hospitals need all this and more.  Equally, though, part of the solution to what is happening in our hospitals is that we have far too many people in hospitals who should be being cared for elsewhere.  One of the key tenets of Sl&aacute;intecare was that we would start to reorientate our spending to other elements of care that are less costly but much more beneficial for patients and the healthcare system.  Part of this involves step-down and recovery beds and residential care settings, but also home care.</p><p>Promises were made that we would have a statutory home care scheme.  There is still no date for when this scheme will be put in place.  Several pilots were undertaken but we have no sense yet as to when this scheme will happen.  The average number of home care hours a person gets is about eight.  If we are to move to a statutory home care model which allows for much greater levels of care in the home for people with higher needs, which they will have, and more dependency, it will mean providing many more hours of home care.  Many providers told me recently that this will mean, in some cases, providing 20, 30 or 40 hours of home care.</p><p>If we cannot provide home care to people as it is, even before we start to extend and improve home care and provide more opportunities for others to be cared for in the home, what chance will we have when the statutory home care scheme comes into place?  We need to start planning now.  We have left it far too late.  While the Minister of State has commissioned a report, which I welcome, we need action on all fronts on this issue.  We need to regulate the sector.  We need a Bill that does this.  There are draft regulations that need to be fast-tracked and put in place.  Once and for all, we need to deal with the recruitment and retention issues and put in place a fairer scheme, a fair rate of pay and a fair collective agreement that creates a level field that will allow us to recruit more staff into a crucial sector.  More importantly, that will allow us to value the work these people do.</p></speech>

More than 40,000 home care hours are not being delivered weekly and more than 6,000 people approved for funding are still on the waiting list for care.  The crisis is the recruitment and retention of staff.  The root cause of this issue is sectorial employment standards.  During the summer, I met with several groups representing the care sector and they all spoke with one voice in outlining the reason we are in this crisis.  The representatives of some of those groups told me they met with the Department but they feel they were not listened to and that the meetings were just a box-ticking exercise, with no clear actions arising from them.  The time for talking is over.  It is now time for action.  We need a root-and-branch reform of home care.  We must value the people being cared for and this must start with valuing the work being done by those who care for them.</p> <p>Where is the long-awaited pandemic bonus payment for the people who risked their lives and saved so many others?  The sector is totally neglected and this needs to change.</p> <p> While the crisis is bad now, there is a ticking time bomb of demographics.  When I met with the national community care network, I was told that the average age of its 3,000 carers is 60 years of age.  I have spoken to individual carers.  They are overworked and underpaid and they feel undervalued.</p> <p> We must make home care an attractive career option with opportunities for advancement and training.  Home care workers must be added to the critical skills list for employment visas and permits.  Each worker must have guaranteed hours and must be provided with payment for travel and subsistence.</p> <p> Delivering proper home care would reduce the length of hospital stays, as Deputy Cullinane said, and reduce the risk of hospitalisation which would reduce pressures on the emergency departments and reduce delayed discharges.  The State must step up to the plate.  We need a two-pronged approach.  The Government must address the recruitment and retention crisis but it is equally important that it advance vital regulation for the home care sector and make this legislation a priority.  If the Government will not deliver a promised commission on care, Sinn F&eacute;in in government will.</p></speech>

It is an unacceptable situation.  The crisis is getting worse and worse.  In October 2021, 4,825 people were awaiting home care.  In July of this year, there were 5,312.  According to a reply to a recent parliamentary question I submitted, it is now at 6,255.</p>  <p>  We as a party have been warning for a number of years about a looming crisis within the home care system.  In responses to parliamentary questions I submitted, the Government acknowledged the demand for home care support has grown considerably over the past number of years and that factors such as the contracts of employment and employment terms and conditions being offered are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector.  If the Government knows what the challenges are, why are they not being addressed?</p>  <p>  The HSE is employing over 1,000 fewer home care assistants now than it was in 2017.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed to plan for proper home care to look after those in need and this failure is putting older people into hospitals and nursing homes when they should be cared for in their own homes.  The lack of community care alternatives has left thousands in hospitals.  Some cannot avail of early release from hospital because they have nowhere to go.  When they go home, they have no one to look after them.  Maybe they live alone or they live with an elderly spouse or sibling.</p>  <p>  What we need is a pay agreement for the sector and the Government needs to make this happen.  We need a proactive strategic approach to workforce planning across health and social care.</p>  <p>  The Government must advance vital regulation for the home care sector and should make this legislation a priority.  It must establish the promised commission on care to kick-start the modernisation of social care arrangements.</p>  <p>  I will raise the home care cash grant with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I raised this on Questions on Policy or Legislation a few weeks ago.  This places the entire onus on older people or their spouses to advertise for carers, to recruit them, to ensure they are adequately trained, to ensure that all aspects of the employee's entitlements are adhered to such as PAYE, leave and work permits, where applicable, and to include this on their home insurance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, suggested on that occasion that I was confusing this with the personalised budgets.  I assure the Minister of State I am not.  There is a home care cash grant.  I sent the Minister of State information on this after that Questions on Policy or Legislation session and I am awaiting a reply.  It shows exactly the correspondence from the HSE to the person in question, of course with the person's permission, and it is referred to as the home care cash grant.  It is used by the HSE in some areas.  It is not appropriate.  It is not fair on the older people.  It is a danger.  I have outlined the issue and I would appreciate a response to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-11-08a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022110800036#JJ00300"><p>Last year, when the Covid lockdowns were in effect, I raised the issue of a young man with muscular dystrophy.  He was in receipt of minimal home care assistance at the time.  I was told that despite being promised more care hours, they would not be provided due to shortages of healthcare workers in the south-east.  Of course, Covid was used as a primary excuse here and yet here we are again speaking up for the many people who this Government has let down continuously because of its failure to plan for a significant workforce or to address long-term pay and conditions.  As a result of this ongoing inability of the Government to address this, 1,561 people in community health organisation, CHO 5, which includes south Tipperary, and 461 in CHO 3, which includes north Tipperary, are waiting for a home care assistant despite being approved.</p>  <p>  Repeatedly we are told, when facilities such St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir or the Dean Maxwell in Roscrea are closing, that care in the home is the direction the Government wants to focus on.  It is fair enough to pursue the goal of more care in the home.  What is not fair is to close those important community facilities without having the alternatives in place and yet this is what we see from this Government - closing St. Brigid's in a secretive manner, preparing for the closure of Dean Maxwell but not having any alternatives in place locally.  Instead, the Government makes people travel for the care they need or locate it miles away from their locality and their families.  The Government makes plans without investing in the alternative.  That is why almost 10% of all older people approved for home care have no carer.</p>  <p>  The HSE admits that issues such as the contracts of employment terms and conditions are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants a health system that is planned in a way that supply and qualification meet demand so that we have a service that people can depend on.  That is why we are calling for the establishment of a commission on care to bring together social care sectors and stakeholders to modernise the home care sector and better align the range of care services.  We need to see the establishment of a high-level workforce planning group to deliver accountability and joined-up cross-Government planning for training, recruitment and retention of health and social care professionals across the sector.  If the Government thinks that carers and home care workers will magically appear without this level of planning, the problem that already exists under its watch will only get worse and it is the people with the most need who will suffer.</p></speech>

I was representing them at the time and we warned politicians that there was a crisis coming in home care because of the terms and conditions of employment and because of the privatisation which, as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will be aware, fired the starting gun for the race to the bottom.</p>  <p>  There is nobody in this House or anywhere else who will dispute that home helps and home carers are good value for money.  They are exceptional value for money but when one spends that money in the private sector there is always a premium to be paid to the shareholders, to the owners etc.  When one spends it on not-for-profits or directly employed home helps, every shilling that one spends goes into home care delivery.  The privatisation model has not worked.  It has let down the home helps, it has let down the home carers, it has let down the people who are dependent on their care and it is letting the taxpayers who are funding it down.  It is not good value for money.  It is only when one recognises that it is not good value for money that one will be able to make the necessary changes.</p>  <p>  I will mention the case of two twin boys in my own area.  They are wheelchair users.  They are eight years of age.  Their mother is at the end of her tether.  She is desperate to get some assistance.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on the issue.  I have engaged with the HSE.  They tell me simply that the staff are not there, but what do I say to their Mam?  What do I say to her?  She is at the end of her rope and all she needs is some of the most cost-effective, best value-for-money intervention that the health service can provide.  That should not be beyond the Government.  The Government has ignored the calls from the trade unions and the advocacy groups and now we find ourselves, yet again, in a crisis that was entirely avoidable.</p>  <p>  I commend An Teachta Cullinane, not only for this motion but for all of the work that he is doing.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board what is in this motion and the practical suggestions made.</p></speech>

Coming out of hospital is a very worrying time for anyone, but doubly so for older people who may be facing mobility challenges.  It is proven that home support is the best way back to independence.  The elderly fully deserve this service at their time of need.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to mention the families of individuals waiting for home support too.  For them, home support comes as a lifeline, a time for respite when they can be reassured that their loved ones are getting the care they need in a safe and professional manner.</p>  <p>  I have spoken about the desperately long waiting lists for home support in County Wexford in this Chamber on many occasions.  At the start of this year, there were 644 families waiting for new home support services and 227 waiting for increased provision in County Wexford alone.</p> <p>The waiting list figures for home support services in County Wexford are so dire that a review had to be conducted at the end of last year.  I tried to get my hands on that review with little success but eventually succeeded in securing a copy through freedom of information.  The main finding of the review is that the fundamental issue is staffing.  This is not a surprise considering low wages, ever-changing working conditions and the current cost-of-living crisis.  This is why I support the motion in the strongest manner possible, specifically the calls for career pathways and a workforce planning group with fair employment standards and proper remuneration benefits that match the valued work the home support workers provide.  We need a pay agreement for the sector with direct Government regulation and intervention.  The Government must appoint a commission on care to modernise social care arrangements.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to follow up on the review conducted in County Wexford.  Recommendations were to be implemented throughout 2022.  What is the update on this?  What actions have been taken or are being implemented in Wexford?  The Minister of State has a long way to go to get home support services up to standard.  The comprehensive motion outlines how we can get there.  I urge every Deputy in the House to support this excellent motion and act quickly on the issue of home support services.</p></speech>

We are now no country for older people.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are failing our older people.  We have reports that there has been an increase of more than 10% in the number of older people on waiting lists for home care assistance, with figures of more than 6,000 this year.  What is shocking is that almost 10% of all older people approved for home support have no carer.  This is because past and current Governments have failed to plan.  This lack of planning by the Government speaks to its priorities.  People who have worked their entire lives are being left behind and let down badly.  There are hundreds if not thousands more who have funding but only receive partial support that is far below what they and their family need.  When we hear of our young people emigrating in record numbers, many of whom are healthcare professionals, can we really blame them when this is the future they can expect?  We need a proactive strategic approach to workforce planning in health and social care.  We must improve working conditions to help with the retention of staff.</p>  <p>  There are knock-on effects.  The lack of community care alternatives has left more than 7,000 people delayed in hospital, including more than 1,000 people who could have gone home earlier if they had a carer.  In the midst of a hospital bed emergency, we have people in beds who should be at home and we have people on trolleys waiting on those beds.  We can rectify this with proper home care delivery.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan to fix this, as my party colleagues have outlined.  We need a pay agreement for the sector and the Government needs to make sure this happens.  The Government must advance vital regulation for the home care sector and should make this legislation a priority.  We must also establish the promised commission on care to kick-start and modernise social care arrangements.  Our communities deserve much greater public investment in the home care sector in the years ahead so they can get and receive the right care in the right place at the right time.</p>  <p>  Something that really bothers me is the phrase "bed blockers".  I hate when it comes up.  A woman in her 70s contacted me to say she was told her husband was a bed blocker.  He has been in hospital for a long time.  He is unwell.  In her words, he is looking to come home and die with dignity.  He has not been allowed to do so because he has been told he is blocking beds.  He is not blocking the beds.  It is the system that is blocking the beds.</p></speech>

This is about 2 per cent more than the expected activity and 4 per cent more than the same period last year, and the number of hours of home support provision nationally has increased from 17.55 million hours in 2020 to 20.46 million hours in 2021, in tandem with increased investment; </blockquote>notes that:  <blockquote> 	&mdash; the Irish Government's strategic policy goal is to deliver a new model of integrated, older persons health and social care services, across the care continuum, supporting older people to remain living independently in their own homes and communities for longer, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for receiving the right care in the right place and the right time; <br /><br />&mdash; the interRAI assessment will be used to determine the allocation of care depending on the need of an individual and the phased rollout of the interRAI assessment tool for home support has commenced across four pilot areas, and this will be accelerated with the recruitment of 128 interRAI care needs facilitators which is underway and these outputs and the evaluation of the pilot sites for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery of home support evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme; <br /><br />&mdash; the HSE monitors data on Delayed Transfers of Care (DTOC) on a daily, weekly and monthly basis so they can target these patients as early as possible and take appropriate steps to identify suitable post discharge support which will then facilitate their discharge and patients are added and removed from the list on a daily basis; <br /><br />&mdash; as of 1st November, 2022, the HSE reported there were 594 DTOCs of which 103 people were waiting on home supports;<br /><br />&mdash; the HSE National Service Plan 2022 sets a priority action to maintaining, at a minimum of 40 per cent, the proportion of public / private provision of support hours so that the balance is reflected in each area over time. Any increases reflect the workforce requirements of the expected statutory home support scheme. In line with these commitments, the Report of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Healthcare Assistants' calls for 'a significant increase in the proportion of home support hours and packages provided directly by the HSE' and recommends that 'targets determined by the HSE on a national level should be set out in the National Service Plan 2023' (recommendation No. 11); <br /><br />&mdash; there are currently 21 Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) teams in place across the country and all Community Health Organisations (CHOs) have at least one team in place, the recruitment for the remaining teams is ongoing and it is planned to have the full complement of 30 ICPOP teams established by Q1 2023; <br /><br />&mdash; the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits the Government to 'Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care', and the Department of Health is currently developing a regulatory framework for home-support providers with the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with high-quality care that will comprise of (i) primary legislation for the licensing of home support providers, (ii) regulations for home support which will set out the minimum requirements that a provider must meet to obtain a licence, and (iii) Acute and Community Healthcare Services (HIQA) national standards, the Heads of Bill are currently being drafted by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity, and HIQA are developing standards for home care and home support services which will go out for public consultation early in 2023; <br /><br />&mdash; the Government is committed to supporting healthy and positive ageing throughout the life-course as well as to ensuring that older persons can continue to live independently in their homes and communities for as long as possible. At present, this objective is supported by the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), which provides a blueprint for whole-of-Government policymaking and service-delivery in partnership with the community and voluntary sector. Acknowledging the disproportionately negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on older persons, the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to the establishment of a commission on care that will 'assess how we care for older people and examine alternatives to meet the diverse needs of our older citizens', learning the lessons from Covid -19 and an initial scoping exercise for the commission on care has been undertaken, it is envisaged that the commission on care will support a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to examining existing policies and strategies which support positive ageing and that it will effectively address the gaps which currently exist in the policy-landscape and it is anticipated that the commission will be established in 2023; <br /><br />&mdash; the Health and Social Care workforce planning and ensuring an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified healthcare professionals in Ireland is a top priority for the Government, and the Department of Health has commenced a programme of work to deliver a Health and Social Care Workforce Planning Strategy and Action Plan, and a Planning Projection Model, and this work is being undertaken with the support of the European Commission under the auspices of their Technical Support Instrument which will provide the technical expertise to deliver this project and is due to be completed in Autumn 2023; and<br /><br />&mdash; addressing the shortage of care-workers in Ireland is an urgent priority for the Government. To this end, the cross-departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group was established in March 2022 to examine, and formulate recommendations to address, the challenges in front-line carer roles in the home-support and long-term residential care sectors. The Group was chaired by the Department of Health and comprised representatives from seven government departments, the HSE, HIQA and SOLAS. Working closely with key stakeholders, the Group examined the recruitment, retention, training, career-development, and pay and conditions of front-line carers. The Report of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Healthcare Assistants was published on 15th October, 2022, providing an overview of the work of the Group and its key findings, the report presents a suite of 16 recommendations spanning the areas of areas of recruitment, pay and conditions of employment, barriers to employment, training and professional development, sectoral reform, and monitoring and implementation. All of the recommendations have been strongly endorsed by Minister Butler, and work to implement the recommendations has commenced; and </blockquote>further recognises that:   <blockquote> 	&mdash; the General Scheme of a Health (Amendment) Bill to amend the 2007 Health Act was published in October 2022. This legislation will enhance and modernise the powers of the Chief Inspector of Social Services in HIQA and will provide for the mandatory reporting of key operational data by nursing homes. The General Scheme has been referred to the Oireachtas Health Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny and the Department of Health is engaging with the Office of the Attorney General is relation to the drafting of the Bill; <br /><br />&mdash; the Heads of Licensing of Professional Home Support Providers Bill are currently being drafted by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. Regulations are at an advanced stage. The Department has completed a public consultation on the draft regulations which concluded on 4 August. The report on the submissions for the public consultation is currently being compiled by the Institute of Public Health (IPH); <br /><br />&mdash; adult safeguarding has been included in Section 10 of the draft regulations for the licensing of Home Support Providers; <br /><br />&mdash; the HSE will recruit key posts to enable the establishment of a National Home Support Office. Funding is provided for 15 full-time jobs; <br /><br />&mdash; the HSE has acknowledged the importance of a fit for purpose IT system for the delivery of Home Care across all CHOs and are finalising the details. The HSE and Department of Health are jointly working on the structures and systems to enable the creation of the Regional Health Areas and the National Home Support Office will be included as part of this; <br /><br />&mdash; a key recommendation of the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 is the shift of care out of acute hospitals into the community and closer to a person's home, where safely possible. In pursuit of this goal, the HSE commenced the implementation of the Enhanced Community Care programme in 2021. The Enhanced Community Care (ECC) Programme is a strategic reform programme in line with Sl&aacute;intecare proposals which seeks to deliver new and enhanced services and support the move toward a more community-centric model of healthcare. The ECC programme represents the most significant expansion in Primary Care in the last two decades, with overall recruitment to the ECC targeted at approximately 3,500 WTE, and this Government allocating significant funding to deliver this expansion; <br /><br />&mdash; improving access to home support has been a priority for Government. The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities are enabled to live an independent life of their own choosing, like any other person, in line with the disability reform policy - 'transforming lives' and the HSE has consistently, year. on year, increased the number of hours of PA Services delivered to people with a disability. The National Service Plan 2022 outlines the HSE's commitment to deliver 1.7 million hours of PA services to 2,587 people this year. This reflects an additional 120,000 hours of PA services in 2022 to expand and enhance supports for people to live self-directed lives in their own communities; <br /><br />&mdash; the Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme, an innovative partnership between the local government sector (Age Friendly Ireland) and Sl&aacute;intecare, commenced in 2021 and saw the introduction of a new person-centric, robust, support co-ordination service. It was announced in Budget 2023 that funding of &euro;5.2 million has been allocated to roll-out the initiative nationally;  <br /><br />&mdash; under Housing for All &ndash; a new housing plan for Ireland, a review in relation the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme is currently underway. Grant limits and income thresholds are being considered as part of this process; <br /><br />&mdash; the tender process for home support is underway. The HSE is responsible for procuring home support services. Established procurement protocols apply to this process; and<br /><br />&mdash; the recommendations made in the Report of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Healthcare Assistants includes recommendations on terms and conditions for workers. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>I am delighted to see the Ceann Comhairle back in the Chair and I wish him all the very best.  I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about the substantial progress under way on supporting people to receive care in their homes as well as the wider home care sector.  We know that for most people home is the preferred location for care.  The home support service is therefore an essential service for thousands of people across the country.  It is highly valued by service users and their families because it enables older people to live independently and with dignity in their own homes for longer.  It also enables many older people to return home following acute hospital admission who otherwise would remain there or would be admitted to long-term residential care.  For these reasons, improving access to this service is a Government priority.</p><p>Many of my colleagues on the other side of the House spoke about what is not being delivered.  I will speak about what is being delivered.  Home support hours in communities are increasing in line with enhanced investment.  We provide more hours of home support to more people than ever before.  In 2021 we provided 20.4 million hours to more than 55,000 people, an increase of 17% compared to 2020.  As of the end of September, more than 16 million home support hours have already been delivered this year to more than 56,000 people in the community.  This is more than 6% more hours than delivered by this time last year.  Are there difficulties?  Yes there are because more people than ever before are being referred for home care.  We have had an increase of 6% already this year and an increase last year of 17%.</p><p>I want to speak about delayed transference of care because there has been a lot of talk about this.  The HSE monitors data on delayed transfers of care on a daily, weekly and monthly basis so it can target these patients as early as possible and take appropriate steps to identify suitable post-discharge support, which will then facilitate discharge.  Patients are added and removed from the list on a daily basis.  As of 1 November 2022, the HSE reported there were 594 delayed transfers of care, of which 103 people - not 1,000 - were waiting on home supports.</p><p>I was particularly pleased to announce in budget 2023 that the proportion of new home support hours allocated to people with dementia will increase by 4%.  This will bring the dementia-specific proportion of new home support hours up from 5% in 2021 to 15% in 2023, valued at &euro;5.2 million.  These improvements have been facilitated by increased Government funding.  We have provided an additional &euro;200 million for home support since 2021.  Next year the overall budget will be in excess of &euro;700 million.  What is frustrating for me as Minister of State is that I have a budget and I could provide funding for the 6,000 people waiting today but we do not have the staff.  I have the budget and I want to get this message out.  This will go towards progressing the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services and delivering about 24 million hours of home care in 2023.</p><p>The delivery of this service is not without its challenges.  Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment.  Addressing the strategic workforce challenges in the home support sector is an urgent issue and for this reason, as Deputy Cullinane referred to, in March I established the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  It set out to examine and, most importantly, to propose solutions to the challenges in front-line carer roles in the home support and long-term residential care sectors.  The group was chaired by the Department of Health and comprised representatives from seven Departments, the HSE, HIQA and SOLAS.  Working closely with key stakeholders, the group worked together to examine the recruitment, retention, training, career development and pay and conditions of front-line carers.  The contribution of stakeholders through meetings and facilitated workshops was invaluable, ensuring that deliberations were fully informed by those who provide care every day in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p><p>The report of the strategic workforce advisory group on home carers and nursing home healthcare assistants was published on 15 October 2022.  The report presents a suite of 16 recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment, pay and conditions of employment, barriers to employment, training and professional development, sectoral reform, and monitoring and implementation.  I will mention three key recommendations on which we are already moving.  Somebody providing home care has to be paid a minimum of the living wage of &euro;12.90.  We will be announcing very shortly that the critical skills list will be recruiting beyond the EU.  Travel expenses should be paid to anyone providing home care.  I have strongly endorsed the recommendations and implementation commenced immediately.  This will be closely monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the recommendations are enacted in full in a timely manner.  I anticipate that the implementation of the recommendations will have a lasting, positive impact.</p> <p>When I took on this role two and a quarter years ago, 9,000 people were waiting for home care, and we managed to reduce that figure to 4,000, as Deputy Tully said.  Unfortunately, that figure has grown again because, since Covid, more people are looking for home care than there were before and the cases are more complex.  In dealing with waiting lists, one has to prioritise the most complex cases and end-of-life care.  That is why it can be challenging.  It pains me to see the numbers increase.</p> <p> Deputy Mythen mentioned Wexford.  It was I who put in train the special review for Wexford, where there is the highest number of people waiting for home care in the whole country.  I will follow up on that expert report and see what the recommendations are.  However, it is quite challenging.  I thank home care support assistants for the invaluable work they carry out, and I know everybody is in agreement with us in that regard.</p> <p> When I took up this position two and a quarter years ago, the split between private and public home care was 50:50, but because we increased home care provision by more than 2 million hours, we had to move to the private sector.  The private sector has an agreement with the HSE whereby the average payment is &euro;27 per hour.  However, I cannot control the amount the private sector pays its workers.  That is why I have recommended the minimum payment in the tender that will be introduced in the new year should be &euro;12.90, which is the living wage rate, plus mileage.  That would go a long way to support and encourage other people to work in the home care sector.</p> <p> Health and social care workforce planning and ensuring an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified healthcare professionals in Ireland is a top priority for the Government.  The Department of Health has commenced a programme of work to deliver a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, as well as a planning projection model.  This work is being undertaken with the support of the European Commission under the auspices of the technical support instrument, which will provide the technical expertise to deliver this project.  The work is due to be completed in autumn 2023.</p> <p> Under the integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, community specialist teams provide access to multidisciplinary assessments that ultimately enable older people to remain living at home for as long as possible.  The teams specifically target those at risk from falls, frailty and dementia.  They seek to ensure that older people can access care at, or near, their homes through care pathways specifically designed for them.  There are currently 21 ICPOP teams in place across the country and all community healthcare organisations have at least one team.  Recruitment for the remaining teams is ongoing.  With continued positive recruitment, I expect the full complement of 30 ICPOP teams will be in place by early 2023.</p> <p> The Government is committed to supporting healthy and positive ageing throughout the life course.  Acknowledging the disproportionately negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on older people, the programme for Government commits to the establishment of a commission on care that will assess how we care for older people and examine alternatives to meet the diverse needs of our older citizens.  An initial scoping exercise for the commission on care has been undertaken.  It is envisaged the commission on care will support a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to examining existing policies and strategies that support positive ageing and it will effectively address the gaps in the policy landscape.</p> <p> The healthy age-friendly homes programme, an innovative partnership between the local government sector and Sl&aacute;intecare, commenced in 2021, and it saw the introduction of a new person-centric and robust support co-ordination service.  In budget 2023, I announced funding of &euro;5.2 million to be allocated to the roll-out of the initiative nationally.  In addition, under Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, a review of the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability scheme is under way.  Grant limits and income thresholds are being considered as part of this process.</p> <p> Once again, I thank the Deputy for tabling the motion.  I agree with many parts of it, several of which are currently in train.  I know we agree on nearly 90% of the motion.  There were a couple of other elements in the motion and the Deputy knows the reason I could not accept it, and that is why I tabled the amendment.  I thank him for raising this issue.  It is important that we have speaking time on home care, which supports 56,000 people per day.</p></speech>

It is good to see him looking well.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has identified all the challenges and blockages.  What we need now is real action and not just observations.  We also need a strategy, as throwing money at it is not a strategy.  Home care is an essential service, and without a workforce strategy, there will be no improvement in home care delivery.  The Government throwing money at it is not a strategy.  The failure to put a home care workforce strategy in place is pushing patients into hospitals when they could be cared for in their own homes.</p>  <p>  Everyone, including the Minister of State, knows the problems, but we are not getting the action we need.  We need delivery.  We have had enough of reports and reviews.  Our communities need to see the reform of the home care sector.  What we have now is effectively a race to the bottom.  We need a career pathway that will allow home care staff to develop their skills and train to deliver a quality service, and this needs to be recognised.  There needs to be a collective pay agreement for home care workers that takes into account travel times, as mentioned by the Minister of State, so why has she not done this?  We all know this needs to be done.  We need action.</p>  <p>  We also need to see home care workers having access to work visas in the same way as home care workers in hospitals and nursing homes.  Unless that is done, there will be a haemorrhaging of home care workers into nursing homes and hospital settings, which will ensure there is never an improvement in home care delivery.  Providers are haemorrhaging staff because the Government has not introduced the necessary standards and requirements to ensure people want to work and will work in home care services.  There needs to be a level playing field for all providers of home care, such as in hospitals, home care settings and nursing homes.  We do not have a level playing field now.  Home care workers cannot access visas, which means home care companies are training staff for nursing homes, the HSE and the hospitals.</p></speech>

Demographics suggest that we are all living longer, which is a good thing, but worryingly it is suggested that if people are not well off, they will struggle as they get older and the quality of their extended life will be poor unless supports are increased dramatically.  It is an abandonment of our duty to our older and more vulnerable citizens that it is often beyond the ability of many families to afford private home care.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State questioned some of the figures referred to in the motion.  Some 1,000 people unnecessarily experienced a delayed discharge from hospitals this year because the home care packages are just not there.  She mentioned the date of 1 November 2022.  We are saying that there has been a problem in that regard since the start of the year.  If we want to look at figures, there is a lack of step-down beds, which impacted on 7,000 people being discharged.</p>  <p>  By way of an example of some of the challenges being faced, there were 11 ambulances outside Tallaght University Hospital at the weekend.  There are 12 ambulances in the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet, ten of which were outside that hospital.  There is a problem within the system, and that was unusual.  I ask the Minister of State to point out a hospital in the country that does not have people lying on beds because they do not have somewhere else to go.  I do not know of any such hospital and that is the experience my colleagues and I are hearing about.  We need to do more regarding that.  The almost glacial speed of changes to the provision of care in the public service needs to change.</p>  <p>  In my area, Tallaght hospital recently commenced the pathfinder service with the National Ambulance Service, which it is hoped will reduce the need for patients to attend the accident and emergency department, but this took years to expand following an experimental pilot programme in Beaumont Hospital.  Despites its success, there seems to be a delay.  We need to be more proactive, move quicker and realise the benefits of a successful project sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

I have listened to what the Members have said, and I will read from a number of papers.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>recently stated, &quot;Low wages, long hours, and insecure working conditions are pushing the largely female workforce out of the caring industry&quot;.  People who spoke to the paper said there was nothing complex about the crisis with one saying, &quot;Change would have to mean the agencies paying more to the carers, and better conditions for the healthcare workers and more attention to the families&quot;.</p> <p>A number of months ago there was reference in <i>The Irish Times</i>to carers as gig workers.  An interdepartmental group on economic migration determines which sectors can tap non-EU workers and is chaired by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  It concluded there was no labour shortage in the sector.  It instead found that the issue was the terms and conditions home care groups are offering.<br/><br/>The Minister of State mentioned budgets and money.  We have heard from people working in the system that they are not being paid and the money is going somewhere else.  We know privatisation is for profit, not for care.  I raised the issue of home carers in a Topical Issue debate a number of weeks ago.  It was horrific.  Additional hours had been approved but were not granted because there was nobody there to do the work.  In the meantime, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, discussed incontinence pants.  People were rationing them to two a day for a 93-year old woman who cannot get home care help.  The family is providing care.  The knock-on effect is stress on families.  The whole system breaks down and people lose faith in everything.<br/><br/>I again refer to budgets.  Let us start hiring and paying our own.  The minute we start outsourcing to private companies and moving money out we destroy it.  We can hear from witness statements that people have no faith in the system.  My mother was a carer for years.  She went above and beyond, which most do, for a pittance.  That is what we have to address.  We have to be fair because if we do not pay and treat people properly they will not work in the service.</p></speech>

Some have been waiting up to 18 months.  They want to and can be cared for in their own homes, but this can only happen where the care is being provided.  They and other families are being let down.  I raised the crisis in home care during Leader's Questions last December.  At the time, the HIQA report had been published.  It concluded that home care is currently not sustainable or meeting people's needs and a complete overhaul was needed.</p>  <p>  Since then, in March the Minister of State announced the establishment of the workforce advisory group to look at the crisis in the recruitment and retention of home care workers.  It was due to report in September and the report was published last month.  During those seven months waiting lists continued to grow and time was wasted because there was nothing new in the issues identified or recommendations made in the report that home care providers and workers could not tell the Minister of State themselves.  I said that to the Minister of State.  We are now at a point where we need to see action on pay, terms and conditions and promoting roles in home care to resolve the recruitment crisis that continues.</p>  <p>  I want to suggest to the Minister of State Roscommon's RHS Home Care services, established in 1996, as a blueprint.  It pays a living wage and above to its carers and uncapped travel costs and provides an excellent service to our county.  It is those very valued home care workers, including those in RHS Home Care services and further afield, who are still waiting for the &euro;1,000 Covid recognition payment.  The Minister of State did not mention that in her contribution.  These workers deserve far better and are still waiting almost 11 months after the announcement was made.  It is a disgrace when we consider what they did during Covid, especially at the start when they did not have PPE or vaccines.  They took their lives in their hands and deserve a lot better.</p>  <p>  I met two siblings this week.  Their brother, who has a number of health conditions, is in hospital.  The hospital told him it would do the paperwork for a home care package but there was not a hope of it being received.  That is the situation today regarding home care.  We need to fix the issues that are there.  We need to stop the reports and financially and otherwise support home care workers who were providing care every day of the week.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago I was going door-to-door and came across a woman who had just come home and was getting out of her car in her driveway and was taking a moment to compose herself.  I had that feeling with which we are all familiar of trying to deliver a leaflet and wondering what to do.  She took the leaflet, called me back and asked me to come in.  She had come from providing a couple of hours care for her mother - she shares the care with two sisters.  Like many people providing care, she finds it a struggle and it is difficult.  Her mother has been approved for home help hours, an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening every day.  She had been waiting for the service for nine months.  I rang around to see why she had been waiting and I found out from one of the providers, which was very helpful, that there were specific times on the request, which is a perfectly understandable request for a family member filling out a form for home help to make.  A person who needs home help may need medication at 8 a.m., 9 a.m. or 10 a.m or whatever the case may be.  The hours on the form were deemed antisocial off-peak hours.  They were not.  The hours requested were not 10 a.m. or 6 p.m.; rather, they were specific hours such as 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m.</p>  <p>  When I advised the woman that was the case she told me if she had known that she would not have put times on the application because they could be flexible.  She had to go through the process again.  If I had not met her, made calls and spoken to a helpful person from a private home care provider who gave me that insight the woman would still be scrambling with the forms on her kitchen table, which she showed me, making phone call after phone call and desperately trying to seek home care for her mother and respite for her and her sisters.  That is just one of many examples of how the system as it exists is failing so many people.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the workforce advisory group included a national campaign to raise the profile of home care, promote training opportunities and a national and EU campaign on the benefits of working in the sector.  The recommendations mean naught unless recommendations 5 and 6 are implemented.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6, on the living wage, to which the Minister of State referred, is weak.  We need an ERO similar to what we have in childcare.  We need a collective agreement that will set a wage living wage or above for workers in the industry and include travel, which was another recommendation.  The principle of the recommendations is not bad, but the language, in particular on an hourly rate, is weak.  I would rather a stronger trade union language, using the model we have in childcare, and getting the industry and stakeholders to agree a rate, through the JLCs.  Only then will advertising and recruitment campaigns work in respect of care.</p>  <p>  This is not a new or novel issue we are discussing.  We all have long experience of dealing with families who wish to avail of home care for their loved ones and workers who are burned out, overstretched and are being paid for one hour rather than two hours' work because they have to travel between locations.</p>  <p>  We now have micro-geographic areas through which a home care worker is willing or able to work.  Sometimes only half of an area such as Kinsealy, in north county Dublin, is covered because the other half is too far away from workers.  It is nowhere near the largest town in north County Dublin.  These are the failures.</p>  <p>  I want to hammer home that inviting private companies to pay a living wage is not strong enough.  We need an ERO.  The handful of groups that made submissions on this report included the Irish Congress of Trade Union and SIPTU.  The trade unions are engaged and want to be part of the solution.  If we set wages appropriately, people will work as home care workers because it is vocational and care work, which people want to do.  However, they want recognition not only in their pay but in the esteem in which they are held in the State.</p>  <p>  A couple of hours ago I met contract cleaners and security workers who are still awaiting their Covid recognition payment.</p>  <p>Those workers did not mention the amount, the cost-of-living crisis or any of that, as would have been understandable and their right.  They just mentioned recognition.  It is the same with home care workers.  I ask that the Minister of State re-engage with the trade unions and set about a process through which-----</p></speech>

However, I am concerned that there is no clear timeline for the implementation.  While she talks about getting moving on it straight away, she does not set out a timeline.  It is a real weakness that needs to be addressed.  That is why I have tabled an amendment to the motion calling for the publication of a timeline before Christmas or the end of the year.</p><p>The issues and solutions have been identified pretty well in the report.  We need to accelerate the kind of reform set out in the report because we cannot continue our overreliance on institutional care, not least in the aftermath of Covid-19 and the devastating impact it had on nursing homes.  It also put the issue of institutional care under the spotlight.  I can recall Deputy Varadkar, who was Taoiseach at the time, as far as I can recall, talking about us needing to radically change our view of the best model of care for older people.  Nothing has happened since then.  There was all this talk about things having to change drastically but nothing has happened.</p><p>We know that older people, in the main, do not wish to be in nursing homes.  We also know there are many people in nursing homes who should not be there at all.  They are there because no home care was available for them or for different reasons.  However, people should be given choices, the first of which is to be at home, living as independently as possible with home care.  We also have to look at the area of housing for older people.  I have been talking about this for years.  There are good models of housing around.  We should ensure that people have some kind of sheltered housing option to which to move when their house is too big or unmanageable.  Phased grades of support should be then made available up to nursing home level but nursing homes should be the last option.</p><p>More than 6,000 people are on a waiting list for home care.  That is a scandal.  There have been more than 8,000 delayed discharges so far this year, of which more than 10% were due to a shortfall in home carers.  It makes no sense whatsoever to have large numbers of people in such situations.  At any one time, there are approximately 600 people in hospital who are ready to be discharged.  It is crazy that such a situation is allowed to continue for want of adequate home care, staffing, funding or step-down facilities.  It is an example of the dysfunction within the health service, which should change very urgently.  We cannot stand over a situation in which there is such a level of waiting lists and inappropriate use of expensive acute hospital beds.  However, under the watch of successive Governments, we have seen not the State taking on responsibility for the provision of services directly but creeping privatisation of the home care sector, with funding to private providers increasing from &euro;3 million in 2006 to &euro;176 million in 2019.  </p><p>Like a great many other aspects of our health and social care system, the State has become disproportionately dependent on outsourcing care.  I was at the SIPTU conference a couple of weeks ago where one of the speakers was Ms Emma Dowling.  She is the author of an excellent book, <i>The Care Crisis</i>, which I recommend the Minister of State reads if she has not done so.  It is a terrific book.  Ms Dowling made a good point in her presentation to SIPTU, when she said that rather than talking about outsourcing of care, we are talking about extraction of wealth from the care service.  That is what it is.  It is a model that includes the profit margin.  Why are we doing this?  Why are we making businesses out of what should be State-provided caring facilities?</p><p>I will make another recommendation.  A woman in DCU, Professor Kate Irving, has written extensively on caring.  She has written specifically on dementia but has also made important points with regard to caring generally.  In a recent paper, which I would be happy to share with the Minister of State, Professor Irving made the point that we will continue to place responsibility for any version of person-centred care on the least qualified persons in the chain, that is, the home support workers.  It is a very good description.  I hope that we will all get to that critical point at our lives late in life but we will all more or less be looking for care at a certain stage.  It has been decided by successive Governments that those providing critical care - a sensitive need for proper care - are probably the lowest paid and least qualified of all workers in our economy.  That seems to turn logic on its head.</p><p>To make matters work, we still have no regulatory framework or independent regulator.  All we have is the HSE acting as a proxy regulator of providers to deliver home care on its behalf while home care provided directly by the HSE effectively undergoes no such scrutiny as it cannot be independent of itself.  Worst of all, in theory, providers outside of the tender do not have to adhere to any standards whatsoever.  That is the current situation which is, frankly, unacceptable.</p><p>I think everyone accepts that the current tendering model is not fit for purpose.  It has created a race to the bottom with the providers competing solely on price.  Not only is this bad for the client, it is completely unsustainable for workers' pay and conditions.  It is November and it is still my understanding that the invitation to tender has not been issued.  I read the Minister of State's amendment carefully and tried to get around the weasel words but it was not clear whether the tender has been issued.  It was supposed to be issued by the end of quarter 3 for implementation by 1 January.</p><p>I wrote to the Minister of State last April when the plan to dramatically reduce the number of providers was first mooted.  Seven months on, providers are still anxiously awaiting clarity, especially smaller, not-for-profit and community providers.  Will she, please, update the House on the upcoming home-care tender?  The last I heard, Grant Thornton had been hired to assist with the procurement strategy but that was during the summer.  I did not understand the need for private, third-party assistance then and I certainly do not see the need now.  The Minister of State managed to miss the quarter-3 deadline even though she had employed outside consultants.</p><p>At the very least, will she give an assurance that the tender will ensure all home care workers receive a living wage at a minimum?  That is the recommendation.  She acknowledges that in her amendment but she does not commit to doing so.  Will she give an assurance that when the tender document is issued to invite tenders, it will provide for the payment of the living wage, at a minimum, in accordance with the recommendations in the report?  I have tabled an amendment to provide for that.  Since the advisory group published its report, the living wage for 2022-23 has increased to &euro;13.85.</p> <p>Will the tender provide for that at a minimum?  Further changes are required to address chronic low pay in the sector.  A reformed tender model should insist on an incremental pay scale that recognises a worker's length of service, training and qualifications.  At the crux of this is a lack of recognition of the vital work of the professional home carer and this should not be the case.  It would also be remiss of us not to acknowledge this is a workforce dominated by women and that is certainly a factor in the historical undervaluing of this work.  If there were proper pay scales, it would not be as difficult to recruit staff and we would have a lot more men going into the service as well, thus there are strong arguments for this, apart from the right of workers to decent pay.</p> <p> Ultimately, these workers deserve our respect, not just in the form of positive platitudes but tangible measures that recognise the importance of their work, respect them and recognise the importance of collective bargaining, among other things.  Without these reforms we will struggle to retain and recruit staff.  I will forward the documentation I have quoted but I ask her to clarify what the situation is with the tender document and the living wage.</p></speech>

It is a good critique of where we are at the moment.  There is no argument, here or outside here, but that older people are better off being cared for at home.  I have experienced that as a care worker myself and in the past six or seven months of my mother's life when she was cared for at home.  Home is where our parents want to be.  It is where they grew up, where their family and friends are and it is the best environment, sometimes, for end-of-life care.  Sometimes it is not conducive but it is the best place for our loved ones to be at that particular time.</p>  <p>  It is better in financial terms because if a person is in hospital for a week, it adds up to approximately &euro;6,000.  If a person is in a nursing home, it costs &euro;1,000 per week and, therefore it makes a lot of financial sense to have somebody in that situation in their home.  Then there is the matter of age demographics.  In the next seven or eight years there will be many more people aged over 65.  Whether they need that care will depend on their own situation but demographics will play a part in how we provide for our older citizens.</p>  <p>  I understand considerable time has been given to home care hours in the past five to ten years but we have to look at where these hours are going and the private companies involved in private home care work.  Probably the best example of the whole structure of this, which the Minister of State referred to in her statement, is how much private companies charge the HSE per hour.  If we break this down it does not make sense.  The worker who does all the work is getting paid &euro;11.50 or &euro;12 per hour and the company is charging &euro;28 per hour.  Somebody is making a lot of money out of this.  If we look at what the main private operators got in 2020, it is eye-watering.  In 2020, three companies got the following from the HSE: Home Instead Senior Care, &euro;58 million; Bluebird Care, &euro;33 million; and Irish HomeCare, &euro;13 million.  I am sure that has gone up incrementally in the past two years.  It would be better to put resources into a public system where workers are looked after properly.  The private sector is haemorrhaging workers because they are not looked after.  If the company is getting that amount, it is hugely profitable but, at the same time, workers are not even paid to travel from A to B.  If they are not getting paid for that, then it is no wonder people are leaving the sector.  There is also a good angle to this.  I worked for the HSE directly and it was a better rate of pay.  The executive looked after its workers and that is a better system, considering the huge resources that go into this.  It is better for the worker, the person they are going to, the family, society, the taxpayer and everybody.  It is not about looking to the private model all the time because that system is not conducive to home care and proper care in the home.</p></speech>

I know him a long time and knew him when he was a young fellow doing this sort of care work.  I know the pride with which he did his job and the type of people he looked after for long periods.  He looked after people with whom he built up relationships.  There were people who were wheelchair-bound and people who suffered with their mental health.  The whole point of the type of care that was delivered, as the Deputy said, through the HSE and the public sector was that the carer built up a relationship with those who they cared for.</p>  <p>   I have been involved in a few special committees during my time in the Oireachtas, which is a short time.  One of them is currently getting ready to issue its report on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  For one session we had before us Professor Kathleen Lynch, who has written a brilliant book on capitalism and care.  She pointed out a number of strong home truths on the same lines as Deputy Kenny has experienced in his life.  One of the things she points out is care itself is not about providing just the physical facilities but about having a relationship and having an affection and a sort of a friendship with person for whom you care.  It goes to the heart of what people need in their lives in terms of their need to flourish.  We learned a lot about that during Covid.</p>  <p>  The other committee I was involved in was the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that sat I do not know how many times during 2020 and examined the care sector in particular and what was happening in our nursing homes.  I remind Deputies that 56% of all Covid deaths in the State at that time took place inside the nursing home system, which was totally disproportionate as this group of elderly people comprise 0.65% of the total population.  A recommendation that came out of that long-sitting, long-suffering committee was "that a public inquiry be established to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to each individual death from Covid-19 in nursing homes".  We fought for that recommendation to look at what was going on in the private sector because Professor Lynch's statistical study shows 70% of all nursing home beds are now owned by for-profit companies and a huge subsidy takes place in the State.  With regard to the overall care relationship between the State and the for-profit sector, the proportion of public expenditure allocated to private for-profit care rose from 5% in 2006 to a handsome 40% in 2019, and that is not the latest figure.  Though it is not defined as profitable, it is currently at approximately &euro;718 million annually with 599 businesses registered as delivering care.  What is that if not the commercialisation of the most human action one can carry out in one's life, which is to care for another, particularly when they are vulnerable or disabled?  That is the corporatisation of care and the State is very much guilty of implementing that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in motion as we need a serious think about how we are delivering it.  Approximately ten years ago the HSE was washing its hands locally of the home help system that existed in all our communities.  It was so localised we had a special dedicated office in Lower Ballyfermot and another in Upper Ballyfermot.  It was mostly run by nuns and voluntary elements of the HSE but they worked closely with mainly local women, and sometimes men, to deliver hours of care to their neighbours.  That was real care because those working knew the people.  They knew the elderly men and women they were looking after.  They had grown up alongside them.</p> <p>They loved them, had relationships with them and bent over backwards for them.  They were available to those people out of hours and were paid a reasonably decent hourly rate to care for them.  When the home help system was removed, all of that went under the radar.  All of those women and men, if they wanted to stay in the industry, were expected to pay for their own training and uniform and to work for a for-profit company that provided them with an app whereby their work was timed.  They were asked why they spent longer than 15 minutes with Mrs. Murphy around the corner when they should have only helped her to shower and take her tablets.  I reiterate that what people really need are relationships, affection, care and friendship.  If we move away from that model, we are doing society a huge disservice.</p> <p> As part of my work on the climate committee, I read a lot about the alternatives to our burning of the planet.  There are many theories about how we could do things differently in society.  Many people have written about what they call the care and repair of society.  Central to that is for society to move to spending significant public money on looking after each other, which requires training and paying people properly to give the sort of care our vulnerable and elderly people deserve.  We will all get there some day.  It would be fruitful and productive to take that approach.  This debate helps us to understand that is where we need to go.</p></speech>

In my constituency, as is probably also the case for the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, a lot of people come to me who say they or their parents have been assessed for hours, there is an allocation given but the hours are not provided.  Nothing happens.  I dealt with a man who needs two people to help him because he has had three strokes.  He will not get that help because there is somebody else living in the house with him, namely, his wife, who is 82 years of age.  That is not right.  There are things going on that are just not right.  I have plenty of cases of people who have tried to get care privately and do something to keep their family member at home.  It flies in the face of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy if that cannot be done.</p>  <p>  Regarding the private companies providing care services, the reality is there is a tiered system.  Some of these elite companies, let us call them, are getting the high rates that were mentioned by a previous speaker.  However, small companies that employ people locally are getting the pickings off the bottom of the pot.  Their staff get the longest distances to go to care for people.  These companies are being told that if they want to get up with the elite, they must have policies in place and everything done to prove for the next tender that they are as good as the big guys, who are deemed to be good just because they have many more people working for them.  The reality is reflected in the case of a company I know of, which has done the training and brought all its staff along with it only for the HSE to poach its staff, after all the training is done, and give them a higher rate of pay than the company can give.  I am referring to tiers 3 and 4 companies.</p>  <p>  It is a crazy system.  There cannot be differentiation between one company providing a service and another company when both are giving staff the same training.  It is down to the corporate image of the bigger companies.  They know exactly how to do things.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, knows, 180 beds have been lost from nursing home services in counties Galway and Roscommon for this winter.  More will be lost if we do not do something to support private nursing homes in their hour of need.</p></speech>

However, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment refuted those labour market shortages in August, suggesting that the recruitment challenges were because of a failure to guarantee hours of work and the lack of travel and subsistence payments.  Although it was aware of this reasoning, the Government did not address those long-term pay and conditions issues, which have subsequently harmed recruitment and retention.  Instead, the Government is overreliant on private, non-HSE home care providers to fill the gap in the market.  Although the national service plan for 2022 makes significant promises in delivering a national service framework that defines a financially and operationally sustainable model for public long-term residential care and intermediate rehabilitation care, only 38% of home support services are delivered directly by the HSE.</p>  <p>  As of July, waiting lists for home care support had escalated sixfold in just a few months to 5,000, leaving those with additional needs struggling and unable to stay in the comfort of their own home.  On top of this, almost 10% of all older people approved for home support have no carer.  If demographic projections for hospital and home care admissions are correct, the demand for such care will grow significantly over the coming years, putting significant pressure on our health system, which cannot and will not cope safely.  These failures to provide improved pathways of home care are pushing older people into overcrowded hospitals and nursing homes.  The lack of community care alternatives has left more than 7,000 people delayed in a hospital when they should be cared for in their own home, if they had a carer.</p>  <p>  A huge number of people have moved to my constituency of Louth and to east Meath in recent years.  There are long hospital waiting lists, GP shortages, long waiting times to access child protection and welfare services and now an acute labour shortage of home care workers.  I was contacted today by the family of an 88-year-old woman who is currently in hospital after a stroke.  Having been granted discharge following treatment, this woman cannot go home as she is still awaiting a care package from the HSE.  An 88-year-old stuck in hospital for that long is ridiculous.  The members of her family are exhausted fighting for what should be rightfully available for their mother.  They are at their wit's end.  They are doing everything they can to ensure she gets the required care.</p>  <p>  We learned many lessons during the Covid pandemic.  One is that care of our older people is far from ideal.   These issues are predominant and are only going to get worse.  There are poor standards and a lack of authority for safeguarding.  The Government says it is committed to ensuring standards and putting safeguarding on a statutory basis.  It must advance vital regulation for the home care sector and should make legislation in this regard a priority.  Delivering proper home care would reduce the length of hospital stays, the risk of hospitalisation, pressures on emergency departments and delayed discharges.</p></speech>

This year, we in Aont&uacute; have researched the number of people who are medically discharged from hospital but forced to stay there because of a lack of home care or step-down beds.  The information we have received is incredible.  The HSE told us that on a given day, there are 536 people in hospitals who have been discharged and have no need to be there but are forced to stay because there is no home care package or step-down facility for them.  This is shockingly damaging for the patients who must stay in hospital and are not getting ongoing treatment elsewhere, but it is also shockingly damaging for the patients who are stuck on trolleys in hospital emergency departments because they cannot get a bed.</p>  <p>  I have done the maths on this.  The HSE reckons it costs &euro;878 to put a person in a hospital bed for one day.  Taking the 536 people awaiting discharge, it is costing &euro;500,000 on a daily basis for the HSE to provide beds for people who have no need to be in them.  If the cost is added for the whole year, it comes to &euro;171 million to provide HSE beds for patients who have been clinically discharged.  The doctors can do no more for them.  They do not want those patients in the hospital beds; they want them elsewhere in the health service or at home with access to a step-down facility.  Not providing the necessary home care and pathways for these patients is costing &euro;171 million a year.  No matter what way one looks at it, this is outrageous.  That amount would pay for a whole lot of home care.  It is beyond time the Government ensures this is no longer the case and that the necessary investment goes into step-down facilities and home care packages to enable people to go home.  I know of people who were in hospital for more than two years after being medically discharged.  That is wrong for any patient.</p></speech>

We want to preserve people's independence and keep them out of the acute hospital system as long as possible.  However, there is a crisis in the sector, as the Ministers of State acknowledged.</p>  <p>  The first point to note is that people are living longer and their needs are becoming more complex as they age.  We must acknowledge that as a problem within the system.  However, we also know the remuneration on offer in the home care and home help sector is largely not attractive for most people.</p> <p>Workforce planning can be chaotic, particularly in regional rural areas.  As both Ministers of State know, people may have to travel 20 or 30 miles between care homes.  When their hours are added up, the number of hours they have actually spent in the household giving care is small compared with the time spent travelling.  There needs to be a pathway for recruitment and better job progression to try to attract people into the sector.  I welcome the work the Ministers of State are doing in regard to the strategic advisory group and ICPOP and also mandating an increase in pay to &euro;12.90 per hour and the payment of expenses.  All of that is progressive but beyond that, we need something further.  We need to be able to attract healthcare professionals into the sector.  Perhaps we do not even need healthcare people.  Community care is often given by people who are not qualified.  They do it as part of an arrangement in families.  In my case, our mother was cared for at home for two years under such an arrangement.  We need to try to attract such people into the sector.</p> <p> Should we ask the Minister for Finance to provide additional credits?   For the money that is paid, there are middle-aged people who might be able to provide five, ten or 15 hours of home care in their own area but will not do so because they will pay tax.  Some will end up outside a pension threshold.  We need to do something.  We must understand that younger people working in medicine will probably not choose to work in the home care model where they work in someone's home.  They want to work in the dynamic working environment of a hospital or the community care centre where they can expand their abilities and progress.  People who are middle-aged are happy where they are.  They have finished their working life and would be happy to get involved.  An initiative like that would be the best outcome from tonight.</p></speech>

More than 907,000 people are currently on a public hospital waiting list.  The situation is so severe that hospital consultants are constantly warning that these treatment delays in care could put thousands of patients at risk of dying.  Earlier this year, it emerged that a staggering 236,000 people are on separate waiting lists for scans and diagnostics.  In overall terms this suggests that as many as 1.2 million people or almost one in every four people are currently awaiting hospital treatment.  This is frightening and beyond belief.</p>  <p>  I also highlight what is happening in the constituency I represent.  I do not know about the rest of the country but I know a share about Kerry.  We all know the best model of care is to have those who can do so stay at home.  That is the best place to be if your body is good enough.  However, people need help and assistance.  That is why we have home help hours.  In Kerry people are being allocated home help hours of one hour a day or half an hour or three quarters of an hour in the morning or the evening but there is nobody to provide it.  I am not blaming the Ministers of State or anyone else for that.  I mean no disrespect to anyone coming to this country but there are an awful lot of people coming to Ireland every day.  Surely be to God, some of them could work in this sector.  Surely some of them would be able to take care of older people.  Would they not be delighted with the money?  Would it not give them a purpose and a place to go to work?  There is nothing wrong with work.</p>  <p>  I thank the people in Kerry who work in our district hospitals and larger hospitals.  I thank the staff and management from the bottom of my heart for the work they do every day on behalf of the good people in County Kerry.</p></speech>

This is not their choice or the choice of their families.  I am aware of many elderly constituents who are in hospital awaiting discharge but because no home care package has been put in place and due to a shortage of home care staff, they are forced to stay in hospital.  This in turn puts a strain on the hospital system, creating a shortage of urgently needed medical beds.  As the weeks go by, the recruitment process is getting more and more challenging.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that home care assistants are required to have a FETAC level 5 qualification or equivalent.  In my constituency of Cork South-West there are no opportunities to acquire this qualification in an evening class.</p>  <p>  One idea that should be explored is earn as you learn, which describes a concept combining study with practical experience, thus enabling individuals to gain the knowledge and skills required to pursue their chosen occupation.  Similar to an apprenticeship, this concept gives the participant the opportunity to gain practical skills in the workplace while earning a wage but also to study towards completing a FETAC level 5 qualification.  I envisage that an apprentice would accompany and shadow a qualified home help on her daily visits to patients, while at the same time freeing up another qualified home help and in this case increasing the home care workforce.</p>  <p>  On many occasions when we inquire about a home help for someone, we are told there are no home helps or hours available and then we are told by the home helps themselves that they can do extra hours but will not be given them.  Why is this going on within the HSE?  Respect would go a long way with home helps because the reason we can get no home helps in many cases is the roster.  They need time off but instead they have an hour here and there, day in and day out.  In many cases, they do not get a couple of days off.  This will not attract young people who would love to do home help but would like to go out a night or two when they are off.</p>  <p>  All is not well with home helps but a great deal could be done if everyone was willing to work together towards a solution.  This crisis is a national emergency for all of us.</p></speech>

Elderly people have a natural desire to stay in their homes as long as they can.  It would surely benefit the State if they could be treated and minded in their homes as they should be.  Many elderly people have a fear of going into a nursing home or a long-stay hospital bed because they fear it is the departure lounge they are going into.  They dread that.</p>  <p>  There is humanity in people.  I have had several people call me to say they have been allocated home help but there is nobody coming out.  Family members are also ringing.  They are doing their best to keep their elderly relatives at home.  I have suggested asking these new arrivals into our country from Ukraine or wherever.  People with cars and those with good English should be enticed or at least asked.  God damn it but they have two hands, two legs and a head like we do.</p>  <p>  I worry when elderly people go into hospital and family members cannot go into see them, as has happened.  It broke my heart during Covid-19.  People died alone in nursing homes and hospitals while their relatives could not go in.  I can honestly say that some of them died of hunger because there was nobody to spoon the food into their mouths.  That actually happened and I know it.  If I am driven to it, I will tell where it happened.  I only talk about what I know about.  Do not impose restrictions on family members going into hospitals or nursing homes any more, for any reason.</p></speech>

I am aware of many cases where an elderly person is trying to care for a son or daughter and a home help is out sick.  We can all be out from time to time but when there is no replacement for the home help, people are let down very badly.</p>  <p>  Something needs to be done in regard to recruitment and retention.  If we are to address recruitment and retention issues for home carers, we need to offer better pay and conditions.  Mileage, which has been brought to my attention, is a huge issue for home helps.  They are doing fantastic work but they are stretched.  There are not enough of them.  That is the issue and I would like to see it addressed.  In community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8 the plan is to deliver more than 2.3 million hours of home support this year, of which 580,542 hours are planned for counties Laois and Offaly.  Unfortunately, the reality is much different.</p>  <p>  I commend the Carers Association of Ireland and Family Carers Ireland.  The latter has pointed out that caring for people in their own homes and maintaining their independence and dignity are important.  This is what people want and value and it saves the State money.  If pay and conditions were addressed and more home helps were recruited, we might get somewhere.</p></speech>

How many more people per day have been seen by a case officer or consultant?  What service agreements are in place?  Are we getting value for money?</p> <p> The issue around disability services comes from not having a level playing field.  Organisations such as St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, Enable Ireland and St. Gabriel&rsquo;s Foundation are voluntary agencies funded by the Government.  As a consequence, they are constantly competing for the same staff who are acquired by the HSE, where there is a proper progression system.</p> <p> Other Deputies in the Independent Group spoke about home help.  I spoke to a young mother who is a home help.  She gets one day off a week in the middle of the week.  She works seven days and then gets one off because the organisation she works for is competing with the HSE whose staff are being paid more money for doing the job.  The likes of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, St. Gabriel&rsquo;s Foundation and Enable Ireland are possibly doing double the work for less money.  They are doing much more on the ground and they are voluntary organisations.  Their staff are getting paid less, getting less mileage and everything else and there are fewer improvements in their systems.  However, they are doing more work.  These people do Trojan work around the country.  However, staff are being snapped up by the HSE after being trained by those agencies.  That is a big problem.  We need to look at recruitment and also retention within those services.  They need to be paid well for what they do, the same way HSE staff are being paid.</p></speech>

It is important that this crisis in home care be discussed openly and as often as possible.  It is one of the many areas of healthcare that are affected by the recruitment and retention crisis and it is playing havoc with people&rsquo;s health, particularly that of elderly mothers and fathers.</p>  <p>  I support the 12 demands set out in the motion calling on the Government to resolve the issue, particularly the demand to "modernise the tendering and funding model for providers of home care to prevent a race-to-the-bottom in costs and quality, to be underpinned by a collective agreement on employment standards in the sector that ensures a level playing field, high care standards, and fair remuneration for workers."  I also support the amendment from the Social Democrats, which "further calls on the Government to set out, before the 31st December, 2022, a timeline for full implementation of the 16 recommendations in the Report of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Health Care Assistants".</p>  <p>  A woman contacted me last November when a home care package from the company Care for Me, which had been place since May 2017, for 31.5 hours per week was suddenly withdrawn on 17 September last year.  No other agency took up the care package due to lack of capacity.  The daughter was given a list of agencies to ring herself to see if she could source private care.  Around the same, a number of people rang into a well-known radio show on RT&Eacute; with similar heart-rending stories.  She had to get family and private care, etc., to help keep her mother at home.  This case was raised with the Minister.  Throughout December and into January, the daughter was left abandoned to care for her mother.</p>  <p>  I have also just recently been contacted by one of the hundreds of families who have been given caring hours but cannot access them.  The email I received was from a daughter, whose name I will not give.  She wrote that the biggest problem she has is that her mother is very unwell and in chronic heart failure.  At this point in time, she continued, her mother is getting quite anxious and distressed and desperately wants to come home.  All the family is asking is that somebody can come in the morning to shower and dress the mother and in the evenings to help her get ready for bedtime.  The 21 hours have been approved from the HSE.  Surely, she asks, it is in the interest of the HSE not to be paying huge expenses in a nursing home when all the family is looking for is 21 hours.  At this point in time, it is a matter of urgency for the mother to come home where she can get palliative care as well.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue two weeks ago.  Yesterday, I got a call from the daughter saying that the only home care the family could get is from one company that is willing to provide 12 hours.  They just cannot manage that and really need 21 hours of home care.  </p>  <p>  This is only one of many families who are desperately waiting for home care hours to come through.  The Minister of State has committed to a great deal but these 6,000 people have been allocated hours they are not getting.  The situation the families concerned find themselves in is horrendous.  I strongly support the motion.</p></speech>

I also thank the Social Democrats.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister of State commissioned the report of the strategic workforce advisory group and that it was published in a relatively quick timeframe.  I welcome the work that went into the report and its 16 recommendations.  The Social Democrats tabled an amendment simply seeking a timeframe for the implementation of these recommendations.  The Minister of State did not address that.  Perhaps I missed it when I was listening in my office.  Is that not the most basic thing?  The report refers to the international problem of recruiting care workers and the multiplicity of reports.  Here we have a pretty good report.  I do not agree with all of the recommendations, but I will come back to that.  I probably do not have time now but perhaps I will discuss that in another forum.  It is disappointing not to have a timeframe for the implementation of the report's recommendations.  It would be helpful for trust if the Minister of State could tell us when that will be done.</p><p>This Government inherited this problem.  There is no doubt about that.  This model came from the Progressive Democrats.  I had the privilege &ndash; or torture &ndash; of sitting on the health forum for ten years of my life.  I watched the dismantling of the public health service and what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to as the commercialisation and corporatisation of our health service.  That process was led by the Progressive Democrats.  I do not even hesitate in saying that their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>was to privatise everything and that is what we have now as a result.  I think the private-public ratio of nursing homes now stands at 80%:20%.  This report sets out the percentage in relation to direct and indirect care and of course the higher percentage is for the indirect care.  It was confirmed the Government is paying &euro;27 an hour to companies to enable them to make a profit when that money should be going to direct care.  That started with the Progressive Democrats and it is now way past time we changed that.  Part of the problem was the model.</p><p>Some 96% of carers are women and 43% are over 60.  If 97% or 96% of carers were men, this problem would simply not exist.</p></speech>

We will always need beds, respite beds and step-down facilities.  That it could be contemplated that this facility would be closed is simply intolerable.  I know things have progressed a tiny bit but we were given many different contradictory excuses, such as that hands were tied by the union, there was a lack of staff and a lack of demand.  Yet, all of the time, there were beds in the hospital being occupied.</p></speech>

For many families, this is a priority.  Indeed, many families are trying to provide home care either part time or full time and they find it exceptionally difficult to do so.  Many are struggling.  As more and more people live longer and demand for home care increases significantly, this is the issue.  Everybody wants to remain in their own home.  We want it for our parents and elderly relatives and we will want it for ourselves.  This is the problem we are facing.</p>  <p>  It is great to see the Minister of State this evening.  In her intervention, she stated she had increased home care hours.  However, she also said demand is increasing at pace and, despite the progress she has made, many people and their families are still unable to access the home care they need to support them.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister of State on her action in regard to the new tender for private home care providers, which she said will include the payment of the living wage and mileage allowance.</p> <p>I fully endorse the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Connolly, in that regard.  It is totally unacceptable, however, that home care workers travel from home to home, sometimes long distances in rural areas, without payment for mileage or an allowance for the time spent travelling.  Caring and home care are valuable work and salaries and conditions commensurate with their value must be paid.  If that is not done, they will continue to be undervalued and people - men and women - will not enter the profession.  I agree it is an overhang of the fact that caring was seen as women's work, carried on behind closed doors.  That is the reason salaries are so low.  Caring must be seen to be, and be, a fulfilling career.  Right now, that is not the case.</p> <p> As many Deputies have stated, the reality of home care in many cases is that even when a package is allocated - and it is not easy to get an allocation - perhaps of half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening, there are no carers to do that work seven days a week.  A person might get four or five days.  There is often no cover for holidays, such as bank holidays, or if a carer or someone in his or her family has Covid.  In many cases, that is the reality and there are many families who are really struggling.</p> <p> The programme for Government committed to the introduction of a statutory scheme to support people in their own homes.  I could be wrong but my understanding was that such a scheme would be in place by the end of the year.  When will that scheme be in place?  When will there be an entitlement to home care?  When will that be put on a statutory footing?</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will be issuing a timeline in respect of the strategic workforce advisory group recommendations and has already commenced work on some of the recommendations.  I acknowledge the input of all Deputies who contributed.  It is clear that we all have a strong desire to ensure those who need a safe and regulated home support service in a timely manner have access to it.</p><p>I will speak first about what the Government is doing to address some of the immediate challenges we face and then speak more generally about what the Government has achieved so far, with all the extensive reforms that are taking place.  Home support is a priority for the Government.  The population is growing and ageing, and that means the demand for home support services increases every year.  I am pleased to state that funding has kept pace with this demand.  As noted by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, we have provided an additional &euro;200 million for home supports since 2021.  This is a 42% increase.  Next year, the overall budget will be in excess of &euro;700 million.  This will go towards progressing the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  It will also deliver approximately 24 million hours of home care in 2023, more than ever before.</p><p>The Government is working to ensure that people with disabilities are enabled to live an independent life of their choosing, just like any other person, in line with Transforming Lives, the disability reform policy.  Year on year, the HSE has consistently increased the number of hours of personal assistant, PA, service delivered to people with a disability.  The national service plan for 2022 outlines the HSE's commitment to deliver 1.7 million hours of PA services to 2,587 people.  I sought a sixfold increase in the budget of 2022 to ensure we would have such funding for it.  This reflects an additional 120,000 hours of PA services in 2022 to expand and enhance supports for people to live self-directed lives in their own communities.  This is the single biggest increase in PA hours in the past ten years.</p><p>It is not often that I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith but it is important that we reflect on her portrayal of how home care should be delivered.  It is how I envisage it within disabilities.  Deputy Nolan also spoke in the same vein.  It is about giving hours to family carers so that they can support people within their communities while they are awaiting more long-term supports.  When people are discharged from hospital or if there is a need or an acuteness within a family setting, they would have a blanket number of hours to support families with disabilities in that manner.</p><p>However, it is increasingly difficult to find workers to deliver all this care.  Having listened to the commentary this evening, I make the point that it is not just the section 39 organisations that have an issue; the HSE also has an issue in this regard.  I make the point to Deputy Cullinane that what I have tried to do in recent months is to look at the whole framework.  In the context of disabilities, if it were possible to abolish the current framework, I would throw that framework out the door, start again and make all the recruitment agencies take responsibility in the context of certain things that when we have on the critical skills list, such as a required standard of English, and also the qualifications needed to deliver of PA and home support in disabilities.  That work in respect of the skill sets should be done when the provider or recruitment agency is seeking staff abroad rather than when the staff arrive in Ireland or when there is a time lag on it.  Another reason for abolishing the whole framework piece is that it is restraining us from making progress.  The whole tendering process in that regard is too much of a quagmire.  If it was abandoned, and given that we know the requirements in delivering PA and home support within disability, we would see a sizeable cosmic shift in that space.  It is something on which I am working with the HSE.  It is slow to move but we will get there.</p><p>As regards pay and conditions, it is important to recognise that one of the recommendations is for rolling recruitment campaigns by the HSE but, even though the terms and conditions are better, the HSE is struggling to recruit.  That is why I speak about the family carers model.  It is closest to home for the delivery of care.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I have discussed <i>ad nauseam </i>the possibility of the HSE providing that care in as close a circle as possible.  Rather than people travelling 20 miles or 30 miles to deliver care, there would be a far more structured and streamlined delivery of care and it would be far more manageable.  It is the way that home care was done back in the day and there were far better outcomes from it.</p><p>Preliminary data for September show there are 6,255 people assessed and awaiting a carer to become available and seven people waiting for processing for funding approval.  From that, we can see that funding is not the issue; it is actually manpower on the ground.  It is important to note that the number of people waiting across both categories was reduced from 9,000 to 6,226.  The current waiting lists are predominantly made up of people who have been approved for support but are waiting to be assigned a carer, so it is clear that funding is not an issue.</p><p>On the reform of home care supports, the programme for Government commits to the introduction of a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality regulated home care.  The Department of Health is currently developing a regulatory framework for home support providers with the aim of ensuring that all service users are provided with high quality care.  This will comprise primary legislation for the licensing of home support providers, regulation that will set out the minimum requirements a provider must meet to obtain a licence and, last, the HIQA national standards.  We have to remember we are delivering this in people's homes.  We do not need to over-regulate it from a HIQA point of view, such as requiring that door frames have to be a certain width before we can send in a provider.  We have to be realistic, agile and pragmatic in our support.  The heads of Bill are currently being drafted by the Department with a view to bringing the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.  Regulations are at an advanced stage.</p><p>Throughout the development of these regulations, the Department has sought full participation of home care providers, trade unions, NGOs, international colleagues, academics, health and social care professionals, families and, most important, the service users themselves.  For example, in August the Department completed a public consultation on the draft regulations.  A report on the submissions received is currently being compiled by the Institute of Public Health and will be published shortly.  The findings from the consultation will inform amendments to the regulations.  This will ensure the regulations are ambitious but achievable.</p></speech>
