What procedures are in place for children in situations of immediate risk and-or neglect in their homes?  Is there a process of engagement between the HSE, Tusla and the Department for Children and Youth Affairs for immediate intervention when neglect has been identified as a serious concern?  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.  As the Minister is aware, I am highlighting a typical case to show there is a complete breakdown of these services in my area.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200003#A00700"><p>I thank Deputies Rabbitte and O'Rourke for this important question.  I will address the issue of children in situations of immediate risk first and then I will address the issue of neglect.</p>  <p>  Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases.  Tusla, when alerted to a child at immediate risk, for instance a young child left alone at home or abandoned, will contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if the child needs to be removed from the situation.  The Garda may, under its section 12 powers in the Child Care Act, remove the child from danger and Tusla will then receive the child into its custody and, following an assessment, may apply for an emergency care order.  Tusla has emergency foster placements available for such situations.</p>  <p>  Where a child is identified as being at immediate risk from an adult, Tusla will identify if the child can be protected from that person by their parent or by the removal of the adult posing the risk.  In such situations, Tusla will consult with relevant professionals to share information and to develop a safety plan for the child.  If a child cannot be protected in their home, Tusla will apply to the courts for an emergency care order.</p>  <p>  In cases of child neglect, a comprehensive assessment is needed, often involving a number of professionals, and progress needs to be tracked over time.  Neglect is more common than physical abuse or sexual abuse, although there is evidence that children who are neglected may also suffer from physical and sexual abuse.</p>  <p>  In neglect cases, parents will be supported to improve their parenting, and parental problems that contribute to the neglect will be identified for intervention.  Parental substance misuse is a key indicator of risk for children.  This was highlighted by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in his report on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a feature in some cases that an immediate improvement may not be sustained, which is why it is important for the child's situation to be monitored over time.</p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, concerns should be reported to Tusla.  Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, the Garda should be alerted without delay.</p></speech>

This is another such case - I came across a case involving a similar experience before Christmas.  I will focus on this case and the problem with the breakdown of the services in this area in Kildare and particularly in Kildare North.</p>  <p>  On 29 January, both the school and this lady's sister contacted the HSE and Tusla to raise grave concerns about the neglect of and the risk to the children because the mother was using drugs in the home.  Four weeks later, they have had no engagement.  There was only one call from a person within the service to say she was on holidays and she would deal with it when she came back on 19 February.  That is nearly a week ago and there is still no engagement.  Today, the sister has intervened and taken the children into her care without any legal guardianship or any legal proceedings, meaning there is no legal cover.  At any time the mother could come for those children and take them back into her care.</p></speech>

The only contact was with Tusla and the HSE four weeks ago in which the school and the lady's sister outlined grave concerns and risk for the two children aged 12 and 15.

This is serious, especially for the sister who is caring for the two children without legal guardianship.  There is no carer follow-up for the mother.  This is one case.  I highlighted another to the Minister's office and to that of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, before Christmas of a 15 year old on suicide watch.  That person was in the care of the State but on two occasions was allowed to go off unattended.  The person went missing for five days and was eventually found by garda&iacute;.  I am highlighting this case.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time to go into others but there is a major problem with the delivery of the services in my area to help families and children at risk or being neglected.  This is not a once-off.  Sometimes, when I raise matters with Ministers they say that it is an isolated issue but this is not.  There is a pattern, as these two cases demonstrate.  There is concern that we are not getting delivery of services.  I hope the Minister will take up this case and ensure that services are delivered for families who need them.</p></speech>

He is doing a fine job.  The Deputy suggests that there is a pattern.  I will investigate that and come back to him about it and about the very vulnerable families who need the assistance of the State.</p></speech>

Following Tusla's appearance before it on 19 October 2017 in respect of the examination of its 2016 financial statement, the committee made a number of recommendations.  These covered the following areas: ensuring that service level agreements are in place for 100% of grant-funded agencies; ensuring that current weaknesses relating to procurement are addressed; ensuring that timelines are established for the implementation of an action plan with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to improve inter-agency co-operation in the area of child protection; and ensuring that Tusla supports An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in implementing recommendations in a timely manner.</p><p>When I issued the performance statement, which is a statutory communication from the Minister to Tusla, in November 2017, I brought specific attention to similar concerns.  I also requested early progress on the research being commissioned and managed by Tusla regarding actions taken following the invoking of section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Officials from my Department requested a written update from Tusla on 1 February 2018 with regard to the specific recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s periodic report.  Tusla provides grant-aided funding to 986 separate organisations.  These include national organisations in receipt of over &euro;7 million annually, as well as organisations in receipt of less than &euro;1,000 per annum.  Tusla has confirmed that it has put in place processes to achieve better compliance on the part of grant-aided organisations.  It has, however, also identified that it will take some time to achieve 100% compliance in this area.</p><p>Tusla is making progress in improving its procurement arrangements.  This will assist with proper planning and evaluation of Tusla&rsquo;s requirements and will facilitate timely and appropriate procurement exercises to be carried out, ensuring good governance and value for money.  In addition, a procurement training programme is being implemented for key personnel.  I will deal with the audit by Dr. Shannon, special rapporteur on child protection, in later questions but I am pleased to confirm we have had substantial engagement with key stakeholders on his key recommendations.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, made a number of recommendations and I am working with the special rapporteur and Tusla to ensure that they be fully implemented.</p><p>I will be dealing with the audit by Dr. Shannon in detail in later questions.  I am pleased to confirm, however, that I have had substantial engagement with the key stakeholders on Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s recommendations.  This has included visits to locations recommended by the special rapporteur and others in order to develop a model so that children who are sexually abused receive more child-friendly services.</p><p>The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, also accompanied our delegation, which comprised personnel from my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on these visits.</p><p>I will continue to work to progress the various recommendations in Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report.</p></speech>

She will agree that some of the findings were very worrying when it comes to public money being spent and whether there has been proper oversight by Tusla.  I specifically refer to paragraph A.21, which indicates that Tusla could not identify where &euro;700,000 was spent.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had to figure out where the money was spent, which is absolutely incredible.  Who is overseeing the process to which the Minister refers?  Does she believe we will see a significant improvement in the context of next year's report?</p></speech>

It is Tusla's executive and board.  Ultimately, my oversight is provided through ongoing quarterly meetings with Tusla's board and executive on these matters.  In the context of the Minister's oversight of Tusla, there is a process to identify, in a performance statement, the priorities and concerns from our Department for the agency for the upcoming year.  This is what we suggest it needs to focus on in particular.  With the performance statement, I have highlighted all the different areas, including the specific matters raised by the Deputy, on which Tusla will focus an improvement plan.  I have also identified that it should implement actions for all those areas, including the value-for-money aspect of expenditure.</p></speech>

I recognise that efforts are being made to rectify many of the difficulties faced by Tusla and they are historical.  I nevertheless have concerns.  I understand that Tusla has said some of the issues are legacy problems, such as the &euro;5.2 million paid in respect of non-competitive processes, including private foster care, interpretation services, insurance and agency staff.  Given all the concerns we have, does the Minister have confidence in Tusla overseeing the process?  I understand that there is a three-year procurement plan in place.  Is the Minister happy with that process?</p></speech>

I have identified that Tusla has in place a number of plans relating to the report.  There is a section in my Department working with Tusla on oversight and the provision of support, as well as use of moneys being properly expended.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to procurement.  The management of Tusla is establishing procurement support within the agency.  It is developing a three-year procurement plan for the agency in conjunction with the HSE's procurement service in order to identify the key procurement requirements of the agency.  It is also incorporating a procurement training programme which is being implemented for managers, budget holders and relevant staff with responsibility for non-pay expenditure.  Not unlike other major organisations throughout the public sector and beyond, procurement is absolutely critical, and Tusla has identified a number of programmes to ensure that improvement will happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200004#B01500"><p>I am pleased to say we are making good progress in preparing for the delivery of the affordable child care scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, I reported on the matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 24 January 2018 and our work continues intensively.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the affordable child care scheme is dependent on the development of a supporting information technology, IT, system.  The request for tender for the IT system has been published but until such time as an IT developer is in place and agrees a delivery timeframe, it is not possible to confirm and communicate a definitive start date for the scheme.  However, for the purposes of planning and procurement, the scheme's project team has produced estimated target dates, which are set out in the published request for tender.</p><p>These dates involve the system being available to accept applications from the end of May 2019, with subsidies being paid from September 2019.  I am committed to updating Deputies, the public and child care providers regarding the expected timeframe as the project progresses.  It is important to note in the interim that enhanced child care schemes and subsidies introduced last September will remain in place.</p> <p> The Government delivered on its commitment to make child care more affordable from September 2017 by introducing these enhanced measures.  Currently, over 67,000 children, that is 96% of estimated eligible children, are benefitting from these measures, which include both universal subsidies for children under three and targeted subsidies for those on lower incomes or in training.  The door remains open for more families to apply.  In other words, many of the immediate benefits for parents of the affordable child care scheme have been fast-tracked without compromising on the rigour and time needed to develop and launch this major new scheme.</p> <p> Alongside the development of the affordable child care scheme IT system, we continue to make good progress on other elements of the affordable child care scheme.  For example, the Childcare Support Bill has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> When I reported to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 24 January last, I noted that the full affordable child care scheme would mark a radical redesign of the legal and technical infrastructure underpinning our support for child care in Ireland. </p></speech>

It is welcome to hear good work is going on behind the scenes.  It is important as well to acknowledge that ICT at the very beginning, before the affordable child care scheme, was always under pressure within Departments.  When we added extra Departments it of course put on extra pressure.  The Minister has outlined certain timelines.  However, the timeline regarding the delivery of ICT concerns me.  If we do not have that timeline in place, while the legislation is working its way through, I cannot see how this will work seamlessly for the providers in September.</p>  <p>  That also sets another red flag for me.  I do not wish to be a doomsayer, but if it is not sorted out with a proper timeframe that would indicate to me it may not be ready for delivery in September 2019.  When I think back, it was disappointing the pressure child care providers were already under in August 2017.  The Minister did put in hours to support them in respect of time worked in their offices.  However, it is nearly two years since the affordable child care scheme was launched and, unfortunately, I am still waiting to hear that it will be ready to go for September.</p></speech>

We agree on that.  We are now in a tender process in respect of development of the ICT system.  We expect to identify a successful vender to commence the development of the system.  It will take approximately 25 weeks so that will bring us to July.  We hope that will put us in place.  If we manage that it will bring us on time in that regard.</p>  <p>  However, as I indicated earlier, it will only be after we appoint a company or organisation to develop the system that we will be clear on confirming when we can deliver the affordable child care scheme.  As soon as I know that, the Deputy and her colleagues will be the next to know.</p></speech>

There is a 25 week process for the successful tender.  It is from then a company is appointed to design and deliver the system from July.  I live in the real world as does the Minister.  I am a realist.  That tells me it will be the end of July, possibly, and more than likely we will not have an ICT system up and functioning for 21 August and the roll out of the affordable child care scheme.  The tenders will only be coming in at the end of July.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I think I referred to this earlier.  As of September 2018, the current procedures for applications from parents and working with providers will be the same as 2017.  That is not the fully formed affordable child care scheme we are all waiting for.  As I have emphasised before, providers have done an incredible job working with us in order to put in place and fast track interim measures to ensure a huge percentage of our families and children are benefitting from the subsidies that we announced.  We have made an effort to compensate the providers for that.</p></speech>

All persons running a registered early years service and those employed as child care staff are mandated persons under the Act.  All early years settings have until 11 March 2018 to develop their child safeguarding statement. </p><p>I am aware this is a significant responsibility and my Department has put in place a range of supports to assist services to meet their statutory obligations.  Child protection training has been funded by my Department for the last three years as part of the national early years Children First programme.  Over the three year period, 15,000 individual child care workers have already availed of training.  My Department will continue to support this programme actively.</p><p>Other supports my Department has made available include distribution of the revised Children First guidance to all 4,500 early years services; the publication by Tusla of a suite of resource documents relating to Children First; the production by Tusla of a comprehensive 90 minute basic Children First training programme universally available on line, free of charge; briefing sessions held nationwide with services; the development of a child safeguarding statement template which has been distributed to all early years services; and the provision of &euro;18 million in programme support payments in 2017, to be repeated in 2018, to support services with the administrative demands associated with Government schemes and meeting legislative requirements, including the production of policies and procedures.</p><p>Further to these supports, my officials are currently developing a national continuous professional development plan for the early years sector.  This will seek to identify the sector's training needs, target existing learning resources to support the sector in meeting its regulatory requirements and look to increase investment in supporting the workforce in its professionalisation journey.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>It is important to note the early years sector is different to the primary or secondary school sectors in that services are privately run or operated by community or not for profit services.  My Department is not the employer.  It provides a range of supports through capitation payments and other initiatives or schemes to support the sector.  The response of the child care sector to the Children First legislation has been extremely heartening.  I know from many conversations with early years providers across the country that they take their responsibilities in relation to Children First very seriously and I look forward to continuing this engagement.</p></reply>

We also accept ongoing education and training is vital, especially in the area of child protection.  There are difficulties in retaining staff within the sector.  Many providers have spoken about this.  Early Childhood Ireland, ECI, showed 86% of its respondents were concerned that difficulties recruiting and retaining staff would impact on the viability of their service.</p>  <p>  There are two specific requests.  I asked the Minister about the financial support that will be provided for in-service training.  Will the Minister give approval for ECI services to close for the purposes of developing their child safeguarding strategy while retaining their funding so that they will not be penalised for closing?  Will the Minister also provide additional funding to facilitate full day care services to develop their child safeguarding strategy and provide child protection training for staff, as happens currently in respect of both our primary and secondary schools?</p></speech>

However, as I outlined in my response, we provide a range of supports through capitation payments and other initiatives and schemes to specifically support the sector.  There are no current plans to follow a similar path to that of the Department of Education and Skills in that regard.  The early years sector is different in nature and construct from the school system.  I am aware of the challenges that entails but many registered services are small or one-person operations and their closure with a consequent lack of child care on the days concerned would have significant downstream effects for children, parents and the wider economy.  My Department is not the employer.  It respects the rights of private or not-for-profit businesses to make their own decisions regarding service closure and to meet training requirements and, rather, is concentrated on a range of other supports, as outlined in my reply.</p></speech>

There is a proper requirement on all those working with children to have completed child protection training.  It is funded for teachers in primary and secondary schools and it makes no sense that it is not funded in the child care sector, particularly as people working in that area are so poorly paid relative to teachers.  Funding is provided for teachers to undergo this training but the Department is not providing it for those working in the child care sector, where wages are pretty abysmal.  People in the child care sector are entitled to the same level of respect as teachers for the work they do.  Will the Minister reconsider the possibility of providing specific funding to enable them to undertake this training?</p></speech>

I hope that the efforts and supports we have identified and provided in an ongoing and flexible manner demonstrate our respect for the sector.  I am aware of the issues raised by the Deputy because I also hear of them from the sector.  Although I would love to be able to provide for the measures suggested by Deputy Shortall, as she is aware, the early years sector has a differently structured form of provision; it is not a public service or a set of public services and, therefore, I do not have the same capacity as the Minister for Education and Skills to say a school can close because it is a public service.  That is what I am trying to identify.  I am not saying I do not aspire to being able to implement these measures------</p></speech>

In particular, the Act provides for the adoption of any child, regardless of the marital status of his or her parents.  It also provides for the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in respect of any matter, application or proceedings under the Adoption Act 2010.  The Act also provides for the views of the child to be ascertained by the Adoption Authority or a court and for those views to be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</p><p>In 2017, I signed the commencement order to give effect to the provisions in the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.  All provisions of the Act other than section 24(1)(<i>a</i>) were commenced on 19 October 2017.  Section 24(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that before making an application for a child to be adopted because of parental failure, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, must be satisfied that every reasonable effort has been made to support the parents of the child in question.  This provision came in to operation on 1 February 2018.</p><p>I regard the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 as important and progressive legislation.  It makes adoption a realistic option for children of married parents, where appropriate.  It allows the High Court to dispense with parental consent to adoption in certain circumstances and provides for the adoption of a child by civil partners and co-habiting couples.  Importantly, the Act allows for the adoption of a child by his or her step-parent, without the previous requirement for the child's other parent to adopt his or her own child.  This provision addresses a very unsatisfactory situation that prevailed under the earlier legislation.</p><p>The legislation has been enacted and commenced.  It is an important milestone and I am proud to have been the Minister to bring it through both Houses.  I am very appreciative of my colleagues in this House and the Seanad who supported its commencement and implementation.</p></speech>

Analysis of the Adoption (Amendment) Act was carried out following the adoption of the Act by the Houses in 2017.  There have been calls for the introduction of semi-open adoptions.  What is the Minister's perspective on semi-open adoptions, whereby birth families have ongoing contact with adoptive families and there would be contact between the adopted child and his or her birth family?  Does the current Act allow for that, would it require further legislation or has the Minster given thought to the issue in light of the analysis that took place at a conference hosted by the Adoption Authority of Ireland in November and attended by the chairperson of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and other representative bodies which espoused that view?</p></speech>

I attended the conference to which he referred.  His specific question regards a more open approach to the adoption process, that being either semi or fully open.  These issues have been on my mind and in my heart since beginning work on the Adoption (Amendment) Act and, in particular, as we have been working on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2017.  Many of these issues were raised in the context of the Adoption (Amendment) Act but we had to refer most questions regarding the openness of our process to be considered and dealt with in so far as possible in the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  These are complicated issues upon which to move.  I believe that the process should be as open as possible and, as Minister, I have pushed that view as far as I can.  We are currently working on amendments to the Bill that will be brought forward on Committee Stage.  It has been a challenging process.</p></speech>

We must challenge our institutionalised thinking regarding how adoptions work and the relationships that follow therefrom, which are quite structured.  I appreciate that the Minister is giving some thought to the issue.  I am unclear as to whether there will be a move on this issue on Committee Stage of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.

We continue to work on a couple of challenging areas, although we may have progressed them as far as is possible without meeting the barrier of constitutional requirements.</p><p>That is the first point.  I hope it is clear enough.</p> <p> I wish to comment on another issue relating to the Adoption (Amendment) Act raised by the Deputy.  There is an outstanding issue, not relating to that Act but to the Children and Family Relationships Act.  A section in the latter needs to be commenced in order to allow for both members of a same-sex partnership to be registered as parents of their child.  That is being worked on in the Department of Health as we speak.  The Minister for Health hopes to be in a position to lay the order before the Houses as early as possible this year.  That remains outstanding.  It relates to what we were doing with the Adoption (Amendment) Act but the provisions are in the Child and Family Relationships Act.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200007#E00500"><p>I assure the Deputy that the enhanced subsidy proposed under the affordable child care scheme will not be limited to parents in full-time work or education.</p><p>The Government policy on the new affordable child care scheme was informed by evidence with the best interests of children and families in mind.  When introduced, the affordable child care scheme will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, especially lower-income families and lone parents.  It will be available to all families and not just those working full-time or studying full-time.  I will explain this further.</p><p>Support for labour market participation as a route out of poverty is central to assisting low-income families and lone-parent households.  Consistent with this objective, participation in work, education or training by parents will determine the maximum number of hours of subsidy available under the new affordable child care scheme.</p><p>When parents are engaged in work, education or training, they will be eligible for what we call an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  The enhanced subsidy of 40 hours per week will be awarded to parents in full-time or part-time work, including those on zero-hour contracts as well as those in full-time or part-time education and those participating in labour market activation programmes.  Indeed, it is my intention to define work and study in regulations made under the Bill in broad inclusive terms to recognise the diversity of progression routes to labour market participation.  As such, it is not the case that the enhanced subsidy of 40 hours per week will be limited to parents in full-time work or education.  That is my point.</p><p>When parents are not engaged in any form of work, education or training, child care will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to 15 hours per week.  This reflects international evidence that the child development benefits of early childhood care and education are, in most cases, realised through this level of participation.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>I am committed to keeping this aspect of policy under close review.  Indeed, I plan to commission further research exploring the labour market status and child care needs of those currently using child care services, especially in disadvantaged communities.</p><p>There is a small but important group of families for whom child care is needed on child welfare or child development grounds or for whom child care is necessary as early intervention support.  Where this is the case, a referral system under the affordable child care scheme will ensure that families will automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income, work or study test.  Schedule 2 of the Childcare Support Bill lists five statutory bodies with which the Department of Children and Youth Affairs may make agreements on referral procedures for such families.  My officials are currently in discussion with relevant statutory bodies on how this referral process will operate under the affordable childcare scheme.</p></speech>

The latter is much appreciated.  I intend to focus on one point relating to the Childcare Support Bill.  Subsidies will be paid on a 48-week basis.  Some child care providers operate on a 52-week basis.  Is there scope to change this?  Is the Minister planning amendments to provide the scheme on a 52-week basis?  If the subsidy was averaged out over 48 weeks, it would represent an increase for some of the families I have in mind.  I know the Minister will agree with me in this regard.  Perhaps it is something we should consider.  Child care providers do not operate for 48 weeks and close their doors for four weeks.  That is not how they run their business model.  Most provide full-day child care facilities and operate for 52 weeks.  Is the Minister considering any such amendments?</p></speech>

Obviously, it relates to the current work of the Department and providers trying to average out the 48-week period to a 52-week period.  As we move to the affordable child care scheme, I can understand how that would be an issue with regard to the determination of the subsidy on the basis of how much parents work or for how long they are in education and training.  The enhanced subsidy is dependent on the hours.  Deputy Rabbitte's question relates to the basis of hours over 52 weeks rather than 48 weeks.  Many of these issues are being worked through and dealt with in the regulations, including the definitions of "work", "study", etc.  I will bring that excellent question to my officials, who may have an answer already.  We will get back to the Deputy or we will take a look at it in the context of that work.</p></speech>

I tabled amendments to the Childcare Support Bill in recent days on the basis of recommendations from organisations, including Barnardos, to address the 48-week period rather than the 52-week period.  I am hopeful of the Minister's support for those amendments.  Perhaps when the Bill was being devised, consideration of best practice meant people looked at a period of 48 weeks rather than 52 weeks.  It could be a genuine oversight in the way the Bill was produced.  This has now been identified as a concern for those on whose behalf I have articulated the point.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to hear about the enhanced subsidy for zero-hour contracts.  That is welcome and I compliment the Minister in that regard.</p></speech>

We will take a look at them.  As indicated, I have acknowledged the proposal of a 52-week period as against a 48-week period and how we need to be flexible in terms of provision.  From the perspective of my Department, supporting child care financially, and figuring out our rules accordingly, is important.  We have done it in the past and we need to do it in future.  I have indicated that some of this will be dealt with in the context of regulation, as distinct from in the Bill.  We need to take a look at it more clearly.  I accept that the issue identified by Deputy Rabbitte, our colleagues and advocates in the sector is key.</p></speech>

A range of responses are in place to support children in completing school, and the school completion programme is key among them.  The programme provides learner-centred and holistic supports for young people who are at risk of leaving school early.</p>  <p>  I believe the programme has played an important part in the achievement of our high rates of school retention.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to prepare a school completion strategy, as noted by Deputy Mitchell.  I am working to examine how best to bring about improvements and reforms of the system.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the school completion programme delivers a valuable service for some of our most vulnerable young people.  It is, however, in need of significant reform in terms of governance and organisation to ensure that we optimise the outcomes for our young people.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, the board of Tusla convened an expert panel to identify and examine a potential revised model of good practice and governance of the school completion programme.  The panel examined how industrial relations and human resources issues relating to school completion staff could be resolved to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The expert panel concluded its work.  When I examined the findings, I decided to carry out some further discussions with a number of other stakeholders.  To that end, I hosted an informative school completion consultation event in Farmleigh on 29 January last.  The event was attended by a representative group, including school completion programme co-ordinators, school principals, academics with expertise in educational welfare, representatives from the voluntary sector and officials from several State bodies.  The matters discussed included best practice and governance within the school completion programme.  A range of views were expressed.</p>  <p>  Following the Farmleigh event, I asked the facilitator for the day to do some additional work.  I hope to bring proposals for reform of the programme to Government in the coming months.  I have deliberated carefully over this process.  These issues are complex.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills is collaborating with my Department on a scoping exercise and data analysis which will inform the development of our strategy for the future.</p><p>Above all, we are moving toward significant reforms of the school completion programme with this strategy.</p></speech>

It provided supports for children who had issues in school and particularly children who were likely to leave school early.  We have to acknowledge what it did.  It included supports in school, after-school programmes and summer camps.  It does fantastic work and makes a difference in young people's lives.  The co-ordinators in particular deserve praise for the difference they make to parents' and children's lives by making school a happy experience for students.  The school completion programme operated well under DEIS but it has suffered a reduction in the budget as well as the removal of three national co-ordinators under Tusla.  This means that workers have no direct advocate or link with Tusla.  My colleagues and I spoke to people involved in this and there has been very little communication with Tusla.  It is very difficult for these people when it comes to budgets.  The funding has been cut.  I acknowledge the work the Minister is doing but can we have the lines of communication opened again?</p></speech>

We need that kind of communication in the context of the reform programme that we are moving towards.  I have met with a number of school completion co-ordinators not just in my own constituency of Dublin South-West, but in other constituencies and regions in my travels, Kilkenny being the most recent.  Members of the newly-named public service union, F&oacute;rsa, have indicated in their communication that they are deeply appreciative of the event I hosted in Farmleigh on the school completion programme and the wider gathering of stakeholders.  Many constructive things happened there and, as a result, I think we are better informed to determine the reform approach.  Once that is ultimately decided, that will influence the investment required.</p></speech>

Issues such as target lists, if deemed too ambitious, can hinder the allocation of a budget.  Until a proposal is suitable to Tusla, no budget will be allocated.  I find it extraordinary that, if we have a scheme that has been too ambitious, the committee will not get its budget.  We have to look at this.  I welcome what the Minister is saying.  Will we be updated regularly on the Minister's progress?  When does she expect a date for the completion and implementation of the plan?</p></speech>

That may be inclusive of some of the commentary that the Deputy is identifying.  I will probably need another couple of months to agree those reforms because I will be consulting some young people on this and looking at what comes back from that event.

I will also answer the Deputy's question relating to Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  I am fully aware of the context of the constituency that the Deputy so ably represents.  Some officials from the Department of Justice and Equality are co-located in the IYJS.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, will reply in written format to the Deputy about them.</p>  <p>  The number of employees of my Department working in the Irish Youth Justice Service at end of each year and to date is as follows.  At the end of 2014, there was a headcount of 11 people and a whole-time equivalent number of 9.8 people.  The whole-time equivalent number stood at 8.6 at the end of 2015 and was 9.6 at the end of 2016.  It was ten at the end of 2017 and stands at 9.9 today.  The whole-time equivalent number of people reflects the fact that some staff in the headcount do not work full-time, so it is a stronger representation of the actual workforce.  On the roles of these staff, there are two principal officers supported by teams from my Department in the IYJS.  One principal officer has responsibility for policy relating to Oberstown Children Detention Campus, including the provision of safe and secure custody for children.  The second principal officer has responsibility for the development of standards and policy for the delivery of safe care for children in Oberstown and youth justice services.  The supporting team consists of three assistant principal officers, one higher executive officer, two administrative officers, two executive officers and two clerical officers.</p>  <p>  The numbers employed in Oberstown Children Detention Campus in the years the Deputy requested are as follows.  There were 233.58 whole-time equivalent employees in 2014.  The number of whole-time equivalents in 2015 was 215.03.  It rose to 248.5 in 2016, there were 245 staff in 2017 and at present there are 241 staff.  Recent fluctuations in these numbers are a reflection of temporary timing issues in filling vacancies.</p></speech>

What is the Minister's current view on the HIQA report, which found that there was serious non-compliance with two of the main areas investigated and moderate non-compliance with six areas?  I know that Mr. Pat Bergin reported to the committee here that the campus is licensed to accommodate 54 young people.  The Minister has just given us the staff numbers.

There are significant issues in that they have not been able to move out of the prison context.

In Kildare, we have two fantastic family resource centres, Newbridge and Curragh Pride.  However, for a county with 220,000 people, Kildare only has the two centres.  County Kerry, with a population of 147,000, has 12 centres while Donegal has nine and Mayo, seven. When compared to these counties, one can see the necessity for two new family resource centres in Kildare.</p></reply>

I have increased the budget for these centres from &euro;13.5 million in 2017 to just over &euro;16.5 million this year.</p>  <p>  Tusla administers the family resource centre programme.  Applications to the programme opened on 23 October 2017.  The final deadline for receipt of these applications was 20 December 2017.  Tusla has confirmed that it has received a total of 43 applications, two of which are from County Kildare.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently assessing all applications.  Applicants will be notified of the outcome of the assessment in March.  In assessing the applications, Tusla has indicated its evaluation process will take account of a range of factors, including the size and population of the catchment area, the degree of economic disadvantage in the area, the existing distribution of services in the area and the ability of applicants to deliver good outcomes for children and families.</p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the establishment of 11 new family resource centres, I am making additional funding of up to &euro;10,000 available to each existing centre.  This will take account of service needs in each area.  Tusla local offices will be happy to work with each family resource centre in this regard.</p>  <p>  Family resource centres play an important role in supporting children and families in local communities.  I was pleased to be able to make additional resources available to support them in 2018.  I look forward to the outcome of the process now under way which will lead to the provision of 11 extra family resource centres under budget 2018.</p></reply>

However, there are only two centres in County Kildare.  Two excellent applications have been made for resource centres in Athy and Kildare Town.  The Kildare town applicant, Teach Dara Community and Family Centre, exemplifies the grassroots response to local needs and encapsulates the spirit of the family resource centre programme.  It has demonstrated commitment, innovation and the harnessing of available resources to operate a de facto family resource centre for several years.  Sarah Shakespeare and her team are waiting for this opportunity to formally be accepted into the national programme.</p>  <p>  The need for a properly funded family resource centre is undeniable in Athy, a town experiencing high levels of intergenerational disadvantage and isolation as well as being a designated RAPID area.  The applicant, Athy Community and Family Centre, has proven community connectedness through John Delaney and his team.  It has experience of operating a local community development programme and currently operates a community child care service.  It has its own premises and already supports a range of existing local initiatives.</p>  <p>  Both of these are family resource centres in everything but except name, funding and support.</p></speech>

The Deputy has put forward his arguments that these applications meet the criteria I have outlined.  Ultimately, Tusla makes these decisions and recommendations to me.</p>  <p>  From my ongoing work with Tusla&rsquo;s executive and board, and as I look at the different issues in the programmes providing services for children and families, I note family resource centres are an integral aspect of the work of Tusla in the community.  The way in which communities take the initiative and show leadership in this regard is also important.  We want to utilise those resources more as we move into the future.</p></speech>

I understand the role Tusla plays and she has highlighted the criteria it will use.  The reason I feel passionately about this is because County Kildare is often misunderstood.  As Deputy Durkan who is beside me knows, it suffers from a perception of affluence.  That means the county's pockets of deprivation suffer from low levels of funding for mental health and youth services.  When the Department gets a little more money coming out of the recession, it needs to raise every boat.  We do not get many opportunities to redress this.</p>  <p>  Kildare has two family resource centres.  Other counties which have two family resource centres include Offaly, with a population of 77,000, Cavan, 76,000, Carlow, 50,000, Longford, 40,000, and Leitrim, 32,000.  The two resource centres in question will provide the good outcomes which Tusla seeks.  They are both in areas of economic disadvantage and need support.  Will the Minister support me in this case?</p></speech>

Working in partnership with the State, they are the best way to move beyond economic and social disadvantage.  That is why my heart, as well as my actions, are committed to family resource centres.</p><p>All I can say is that there were 43 applications and I was able to get money for 11 new family resource centres, which is the first time we have increased the number of family resource centres for quite some time, but I am committed to looking for additional investment for 2019-----</p></speech>

I published the action plan on 28 June 2017 and since then I have had ongoing engagement with Dr. Shannon and Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, about the implementation of these actions.  It is a key aspect of my work in respect of both Tusla and its co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am happy to report that progress is being made across all 15 actions of the plan.</p>  <p>  I will give Deputy Rabbitte some indications of that progress now.  Significant progress has been made with the appointment of a dedicated, co-located national manager from Tusla to work with the Garda national child protection unit.  This role will improve inter-agency working in difficult cases and will help to identify any blockages to co-operation at an early stage and agree solutions.  As An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to roll out its local child protection offices, there will be further opportunities to co-locate staff and to monitor the effectiveness of this approach.</p>  <p>  Closer joint working between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being progressed by the work of the national strategic liaison committee.  That is the forum where senior managers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla work together on issues of mutual importance to their two organisations.  Through this committee actions on cultural change, joint working, and information sharing are being progressed.</p>  <p>  I am also currently progressing the co-location of services to children who have suffered sexual abuse.  I have established an interdepartmental group with the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality, to identify and develop a bespoke Irish model for the provision of these services.  This follows the examination I and my officials have made of international models of best practice in this type of service provision.  While these actions do not arise directly from the audit report, the development of such a multi-agency approach will contain learning which can inform service development.  We have progressed actions in a number of other ways in terms of that audit and I can refer to those later.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the roll out of the child protection offices and co-location.  In her response I would like her to explain co-location in a little more detail.  The issue is about out-of-hours services from Friday evening at 5 p.m. until all services kick in again on a Monday morning.  Do social care workers have access to the files?  We spent some time on an earlier question discussing the ICT system.  How can social care workers access files?  How can they communicate with other people to understand a family situation if it is a first-time referral and whether it is repeated?  I do not believe the Garda currently has the resources, manpower or training to support the Tusla workers.  In how many areas around the country has co-location been rolled out and what training is being provided to the Garda?</p></speech>

One issue is the development of procedures that enable that to happen.  The focus is particularly on the child who has suffered some form of sexual or other significant abuse to reduce the trauma of her or his experience and telling the story of that and offering, as much as he or she can, an identification of what has happened and that professionals who need to hear that story are in a similar location and can work together in order to reduce that trauma for the child but also work more quickly to develop a plan to move him or her beyond those experiences.  We are moving towards the development of a model which we will eventually decide on and roll out.</p></speech>

One of the issues identified in Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report related to repeated incidents at weekends, once a month or every three months concerning alcohol addiction and violence within the home.  In such cases, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na felt they had no option but to go into homes as there was no out-of-hours service and the only recourse was to put children aged three, five, seven, ten or 15 years of age into the back of a Garda car and take them to the local Garda station and mind them until the situation blew over.  That part of the report is not as in-depth as the Minister outlined but that is the reality of what we are experiencing at the moment.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon highlighted the issue very well.  It is the here and now I am talking about and how we are going to address that.</p></speech>

This is an issue on which Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working together to identify reform in terms of streamlining the three existing national services.  Out-of-hours services are available in four major cities and we want to augment that as we move forward so that there is a plan of action in relation to those issues.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that Deputy Rabbitte has raised the issue in the context of the co-location model because when we make decisions on a new way of offering those services, probably in particular dedicated locations, the out-of-hours issue is integral to that as well and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I have made capital funding available immediately for this purpose and I have also secured &euro;250 million for child care facilities under the national development plan in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  Each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to child care services in Ireland, including capacity.  The most recent early years sector profile for 2016 to 2017, indicates that existing child care provision continues to meet the needs of the nation's parents in terms of capacity.  The survey process which informs the sector profile will re-engage with child care providers again in the coming months to provide a further updated picture.  In the meantime, my Department continues to advance a number of measures to ensure that parents can access high quality child care.</p>  <p>  In 2018, I secured &euro;6.86 million for capital investment in child care.  Under the early years and school age child care capital programmes, providers can apply for funding for new child care places, with maximum grants available of up to &euro;50,000.</p></speech>

Pobal provides services in the areas of programme specification and design, business system specification and design, customer service, case management, funding decommital and recovery, contract management and compliance.

The services it provides to my Department are managed under a multi-level governance framework, specifically service level agreements, programmes of work and individual programme agreements.  The high-level terms of the relationship between Pobal and my Department are set out within these agreements.  These outline Pobal&rsquo;s legislative obligations and the oversight arrangements in place.  Pobal is also subject to the revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies, relevant circulars and the terms of the corporate framework under its parent Department.</p>  <p>  The services Pobal delivers to my Department are formalised within programmes of work on an annual basis and are not subject to public procurement requirements.  Finally, the cost of Pobal&rsquo;s delivery of services to my Department is also agreed on an annual basis by individual programme areas and is subject to review and ongoing scrutiny to ensure value for money for the Exchequer funding. </p></speech>

An internal audit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs completed in March 2014 examined the role played by Pobal and found some serious problems.  I acknowledge the Minister was not in office at the time but I have to hand a copy of the audit report and it is pretty worrying.  It states those involved understood that the Department employed Pobal without a tender process and that this approach had not been formally justified.  The audit authors went on to state they did not know whether, if legally challenged, this contract with Pobal would be in line with EU directives.  From a business point of view it seems unlikely that best value is achieved by dealing with one supplier without the benefit of a competitive tendering process.  The Minister stated that Pobal is exempt from the requirements of the EU procurement directives and is not subject to a tendering process.  Can she tell me whether legal advice was sought ?  When was it obtained?  Will she be willing to publish it?</p></speech>

It has provided an important, flexible and responsible service to our Department.  We also plan to commission an independent review of the operating system for child care, because that is where we invest most money in terms of Pobal, and to determine whether reform is required.  From a governance perspective, as the child care budget increases it would be preferable to have a closer statutory relationship with the administrator of the child care funding.  That is looking to the future.</p></speech>

We have not seen the legal advice on that.  Does the Minister not think that not seeking tenders and dealing with one contractor is bad business?  In 2016, &euro;204 million was disbursed via Pobal on behalf of the Minister's Department.  Even though Pobal is a State agency, it does not do this work for free and charges fees.  It was paid &euro;13.5 million in 2016 for this work.  It is supposed to be a not-for-profit charity.</p>  <p>  The EU directive states that contracts greater than &euro;135,000 must be advertised and a competitive tendering process carried out.  This has not happened.  We wrote to the Charities Regulator, which said it will examine all of these bodies, including charities which are statutory bodies.  Pobal obviously falls under that category.</p>  <p>  We have examined public procurement by Departments and State agencies and the number of breaches of EU directives and guidelines is scary.  Last week I raised the issue of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Accenture.  Accenture was paid &euro;26.5 million in 2016 alone and there has been no tender since 2009.  The Government must be losing money by not insisting on tendering processes.</p></speech>

As I understand it, a review will be conducted on the structure of the charitable status of Pobal, which is another question the Deputy raised.</p>  <p>  We are following legal processes which are in consonance with the law.

I refer specifically to reports of the backstop commitments being taken out of the withdrawal agreement and put into a separate protocol.  The phase I agreement signed in December provides for three layers of protection against North-South border controls.  In December, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste described these as bullet-proof, rock solid and cast iron, and we all hope they are right.</p><p>The first layer of protection was a commitment that the UK economy would remain fully aligned to the EU economy but the UK Government has repeatedly stated it will not do this and its position on this issue has been hardening in recent weeks.  The second layer of protection was that the UK Government would propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland but these have not been forthcoming.  Indeed few outside the UK, or probably even the UK Government, believe that such unique solutions exist.  In the last few days, the European Union's chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, stated:</p><blockquote>It is important to tell the truth.  A UK decision to leave the Single Market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.</blockquote><p>He made that statement, as the Minister knows, in regard to Ireland. </p><p>With the first two layers of protection probably gone, we come to the final layer, the so-called backstop.  The Irish Government's view is that this backstop is unambiguous and comprehensive, ensuring there will be no North-South border controls now or at any stage in the future, but many believe that there is wiggle room within what was agreed in December.  Indeed, the UK Government has a much narrower, more minimalist interpretation of what it signed in December.  I have put Ireland's view of the backstop directly to three UK Ministers and all three refused to accept Ireland's view as to the comprehensive nature of the backstop.  </p><p>As of last week, the EU was creating legal text to give legal power to this backstop in order to include it in the withdrawal agreement.  In the last 48 hours however, Ms Jennifer Bray of <i>The Times</i>, Ireland edition, reported this is no longer the case and the legal text for the backstop will now be taken out of the withdrawal agreement and put in a separate protocol.  Bloomberg reported that this protocol would sit alongside but outside the withdrawal agreement.  While protocols can, of course, be legally enforceable, in an interview just this week a Conservative peer, when warning about the loss of rights that might happen in the UK, said the following; &quot;The Government [he was referring to the UK Government] does not intend to take into English law the protocols of European Union laws&quot;.  That interview took place in the last 48 hours. </p><p>Moving the backstop out of the withdrawal agreement and into a separate protocol feels like a political fudge.  We all hope it is not but that is what it feels like.  The backstop may be the only protection left against hard border controls on the island and it feels as though it has just been weakened.  I therefore wish to ask the Minister the following questions.  Is it true that the legal text for the backstop is being taken out of the withdrawal agreement to sit in a separate protocol?  If that is true, why is it being done?  Does the Government believe that this represents any weakening of the backstop and protections?  Finally, with two of the three layers of protection gone and questions arising on the final one, is it fair to say that the December agreement could no longer be described as bullet-proof? </p></speech>

The Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss Brexit with the British Prime Minister when they met in Belfast last week.  On that occasion, they both reaffirmed the two Governments' shared commitments to the December agreement on Irish issues.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Donnelly correctly outlined, work on developing the withdrawal agreement, including the relevant and important sections on the Irish issues, is very much ongoing.  These provisions were welcomed, including by the Deputy, when they were achieved in December.  They are very important to this country and must be delivered on in full.  The Irish Government is continuing to work very closely with the EU task force on implementing the commitments that were made in December through the withdrawal agreement.  This includes the fallback or default scenario.  We expect this backstop option to be given full legal effect as part of the withdrawal agreement.  At this juncture it is not appropriate for me to comment on exactly how these issues are reflected in the withdrawal agreement, a process that is still ongoing and is at a sensitive stage.  However, we as a Government are in very regular contact with the task force, and I can tell the Deputy, the D&aacute;il and more importantly the Irish people that we are fully satisfied with how these issues are being managed.  We are fully satisfied that full legal effect will be given to the December agreement in any withdrawal agreement.</p>  <p>  I will now specifically address the Deputy's two questions.  Yes, we are fully satisfied that full legal effect will be given to the backstop agreement.  This is not just an agreement between Ireland and Britain but an agreement between Britain and the EU.  Through our very regular contact and ongoing engagement with the task force we are satisfied that the agreement must be honoured in full, and we expect that to be reflected in the withdrawal agreement. </p>  <p>  On the second issue, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the commentary of individual Members of the British Parliament or individual members of the British Government, because Ireland is not negotiating with Britain.  Ireland is negotiating as part of the EU task force.  The EU task force is negotiating with the British Government.  We should take encouragement as citizens from the solidarity being shown to Ireland by EU member states.  My colleagues the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and indeed all members of Government continue to highlight the importance of Irish issues to EU colleagues.  We are very encouraged by the fact that we have seen so much solidarity from other member states.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that we are at a very sensitive stage in the negotiations, and I appreciate that a very sensitive and complex discussion is going on in the British Government, upon which it would not be appropriate for me, as a member of the Irish Government, to comment.  However, the Irish Government is satisfied that full legal effect will be given in the withdrawal agreement and we do not see any question of that being in any way watered down, diluted or changed.  </p></speech>

We all hope he is right, because the backstop could be the last protection against border controls, which obviously nobody in this House wants to see, in common with most people on this island.  I would like to ask a clarifying question and then move on to one or two other questions.  When the Minister said that the backstop will be given legal effect in the withdrawal agreement, is that in answer to my question of whether it will be in a separate protocol?  In other words, when he says it will be in the withdrawal agreement, is it therefore the case that it will not sit alongside the agreement in a separate protocol?</p>  <p>  My second question regards sanctions and enforceability, because we all know what is likely to happen.  There will be a legal text somewhere, be it in the protocol or the withdrawal agreement.  Fianna F&aacute;il's firm view is that it must be in the body of the main withdrawal agreement and not in a separate protocol.  The UK is likely to engage in different tariffs, different regulatory issues, and put pressure on the Northern Border.  It is likely that we will come to a stage where the EU rules that a certain measure cannot be introduced, because it would force it to put border controls around the Six Counties.  The British government is likely to disagree, arguing that it has not imposed border controls so it has not infringed on anything.  Obviously the UK will not sit within the legal jurisdiction of the EU.  To what enforcement body is the Irish Government expecting to have recourse, and what types of sanctions will be available?  Moreover, to repeat the clarification, is the Minister saying that the backstop will not be in a separate protocol?</p></speech>

The bipartisan way in which we have approached Brexit is important.  It is also important that, at this sensitive stage, our approach is maintained.  We have shown that when we approach issues of national importance in a bipartisan manner, we can achieve great things for this country.  It is important to maintain that in respect of all our commentary and engagement on Brexit.  To that end, the Government remains entirely committed to engaging with the Opposition and to keeping the Deputy, as the Brexit spokesperson of his party, and other party representatives briefed.</p>  <p>  The Government's position is that full legal effect should be part of the withdrawal agreement.  At this sensitive juncture, it would be inappropriate for me to elaborate or to be more prescriptive regarding what is an ongoing negotiation between the task force and the British Government.  The British Government is meeting on this today but we expect to see a full, legally enforceable agreement and all the protection that comes with that.</p>  <p>  The Government has two jobs to do in the context of Brexit.  The first is to get the best possible deal to minimise Brexit's effect on the people.  Brexit is not a policy in this country but it is a huge challenge for us and we need to examine how we can deal with it.  Second, we must put in place the domestic policies to Brexit-proof our economy and society.  A number of measures have been introduced by Ministers in recent days.  This process is at a sensitive and important stage but we expect to see full legal effect as part of the withdrawal agreement.  We will certainly continue to engage in a bipartisan manner on this issue.</p></speech>

I have been a strong advocate of the regulation of vulture funds.  Indeed, the Minister, when he was Minister of State at the Department of Finance, dealt with the 2015 legislation proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in the context of the regulation of vulture funds.  I introduced legislation last year to regulate these funds but we need to be clear regarding what that would and would not do.  If any party wants to support our legislation, fine.  If a party wants to introduce its own legislation to bring about the desired end, we will support it without question.</p><p>We need to insert a little honesty into the debate.  Regulation of vulture funds will not stop the threat of repossession.  The only thing currently stopping the regulated banks from repossessing properties <i>en masse</i>is the potential impact on the long-term return on their investments and the effect on their reputations as companies operating in communities in which they are looking for business.  That is not how vulture funds operate.  They are only interested in short-term turnaround and quick profit.  These funds, regardless of whether they are regulated, have no interest in reaching solutions with homeowners and no interest in restructured loans or interest only payments.  There is no incentive for them to behave as members of society.  They are not bound by the same sense of community.  They are ruthless and, therefore, the sale of Permanent TSB loans to vulture funds puts 14,000 families and 4,000 renters in an extremely vulnerable position.  There is no doubt that if it proceeds, there will be large scale repossessions, regulated or not.</p><p>The impression is now being given publicly that by simply regulating these funds, mortgage holders will have some magical protection that they do not currently have.  That has made the situation even worse because it has created a pathway for banks which heretofore would not have sold to vulture funds to do so .  The impression now is that if these funds are regulated, it is okay to sell to them.  That is simply not the case.  The Government can do something about this.  Families and renters are watching these proceedings and hoping and praying that the Government will stand up to the vulture funds and stop this sale.  If we are honest about this then stopping the sale is the only way to prevent mass repossessions.  The Taoiseach said it would be illegal to direct the banks not to sell loans.  That is fair enough but it is not illegal for the Minister for Finance or, indeed, the Government to inform the Permanent TSB of the position of its major shareholder, namely, the Government.  Indeed, that is not even unprecedented.  On previous occasions, the Minister for Finance brought in representatives from the banks in respect of the tracker mortgage scandal and high interest rates and outlined the Government's position.  The Government is refusing to do that in the context of this matter.</p><p>Does the Minister accept that simply regulating vulture funds will not provide additional protections to the 14,000 mortgage holders and 4,000 renters if their loans are sold to such funds?  If he does accept that, will the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, call in the banks to tell them what Sinn F&eacute;in has been asking them to do for the past number of years, namely, not to sell long-term products such as mortgages on family homes to vulture funds that only have a short-term interest?</p></speech>

I accept his bona fides on this.  He has raised this issue for many years.  As a Government, an Oireachtas and, indeed, a country, we have to work our way through two issues.  The first of these is how to protect mortgage holders and the second is how to ensure that we have a functioning, stable banking system, not for the banks but for citizens who need access to mortgages and credit for their farms or small business or who need to put money on deposit and know they will get a decent interest rate.  How do we work our way through those two issues?  I am conscious that many mortgage holders are worried and concerned.  Taking out a mortgage to buy a home is the biggest financial commitment a person will ever make and to think that there could be uncertainty or lack of assurance over that can only give rise to concern.  Like the Deputy, the Government is eager to work with everybody in the House to find a way forward and to work out how we can provide maximum certainty, clarity and assurance to mortgage holders while we continue to minimise repossessions.  Many Members talked about mass repossessions only being around the corner, but, thankfully, that never came to pass.  They also said that mortgage arrears would continue to increase but these have fallen quarter on quarter for many years.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance said yesterday - and it is the appropriate and prudent thing to do - that he has asked the Central Bank to provide further advice and guidance to him on the current legislation and regulation and indicate whether there is any need to improve or enhance that.  He went further and said that he is willing to work with the Opposition.  He had a constructive meeting yesterday with the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on finance and a Bill will be introduced by our colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Kevin "Boxer" Moran.  The Deputy also has suggestions.  There is time because these loans have not been sold.  They have not gone on the market and the Minister for Finance has not yet been consulted.  There will be time to engage on the matter in this House and there will be time for the Minister to be consulted by the bank.</p>  <p>  We also have to be truthful with people, however.  We have to acknowledge the fact that we have a bank which, despite the recovering economy and the fact that we are almost at full employment, has on its loan book one of the highest ratios of non-performing loans in the eurozone.  We also have to acknowledge the fact that when Members interfered with or ignored regulatory advice regarding the banks in the past, the Irish people bore the heavy consequences and deep scars of that and they still do to this day.  Mortgage arrears are falling and home repossessions have been kept to an absolute minimum.  There is time to work our way through this and to achieve a balance between the two aims we need to achieve for our citizens, namely, to protect mortgage holders and provide them with certainty and assurance and grapple with ensuring that this bank, which employs more than 2,000 people and has more than &euro;17 billion on deposit, is stable and complies with regulatory advice.  We are, therefore, eager to engage.  No one has a monopoly on good ideas and, certainly, no one has a monopoly on compassion or concern for mortgage holders.  The Government will work with all parties to find a way forward.  As the Minister for Finance said, there is time to do that.</p></speech>

At my request, we have invited Permanent TSB representatives to appear before the finance committee on Tuesday next.  Deputy Michael McGrath made a similar request.  Permanent TSB representatives have told us that they have entered into confidentiality clauses with prospective buyers.  The train has left the station.  These are vulture funds and the problem is that the perception is that by simply regulating them, everything will be okay.  It will not be okay because the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which contains a suite of options, is completely voluntary in nature.  Vulture funds do not offer those options.  They do not do split mortgages, interest-only payments or arrears capitalisation.  A total of 84% of the more than 120,000 restructures that have been done so far have not involved these funds.  I want to see the regulation of vulture funds.  I want them, and not the middleman, to be punished if they break the law.  Primarily, I want to ensure that the 14,000 mortgage holders and 4,000 renters will not be thrown to the wolves.</p><p>If we are honest in this debate, and the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il know and we in Sinn F&eacute;in know, it is not simply a question of the regulation of the vulture funds.  If long-term products are sold to companies that have a three or five-year interest, it will only end one way, in repossessions.  People will be evicted and there will be more homelessness.  We cannot stand here as legislators and pretend that there is some type of magic solution.  There is a solution: the Government owns 75% of the bank.  The Minister should lift the phone and tell Jeremy Masding that the Government refuses to stand idly by while he is about to throw his customers to the wolves, just because the bank did not get its act in order over the past three years and work down those mortgages in the way it should have done.  </p></speech>

It is time to see a little bit of humility from the banks, which the taxpayers have supported through very difficult times.  They could do an awful lot worse than show a bit of humility and engage with the people's representatives.  That should happen.  It is a matter for the bank but that is my personal view.</p>  <p>  Equally, however, Deputy Pearse Doherty needs to be truthful with people who are watching today, who are worried about their mortgages, who are working day and night to pay their mortgages.

On page 92, the programme for Government states "We are committed to delivering a school capital investment programme for extensions/refurbishments [to cater for] additional school places".  It goes on to note that "Significant funding has been secured as part of the Capital Plan."  This is another promise which I can prove is not being delivered on.</p>  <p>  Two years later these words in the programme for Government mean nothing to dozens of families of children seeking to go to St. Brogan's College, Bandon.  Over the past four months these parents have been living a nightmare as their children were put on a waiting list for entering the school in September 2018.  St. Brogan's is a victim of its own success, in that the school's positive attitude and excellent staff have made it attractive to many families.  More important, subjects are suited to certain students and in an era where parents and children sit down together and choose the best school for their child with the subjects that are on offer, St. Brogan's makes that choice somewhat easier for them.</p>  <p>  All this has meant that the school must cater for more students than it has room for.  The Department of Education and Skills may have sanctioned four additional classrooms but this is all too late for the many who are at the moment being left outside the door.  One child, both of whose parents both attended St. Brogan's, and who lives only a few dozen feet from the school, across the road, cannot be taken in due to overcrowding.  This child is heartbroken as he is the only child in his classroom who did not get a place.  I spoke to another mother as late as last night who said that she is not sending her child to any other school as this is best suited for her child.  Another father cannot understand why his son cannot get a place in the school he was educated in.  These genuine stories are endless.  I am dealing with many more families in the Bandon school catchment area with extremely difficult stories who want to send their children to this school but they will not be accepted as there is no more room.  The school has written to the families to say that it cannot cater for the children but when I speak to these families they still hold out hope that their children will be accepted because they know, as I do, that this can be resolved simply.</p>  <p>  In light of the additional classrooms not being in place on time for September, will the Department of Education and Skills work with the education and training board, ETB, and the school and immediately put in train works that will put temporary classrooms in place in St. Brogan's by September, thus catering for the many children left outside the door? </p></speech>

The outline he has provided shows how important this is for many families who worry whether their child will have a place in the school of their choice, come September.  I understand that St. Brogan's is a multidenominational, coeducational second level school with a very good reputation to which many families want to send their children.  It is under the patronage of the Cork Education and Training Board.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to be able to respond positively to Deputy Michael Collins's request for interim accommodation because, as he correctly says, the Department of Education and Skills approved permanent accommodation for this school in December.  This will comprise four mainstream classrooms and two resource teaching rooms.  Once the Department approves accommodation it is often devolved to the local patron to deliver it.  The delivery of that project is the responsibility of Cork ETB.  It has been given the green light and the funding by the Department of Education and Skills and this Government.  I am very pleased that is the case.  </p>  <p>  We do need to consider what can be done in the interim.  Pending the construction of the permanent accommodation we need to see whether some interim accommodation can be provided.  I understand that the ETB in Cork has now submitted an application for interim temporary accommodation.  The Department is responding very positively to this application and has confirmed to the ETB that the classroom accommodation will be approved.  I am informed that the ETB will make arrangements to put the interim accommodation in place.</p>  <p>  I hope this will come as good news to those worried about accessing a school place but as our population continues to grow and our economy recovers and we can invest more in our public services, this Government is building more schools and providing more school places than ever before in the history of the State.  In the national development plan, our new capital plan, our vision for a new, brighter Ireland, Ireland 2040, announced last Friday in Sligo, we have enhanced and added further to that in the scale of our ambition, to make sure schools not just provide places but that they are provided with modern, fit-for-purpose facilities for physical education, PE, information and communication technology, ICT, and laboratories at second level.  We have a very ambitious plan for school building projects across the country.  As we consider what can be done in the interim in places such as Bandon, we will always respond positively to applications from patron bodies for temporary solutions and that is what we have done in this case.  I hope that comes as good news to the people in St. Brogan's College. </p></speech>

That is very positive news because this issue has been going on for quite some time.  I am always a bit reluctant to raise local issues at Leader's Questions but I have been aware of this imminent crisis in Bandon for many months and held back on going public in the hope that we could resolve it behind the scenes.  On 7 March last I first raised this in the D&aacute;il with the then Taoiseach during questions on promised legislation.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, answered saying he would reply 15 days later.  I have heard nothing from him despite making many trips to his office.  That has left many parents bewildered and on tenterhooks.  They are disappointed by a political system that looks at times as if it is hindering progress.</p>  <p>  There is a company in west Cork that would supply and put in place classrooms.  It does that all over the country.  All it needs is approval but sadly this required approval by the Department, which has been dragging its feet.  I want the Minister to make this a priority issue to be dealt with by the Department of Education and Skills.  This day next week is 1 March.  The clock is ticking.  If planning is to be sought and temporary classrooms are to be put in place by September 2018, the Government should stand by its programme and the people of Bandon.  If it does not the programme for Government will be a failure in their eyes.</p></speech>

Let me be very clear that the Government's commitment in this regard is beyond question.  During our time in office, we have prioritised investment in education, which is up by &euro;1 billion on the past two years.  Across the State, new schools are being constructed and existing buildings are being extended.  We have a very ambitious programme to expand on that activity.  In the interim, we are happy to provide temporary accommodation so that children can be facilitated in schools such as St. Brogan's college.</p></speech>

It relates to the procedure and process for the assessment of needs of children with disabilities.  The Department of Health and the HSE are breaching the law on a daily basis in this regard.  The Minister is aware that, under the Disability Act 2005, the assessment of needs must begin no later than three months after the receipt of a completed application.  I am regularly contacted by parents who find that there is a huge backlog in the assessment of needs for children with disabilities.  I have one such case before me where the parent was told that the application was received on 1 June 2017.  The parent was advised that the scheduled date of commencement was to be on or before 1 September 2017.  The parent then received correspondence confirming that the application was received on 1 June and that the child's case was discussed at a forum meeting on 20 June 2017.  The letter states, &quot; ... [the case] was discussed at the Disability Services monthly administration meeting and his scheduled date for assessment is January 2019 (based on current resources).&quot;  This means that the assessment will be completed 18 months after the initial application.  This correspondence cites increased referral rates and lack of resources as the reasons for this.  The Minister must remember that an early assessment of needs for these children is a legal obligation on the HSE, on the Department of Health and on the Minister himself.  The assessment of needs is to start within three months of application and is to be completed within three months of starting the assessment.  The Minister is well aware that these children are diagnosed as early as possible in order to ensure that proper services are available to them.</p><p>I have received further correspondence from another parent which states:</p><blockquote>As you are aware there is already a massive backlog of referrals for AON.  The Assessments of Need are not being carried out in accordance with legislation and regulations under the Disability Act 2005.  Assessments of need are supposed to be conducted in a consistent manner nationally and procedures are supposed to be in place to ensure continuity of the AON process, yet again this is not happening.</blockquote><p>Will the Minister indicate when his Department and the HSE will stop breaching the law and ensure that the assessment of needs process relating to children with disabilities is completed in accordance with the Disability Act 2005?</p></speech>

He is entirely correct; this is an area in which the State needs to do an awful lot more.  The lost decade affected the ability to recruit to and invest in vital public services and this means that we have a backlog through which we need to work.  We are committed to doing just that.  Deputy Healy will have seen that we have significantly increased the number of speech and language therapists working in local areas.  These therapists are an important part of assessment teams.  We hired 80 more last year and, under the HSE service plan for this year, there will again be an increase in the level of resources for speech and language therapy.</p>  <p>  Similarly in the area of psychology, which is an important in the context of any team that supports children with disabilities within our communities, we are going to recruit 135 psychology assistants.  This will help with that aspect of assessments.  The HSE is also currently developing its operational plan for each community health care organisation.  This plan will outline the level of service the organisations intend to be able to provide this year to people with disabilities.  Given that we have significantly increased the health budget to more than &euro;15 billion, I expect that the people about whom the Deputy speaks will see this reflected in the operational plans for their areas.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the lack of consistency regarding the geographical spread of resources.  The Deputy has touched upon this matter.  Autism, for example, is a disability issue that concerns many parents who come to my constituency clinic.  I am sure Deputy Healy sees such parents at his clinic also.  I asked the HSE to carry out an analysis of autism services assessment teams throughout the State in order to map where we have a good service and where we do not.  This is so that the resources can be put in place.  I have just received the report this week and I will now work my way through it, with the ultimate purpose to have an evidence base in respect of the location of resources.  If there are certain areas with particular backlogs and waiting lists for assessment of needs that are above and beyond the national norm, then we need to target resources in to those areas.  I have discussed this issue with the HSE and I am aware that it is a key priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  With this and the extra respite service we will see in community health care organisations, GP visit cards for carers and medical cards for all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, I hope we will make a real improvement.</p>  <p>  I accept that this is an area in which we must do a great deal more.  I will be very happy to speak with Deputy Healy directly about his community health care organisation experience and I will certainly follow up on the details of any cases he may wish to provide.  We are investing a lot more in this area and we are recruiting more staff.  Staff is the key component in these teams.  If we are to drive down the waiting times for the assessment of needs, we need to have more health professionals in our community health care teams.  This is a priority for the Government.  There will be more recruitment this year and that will build on the additional recruitment last year.</p></speech>

While I welcome his reply, it is very similar to one I received six months ago from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  The situation has certainly not improved.  If anything, it has disimproved.  Children in Tipperary are routinely obliged to wait up to 18 months and or two years for these assessments.  I put it to the Minister that this is in breach of the law.  This is not a regulation or a target.  The Department and the HSE are in breach of the law.  More importantly, they are denying young children with a disability an early diagnosis so that proper and specific services can be provided to them.  I ask the Minister to follow up on this matter and to ensure that the HSE is adhering to the law rather than breaching it.  I put the Minister on notice that I will raise this issue regularly in the future.  The situation is simply unacceptable and unsustainable.  The Minister must progress this matter in order to ensure that children are dealt with properly and speedily.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that we have to get on top of this matter and deal with it.  We are committed to doing that.  We have shown this commitment with the significant increases we have already provided to the health service this year and to disability services specifically.  These increases build on the increase in 2017.  I am aware that this is a major priority for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  We are building up services county by county to make sure there are appropriate teams in place and to reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also makes an important point about being able to access services at an early age.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is looking at how children can access services in schools either while waiting for diagnoses or without specific diagnoses.  The idea that a parent would have to wait for a diagnosis before the child could access supports such as resource hours or a special needs assistant in school is not a satisfactory situation.  We will make progress on this between the reforms being taken in the Department of Education and Skills and the extra resources being put in place by the Minister of State.  I very much look forward to our ongoing engagement.</p></speech>

I have been asking about progress on this for two years and every time I have asked about it on the Order of Business I have been told that it is being reviewed.  The Minister rightly pointed out that, thankfully, thousands upon thousands of repossessions may not have happened, though even one avoidable repossession is one too many.  However, many thousands of families, including families in our own constituency of Wicklow, are being dragged through the courts without representation.  There needs to be a place that can deal with these issues and which can protect and enforce the rights and options available to mortgage holders.  When are we going to see the legislation which would give effect to this new court?</p></speech>

I understand that this is priority legislation for the Department of Justice and Equality this session.  I expect the Deputy will see progress on it in this session.

As the Minister will be well aware, the Good Friday Agreement has come under attack in recent days from the hard Brexiteer wing of the Tory party and other reactionary voices in Britain.  In that vein, I welcome the comments of the T&aacute;naiste yesterday during his visit to the United States.  He said that Brexit cannot undermine the hard won gains of the peace process.  That is very much to be welcomed.</p><p>As reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today, the British Government appears to accept the need to stay within the Single Market and the customs union for at least another two years.  Will the Minister accept that the best way to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement is to ensure that the North stays in the Single Market and the customs union full stop?  Will the Government now press for that as part of securing designated special status for the North within the European Union?</p></speech>

The Government has made very clear its preference for continued customs union between Britain and Ireland.  The best way to protect the interests of the people of Northern Ireland from Brexit is to re-establish the institutions in Northern Ireland.  I know this is a view that the Deputy and I share, as do the Government and the Deputy's party.  I note that the leaderships of both the Deputy's own party and the DUP met with the British Prime Minister yesterday.  It is the Irish Government's priority that there would be engagement with a view to re-establishing the institutions in Northern Ireland to make sure that the people of Northern Ireland have a voice at this crucial time.  I welcome the fact that, despite comments from some elements within the British establishment and media, the British Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have been very clear in their support of the Good Friday Agreement, support shared by the Irish Government.</p></speech>

Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised this issue on Tuesday only to be told by the Taoiseach that a process of appeals has been put in place.  I have examples of specific cases.  In one such case a person in Mallow named Catherine Carroll has gone through the appeals process.  As we speak, she is in excruciating pain such that she has said, "It&rsquo;s gotten to the stage where I&rsquo;ve asked the doctor is it possible to cut off my nerve endings, because, even though I&rsquo;d end up paralysed, at least I wouldn&rsquo;t be in pain".  That is a real person.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, if the Government will give time in this House to further discuss this issue.  People have gone through the appeals process and been rejected.  They have nowhere else to go to alleviate their pain.  It is still very much a live issue.  My request is simple.  We need to have further deliberation on this issue.  There were some deliberations on it in the Seanad yesterday but we need to have the Minister before the House because there are further questions to be answered on behalf of people such as Catherine Carroll.  She is not an outlier or exception, rather she is within the range of patients who are suffering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200016#O00700"><p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising that important matter.  Obviously the ordering of business is a matter for the Business Committee.  I have no difficulty with further debate or discussion in this House.  There has already been discussion at the Joint Committee on Health, in which I participated.  There was also discussion in the Seanad yesterday in which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, participated.  I must make the point, however, that this is a clinical decision.  It has been made by clinicians in the medicines management programme of the HSE.  I would like to make it clear that there is a process for GPs to appeal.  These are real people too.  More than 850 people who do not have shingles have now been approved, which means that more than a third of people have been completely approved.  This is about the appropriate use of a medication which, in the view of the doctors and clinicians who advise me, can cause adverse effects if inappropriately used.  I want to see compassion and common sense prevail.  If it has not in respect of the case the Deputy raised, I would be happy to discuss it with him further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200016#O00800"><p>The programme for Government commits to "Improving the lives of people with disabilities".  It states, "we will support people with disabilities in maximising their potential, by removing barriers which impact on access to services, education, work or healthcare".  How does that tally with the points raised by Deputy Seamus Healy during Leaders' Questions about the massive and rising waiting lists for access to all sorts of supports?  To give one example, a seven year old in my constituency, Harry Whitaker, had an assessment of needs in June 2015.  As a result of an error on the HSE's behalf, he was not placed on a waiting list.  He made an appeal, which was successful, but he was then placed on the waiting list at the point at which the appeal was successful in March 2016 rather than the point at which he had his needs assessed.  The result is that he is still languishing on a waiting list and may be languishing there for another year or more.  He has multiple needs and while he waits, he does not have access to speech and language therapy or a special needs assistant in school.</p></speech>

If he wishes to provide me with the details, I would be very happy to look into the case.  On fulfilling the commitment in the programme for Government, measures we have taken in recent months have included a significant increase in funding for respite and home help, more special needs classes around the country, an automatic entitlement to a medical card for people in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, extra speech and language therapists working in our early intervention teams, and more than &euro;3.8 billion being spent on illness, disability and carer payments - an increase of almost 4% on the previous year.  We are making progress, but we have much more to do.  I would be happy to look into that individual case.</p></speech>

It is on the whole debacle around recruitment to the Citizens' Assembly by the polling company RED C.  At the outset, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, whom I respect, was full of praise of how the people were recruited.  However, we have now found huge flaws in the process.  One recruiter recruited seven people who were personally known to him.  It raises fundamental concerns about the Citizens' Assembly.  Eleven counties, including my own, were excluded from it.  How could that be fair or reasonable demographically?  The Minister has a lot to answer for.  This was the start of his charade.  We then had the stuffed-up committee of the Oireachtas which got him his desired answer.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Without disrespect to any of the assembly's members, the way in which the membership was chosen was a stitch-up.  It has been found out now.  The hem has fallen down on the dress and needs more stitches.  We need answers from Ms Justice Laffoy.</p></speech>

However, what reason or what gripe has the Government with people in rural Ireland wanting to build their own homes?  In this new 2040 plan, that never mentioned Kerry by the way, the Government is saying that houses can only be built in the open countryside if they do not detract from the capacity of our larger towns and cities to deliver homes more sustainably.  That is saying they will not grant or allow planning permission in rural areas.  What has the Government against people in rural areas building their own homes?  Government Deputies are in here propagating that they are going to do this and do that.  There is one report after another to deal with homelessness and to build houses.  Why are they trying to stop people who want to build their own homes?  What blackguarding is this and why is the Government against people in rural Ireland?</p></speech>

The residents and owners of businesses in Br&uacute; na Sionna in Shannon town have become the latest community to join the list of those who have discovered fire safety problems in their homes and they are now facing substantial bills due to bad planning.  Br&uacute; na Sionna is a complex of 240 units consisting of houses and apartments.  Local Shannon councillor Mike McKee told me this morning that the management company is looking for sums ranging from &euro;7,000 to &euro;28,000 from each owner to address these issues, even if there are no actual problems with his or her own individual unit.  This is disgraceful and follows numerous other issues with core building standards and fire problems across the country.</p>  <p>  Will the Government commit to bringing forward legislation to enact the key recommendation in the "Safe as Houses" cross-party housing committee report, which calls for a redress fund funded by industry and State to support those residents in homes with latent defects where the builder has gone bust and access to HomeBond has expired?</p></speech>

At the moment, I am dealing with two cancer patients who are undergoing treatment and both are being obliged to fight to get or hold medical cards.  Charles is an older man and has recently been refused, even though he is undergoing treatment.  Nora, much younger, has already fought off breast cancer and is currently fighting throat cancer.  Her card has been taken from her and she is having to fight for a new card.  There should be some humane way of allocating medical cards to people who need them.  If anybody should have one, surely Nora and Charles should.  Has the review been conducted?  If not, when will it be conducted?  Worse still, if it has been conducted, is it the reason these two people are being refused?</p></speech>

An applicant cannot lodge an application or get approval in principle on a loan to buy a site and build a home without first getting planning permission on the site.  This is further evidence of the bureaucracy that has caused every other housing initiative up to now to fail.  How can we expect a couple to spend money on securing planning permission for a site they do not own, so they can apply for a home loan for which they might ultimately get a refusal?  Surely it should be possible to get approval in principle and then require full planning before drawing down the actual loan.</p>  <p>  This is proof that the Government has more interest in rules and regulations than in getting a fully functional and workable scheme.  This requires a simple change.  I would like the Government to commit to it today.</p></speech>

The Pensions Authority wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts this morning to say that in 2009, it told CI&Eacute; that its workers' pension schemes were no longer in compliance with statutory instruments.  Despite that, the Pensions Authority allowed CI&Eacute; to ignore its statutory requirements and gave it permission to leave the workers' pension schemes in deficit.  Does the Pensions Authority have the power to overrule a statutory instrument?  Surely only a ministerial order can do that.

Currently the CCPC cannot issue administrative sanctions or penalty fines for breaches of EU and Irish competition law.  In Ireland, fines can only be imposed following a criminal conviction in courts.  Since 2014 only one such fine has been imposed, which amounted to just &euro;17,500.  However, the CCPC is &quot;strongly of the view that the current competition law enforcement regime in Ireland is not fit for purpose as it does not provide for an appropriate range of effective and dissuasive sanctions for breaches of EU and Irish competition law&quot;.  </p><p>The CCPC, in a submission to the Law Reform Commission, is strongly in favour of introducing administrative enforcement powers.  The CCPC has stated &quot;the absence in Ireland of civil or administrative fines for breaches of competition law very significantly undermines the CCPC&rsquo;s ability to combat anti-competitive conduct&quot;.  It also has stated this &quot;means that there is little deterrent effect in such cases: industry knows that it may as well try to engage in such conduct, because even if the CCPC intervenes to stop it, they are not at a loss&quot;.  In contrast, competition regulators in 21 other EU member states, including the UK, Italy, France and Denmark, can issue administrative fines, while Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Australia can also do likewise.  </p><p>Anti-competitive behaviour by big companies, acting alone or in unison, can cause significant damage to competition in sectors and to consumers.  Common forms of anti-competitive cartel activity include bid rigging and a practice known as cover pricing.  Giving the CCPC the power to impose administrative fines on corporate entities in this Bill would significantly strengthen the regulator's investigations and sanctioning in sectors where anti-competitive activity is allegedly taking place.  These powers would aid enforcement, given that the CCPC has previously investigated suspected anti-competitive conduct in the ticketing sector and the motor insurance sector, for example. </p><p>The Bill I am introducing today amends the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 by adding six new sections.  It is lazy of the Government to state it would be unconstitutional to allow an authority such as the CCPC to issue fines for prohibited anti-competitive practice.  The Supreme Court, in a Law Reform Commission report, has already recognised the need for certain bodies to be able to issue civil fines in certain circumstances.  There is precedent, with administrative financial sanctions currently provided by regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation, and the Data Protection Commissioner.  This Bill provides for the mechanism that is used by other bodies by making the CCPC confirm its decision to issue a sanction against an undertaking by applying to the High Court for confirmation of its decision.  We provide for an appeals process, both for the CCPC decision to the High Court and the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal.  This Bill allows the CCPC to issue a fine to a company of up to &euro;100 million or 10% of its turnover in most cases.  The 10% turnover figure is used in many other jurisdictions.  We look forward to bringing the Bill to Second Stage, and we seek leave of the House to do so.  We look forward to getting the legislation across the line in due course as a pro-consumer initiative.  </p></speech>

It is not written into the statutory instrument, which declares that people have the right.  It is left to interpretation.  Deputy Smyth and I seek to have that right written expressly into law in order that female Members have the same rights and entitlements as other females working in other sectors and under other work agreements.  </p><p>I know by the way the Minister of State, Deputy English, is nodding his head that he understands exactly the thrust of the Bill, which is to provide the opportunity for more females to get involved in local and central government.  It also gives us the opportunity to show the importance of a good work-life balance for females who wish to have families but who also wish to engage in public life.  I will give an example of my council, Galway County Council.  There is an understanding that if someone misses two or six consecutive meetings, depending on the chair or the interpretation of the standing order, it can be deemed that it is no longer appropriate for them to attend that particular meeting.  The thrust of the Bill is to bring clarity to the situation and provide the opportunity for more females to get involved in local and central government.</p></speech>

As I was saying last night, we know that every major metropolitan region in Europe is pulled along economically by a dynamic city at its core.  Dublin has begun to wear that mantle since the turn of this century but it would be invidious if we now came along with this kind of indicative plan, or legislative plan, which would restrict the development and growth of Dublin.  After all, Dublin is still a relatively small city by comparison with, for example, the 5 million population of Athens, the 5 million-plus in Barcelona, the near 5 million in Manchester, the 3 million to 4 million in Vienna or the 2 million-plus in Budapest.  When we compare it with what we would regard as premier division cities of the European Union, Dublin is still a relatively small city of some 1.5 million people, if we count the four Dublin counties.</p>  <p>  Although there is no reference to it in the plan, one noticeable aspect of all of those dynamic cities is that they have an elected local city leadership.  This is one thing we could have advanced and had ready for 2019, particularly for Dublin and Cork.</p><p>Dublin critically needs infrastructure across a range of areas, from health to transport to schools to housing.  At Leaders' Questions last week, I raised the urgent need for social and affordable housing in the city and the four Dublin local authority areas.  My constituency of Dublin Bay North has the longest housing list in Ireland.  The plan remains lethargic in that regard.  The delivery for 2015-17 in which the Minister was involved has not happened, or at least not in Fingal and Dublin city.  I welcome the social housing target of 20,000 to 25,000 units for 2020 and subsequently the 30,000 to 35,000 target.  We still seem to be running to stand still.</p> <p> I do not disagree with the idea of there being a more compact city in appropriate areas although the people who make these planning decisions should be prepared to live in more compact high-rise buildings themselves.  One finds that the people who make these plans live way out in the countryside in large haciendas and plan for others to live on the fourteenth floor or the fifth floor with no lift, which has happened to residents in my constituency.  The plan does not recognise the full scale of the housing crisis in Dublin.  While I welcome the national regeneration development agency, it is not the agency which I asked that the Taoiseach set up, which would have been available to look at all land.  We need close cohesion with local plans, such as the Fingal plan and the Dublin city plan in my constituency.  In the north fringe and south fringe we have had the awful situation where there was no strategic development for a new urban region, which was effectively another city the size of Waterford, and have suffered all the massive problems for the last decade as a consequence.</p> <p> In transport, I warmly welcome what I hope is the final decision to proceed with metro north.  I cannot understand why it would be delayed in any way in order to link up with the existing Luas green line.  Naysayers such as Colm McCarthy have come out already to complain about the &euro;3 billion cost of this public transport infrastructure but we will soon have one of the biggest airports in Europe and one of the few airports in a major city that does not have a fixed-line rail link to the city centre.  I welcome it because originally we were to have a northside Luas.</p> <p> Referring briefly to national infrastructure, I do not understand the lack of any plan for a motorway to the north west and why it is not a national task.  Why is the M11 not extended all the way to Rosslare given Brexit?  I support the Cork to Limerick and Western corridors as timely connective developments.  If any of these huge infrastructure developments take place it will lead to significant jobs growth but we have to worry whether the 660,000 jobs mentioned can be delivered.</p> <p> I do not have the time to raise the concerns I have on education and on the marine environment, which I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will raise himself, but on health I do not see the influence of Sl&aacute;intecare and its delivery in the plan.  The plan refers to a new elective hospital for our region.  In the northside, Beaumont has always been at 120% to 130% capacity.  I do not see why the proposed new hospital should not be somewhere such as Swords or the Swords-Donaghmede interface.</p> <p> Strategic planning for the country's future is of the upmost importance but Project Ireland 2040 would have been better had there been cross-party agreement.  There will be some legislative plans on planning regulations and so on but there should be general agreement on how we advance Ireland and make it a prosperous, peaceful and well-developed country by 2040.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200022#X00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Project Ireland 2040, our plan for our country until 2040 but particularly, for the purpose of this statement, our capital spending plan for the next ten years.  I am particularly pleased to speak about the very significant increase in capital funding for the health service as a result of this plan.  Capital funding for our health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was for the last ten years.  This is a sea-change commitment to capital investment in our health services.  It means we now have a solid, ambitious plan to build a better health service for the future through the combination of this significant capital investment programme alongside the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.</p>  <p>  We now have the opportunity to reform and modernise our health service, to deliver one that is fit for purpose, that our citizens can be proud of and that can meet the needs of our growing and aging population.</p>  <p>  The &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our health services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care and modernise how we deliver services through ehealth and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  As our population changes and ages, the way in which health care is currently delivered in Ireland will become increasingly unsustainable.  New models of care are needed, including a major shift from hospital centric to community-based care.  Significant population growth and an increase in the population aged 65 years and over and in particular aged 85 years and over, in the next ten years will increase demand for health and social care services.  The fact that people in Ireland are living longer and longer than the European average is a good thing, but we must plan accordingly to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  The Government supports the vision for a high quality, safe, accessible and sustainable healthcare system set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Implementing that vision will require concrete and well-defined steps to be taken which are prioritised, sequenced, co-ordinated and funded.  As part of this process, capital investment has a key role to play both in enhancing health service provision and as a driver of reform.  Too often we speak about current health spending but do not spend enough time discussing the important difference which capital funding can make in reforming and increasing the capacity of our health service.  Modernisation will require significant investment, including in ICT and ehealth, to underpin safer, more integrated, patient-centred care.  At the same time, as with any health system, there is an ongoing need to maintain and update facilities and healthcare equipment.  Government priorities in health capital investment supports the national planning framework outcomes in terms of plans to provide local, regional and national developments which empower rural communities and enhance urban amenities, which are outcomes Nos. 6 and 7 in the framework.  Capital investments over the coming decade will support existing Government priority projects and commitments and will enable the roll-out of new additional capacity guided by the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recently published health service capacity review.</p>  <p>  There are several drivers of the development and reform of the health services over the ten year period of the plan.  The main ones include capacity since demographic changes, including an increasing and older population, and mean that the level and complexity of health care to be provided will increase.  I will never understand why a policy decision was taken in 2007 to reduce the number of hospital beds in this country when the population was rising.  We recognised that in education there would be more children who would need school places and we provided more school places, yet bizarrely the Government of the day decided to reduce the number of hospital beds in successive years between 2007 and 2010, and they remained reduced during the recession until 2014 when they began to increase.  We need to increase capacity and the plan will deliver that.</p>  <p>  A second driver is the need to deliver strategy.  The strategy for the public health services is centred on integrated healthcare.  This involves a decisive shift towards primary care to meet growing demands.  I am pleased that this plan features &euro;810 million for primary care including investment in diagnostics.  There are many really good primary care facilities.  On Monday, I will open two more, one in Kilcock and one in Coolock, but we need to put the diagnostic equipment into them.  They must have the X-ray machines and ultrasounds so that people do not have to go to a hospital for every diagnostic test that could take place in the community.</p>  <p>  Another area is ICT and innovation.  The implementation of the ehealth strategy is required to develop the electronic records system, which enables the flow of information across various care settings.  It will also enable patients, our citizens, to be more empowered in their own health information.</p>  <p>  We also need to deliver on risk and compliance.  There is an ongoing need to maintain and update both buildings and healthcare equipment and ambulances in particular in response to critical clinical risks.  These are risks that exist in our health service which we need to fix.  Now that the country&rsquo;s economy is growing once again, we can invest in improving theatres, building ward blocks and replacing ambulances.</p>  <p>  This leads me to the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, and the recently published Health Service Capacity Review.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report has significant implications for capital investments, which I welcome.</p><p>The report strongly endorses investment in ICT and eHealth, and the Government's national development plan will provide the required capital investment in Health to fully delivery on eHealth in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report and the Government's national development plan strongly support capital investments in primary care, including community diagnostics.  When Deputy Broughan rightly asks me what will the capital plan do to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, I say it will deliver diagnostics in the community, which is a key element of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will deliver in full a very significant investment in eHealth, which also is a key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare, and will drive down waiting lists through elective-only hospitals, which is another key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  These are three key recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I note the presence of my colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, who is key on this committee to reform the health service.  We are taking three solid steps to reform the health service in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare through this capital plan.</p> <p> The national development plan will support Sl&aacute;intecare's recommendation that the outcome of the capacity review should be used as a framework for guiding future investments in health services.  When I became Minister for Health, I commissioned a capacity review.  We got it internationally benchmarked to answer the question, how many hospital beds do we need in Ireland now and how many hospital beds will we need in Ireland out to 2031, so that we could put an evidence base behind it.  It stated clearly that even if we reform the health service and implement Sl&aacute;intecare, which we will do, we still will need 2,600 more hospital beds by 2031.  I am delighted that this capital plan will deliver all of those beds four years ahead of schedule.  We will deliver, and fully fund, the capacity review by 2027.  Obviously, now we need to look for opportunities to front-load that and I have already asked the HSE to examine what front-loading could be done in this regard.</p> <p> We need continued investment in primary care facilities and the development of community diagnostic hubs and our ageing population will require the delivery of significant additional step-down and long-stay facilities.  In this plan, we are not only delivering more hospital beds and more diagnostics in the community.  I am pleased that we will also provide an additional 4,500 community step-down beds and long-stay facilities for our older citizens to get people back to the community and out of the acute hospital setting where they have no wish to be once they have received their medical care.  Those additional 4,500 community beds are on top of the refurbishment and replacement of community nursing homes which is already under way.</p> <p> We will deliver new elective-only facilities: one for Dublin, one for Galway and one for Cork.  The idea here is that high-volume low-complexity procedures - many of the procedures for which people wait on the waiting lists - can be dealt with through elective-only facilities where we are decoupling scheduled and unscheduled care and the pressures of both.  What we are doing here is learning from other jurisdictions.  We are learning from Scotland where they put in place an elective-only facility and managed to dramatically reduce their waiting times.  It took them ten years to get the waiting time down to 12 weeks but they did that, and they made incremental progress.  I do not want Members to think we have to wait ten years for things to happen.  We need to make incremental progress, each month and each year, until we can get to where we want to be.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is a ten-year plan, elective-only facilities are the way to deliver it and the Scottish people and health service have shown us how we can do that.  It is envisaged that these facilities will be sited adjacent to general hospitals and I will now ask that the HSE put in place a process to identify where best to locate these facilities.  I would like these to be up and running as quickly as possible.</p> <p> There are a number of major projects which will be delivered over the lifetime of Project Ireland, including the new national children's hospital at St. James's campus.  People have been talking for decades about delivering a children's hospital.  We are building it - it is under way in St. James's - and two children's outpatient and urgent care centres, one in Blanchardstown and one in Tallaght hospital in Dublin.</p> <p> I note that, yesterday, there was much discussion in these Houses about the national maternity strategy.  I am delighted that, as part of this capital plan, we will relocate all stand-alone maternity hospitals to acute hospital campus, providing women and their babies with world-class 21st-century facilities.  Holles Street will move to St. Vincent's, University Maternity Hospital, Limerick will move to the site of the University Hospital Limerick, the Rotunda will move to the Connolly Hospital site and the Coombe to the St. James's campus.</p> <p> In relation to the cancer strategy, we will also deliver the capital developments, including the national programme for radiation oncology at Cork, Galway and Dublin and the expansion of BreastCheck.  We will build the new national forensic mental health service hospital at Portrane.  We will continue with the redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  We have commenced phase 1 and we will now fund phase 2.  The primary care centre construction programme will continue at locations right across the country, as will the replacement and refurbishment of the community nursing homes for older people and long-term residential care units for those with disabilities and the implementation and delivery of the trauma system.</p> <p> With the unprecedented capital investment in the health services, we must ensure that we carefully plan and select projects.  This process will be guided by the national health strategy and policy, including the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We will have a robust method of project appraisal, assessment and selection in order to ensure that these are delivered appropriately.</p> <p> In summary, the provision of this unprecedented capital investment of &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years will help us build that better health service that citizens yearn for, that staff deserve and that, quite frankly, we all need.</p></speech>

I was surprised when I picked up the <i>Evening Herald</i>yesterday to see a double-page spread that, to a person browsing through the newspaper, appears like normal articles.  It is a double-page spread of articles but at the top is the little giveaway, &quot;In partnership with the Government of Ireland.&quot;</p></speech>

Christy is quoted in it.  He welcomes it and states that it is very good news for Finglas, which it is, and he wishes the building work would not take nine years.  Someone did not tell him that the building work will take nine years from 2027 because the Finglas Luas line is not included in the projects from 2018 to 2027.  The advertisement also implies that construction work on this is beginning tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev is quoted in the advertisement as well and a Finglas youth worker is also quoted.  The youth worker is quoted as saying, "The link will give young people a better chance in life."  What I am asking is, what young people of what generation are being thought of here?  It certainly will not give the young people who live in Finglas right now a better chance in life, as the Minister will be aware, because this will be post-2027.  A child born in Finglas today will not set foot on this Luas until he or she is about to enter post-primary school.  In fact, well beyond post-primary school, he or she could be going to college because this is a plan for post-2027.</p>  <p>  Did any of the three persons who feature in this article know they were contributing to an advertisement feature or that this was part of the Government's communication strategy?  Was anybody paid to contribute to this article?  How much did this double-page spread cost in a major national newspaper?  Essentially, this is a party political advertisement in a national newspaper in what is a marginal constituency in which the sitting Fine Gael Deputy is fighting to hold on to his seat.  Therefore, this is targeted political advertising that is, essentially, being paid for by the taxpayer.  In the words of Christy Dignam, I can ask, "How can I protect you from this crazy [Government]", as opposed to "crazy world"?"  This is something we will be coming back to repeatedly.</p><p>If the Government is trying to communicate with people in relation to developments, why is not taking out advertisements in national newspapers about the chronic traffic congestion in Dublin or explaining the dangerous overcrowding on Luas, the recent electricity breakdown that affected hundreds of businesses at peak time in Dublin or all the porkies the Taoiseach told about hospital waiting lists this week, on which he was called out by an exceptionally reputable journalist in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>?  I checked one or two of the newspapers that serve my area, <i>Southside People</i>being one, <i>The Echo</i>being another, and there were no ads for the national development plan, no ads from the Government's communications unit and no ads for Project Ireland 2040.  If there were ads in <i>The Echo</i>, <i>Southside People</i>or any other newspapers covering my constituency, they would show a blank page because there is nothing for the people of Dublin South-West in the national development plan.  I invite people who might be watching or listening to this debate, constituents, to google the national development plan.  They will see a PDF of the national development plan.  If they open the PDF, they can do a word search.  If they search for townlands such as Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Templeogue, Ballycullen, Whitechurch, Ballyboden, Marlay or Greenhills, they will find absolutely nothing.  They will find they are sandwiched between the Luas red line and green line.  This vast swathe of south and south-west County Dublin has been abandoned by Fine Gael and by the Government in the national development plan.  The people who live there are particularly challenged by chronic traffic congestion.  As I mentioned to the Minister the other night, they have sight of the M50 but their access to it is proving impossible.<br/><br/>In all the talk of housing and increased density, there is no mention in the national development plan of increasing recreational facilities, which must be a basic standard when we talk about increased housing.  There is no talk of providing additional swimming pools or major parks facilities to service the increased density of housing envisaged.<br/><br/>There are a few mentions of Tallaght in the national development plan, such as the renal unit and the intensive care unit in Tallaght hospital, but these projects were initiated by Tallaght hospital itself.  The HSE delayed, and continues to delay, the launch and tender of these projects, and now we find them wrapped up in the national development plan.  The Dublin technological university is relaunched in the national development plan.  It should not be part of the plan.<br/><br/>I am quite convinced BusConnects, parts of which I think are only at pre-consultation stage, will not come online for another three or four years as far as its impact on people in my constituency is concerned, but this is all wrapped up and repackaged in the national development plan.  Meanwhile, the Minister's constituency, which already has the Luas green line, will get a metro, and still we have this large gap from Dundrum all along the corridor and right out to Tallaght and everywhere in between.  There is no talk of a spur line.  This does not even have to be a line on track; once it is a segregated, dedicated, exclusive corridor for public transport, I think people would accept it as a mid-term measure.  However, there is absolutely no such measure in the development plan.  As I mentioned the other night, there are no measures for the here and now.  I absolutely accept the need for a national development plan and a national planning framework.  However, what the Government lacks are proposals to deal with what happens between now and when all this infrastructure is built out, which in some cases will take between ten and 20 years.  In the meantime, traffic coming into the city builds up on all the arteries leading into it.  In the 1990s, if one lived in somewhere like Rathfarnham or Tallaght, one could endure the congestion because one saw the M50 physically being built every day.  In the early 2000s, one could endure the congestion because one saw the Luas under construction.  However, it will be a decade before anyone sees a shovel in the ground or earthworks happening in any part of Dublin on any of the projects proposed here, and even longer for some of the critical proposals.<br/><br/>To follow on what a previous speaker said about Dublin, as a Dubliner and a Dublin representative - I appeal to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this as a voice at the Cabinet table - the challenge for Dublin is to compete with international cities.  I think everyone pretty well accepts that.  This was one of the reasons behind Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal for a directly elected mayor, so that Dublin could go out and compete with Copenhagen, Barcelona and all the other cities to attract business and investment into Ireland.  What this national development plan sets up is competition between Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, which is the very last thing we want to do.  Dublin and Dubliners have a right to insist and expect that this county and capital will continue to be allowed to fulfil its potential as a destination, a place to do business and a place to attract investment.  However, what the Government has done in the national development plan is to set Dublin up in competition with other cities in the country as opposed to other cities outside the country in attracting competition.<br/><br/>There is no mention of big issues for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport such as air pollution along the M50 corridor and some of the other major routes such as the N81 and noise pollution issues in respect of the M50 corridor for people who reside adjacent to it.  These are really significant issues that have not been addressed in the national development plan, and nor has a Government commitment to take the kind of approach to parts of my constituency and other constituencies that are ravaged by drugs and disadvantage been taken in the Government's initiatives regarding the north inner city.  These are just some of my responses to the national development plan.</p></speech>

The programme of investment set out in the national development plan will result in a comprehensive road, bus and rail network providing a high level of service to all regions of the country, linking all parts.  The planned investment in transport will also prepare for increases in demand.  All this is even more important as the potential risks of Brexit make access to a range of routes to global markets for trade and tourism all the more important.  It is an investment priority to ensure that the existing extensive transport networks are maintained to a high level to ensure quality levels of service, accessibility and connectivity for transport users.  Protecting our vital national assets and keeping them safe and fit for purpose will be key.  While we are planning for the long term, we are also increasing services in the short term and completing an existing medium-term programme of investment right out to 2022.</p>  <p>  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system both to reverse emerging congestion problems and secure a significant improvement in public transport services.  BusConnects is an investment priority to radically transform the bus system and deliver a step change in performance across our cities.  The benefits of BusConnects will come on stream progressively from 2019.  BusConnects will aim to introduce continuous bus lanes on the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park-and-ride facilities at key locations.  It will also involve major improvements in ticketing and information.  Dublin will pioneer the system and, as the other cities develop transport strategies, investment will also be available for roll-out of BusConnects in the main cities.  Metro link is a key transport investment priority, with indicated funding of &euro;3 billion.  We will consult with the public on metro link, which will serve people from Swords to Sandyford.  Construction will commence after this consultation and approval process, likely to be 2021, with a view to delivering the project by 2027.  The DART expansion programme will focus on delivery of priority elements of the programme using the recently opened rail link under the Phoenix Park.  This includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as resignalling and junction and station changes followed by a programme of electrification to provide high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda, Celbridge-Hazelhatch, Maynooth and Greystones.  Comprehensive cycling and walking networks will be developed in cities under the national development plan.  This programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.</p><p> Building on the success of Government's continued investment in the Luas network, we will undertake appraisal, planning and design in the context of expanding the network to Bray, Finglas, Lucan and Poolbeg.  A light rail corridor for Cork will also be appraised for the later stages of the period of the Cork transport strategy.  These appraisals will ensure that we will be ready to expand the Luas where and when it is needed in line with sustained development and increasing demand in these areas.  There is a strong link between investment in public transport and an increased need for operational funding.  This is particularly the case for rural public transport services, which we are also planning to maintain and grow.  This fact is rightly recognised in the national development plan.</p> <p> The aim of the national planning framework is to consolidate the growing population in ways that allow efficient public transport systems and more walking or cycling journeys.  This provides meaningful alternatives to the private car, the benefits of which are not limited to reducing CO2 emissions but also include lessening congestion and yielding more liveable towns and cities.  As part of the national development plan, we will introduce more environmentally-friendly buses in Ireland's cities.  Furthermore, investment is earmarked to support the transition to zero emission capable cars.  The bold target of having 500,000 electric vehicles in our national car fleet by 2030 further signifies the extent of our commitment to decarbonise our transport sector over time.  This all adds to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion in our cities and combating climate change.</p> <p> The importance of air connectivity for this island nation cannot be overstated.  Ireland is well served by its airports and has a wide range of routes for business, leisure and tourism.  The national development plan includes priority infrastructural improvements at our State airports as well as support for safety and security related projects at the smaller regional airports under the regional airports programme.  The north runway at Dublin Airport is a nationally important piece of infrastructure, where, following a sustained period of recovery and growth, additional capacity is now required.  Dublin Airport served close to 30 million passengers in 2017 and is a key enabler for the Irish economy.  The international connectivity which will be afforded by a new runway is vital to our future prosperity, especially in a post-Brexit environment.</p> <p> Shannon Group has plans to invest over &euro;150 million in the coming years.  This includes the construction of a wide-body paint hangar at Shannon Airport and the development of the group's considerable property portfolio to deliver high-quality, advanced commercial property that supports employment in that region.  It will also support tourism in the region.</p> <p> The ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes are key international maritime gateways, handling approximately 90% of all goods received.  The national development plan recognises the importance of ports in connecting Ireland to the rest of the world.  Over the next five years, Dublin Port will progress infrastructure investment of roughly &euro;230 million.  The Port of Cork is investing in the region of &euro;90 million and Shannon Foynes Port will be investing approximately &euro;27 million.  This investment will provide additional capacity through increasing the number, size and depth of berths, thereby preparing the ports for increases in ship sizes and frequency.</p> <p> Strengthening access routes to Ireland's ports through investment to upgrade and enhance the road transport network to improve journey times remains a Government priority.  For example, the development of the M11 improves connectivity to Rosslare Port in the south-east.  Regrettably, roads funding, like so many other vital public goods and services, has been far less available than anyone would have liked in recent years.  My Department has carried out detailed and robust studies to show what funding is needed to maintain our roads.  This is why I welcome clear recognition in the national development plan of the importance of maintaining our transport network, particularly our roads.  I know that the everyday condition of local, regional and national roads concerns people and businesses in every corner of Ireland, and a commitment of &euro;4.5 billion for local and regional roads has been made under the national development plan.  I am passionate about making our roads safer.  In that context, properly maintained roads are safer roads.</p> <p> These are investments in stronger regions, in greater resilience to the impacts of Brexit and in supporting public transport.  Facing into Brexit, it is important that all our transport sectors feed into and complement each other.  Connectivity is the key, connecting more people to more places.  For example, the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road will connect the new development of the Port of Cork at Ringaskiddy with Cork city and the rest of the country.   Similarly, the new N69-N21 will not only relieve congestion from the busy tourist and commuter town of Adare, it will also enhance access to Shannon Foynes Port.  The planned N6 Galway ring road and the N11-M11 from Kilmacanogue will enable better, faster and more consistent bus services.  Of course, the M20 project will substantially complete the Atlantic corridor.</p> <p> Tourism will play a key role in strengthening rural economics and communities.  The tourism sector provides employment for approximately 225,000 people throughout the country and contributes significantly to the development of rural areas.  The success of the Mayo and Waterford greenways in particular show the impact that greenways can have on transforming rural communities.  In the period up to 2021, almost &euro;108 million will be allocated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for investment in tourism product development.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to invest in the experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East and in a new brand for the midlands.  Tourism Ireland will continue to invest in capabilities to ensure that Ireland really stands out and inspires and motivates people across the world to visit Ireland.</p> <p> Sport plays a key role in improving the health and well-being of our young people in particular and it is vital that we strive to increase sport participation.  The sports capital programme provides funding to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  Allocations under the most recent round of the programme were made at the end of last year, when we allocated a total of &euro;60 million to 1,807 different sporting projects.</p> <p> We will continue to invest in key programmes over the lifetime of the national development programme to support our people and our communities, I am delighted that Project Ireland 2040 commits to establishing a new large-scale sports infrastructure fund for larger projects.  The new fund is designed to provide a more structured approach for such funding and &euro;100 million is being provided.  The full terms and conditions of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months.</p> <p> The National Sports Campus has been a very successful development at Abbotstown in Dublin.  Its inclusion in Project Ireland 2040 is fantastic and its future planning is an integral part of the development of Irish sport.  Phase 2 of the national indoor arena will be completed next year.  Construction of a national velodrome and badminton centre is due for completion by 2021.  A review of the master plan for the campus's development will be completed this year and will be aligned with wider Government capital planning.</p> <p> We are also seeking, by means of the national development plan, to mitigate some of the potential implications of Brexit.  While we cannot determine the exact implications of Brexit with any degree of certainty at this stage, we do recognise that transport connectivity is crucial and that any disruption to our connectivity will impact on our international trade and tourism sectors.</p> <p> Project Ireland 2040 sets out a detailed and positive vision for Ireland's transport infrastructure over the next decade.  The national development plan will deliver a greener public transport network that will provide high-quality passenger interchange points, which facilitate convenient transfer between efficient and integrated public transport services that connect all parts of the country.  All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion in our cities and combating climate change.  Following publication, our focus will turn to delivery that achieves value for money for the taxpayer and enables sustained development and growth as set out in the national planning framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200025#AA00200"><p>As a rural Deputy, my concern is how Project Ireland 2040 will improve the development of county towns and smaller centres of population, including our villages.  This is a ten-year capital plan for bricks and mortar and a 20-year vision for national development in designing where people will live and work.  I felt a little uneasy when I saw the media hype surrounding the launch of the two documents.  It was as if the Government was trying to convince itself about the merits of these projects, not to mention convincing the electorate.  Six days later, we are back to trying to solve our current crises, namely, those relating to the shortage of housing and the health service.</p>  <p>  In our health service, an average of 612 people have been on trolleys over the past four days.  This is equal to the peak number on trolleys on 6 January 2017.  We need to reform our health service through Sl&aacute;intecare, but that is as much about reforming culture, process and management structures as it is about introducing bricks and mortar and building new services and new hospitals.</p>  <p>   Planning and projections are, of course, important and there will be no perfect document.  However, I feel that the rush to put this on a statutory footing is ill-judged, especially before it is closely examined.  The plan is very urban centred, concentrating service and infrastructure development in five cities and a few provincial towns of strategic political importance.  Vast areas of rural Ireland will fall further behind in job opportunities and sustainability.  We need balanced regional development but we also need balanced development within our regions.  Rather than having a view of not wishing to spread resources thinly, we should take the view that each citizen should have an equal opportunity to live and work outside urban centres, or at least have that choice.</p><p>Connectivity and infrastructure should allow a more even distribution of jobs and people, and not create a number of city states.  Our 19th century county towns need to be rejuvenated, not just as places to live, but also as places to work.  Our villages need to be sustainable and vibrant, but they can only do so if there is employment within or nearby and if farming is supported as a viable career.</p> <p> Out of a total of &euro;116 billion, a &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund over a ten year period equates to less than 1% spread over 26 counties.  Other developments in Project Ireland 2040 will indirectly help non-urban centres.  However, an allocation of &euro;1 billion out of &euro;116 billion can hardly be described as balanced or fair, particularly when one compares it the resources going into our cities and major urban centres. </p> <p> I listened to the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Ryan, during the last discussion of the plan.  His contribution to this debate extolled the virtue of compact urban living, arguing that Project Ireland 2040 did not go far enough in urbanisation.  He is not alone in this regard.  Rather than create jobs more evenly outside cities, he proposes to bring people into cities and concentrate jobs therein, building urban cores where people live and work to the detriment of rural society.  The Green Party is clearly more an urban Green Party than an inclusive all-Ireland Green Party.  This plan sees rural Ireland as a holiday playground rather than an economic entity which is sustainable all year round.  The Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East need to have people living and working along their paths.  How can they be sustainable if there is not a hinterland and an indigenous population?</p> <p> Compact development is the main theme of Project Ireland 2040, concentrating on five major cities for living and job creation.  Adherents to this philosophy will appreciate this plan.  However, if one believes we should be building a society which is more diverse, then this plan is a major disappointment.  Must we always strive to squeeze the maximum efficiency, with no regard to quality of life or a balanced society?  Must we concentrate on our economy rather than our society?  How will citizens afford to buy or rent in high-density centres?  Will they be happy with their quality of life?  I predict that compact urban development in five urban centres will suck the life-blood from our towns and villages, should there be any left in those areas, as many of your young people have already migrated to our cities or emigrated to foreign parts due to the lack of job opportunities.</p> <p> The plan does have positive aspects.  The development of green energy is to be welcomed.  Renewable energy projects harnessing natural offshore wind, wave and solar energy are important policy objectives.  The development of functional and practical electric cars is a goal worth pursuing.  Looking at a green future for Moneypoint and all other peat-burning stations is the right thing to do.</p> <p> The Minister of Health, Deputy Simon Harris, recently referred to the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the plan to provide 2,600 extra beds.  I note that the population of Ireland is projected to increase by 1,000,000, which is equivalent to the requirement of an additional 2,600 beds.  As such, these 2,600 beds will just allow us to stand still.  Yes, the provision of elective-only hospitals is very positive.  However, we must look at the culture, process and management changes that need to occur in our health service.  That is the core of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is not just about bricks and mortar.</p> <p> I welcome the capital programme to provide &euro;100 million for the development of Shannon Group property portfolio and the &euro;10 million sum for the development of the Bunratty visitor centre.  However, developing the infrastructure of Dublin Airport for an overwhelmingly dominant role in air travel is very unbalanced, particularly when the airports of Shannon, Cork and Knock have substantial passenger capacity and potential as aviation hubs.  The proposed M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick, which links the motorway north to Tuam and eventually to Sligo, is essential for the region and is welcome.  I also welcome the proposal to build 3,500 social houses in County Clare as part of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Ultimately, county towns and villages of Clare will depend on what proportion of the &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, which is earmarked for towns with a population of less than 1,000, they can access.  The sum of &euro;1 billion is a fraction of &euro;116 Billion.  When one considers that Metro North will cost &euro;3.2 billion, and probably more, the regional disparity in investment is put in perspective.</p> <p> On the positive side I feel Clare is in a strong position to tap into the proposed rejuvenation and development fund.  I hope this fund will synchronise with Clare rural development strategy 2026, which was launched last September by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  Clare was the first county to launch a rural development strategy following the Government&rsquo;s action plan for rural development.  The elected members and the executive of Clare County Council are to be congratulated for developing this plan.  The ten year strategy targets the creation of 4,000 jobs over the lifetime of the plan through the development of community-led social enterprises supported by Enterprise Ireland, the Clare Local Enterprise Office, the Office of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Leader programme and the rural and community support unit of Clare County Council.  Digital hubs will be established at numerous locations throughout the county to support rural enterprise by facilitating e-working, small-scale training and conferencing.  The strategy also targets the development of community-run multi-service centres, which will aim to provide a range of public services such as GP care, postal services, social protection, health care, transport, advice and information from a single building.  Innovative rural transport initiatives, such as a proposed "rural Uber", community car-pooling and community bus services such as LocalLink and Clare Bus are also earmarked under the strategy.  Clare County Council will establish a rural community development officer in each of Clare&rsquo;s four municipal districts.</p> <p> While the overall population of County Clare grew over the past 30 years, particular rural areas suffered a population decline of up to 35%.  These are areas in the peninsula area of Loop Head and in north Clare.  Depopulated areas lost much of their agricultural and retail employment and gained few jobs in emerging sectors.  Primary school and GP service closures and threatened closure of Garda stations, post offices and banking services have followed this rural depopulation.  It is thus important to note the differences in development that exist between the corridor connecting Ennis, Shannon and Limerick and the rest of the  county.  Project Ireland 2040 must redress this imbalance, and whether this plan has the focus to do so is questionable.  Hopefully, the Clare rural development strategy will redress this imbalance.  The challenges to our farming sector are magnified by the threats of Brexit, the proposed Mercosur trade agreement and climate change.</p> <p> Of course there must be a plan to develop Ireland over the next ten to 20 years.  However, this plan is urban-centred and leaves county struggling to have its voice heard over city.  It lacks balance within regions where rural life, while tolerated, is seen as a drain on our economy and can be sacrificed in favour of compact city development.  This is a short-sighted view of our future.  It is unfair and as the plan unfolds I hope that rural Ireland will not continue to be marginalised.</p></speech>

There has been lots of hype about the Project Ireland 2040 plan in the media since its launch last Friday.  Perhaps we should refer to its incredible launch last Friday.  Who paid for that?  We will not go there.  I am not as enthusiastic about the report however.  In fact, I could even say that, to me, the most relevant piece of the 170-page document is a picture on page 45 of a member of my staff, Ms Maureen McGrath, dancing a set at a local festival in Clonmel.  That is as much as I could relate to the document on any issue concerning rural Ireland or west Cork.</p></speech>

From there on however, the chapters I have been able to read are pretty disappointing.  I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, has highlighted the benefits, or so-called benefits, that the plan has for Cork.  These are only relevant to Cork city.  Consider the possibility of a light rail network to Cork.  Will this extend to the constituency of Cork South-West?  I have been pleading for many years for light rail to come at least as far as Bandon in west Cork.  I doubt this was even considered in this plan.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>There are references to improvements in public transport links to our regional cities, but what about our rural areas?  My daughter works in County Longford as a childminder.  Each week she travels from Schull in rural west cork to Longford, which takes 12 hours.  Her journey includes a bus from west Cork to Cork city although I usually drop her to reduce her journey, a second bus from Cork to Dublin and a third bus from Dublin to Longford.  A journey that should takes four hours and 20 minutes according to Google Maps takes 12 hours on public transport.  That demonstrates where we are and where we are going.</p> <p> It is refreshing to see our regional cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway getting some attention other than Dublin but areas beyond that have been given little attention.  Dr. Frank Crowley, of University College Cork business school, has published an article on why Project Ireland 2040 is doomed to fail.  I like to support my fellow Corkmen and, although we have different reasons for thinking the project will be unsuccessful, I agree with his conclusion.  The president of Cork Chamber of Commerce argued that the framework acknowledged that it was in the national interest to promote growth outside Dublin to alleviate pressure in the capital and create opportunities elsewhere.  This is certainly something I agree with.  Two nights ago, a Private Members' motion was dedicated to traffic issues in Dublin city and every other day we hear about housing and accommodation pressures in the capital as well as the extortionate cost of living.  It would make sense to alleviate that pressure and enhance rural and under-developed areas, as Mr. Bill O'Connell said.</p> <p> In reference to the south west, including my constituency, the report states: "Many of these rural areas have a high degree of self-containment, operating as significant local employment and service centres for a large rural hinterland."  Without the initiative and entrepreneurship of people in west cork, we would be in a sorry state in respect of employment.  Many companies and individuals have created significant employment through the years with little or no Government mandate.  I visited the Ceramicx Ireland factory in Ballydehob recently.  Mr. Frank Wilson and his family have had to fight the fight themselves and they have created between 50 and 60 jobs.  They are dedicated to their work and their community.  However, the Government still offers no help in this regard.  Small business owners, publicans and postmasters are crippled by different taxes and regulations.  Although it is good that Cork city has been earmarked for further development, which will hopefully have a spin-off effect on west Cork, I would have liked more attention to be given directly to the area.</p> <p> West Cork is one of the best places in the country for fishing and marine activities, but little or no thought has been given to this sector  I acknowledge a chapter of the report focuses on marine planning but not to the benefit of people in rural Ireland and west Cork, in particular.  More money should be spent on marine infrastructure and on the many small piers and harbours that inshore fishermen operate from.  These little piers and harbours are to be found all along the Wild Atlantic Way.  Do the Government parties not realise what an attraction they are for tourism?  Kids get to take pictures of crab and lobster.  It is not just fishermen that benefit from this; this is what attracts people to these areas.  The tourism revenue generated by this has a spin-off effect on rural communities.  Investing in these activities would provide for real rural development.  The only marine-related interest that the Government parties have in west Cork is the mechanical harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay.  This will be an environmental disaster if it goes ahead.  Such harvesting will kill creatures that are living in the seaweed and fears exist that the seaweed may not grow back.  Unfortunately, the Government parties, in every way, shape and form, are doing their best to support this in spite of everybody in the local community pleading with them to rescind the decision, which they can do.</p> <p> Inshore fishermen were not mentioned in the plan.  Does the Government have any interest in them?  They provide great financial assistance to local businesses.  More financial help is needed for inshore fisheries in the form of hardship money, especially during bad weather.  I raised the issue over and over again following Hurricane Ophelia.  Inshore fishermen pay tax the same as everybody else.  The sector received no help from the Government and inshore fishermen were ignored after the hurricane.  If this destruction or devastation happened anywhere else in the world, the Government would rightly send aid.  With the new season fast approaching, fishermen have lost so much gear that they are trying to borrow money to replace it</p> <p> I reiterate the comments of my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, earlier about the abolition of town councils.  We have witnessed the disastrous effect on Cork County Council of this decision.  The T&aacute;naiste highlighted the great projects that Project Ireland 2040 will bring to Cork at a breakfast briefing in the city last Monday.  He included the full implementation of the MacKinnon report, which provides for the extension of the Cork city boundary to incorporate Rochestown, Grange, Glanmire, Blarney, Tower and Ballincollig into the city.  This will add approximately 100,000 to its population.  Members of the Rural Independent Group and I highlighted our opposition to this in a motion before Christmas.  There is huge opposition to this on the ground.  The Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il members of the county council opposed it.  Almost everybody in the county is opposed to this but the Government parties will railroad this plan through because it is their idea and no one will stop them.  This is not a surprise because they are not in touch with the common man on the ground.  If they were in touch with their councillors, the plan would be scrapped.  Our motion highlighted the detrimental effect the MacKinnon report would have on the county council areas that are to be moved into the city but it was narrowly defeated.  That was much to the detriment of the people of Cork county.</p> <p> Last Monday, the T&aacute;naiste went on to say when addressing business people in the city that he envisions the expansion of the city by another 125,000 residents. I hope it is not intended to extend the city border as far as Bandon.  I do not know where he will find all these people.  Perhaps, we might be lucky and he will extend the border west of the Mizen peninsula or to the Beara peninsula, where rural people have been forgotten.  The Government needs to take the people of rural Ireland into consideration.</p> <p> I hope the plan has been rural-proofed.</p></speech>

The CAP budget will be cut, most likely by millions of euro, which will be another attack on rural Ireland.  That budget funds much of the progress in rural Ireland.  The Leader programme collapsed while the Government sat idly by.  That money was for rural development but now it is gone.  The plan will be of no benefit to the people of Cork South West.  It will lead to further destruction for them because the money will be invested in the larger cities and counties while rural areas will be neglected.</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040 is the result of significant consultation both with parties in the House and throughout the country.  Given the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il's national spatial strategy, NSS, it is remarkable to hear many of its members criticising this plan.  Not one of the 22 fastest growing towns in the State between 2002 and 2016 was a NSS gateway or hub settlement.  The strategy did not aid balanced development and there are now greater distances between where people live and where they work.  What Fianna F&aacute;il did, metaphorically or otherwise, was troop every one of its Deputies and Senators into a room to ask them what they wanted for their constituencies and they got it.  That is not a strategy; that is parish-pump politics at its worst.  I represent west Galway and south Mayo and the strategy did nothing for Galway or the west.</p><p>There was no investment in transport, housing or health, nothing.  I am happy to outline some of what this Government's plan will do, not only for Galway but for the region.  Our plan will provide funding for the Galway city ring road.  This will provide relief from traffic congestion in order to implement smarter mobility and public transport measures.  The project is currently at design and environmental assessment phase.  A new elective hospital in Galway is also being funded.  This will drastically reduce waiting times for elective surgery, not just for Galway but for the whole of the Saolta hospital group, which stretches all the way from Donegal to Galway and as far east as Athlone.  A new emergency department will be built at University Hospital Galway.  Replacement and further radiation oncology facilities are funded.  There is funding for a new patient accommodation for Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and a new ambulance service base in Merlin Park.  The N50 Moycullen bypass will also be funded, which will reduce congestion in Moycullen and provide a safer route, with better journey times and better journey time certainty that will improve access to the west and in particular to Connemara.</p> <p> The technological university for the Connacht-Ulster alliance consortium will get funding for significant new buildings which will be provided to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology, Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology in its bid for technological university status.  The Government is committed to providing &euro;15 million to the European city of culture 2020 project.  There will be investment in national heritage, which includes Coole Park and Connemara National Park in County Galway.  Gaeltacht investment includes the development of tourism facilities in Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n in the Connemara Gaeltacht, investment in the Aran Islands, the development of improved pier infrastructure in Inis Oirr and the construction of new co-operative offices and community facilities on Inis Me&aacute;in.  There is an investment programme for ongoing safety and maintenance and necessary new developments at Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre.</p> <p> Towns and villages with populations of up to 10,000 people, places such as Oranmore and Claregalway, along with rural areas, can benefit from a new rural regeneration and development fund worth &euro;1 billion nationally over 10 years.  Under the sports capital programme communities and clubs across Galway and the West including in rural areas can bid for over &euro;100 million in capital funding over the next four years.  A new large-scale sports infrastructure fund of &euro;100 million is being established for larger sports projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amounts available under the current sports capital programme.  That is what the Government's plan will deliver for Galway and the west; not parish pump politics but infrastructural investment in Galway, the west and north-west that has been badly needed for decades.  I absolutely commend this plan to the House.</p></speech>

Deputy Lahart, who I have great time for, and yesterday, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said it is not doing enough for Dublin but every other Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher and Deputies Harty and Michael Collins said it is doing too much for Dublin and not enough for the regions and rural Ireland.  That probably means nobody is completely happy but equally that no part of the country has benefitted unduly over the other regions and sectors.  That is a task in itself.  I commend the officials responsible for it, and the Ministers.  It is important that we have a proper planning framework for the future.  I discovered the Buchanan report, published at the end of the 1960s only recently.  Much of what it contained is now contained in this plan.  It referred to places such as Athlone and the need for development outside Dublin.  I welcome the fact that the final copy of this plan seeks to ensure that there are significant centres of population north of that line from Galway to Dublin, which is not necessarily the case already.</p><p>Without wishing to criticise Deputy Breathnach, sitting across from me now, the constant criticism made by Fianna F&aacute;il was that there was too much spin, or that its announcement was almost too big.  Deputy Lahart went so far as to produce a copy of <i>The Herald</i>to explain that it went too far.  The spatial strategy was released with great fanfare.  I think Martin Cullen was the Minister responsible for it.  As Deputy Naughton pointed out, it was spectacular in its absolute and utter failure to deliver anything.  I accept that for ten years, the economy could not support the ideals of the spatial strategy but it was produced in 2002.  It was there for the best years of the Celtic tiger.  I could show towns and cities including my own, Kilkenny, or neighbouring Waterford, that were listed as gateways and hubs that did not get a damn thing under the spatial strategy.  It did not matter a whit.  Nothing was delivered for Waterford, Kilkenny or Carlow, which was also a hub.  That was partly because the economy did collapse and partly because the plan was completely undermined a few years later by a former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who came into this House one budget day and announced decentralisation, which was really a case of one for everyone in the audience, another plan that was not implemented.  </p><p>I am glad this is a long-term plan.  I am the furthest thing in this House from a socialist but the communists thought about long-term economic planning.  It did not work out very well in many communist countries but at least there was a long-term objective, not just the list of what is being done in a Member's constituency or his or her part of a constituency. </p><p>This plan states there will be 1 million extra people in Ireland in the next 20 years and 750,000 of them will be accommodated, schooled and transported outside the greater Dublin area.  It beggars belief that anybody could say that objective is anything other than pro-regions and rural communities.  Many of the capital announcements for major headline schemes in the Dublin region have been announced before but are long overdue and are badly needed, particularly in the area of transport.</p><p>I am glad that the institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford have been included for funding.  The boards and chairpersons of those institutions are involved in detailed discussions with a view to the establishment of a university in our region.  It is the biggest single game-changer for the south east that we could hope for and aspire to.  Deputy Lahart criticised the spacing out of some proposals over ten years.  That is the way to sustainably build an economy.  It would not be sustainable to start everything contained in the capital plan tomorrow.  We must learn from the lessons of recent history in our economic development.  I commend the framework plan, and the officials and others who have been involved in drafting it.</p></speech>

For those who are not familiar with Ulster Scots it means that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.</p>  <p>  I cautiously welcome the national planning framework for 2040 but I am hoping that in planning the work we will work the plan because there is no doubt that by 2040 it will probably be left to Fianna F&aacute;il to implement the plan.  I expect that we will soon have proper legislative footing under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016.  Project Ireland 2040 is a very ambitious plan for our country.  As many other Deputies have already stated, however, a lot of what is contained in the plan is not new and the plan contains initiatives that have been announced already.  The plan is made up of a lot of rehashed announcements that have given Leo's spin doctors a high.</p></speech>

I welcome the plan's national policy objective No. 2 outlining the regional roles including Drogheda and Dundalk to Newry cross-border where networks will be identified and supported in the relevant regional spatial and economic strategy.  I also welcome sections 8.2 to 8.5 of the plan that highlights the importance of the Dublin to Belfast corridor as being the largest economic cluster on the island of Ireland.  This point cannot be overstated.  In this context I hope that the commitments to improve infrastructure will be followed through.  The proposed linkage of a high speed train network between the two capital cities of Ireland in the North and South must be completed.  It is important in the North-South context but in the southern context the proposal to extend the DART to Drogheda is equally as important when we consider the pull towards Dublin where many commuters in Meath and Louth will eventually benefit from that as the years go by.</p>  <p>  These improvements in infrastructure are imperative if we are to continue to attract inward investment to the region.  In late 2017 we welcomed 300 new jobs in Dundalk when the medicine packaging company Wasdell Group committed to opening a new 70,000 sq ft plant.  This UK company wishes to retain a presence within the EU.  The attraction of that Dublin to Belfast corridor is crucial to our region, which is equidistant to Dublin Airport and to Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport.  The corridor is important in attracting many people post-Brexit who will just be within a one hour commute from places such as Liverpool and Manchester.  That region can be sold in that fashion to get some benefit from Brexit.  The eastern corridor is a huge growth area, as a potential from Brexit, and it is imperative that infrastructure is provided, not just road and rail but also housing to accommodate a sustainable population growth that will give people a good quality of life.</p>  <p>  Providing this infrastructure will include the provision of proper connectivity with high-speed broadband as a basic requirement.  Unless a person had broadband in the last week he or she had no opportunity to even read this plan.  It is a disgrace that not one Member of the House has been provided with a hard copy of the document.  This flies in the face of talking about the fact that many people in the State do not have a broadband service.  As with housing, which I shall address shortly, we can advocate that we will do this, that or the other, yet we cannot solve the broadband, the housing or the health crises in the State.  It is no good talking about master plans if we are not going to deliver them.  The issue around high-speed broadband certainly reflects the lack of delivery by the Government.</p>  <p>  The plan notes that it will be necessary to prepare co-ordinated strategies for Dundalk and Drogheda at regional and town level to ensure that they have the capacity to grow sustainably and to secure investment as key centres on the Drogheda-Dundalk-Newry cross-border network.  This is very important and I welcome it.  There has been much talk about city status for Drogheda.  Members would all love to have city status advocated for many of our towns, including Dundalk, but it is not about a hierarchy.  In my constituency it is about having the corridor and working it to its best advantage.</p>  <p>  In the North-South context it is important and noted in the framework that the implementation be in tandem with the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland.  We need a collaborative approach in developing those opportunities for the eastern Dublin-Belfast corridor.</p>  <p>  We also need to protect rural towns and communities and when we consider the plans for the four cities it would appear that there will be a shortfall in funding, which will undoubtedly eat into the majority of the funding leaving larger towns to suffer the deficit.  The national policy objective No. 15 is to support the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth.  As I have said already while speaking on a Topical Issue recently, I would like to see opportunities for those who for traditional and generational reasons have lived in rural areas and that they are allowed to remain in their local areas and build in their local community.  This does not necessarily mean in the village they came from.  It is not their fault the villages expanded.  If they can show a traditional link to the community they should have an entitlement to aspire to build a house in the countryside.</p>  <p>  National policy objective No. 32 is to target the delivery of 550,000 additional households by 2040.  Because of this Government&rsquo;s track record on housing to date, I believe this objective is aspirational rather than achievable.  I have said before that an immediate solution to the current housing crisis is to provide for emergency legislation immediately, preventing vulture funds coming in and putting families out of their homes.  Before the banks take their opportunity in advance of any legislation for regulation passing through this House, the only way this protection for families can be put in place is for Members to pass emergency legislation making it obligatory, in a very simple and once-off period of time, for the vulture funds and the banks to give first option to the local authorities on the purchases of those distressed loans, at the same price they are being offered to other people.  The local authority would get a bargain, the State would get a bargain and people could be left in their houses.  I shall give an example of this.  Of the 84 compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, that were done, more than 60 were boarded up bank houses.  The banks did not contest the CPOs, which shows that such a measure is constitutional; the banks did not challenge the local authority on the CPOs.  I have been reliably informed that there are more than 400 such houses spread across the county.  We need to take action now, not in three weeks or three months.  Now is the time.  The local authorities should have first call on purchasing these distressed loan books at the same knock-down price as the vulture funds.  This would prevent many people becoming homeless.</p>  <p>  I could refer to the lack of a regional hospital that was promised to the region by many Ministers in the past.  We did, however, get a sop: the plan includes the Ardee ambulance base, which is welcome.</p>  <p>  Louth's motto in its development plans have often spoken of my constituency as being the best place to live, work and grow old in.  This saying was stolen by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, when he spoke for the country.  That was Louth's motto long before he said it.  This should be reflected in any overall planning.</p><p>All we want to see is our children growing up, getting a good education, having a nice place to live and aspiring to grow old.</p></speech>

In the time available, I will confine my comments to matters relating to the constituency and region I represent, which is Cork.  Obviously, population growth under a plan such as this requires very substantial population growth in and around Cork city in particular.  By 2040 or 2050, the population of the county of Cork will exceed 1 million and the population in and around the metropolitan area of Cork city will increase by more than 125,000.  By 2050, that increase could be up to 500,000.  That is obviously a significant growth in population.  In order to develop that growth, we need to ensure that infrastructure is put in place and that the city is planned in a very strategic way.  Public transport is a crucial element of this and I will return to that issue.</p>  <p>  Not just in terms of Cork but also in the context of the south and the south west generally, it is enormously important that we encourage infrastructure which does not rely on the hub-and-spoke model under which all roads lead to Dublin.  We need to be able to link Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  All of those areas need to be in a position to work in concert and to develop as a region.  Crucial to that is the delivery of the M20.  This project has been talked about for a very long time.  There is no doubt that it is a substantial project but I put it to the Minister of State and the Government that, pound for pound, there is not a single road project in the State that has the same potential for economic development and delivery of investment and growth.  We also need to see the delivery of the M28.  It is a very short distance of road but if it is developed properly, it could unlock the potential of Cork Harbour and Cork's ability to trade with the world.</p>  <p>  Obviously, we cannot simply rely on our roads to accommodate that level of population growth.  Even if all of the identified road projects are delivered, and we will have to ensure that they are, it will not be possible to accommodate that level of population growth on our roads.  We need to invest in public transport.  Money has been identified.  We need an awful lot more detail because if it is simply invested in traditional bus services in the short term, I would be concerned that it would not deliver the necessary mode change.  We need to look at rapid transit bus and at light rail.</p>  <p>  As a final point, it is absolutely essential that the feasibility study on light rail takes the long view and focuses not just on the city we have now but, rather, on the one we will have in the future.  If it does not take that long view, the outcome of the study could be adverse.  We need to take a long view on this issue and on what Cork needs into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200030#FF00600"><p>The Government's national planning framework is big on presentation and was launched with great razzmatazz and gloss.  However, it is short on detail and of information regarding the front-loading of investment.  My home town of Drogheda is given third-tier recognition in the plan.  Many people are of the opinion that this is just lip-service because it does not address what Drogheda needs.  Recognition is all very well but if it is not backed up by a firm plan, commitment to funding for infrastructure implementation and a timeframe for delivery, it could well turn out like most plans and just be an aspirational document that lies on a shelf gathering dust.  Without that commitment to funding for infrastructure and without timeframes for delivery, third-tier recognition adds nothing and is of no substance.  A cynic might say that this was an appeasement to ward off any political backlash that local Government representatives might otherwise have gotten.</p>  <p>  We should look at the damage done by this Government over the past seven years.  My home town of Drogheda was stripped of its borough council status, its town clerk and any semblance of the power it once had.  What is the point of designating Drogheda as a third-tier growth centre without defining what that actually means in real terms?  Nobody seems to know.  The plan certainly does not define what it means in any detail whatsoever.  Drogheda has already been strategically placed and identified as part of the M1 economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast.  There is not a peep in this plan about funding for Drogheda's northern cross route.  There is not a peep about city status for Drogheda or about the second rail line that was promised.  There is no mention of development of our port or of investment in jobs or housing.  There is also no mention of investment of any sort for Drogheda or Dundalk in recognition of the fact that we are facing into Brexit and of the impact it will have on Louth as a Border county.</p>  <p>  It is very easy to present a plan with promises for the future.  One just has to look at the broadband plan which was announced and then announced again.  The announcement was regurgitated and then the timeframe was extended and extended to such an extent that in many areas of the State it is still nothing more than a promise which was not delivered on.  As I said at the outset, the plan is big on presentation, marketing and PR but it is short on commitments for funding, on timeframes and on implementation.  I have to say that this Government has let Drogheda and County Louth down once again.</p></speech>

We all recognise that the previous national planning framework and national spatial strategy did not get it right.  We had many hubs and gateways.  If one looks at the south east, where I am from, Waterford was designated as a gateway.  From all of the economic indicators, right across investment in public services, investment in infrastructure, unemployment and employment rates and rates of educational attainment, it is clear that the south east did not deliver and, in fact, underperformed.  We had the highest level of unemployment and the lowest level of employment for a long time, both before and since the recession.</p>  <p>  We had the lowest level of education attainment.  There is no university in the region and, while we have a first class institute of technology, record numbers of people in the south east are leaving in order to obtain third-level or fourth-level qualifications and are then not coming back.  We do not have the same level of investment in research and development a other regions because baseline research and development funding is given to universities but not institutes of technology.  While we have had some investment in recent years, such as in respect of the motorway, Waterford simply did not deliver as the gateway.</p>  <p>  I accept that, at least on paper, this plan is ambitious for Waterford and that is to be welcomed.  It envisages Waterford being a regional gateway city and massive increases in population and the number of jobs.  There are job creation targets.  The difficulty is in how all of this will be delivered and in whether the capital plan will be forthcoming.  Two big issues are not covered in either the development plan or the capital plan.  One is the regional airport in Waterford.  There is investment in regional airports everywhere except Waterford where money is only provided to stand still.  </p>  <p>  There is also no real capital investment for Waterford Institute of Technology or additional funding to allow it and the Institute of Technology Carlow to transition into a technological university.  According to this plan, 90% of all funding for higher education institutions will go into the existing universities while only 10% will go into the institutes of technology.  That will not be good for a region which wants to be front and centre at the table and which the Government wants to be a counterweight to Dublin.  The south east will only thrive, be able to deal with the real difficulties and challenges it faces, and play to its many strengths if Waterford city is the driver and engine of the region.  That is what has to happen.  As Deputy Munster said, we can have all the rhetoric, plans and fine words that we want but unless they are matched with funding, unless the silo mentality which exists in different Departments is ended and unless we have a single plan that can drive real growth and cut across Departments and which is underpinned by real funding, this will simply be another document which is long on aspiration but which will not deliver.</p><p>I very much hope that this does deliver for the south east.  I am very optimistic for the region, given the splendid things it has going in terms of wastewater infrastructure, the institute of technology and the motorways.  While we have a lot, there is much we do not have because of Government neglect.</p> <p> There is no point in having a national planning framework that aims to increase the population if we do not invest in public services or provide the health capacity that people need.  In the south east, there is a demand for a second catheterisation lab to ensure that patients have access to 24-7 cardiology care.  That has to be front and centre if the population is to increase by 60%.  Some of those people are going to get sick and will need to be treated.  That has to underpin any approach to planning as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200031#GG00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak here again today on the national development plan, having contributed heavily to this process for the past year and a half.  I am also clear that in the organisational structures of the plan, all the relevant stakeholders were consulted and encouraged to engage in the process, as I believed has happened.  There have been over 40 public consultation engagements throughout the country and over 1,000 submissions from elected members, organisations and residents.  The level of public consultation was intense and robust.  I attended over half of those public meetings, which was extremely beneficial to me in respect of informing policy in a sustainable and ambitious format.  None of those public consultation meetings dealt in rhetoric or aspirations.  They were about constructive, informative plans for the future of our country.  As chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, I attended numerous informal private briefings from and formal meetings with the Department, during which the committee submitted its recommendations and observations.  The Department officials have always made themselves available to meet any members of the committee.</p>  <p>  Having come from 12 years in local government, I have a vast understanding of the level of work and enormous commitment it takes to produce a development plan for a county, never mind a country.  It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormity of the challenge and the commitment it took to produce an investment plan in tandem with a national planning policy, the likes of which we have never seen before.  I pay particular tribute to a very dedicated team within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, namely, Mr. Dave Walsh, Mr. Niall Cussin, Mr. Paul Hogan, who is in the Chamber and many of their team.  They gave enormously of their personal time to this project and I thank them for all they have done to date.</p>  <p>  I have listened to many remarks in the past week about the statutory process and whether there needs to be a vote.  I watched the political football going on for the past week.  Just as I am on the pitch, I want to be very clear in the Chamber on my reading of this process.  I sat through the statements on the draft national planning framework.  I chaired joint committee meetings on the draft stage on 18 October, following which we submitted our report.  I remained clear that a vote was not required on the final stage, because I had read the legislation and the framework.  I am also clear about which Deputies were in dispute of this and who spoke or did not speak at the draft stage.  I made it my business to be in the Chamber and to speak on the national planning framework because it is important to me not only as a national politician, but also as someone who wants to be part of the policy that will shape our future as a country, a future that will enable growth in a sustainable and targeted format.</p>  <p>  It is now time to move on from this and to get to work implementing the national development plan in the interests of what I believe is the right thing to do.  I want to mention a couple of the reasons I am so supportive of the national development plan.  I have taken part in numerous debates in the past couple of days in which it has been pointed out how big the plan is and how many pages it contains.  There have been references to reheating dinners and to the &euro;1 billion we are spending on rural Ireland.  When I talk to these people for any length of time, I realise they have not read the plan.  If they had, they would be very clear on where we are going as a country and would not just be talking about how many pages are in the document.  Everyone understands the consequences of bad planning of the past - the long commutes, ghost estates and empty town centres.  I do not want to go back over history because our future is far too bright to delay the implementation of this plan.  Project Ireland 2040 is about planning for an Ireland that we know, through evidence we have collated, will grow by at least a million people over the next 20 years.  In respect of growth in employment, nine out of ten jobs have been outside Dublin in the past year and seven out of ten outside the satellite areas of Dublin.  It would be bad politics not to plan and create the environment for such growth.</p>  <p>  This is about planning for Ireland's future and not the bad planning of the past, which was built from election to election.  This is about the next 20 years, during which we will need to provide an additional 660,000 jobs and over 500,000 homes.  Some 25% of our population will be over a youthful 65 years and we need to plan for supportive housing.  My colleague across the Chamber, Deputy Declan Breathnach, is very supportive in this area.  We have had numerous conversations about viable supported living for older people in communities.  I know he is very supportive and comes forward with many policies in this area.  We need to provide housing on State-owned land throughout the country for this purpose.</p>  <p>  We are going to harness and develop further the potential of our tier 1 and tier 2 ports through industry, tourism, marine life, fisheries and climate change.  Ireland's territorial land is ten times greater then that of our island, which gives us vast opportunity and enables us to develop our floating wind farms, turbines and wave energy, all of which will help us transition to a carbon zero economy, harnessing the potential of the region in renewable energy terms across the technological spectrum from wind to solar to biomass and wave energy.  Huge emphasis is being put into consolidating the development of places that grew rapidly in the past decade or so, with large-scale commuter driven housing development with a particular focus on addressing local community and amenity facility provision in many of our larger commuter towns through targeted investment.  We are continuing the transformation of transport and communications by completing motorways, public transport and broadband links that are so badly needed to better connect communities and citizens.  Investment in an integrated transport system that links Dublin Airport is long overdue.  As a former ground staff employee of Dublin Airport, I fully recognise how inaccessible the airport has been in the past.  Also planned are relocations of some of our maternity services and upgrading of our existing hospitals; three new elective units so they are not competing with our main hospitals; investment in primary care, community centres and mental health units, including one in Sligo; and investment in a technical university that will enable growth in education as education underpins growth. </p>  <p>  Launched as Project Ireland 2040 in tandem with the national development plan, the finalised national planning framework signals a shift away from the aspirational plans of the past that came after national development plans and were not underpinned by a capital investment plan.  The national planning framework and the development plan are being followed through on by the three regional assemblies, bringing forward complementary regional, spatial and economic strategies, and linking strategic planning and investment at the national level with the physical planning and local economic and community development functions of local authorities.  Formulation of the regional spatial and economic strategies has commenced.</p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Imelda Munster being parochial about Drogheda.  I would be happy to talk at length about D&uacute;n Laoghaire if anybody wants me to.  That is where my allegiance lies.  However, I am also very aware that this is a national plan.  If Deputy Munster is supportive of this plan and supports her local authority, she too can play a role in developing her community and constituency, not with rhetoric but with actual supportive ways of implementing this plan.  She too can be part of the growth of Drogheda.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the national planning framework will be supported by a &euro;3 billion regeneration and development fund for rural and urban development, and a new national regeneration and development agency.  I could talk all week about the national planning framework plan.  I have had it under my arm, in my car and at home for the last year and a half.  I have been reading it back to front, upside down and inside out.</p><p>This is something that I am passionate about.  I have no qualification in planning but I do have vast experience in it.  I can see the massive potential this plan has for my children and their children in this country. </p> <p> I pay tribute to the team in the Department for its commitment and dedication, and the enormity of the sacrifice those people have made in the past year to make this plan happen.  The plan is about giving every citizen, young and old, equality of opportunity, quality of life and the potential to succeed in whatever area they want to succeed in.  For that reason I am passionately supportive of this plan, and will do whatever it takes to support my local authority and the Government in its implementation.  </p></speech>

There have been a number of speeches in the House on this issue over the last number of days.  I thought that Deputy Bailey gave a fine speech.  She spoke about evidence-based policy and detailed consultations.  I would love it if that were the case.  It was certainly well argued and well intentioned and I would support it, were it not for the unedifying spectacle of a scramble in recent weeks by Government Ministers, Deputies and councillors to somehow allocate funding for their particular regions or areas.  I believe the plan was renamed at the 11th hour for fear that it be considered an urban plan - or perhaps for fear that it be considered a rural plan - because it had to have something for everyone in the audience.  If the plan was based on evidence-based policy, detailed consultation and best planning frameworks, I would be delighted to support it.  However, the evidence to date does not appear to show that this is the case.</p>  <p>  I have looked through the various aspects of the plan.  I am looking at it from a Kildare perspective, considering what we need and do not have there.  The first reaction from my own constituents, and even from local media, was one of confusion.  There is a long list of projects across the country, and I am familiar with those in my own area.  I imagine that the same applies across this House.  Items such as the Sallins bypass were listed as items to be delivered by 2040, as is the Naas to Newbridge N7 widening.  Multiple other plans are also scheduled to be completed before that date.  Deputy Cassells has been arguing for the Slane bypass for many years, and it is also included in the plan.  My constituents, and indeed my local radio station, KFM, were quite confused and spoke about the plans on the airwaves.  They said that some of these projects are already under way, and that they drive past them every morning.  These projects are well advanced.  Some of them have been going on for ten years, between planning, pre-planning and consultations.  There is confusion and scepticism as to how these projects are part of a new plan, when in fact most of them have already started. </p>  <p>  I will return to the subject of connectivity later but I note with some degree of scepticism that the national broadband plan is one of the projects the Government is seeking to deliver.  I wish it well with that project, but it does not inspire confidence.  </p>  <p>  On the theme of innovation, I asked a question only a few hours ago of the Minister of Health, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, about Government spending on research and development and on innovation.  Another recent plan, published to much fanfare and heraldry, was Innovation 2020.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy English, put great work into it and was very diligent about it.  Indeed, it is not his fault that the plan he delivered has not been implemented.  Innovation 2020 at this stage is more remarkable because of what is omitted from it rather than its implementation.  The headline target for innovation in that plan was that 2.5% GDP was to be spent on research and development funding.  Figures from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published last week show that not only have we failed to meet the 2.5% - we have spent somewhere around 1.45% - but in fact spending on research and development went backwards last year.  We spent less in 2017 than we did in 2016.  At a time when the Government must have realised that the knowledge economy and third and fourth level education are paramount to ensure continued foreign direct investment, competitive advantage, educating our workforce of the future and attracting talent, capital and investment, it is unforgivable for the State to be going backwards in terms of research and development funding.  In this context it is difficult to have confidence in Project Ireland 2040.  We cannot even manage a project for 2018.  </p>  <p>  Speaking of research and development, I would like to acknowledge the presence of Jim Sullivan, who is with us today in the Public Gallery.  He is vice-president of global research at AbbVie, which is a very successful multinational pharmaceutical company, which has a long tradition of investment in Ireland.  Indeed, it does some fine work.</p>  <p>  In terms of transport, I have spoken about the N7, the Sallins bypass and the local projects in my area.  I want to talk about public transport.  I was in London recently and I used the public transport network, including the underground.  I never fail to be inspired by the connections it has.  There are multiple airports around the city centre.  It has the Circle line, which means that it is immaterial whether one is north, south, east or west.  To go anywhere one merely has to make a couple of connections and the whole thing falls into place.  My constituents in Sallins who work in Sandyford struggle to get there.  It is a hop, skip and a jump between multiple different modes.  If they are lucky they might be able to get a train and then take a couple of Luas journeys, providing it is not travelling through College Green at a snail's pace, as it has been most days this week.  There does not seem to be the integration and connectivity such as that provided by the Circle line in London.  I have long argued for the interconnector.  It was one of the first projects that I advocated when I came into this Chamber two years ago.  I had a Topical Issue debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, shortly after he was appointed on the topic of the DART underground.  It is now listed as one of the projects in the plan.  To my knowledge there are no detailed spending figures available for it.  We do not see any further than a dotted line, which was in previous plans, including in Transport 21 over ten years ago.  My party spent &euro;500 million to advance it, including feasibility studies, bore holes, drilling and compulsory purchase orders, CPOs for certain land works, but unfortunately it remains a dotted line.  I wish the Government well on this because it is absolutely imperative that the project is advanced.  </p>  <p>  If we look at education there are grand promises about 90,000 primary school places and many thousands of secondary school places.  Yesterday I debated with the Minister for Education and brought up St. Joseph's school, Kilcock.  It is situated in a building dating from the 1950s.  The school urgently needs a new build.  The town of Kilcock had 1,000 people when it was built; it now has 6,500, and yet it is still struggling with the same school.  It has four permanent classrooms and nine prefabs.  We cannot get the money to pay for a new school.  Immediately after my contribution in the House I am travelling to an emergency meeting with parents in Naas Community College to try to explain why the Government committed to build at the school a number of years ago but the building work has not started yet.  As much as we might wish the plan well, it is very hard to have confidence in these kinds of plans when we cannot deliver today, never mind in 22 years' time.  </p>  <p>  I have spoken about higher education and the importance of research and development and innovation to the economy.  Universities are crying out for investment.  They need it in terms of knowledge capital, intellectual capital and research spending.  They are also crying out for facilities.  Bricks and mortar are required.  The programme for research at third-level institutions, PRTLI, was a fund which existed all through Fianna F&aacute;il's tenure in government.  The party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, initiated it in the early 2000s and it continued through some philanthropic investments, which were matched with State funding.  It existed until this current Government took office.  Lipservice is now being paid to it.  There is a trickle of money still left in the programme.  Two and a half years after this Government took office, the university sector has no knowledge or certainty about what will replace PRTLI.  How can the universities construct a new science building, a new laboratory or a new library in the absence of funding?  It is very difficult to talk about education and the need for innovation when we see these kinds of gaps.  </p>  <p>  On tourism, I must give credit where it is due and say that the Wild Atlantic Way is a fantastic project.  I had the pleasure of cycling it last summer on my holidays with my family in Mayo.  It is well heralded and successful.  It was so successful that a marketing architect was poached to launch its marketing strategy, namely, Mr. John Concannon.  He is doing spectacularly well.  There are 15 or 16 people in his team, which does nothing except spin for the Government all day long.  I certainly credit him with coming up with the idea for the Wild Atlantic Way.  Unfortunately the Grand Canal Way lingers.  The project to link Naas to Sallins, to Ardclough and into south Dublin would be a fantastic initiative.  It would drive tourism and active living, and all of the positives we are trying to address across the country.  However, it lingers at the end of a very long list of projects.  I have raised this issue recently with a number of officials, and indeed with the Minister for Rural and Community Affairs, Deputy Ring.  I hope that some progress will be made on that.  We would love to see all of these things happen, but when they are not happening today it is hard to see how they are going to happen tomorrow or in 22 years' time.  </p>  <p>  On health I would have loved to have seen some kind of technological advancements in the plan, for example a commitment to a national patient identifier or a digital ID, which could transform the health system.  One would imagine it would not be terribly difficult to do but it is part of the problem in terms of the disconnected approach that exists at the moment.  These are the kinds of things we would really hope to see.  </p>  <p>  On climate change, I understand there is a significant amount of climate change spending in the plan, which is to be welcomed.  </p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>However, the Government argued trenchantly against the Climate Emergency Measures Bill only a week ago because it cannot commit to renewable energy generation in the next 20 years.  On the one hand, we are hearing that all this money will be spent and that climate change will be addressed but on the other, the Government came into the Chamber and opposed an Opposition Bill because it said it could not commit to meeting renewable targets.  It is very difficult to understand where all of that is going.</p> <p> I wish to talk about governance.  When I was started as a member of Kildare County Council, we could not spend &euro;10,000 on a road without oversight by the senior engineer, consultation among all the members, a vote in the chamber and a signing-off process.  That was best practice, evidence-based and a good use of public money.  Unbelievably, with regard to the &euro;110 billion, &euro;120 billion or &euro;130 billion of public money - I forgot what is being said now but it is an awful lot of money - there is no governance council or national infrastructure commission such as that called for by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We published a Bill on governance and public spending, which has not been adopted by the Government, and we hear there may not even be a vote on any of these matters.  However, I wish the plan well.  I wish for it to be successful but that remains to be seen.  Past performance certainly is an indicator of future behaviour and past performance is not great in this area.</p></speech>

As chairman of the Fine Gael Party, I am immensely proud of the contribution my colleagues in Fine Gael have made to it, from the Ministers sitting at Cabinet - this was very much an all-Government approach by our partnership Government - to our Fine Gael Deputies and Senators.  We had many long, tortuous meetings of our parliamentary party where we discussed at great length all the different aspects of both the national planning framework and the national development plan and how all of that has come together now in Project Ireland 2040.  We did so not because we are parochial about our individual constituencies and counties but because we all care passionately about our country and a development that will be planned and that we will see happen in a structured way.</p>  <p>  For the first time in the history of the State, our special plan will be backed up by solid investment in terms of a &euro;116 billion capital plan, all of which will be underpinned by legislation.  That means the plan we put in place will be followed through, that it will be implemented on a day-by-day, case-by-case basis and that it will have money to back it up.  Such an approach should ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past when previous development plans failed to deliver structured development of our country.  Whether it was the bungalow blitz of the 1980s or the sprawl of Dublin during the Celtic tiger years, our country has been failed by not sticking to the plans that were drawn up or working to plans that were more designed on the electoral cycle than on the long-term vision we have introduced here.</p>  <p>  For my county of Kildare, the plan is vital.  Due to our mix of urban and rural areas, as the Ceann Comhairle is all too familiar with, and our close proximity to Dublin, this plan is about stopping the sprawl of Dublin, making sure that its density increases to a higher density, that the brownfield infill will happen and that Kildare, Meath and Wicklow do not become suburbs of Dublin.  That is crucial.</p>  <p>  For Kildare, a new acute mental health unit for Lakeview is imperative.  Currently, capacity is at 140% in the Lakeview unit.  The then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, allocated &euro;5.5 million to Lakeview in late 2016 for the improvement of the infrastructure in that unit, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware.  However, that would only provide an additional eight beds and a high observation unit.  The point that I and the management made was that this was not enough.  We need to grow the capacity.  As the Ceann Comhairle is all too aware, Kildare people must go to Portlaoise, Tallaght and St. James' hospitals to overflow beds because we cannot cater for those who have acute mental health needs in Kildare, never mind the community support and step-down facilities that are needed also.</p>  <p>  A few months after that, I brought the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, to Naas to meet with the senior management in Lakeview, Donal O'Hanlon and Paul Brophy, and the team.  I brought the Minister of State's successor, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to Lakeview as recently as last December to impress upon him the need for a new build.  We now have that in our plan.  That new development is crucial and as you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, the Lakeview unit currently adjoins Naas General Hospital and the ability of that unit to be a new space that could allow us increase the capacity in Naas General Hospital is crucial also.  That represents joined-up thinking.  There is reference in the national action plan, Project Ireland 2040, to 600 new acute beds to be delivered throughout the country by 2040.  We will have an existing building adjoining Naas General Hospital and should be able to deliver that additional capacity much sooner.  </p>  <p>  When we talk about our health service, and Naas General Hospital, we need to be aware that the population of Kildare has grown by 100,000 in the past 30 years, so we should not be surprised that there are people on trolleys.  There are massive capacity issues in Naas General Hospital, as there are even today.  The way we address that is by providing those additional beds and additional space, and a key component of that was the endoscopy unit that was announced for Naas General Hospital.  That key element was very close to being delivered in 2011 but was then shelved.  That had a devastating impact on the hospital, our health care services and waiting lists in Kildare.  The endoscopy unit is back on track.  It has planning permission.  It needs to be able to go out to tender.  It has only two years left on its planning permission and I will continue to push for that to be delivered, as I pushed for it to be in this national development plan.  It is a crucial development to ensure that Naas General Hospital's position within the hospital grouping is secured and has a strong foundation into the future.</p>  <p>  In terms of our road infrastructure, there has been criticism in the House and in the media of some projects on the list that are progressed.  The idea that we would announce a national capital development plan and not reference the need to widen the M7 motorway or a ring road for Athy is ludicrous.  People would say, "Where is it?".  In terms of it being progressed, we are accused by the Opposition that this is a negative development.  However, the fact that we progressed the southern distributor route for Athy during a recession was crucial.  We got that funding when there was no money in the country to bring that road through to planning stage - the planning permission we now have - and within a few months, we will have diggers on site in Athy, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware, because it is something he fought for also.  I will not take any criticism for the fact that the ring road for Athy and the M7 are progressed.  They were progressed when the country had no money.  Imagine what we can do now with a growing economy as we continue to grow jobs and increase development.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the reason there are so many people sitting in their cars on the M7, which we need to widen, is because of the failed policies of the past.  Many constituents from Kildare and Laois commute to Dublin every day.  The ease with which they can get there is important but having locally developed jobs and industry in our area so that all of those people do not have to commute is crucial also.  That is at the heart of Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Other areas such as the &euro;100 million for large-scale sports capital infrastructure development is crucial.  I very much hope our county grounds in St. Conleth's Park, Newbridge, can access some of that money.  It desperately needs a new, modern stand.  We have one of the poorest county grounds in the country but want to have one of the best because we are a very proud GAA county.  I hope that Kildare GAA will benefit from that fund, as will all of the many clubs that have benefitted in recent years from sports capital grants.  The commitment of a sports capital grants in the coming years is also crucial.</p>  <p>  The situation in our health sector is telling.  In 2011, no hospitals were being built.  By the time this plan is finished, we will be constructing ten hospitals, three of which are under way already.  That is crucial.  When people talk about waiting lists, it is down to capacity.  It is also down to our primary care centres, planning for one of which in Athy we hope to be applying for very soon.  Those are the developments we want to roll out.  St. Vincent's Hospital, Athy was one of the 90 community care facilities that we also want to see upgraded and its capacity increased.  It should be a building fit for modern day use due to the great care it provides.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 covers many different areas.  A rural regeneration and development fund will provide an additional &euro;1 billion.  There will be investment in our towns, villages and outlying rural areas.  That will be on top of existing funding, such as the town and village renewal scheme and all the rest.  The &euro;2 billion urban regeneration fund will significantly benefit large rural towns of over 10,000 people of which there are 41 in the country.  Newbridge, in Kildare, will have the potential to access this funding and that will allow it to be an even greater driver in our local economy and provide the jobs that all the people who live in Kildare need.  They will not have to travel to Dublin for high-quality jobs.</p>  <p>  There is a &euro;8.4 billion allocation for a school building programme between 2018 and 2027 to deliver an annual average of 20,000 permanent school places a year.  That is desperately needed.  We need extra provision in school places at second level, in particular for children with special needs in our mainstream schools.  We urgently need progress on the planned extensions to Athy community college, the Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen, St. Conleth's community college and Patrician, Newbridge as well, but the broader issues of future provision beyond that is crucial also.  We need to see progress on that.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has now been given the money to move that on and I look forward to the results of ongoing demographic surveys.  I stay in touch with Department officials and continue to highlight the need for certainty for parents that they will have that provision and those school places about which there is a great deal of anxiety, with which the Ceann Comhairle is all too familiar.</p>  <p>  Broadband was mentioned earlier.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that the 19% of premises in south Kildare which depend on the national broadband plan really need it.  I have been in consultation and raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on the floor of the House within only the past few weeks.  The national broadband plan must be given every chance to work and if it does not, we need a plan B.  The reason we are at 19% is that the national broadband plan has driven the private sector to roll out commercial broadband over the past five years to 74% of premises in the county while in the coming period commercial broadband will be provided to the remaining 7% as part of Eir's 300,000.  The existence of the national broadband plan has driven the &euro;2.75 billion investment by the private sector to roll out commercial broadband over the past five years.  If the plan had not been in existence and if we had not had a tender process, the commercial sector would have been a lot slower to deliver that.</p> <p> It is not possible to get to every element of Project Ireland 2040 in the ten minutes I have been given.</p></speech>

I hope I will be as good as Deputy Heydon and get in as many of my local areas as possible.  It is the second time he did it today.  He did it already with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, when he was discussing family resource centres.  I will approach Project Ireland 2040 from two perspectives with the first being as spokesperson on children and youth affairs for Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I have gone through the plan in depth and I am disappointed.  When we were talking about everything that was going to be invested in schools, I was looking at the mirror of what was going to be done with child care facilities.  We are looking at population growth of the order of 1 million people in the next number of years.  I looked for funding to support urban and rural communities to develop private or community child care facilities but all I can see popping up at me on drilling down into the plan is the &euro;6.8 million which was already put in place and increased this year.  When one applies that among the 26 city and county child care facilities nationally, that equates to &euro;221,000 per annum.  When one divides that further according to the seven tiers of capital funding for which private and community child care facilities can apply, some will get &euro;50,000 and some will get &euro;20,000 and some might be able to amalgamate the two.  In Galway, for example, where there are 225 child care facilities providing full-day services, that means approximately seven projects will be successful.  Nationally, that means seven projects per county will come through on an annual basis, which is disappointing given that counties like Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim are already at 97% capacity and will be looking for capital investment.  We are not talking capital investment of &euro;50,000 or &euro;20,000 in these cases but about &euro;1.2 million or &euro;1.3 million projects to build the centres of excellence required.  Child care services are already being provided in portacabins outside Carrickmacross.  There are a number of child care providers looking for investment nationally, including in Kerry or at Mountbellew in Deputy Eugene Murphy's constituency where there are capacity issues right now.  To get its service over the line, that provider needs &euro;180,000 to put on an extra room to cater for the 26 children who are already using a room in a local national school.  Those rooms can be also used for aftercare.  In that regard, &euro;50,000 is not a great deal of money.  I use that as a particular example.</p>  <p>  It would be disingenuous to fail to acknowledge the major projects in health and for hospitals.  The position for every child who will need access to hospitals locally is laid out clearly.  However, in relation to the replacement and refurbishment of the 90 community nursing homes nationally, not one community child care facility was acknowledged in the plan.  A planning application has already been submitted on the Portiuncula ward block.  A lot of people are wondering where it is at.  It is already on the map.  Page 92 of the plan refers to disability services and states that the NDP will continue to support the capital programme for people with disabilities.  I am disappointed it did not refer to "people and children with disabilities".  On page 93 of the National Development Plan, child care investment projects are set out and reference is made to ensuing equality and supply of sufficient child care spaces.  Yet again, there is no mention of the buildings child care facilities will use.  The plan refers to the youth services to support and target disadvantaged young people.  We already have a very good DEIS programme but we are still talking about the schools completion programme which was there under previous Governments.  While the programme is excellent, it needs investment.  That can be done here and now and does not need to be under a national plan.</p>  <p>  The continued development of ICT and standards for Tusla are mentioned.  Anyone who listens to questions from me to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, every month will know that ICT in Tusla is critical.  We have had many cases in the past 12 months, including the Molly case and the Grace case, and we all know it was down to paperwork.  Unless we have in place the proper infrastructure for people to do their day's work, we are at nothing.  There must be accountability and traceability and we must invest in technology.  We should not be talking just about technology today, we should be talking about upgrading it and moving away from the pen and paper.  Oberstown has been on the agenda since I arrived in the House.  Only &euro;1 million was left to be spent there this year.  One questioned in the beginning whether it was a suitable site because it was being governed by the OPW.  It is down to doors at this stage, I understand.  I wonder why Oberstown is still on the agenda.  I spoke about the &euro;6.8 million which does not hit the mark at all.</p>  <p>  I said at the outset that I would approach this from two perspectives.  I was going to speak as a spokesperson for the first half of my contribution and then get parochial for the second half.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, will be glad to be here to hear about the parochial.</p></speech>

The extension of the western rail corridor could increase passengers and tourism.  Why, in the name of God, are we looking for another review of it?  There are people in Tuam who are dying to be like people in Waterford.  They are dying to put in their greenway, not on the line but adjacent to it.  Why can we not carry out the feasibility study to show the beauty and opportunity for rural Ireland in running that from Athenry to Tuam, Miltown and on to Claremorris?  I do not want to remove the western rail corridor; I am talking about putting this adjacent to it.  The space between the two hedges is 90 ft wide and it could be used in this way.  A programme is coming out in a few weeks seeking expressions of interest in greenways.  Is the further review on the rail corridor going to delay it?  It is very disappointing for the people of Tuam who are very ambitious and who want their greenway.  I cannot blame them and in fact I am fully supportive.</p>  <p>  CFRAMs is a hot topic for me because I live beside the Shannon on one side and I have the Atlantic in Kinvara on the other side.  I was disappointed when I saw the big projects laid out for the future in Limerick, Tralee, Dundalk, Carlingford and Drogheda.  There is no mention of the Burren lowlands, which project is at engineering stage.  I would have thought the Burren lowlands project would have made it into a plan for the next 22 years as with the gate at Portumna to prevent flooding.  It is the only gap all the way along the Shannon and it is where Emerald Star line comes in.  I look forward to the gate which is a listed CFRAM project.  I do not see it here which is a bit disappointing.  On the other hand, I should be reassured that Athlone is being well looked after.  They will sort out their flooding in Athlone and send it down to Portumna, thank you very much.</p>  <p>  Staying with water, the eastern and midlands water supply project is at consultation stage.  What does that mean?  For those listening in, it means the pipe will go the 170 km from Parteen on the lower part of the Shannon basin to Dublin.</p><p>It is projected we will have a water crisis in Dublin by 2050.  If I thought this was to assist in addressing some of the issues regarding flooding, alleviating problems on the west coast or helping people in the east, I would be very supportive of it.  However, I do not know if that is the case and we need more communication on that.</p> <p> In regard to the greenways project strategy, the project is to be delivered in 2018-19 and includes the completion of the Kildare and Meath sections of the greenway, but it also refers to the Galway to Dublin greenway.  I found that amazing for the simple reason that there has not been much engagement in consultation.  The last time it was decided there would be a greenway going from Dublin to Galway, it hit a road block because the planners drew the map and got the line where it was going to go but they forgot to ask the farmers about the land.  If they are talking about having this finished in 2018-19, what is the position in regard to consultation?  I am very supportive of it but I would like to have an understanding on it.</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to talk about the marketing of the Shannon.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, referenced this earlier in regard to the development of the lakelands district, of which I am wholeheartedly supportive given how wonderful the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East have been.  However, we are squeezed in the middle, although, to be fair, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is there himself.  It would be wonderful to think this could be done at a fairly lively pace and not be put on the back foot.</p></speech>

The Department exists to address the connected challenges of our country, the rural parts of our country in particular, which are being significantly left behind where they need to be in terms of modern telecommunications infrastructure.  We are also, as a country, playing catch-up on our obligations in regard to climate change.  The national development plan gives us a means to deliver on these objectives in a much more comprehensive and fundamental way.  We will continue to use our natural resources in a sustainable manner to drive change, to transform rural Ireland, to support employment and to protect our people and our planet for future generations.  The national development plan is the first plan in a decade and represents a step-change in our efforts to meet our climate objectives.</p>  <p>  Some have criticised the plan as not being ambitious enough but, far too often in the past, there have been bold visions that were accompanied by a lack of finance and a lack of authority to implement them.  This is a practical plan with the funding commitment to deliver upon it.  The national development plan commits to expenditure of almost &euro;22 billion for climate action - that is, &euro;1 in every &euro;5 that is being spent over the next decade will be climate-related.  Some &euro;14 billion of this will be investments by our semi-State companies.  With this plan, we are moving from being climate laggards to climate leaders in Europe.</p>  <p>  The commitments we have set out in the national development plan to further our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient society will also be central to delivery of the national planning framework, which will influence where we live, where we work and how we travel.  The national development plan envisages a radical step-change, with &euro;4 billion on upgrading energy efficiency of our residential commercial and public buildings, including all of our schools built prior to 2008, and &euro;1 billion on rolling out the most energy efficient and climate friendly heating technologies in our buildings.  We will have at least 500,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2030 and we will roll out the charging infrastructure to make this a reality.  We are going to ban non-zero emissions vehicles being sold in Ireland from 2030 and no NCT certificate will be issued for non-zero emissions vehicles from 2045.  We are now explicitly committing to ending the production of electricity from coal at Moneypoint by 2025, becoming one of the first countries in Europe to do so.  We are the first country in Europe to introduce a nationwide ban on the sale of smoky coal.  These decisive actions are ensuring that our children and their children have access to clean air.</p>  <p>  Our semi-State companies will collectively spend almost &euro;14 billion over the next decade under the national development plan on renewable electricity investments, smarter meter deployment, grid upgrades and interconnection to cater for the growing demand and to diversify our sources of energy supply.  Solar panels on our homes and community-led electricity and energy products offer a real opportunity for local economic growth.  Project Ireland 2040 is putting our climate ambition into practical action.  The most innovative aspect of the plan will be the establishment of a climate action fund of &euro;500 million to leverage further investment from the private sector to finance our transition to a low carbon economy.  There is also another &euro;500 million in a disruptive technologies fund.  This provides us with the tools to support innovative solutions to our climate and future economic challenges.</p>  <p>  We are also putting in place a fund of &euro;1 billion to support provincial towns and rural communities.  This allows people with good ideas at long last to turn them into practical solutions.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy will know, there are 18,000 ha of cutaway bog north of Lanesborough in the Mount Dillon complex.  We intend to reflood that cutaway bog, with the climate benefits this will provide.  It will create one of Europe's biggest wetland parks, with cycleways, walkways and even its own railway.  This fund is very much a "get up and go" fund.  It will support communities like Elphin, where people have come together and come forward with an innovative plan, and also Rooskey, Castlerea and Boyle, where communities have come together and decided how they are going to build on the strengths they have in their own towns, and which can now access a fund to do that.  We have been very innovative in doing this in Roscommon and we have shown we can provide that leadership.  There is now an opportunity for other counties and communities across the country to follow our lead and example.</p>  <p>  Early implementation will be essential in order that we capture the full climate benefits of these measures and do not store up problems with achieving our targets over the next decade.  The radical step-change represented by the national development plan will need to be matched by efforts in all sectors of our economy.  These expenditure commitments will need to be complemented by taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change.  These are the other three legs of the climate action chair.  The challenge ahead of us on climate is clear.  It is the work of us, as politicians, to bridge the gulf between the global challenge and our national responsibilities, between Ireland's obligations and every single person's responsibility.</p>  <p>  What we are missing in our towns and villages across Roscommon, Galway and the other counties of this country is young people.  We see clubs struggling to field teams.  Young people are back at Christmas and Easter and during the summer holidays but every single community deserves to be able to keep local people in their own community.  I had a conversation with Canon Liam Devine, who is in Loughglinn after leaving the town of Athlone.  He told a story about last Christmas and the &Eacute;ire &Oacute;g team in west Roscommon.  On St. Stephen's Day the local team played the emigrants.  Canon Devine, who has a big interest in football, said to them, "We have a great team this year", until someone turned around and told him, "They will all be gone next week", because it was the emigrants who had won that game.  It is a sad reflection of what is going on right across rural Ireland.</p><p> The national development plan and the planning framework are about turning that around.  One of the key planks in the context of doing that is the delivery of the national broadband plan in every single community, parish and village in Ireland.  That alone will deliver the type of efficiency about which we are talking.  It will also encourage young people to return to live in those communities and set up businesses there.  I understand the frustration and anger over the delays in the process.  We have received promise after promise from both telecoms companies and my predecessors but I am determined to deliver.  I want to harness the anger to which I refer in order to secure high-capacity broadband and a network that will meet the needs of our generation, of our children and of their children.  We need to put in place a network that will cater for our future needs.  I am committed to moving ahead with the procurement process that is in place.  My Department is working to a timeline for selecting the preferred bidder by this September.  We might be able to achieve that sooner in light of the single-bidder scenario.  I am also committed to ensuring the deployment of high speed broadband to almost 540,000 premises across the national broadband plan State intervention area and to have this completed within a three-year timeframe.</p> <p> We face a huge challenge but this plan is a new beginning.  People will find weaknesses in it and it is the Opposition's job to identify those weaknesses.  We have a plan, let us start implementing it.  We should, by all means, identify weaknesses in it.  Let us ensure that it is reviewed regularly and adapted to meet our needs.  What we must do - this is the purpose of the plan - is create an economy for our people.  It is not about raising children to serve an economy when they become adults.  For far too long, we have listened to the economists; it is time we started listening to our people at every crossroads the length and breadth of the country.  We must listen to their needs and then adapt our economy in order to meet them.</p></speech>

It has had no development plan whatever.  The absence of a plan, combined with the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il policy of no investment, has led to the sloppy, haphazard urban sprawl which radiates from Dublin into towns located in south Ulster and Connaught.  It has emptied swathes of the country.  Even the Minister's county has suffered greatly from the damage caused by lack of investment in recent years.</p><p>The proposed increased investment over the next five years is only marginally ahead of the rate of inflation in the construction industry.  Looked at in the context of the increased population in the same period, the result of this plan will lead to, at best, the economy standing still over the next five years.  The major problem I have with it is that everything is back-ended towards the latter part of the period of the plan.  It is nuts to do that for a 20 year policy.  It is cynical for the Government to say it will do most of the development for the country in 20 years' time when few of them will be left in the Chamber never mind in government.</p><p>I will speak briefly about my own county.  Every Deputy will plead the best case for his or her county believing that he or she has good reason to do so.  Meath is absolutely different.  Meath is at the bottom of almost every single investment criteria in the State.  It is a proud and great county but the level of funding going into Meath is incredible.  Meath has the lowest number of garda&iacute; <i>per capita,</i>receives some of the lowest amounts for roads, its rents are continually among the highest, Meath County Council has the lowest income <i>per capita</i>, the lowest staff <i>per capita</i>and the lowest level of business rates.  It has one of the lowest levels of mental health investments and has the lowest investment in children's services <i>per capita</i>.</p><p>When they woke up this morning, most workers who live in Meath left the county in order to get to their places of employment.  That does not happen in any other county.  Meath people commute more and further than their counterparts in any other county.  The list of metrics is endless.  This situation must change.  However, there is no change in this national development plan in which the Government has given Meath the clippings of tin when it comes to investment.  This Government has assigned Meath the role of a dormitory or commuter county except without providing people with the means of commuting.  One of the most glaring and damaging omissions from the plan is the absence of any mention of a Navan to Dublin rail line.  Navan is the biggest town in the country which does not have a rail line.  Families are hammered with three and four-hour commutes daily, and are obliged to shoulder all the financial and family costs to which that gives rise.  We are talking about a 34 km extension, promised for significantly over 25 years, which would service one of the fastest growing population areas in the country.  The Government now tells us that the 250,000 living in the Meath area is not sufficient for a rail line to go to the centre of the county.  That is hokum.  The rail line was included in development plans long before the population grew to its current level.  The Department's own website clearly states  that Fine Gael mothballed this project due to the reduction in Exchequer capital investment in the programmes.  The one thing Meath has plenty of is Ministers but they are about as useful as mudguards on a tortoise.</p></speech>

I went to look for my old election posters when I heard the announcement because it is a sure sign that an election is coming; it is definitely not a sure sign that metro north, metro link or anything like it, will be coming.  The people of north county Dublin have been fooled too many times before, and we will not believe it until we see it.  Putting it in a glossy brochure or advertising it in the cinema is not the same thing as delivering it.  We will wait and see.</p>  <p>  The capital projects relating to health under Project Ireland 2040 are, primarily, repackaged and relaunched projects, not unlike metro north, and many of them are already under way.  Two of the headline announcements were the national children's hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, despite these being announced years ago.  A sample of some of the other the previously announced projects include the national cancer strategy capital developments.  These projects include: the national programme for radiation oncology at Cork, Galway and Dublin, which Senator James Reilly, when he was Minister for Health, launched; the national forensic mental health service hospital at Portrane, which was announced by former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny; and the National Rehabilitation Hospital redevelopment in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is already under way and which obtained planning permission long ago as 2015.  Even when the latter is built, it will not add any extra capacity.</p>  <p>  Of those new projects announced, many are long overdue.  For example, a ward block was announced for University Hospital Limerick even though this was needed years ago.  The hospital consistently deals with approximately 40 to 50 patients on trolleys each day.  Last year, there were 8,869 patients left on trolleys in Limerick alone.  Similarly, we welcome the announcement of a ward block for Waterford, particularly as there were 5,525 patients left on trolleys in University Hospital Waterford in 2017.  A new endoscopy suite was announced for Naas General Hospital and, while this is welcome, I hope it fares better than the surgery theatre there which has not been used once in 15 years because there are not enough staff to run it.  The latter is despite the fact that nearly 7,000 people are on waiting lists at the hospital.</p>  <p>   The announcement of a new hospital for Cork is good news.  Cork needs a new hospital.  There were nearly 10,000 patients left on trolleys between the Cork University Hospital, CUH, and Mercy University Hospital in Cork city last year.  A new hospital is long overdue.  We hope that a new hospital does not mean scaling down services at CUH or the Mercy.</p>  <p>  I welcome the commitments to genuinely increase capacity.  However, capacity is a twofold issue and it means nothing without the recruitment and retention of staff.  The plan is heralded as preparing Ireland for the future; all the while, the health announcements in it will barely see us meet current demand and unmet need.</p></speech>

This, of itself, is a good development.  For far too long, we have staggered from Government to Government, mandate to mandate, budget to budget, on the basis of those who shout loudest and hold ministerial office delivering or being expected to deliver big ticket projects for their own constituencies.  This approach has served us badly historically and without doubt has contributed to the imbalance that is evident across Ireland where Dublin is the major organ of the State without which all other regions of the country would fail to survive.</p>  <p>  I will contradict myself somewhat as I genuinely believe that there is a flaw in this project, that is, the failure to direct adequate funding and strategic infrastructural development towards the north-west region, specifically, the central Border counties, including my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  There are certain mentions of Cavan and Monaghan.  The commitment to delivering the N2 Clontibret to the Border, the N2 Ardee to south of Castleblaney and the N3 Virginia bypass are all welcome and important, but these are long-flagged developments.  The reiteration of the Government's commitment to "participation in the further development of the A5" North of the Border rings hollow.  Let me offer a view of connectivity from Dublin to the north west.  In my view, dual-carriageway has reached over capacity and is outdated.  I believe in time we will look back and ask why we did not go ahead and build a motorway.  What of a high speed rail service, Dublin to Letterkenny, with stops in Monaghan and Strabane and a spur to Derry.  These are all worthy of consideration.</p>  <p>  What of the restoration of the Ulster Canal?  There is a mention of it in the document, but to move on to "the next phase".  What is that and when will it happen?  I want to see the Ulster Canal - a watercourse - restored as an inland waterway that will bring a new vista and new life and activities into areas long neglected, including Clones and Monaghan town.  Greenway developments are fine but I now want to see a waterway.</p>  <p>  Looking at the issue of health of which my colleague has spoken, I note the redevelopment of St. Davnet's campus in Monaghan signalled for providing a new primary care centre, a mental health unit and a 20-bed elderly residential setting.  All of that, of course, is welcome as far as it goes.  Sadly, as I know all of these projects only too well, there are disappointments for some behind each of these steps.  That said, the biggest problem I have here is that these are not new projects or proposals.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in this plan, although I welcome the fact that we are now talking planning long term, that is innovative or game-changing, in particular, for the central Border counties and the north-west region, which will allow us to address the historical imbalance and neglect by successive Governments.  At a time when the reunification of the island is no longer a distant vision or pipedream as some may have seen it, there was an opportunity here - I hope it is still there and that this is not set in stone - for us to start to plan for this major transformation of the island and its potential, North and South.  By 2040, I believe Ireland will be united and, therefore, Project Ireland 2040 should have been a framework to make this process as seamless infrastructurally as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200037#NN00300"><p>It is good to be here welcoming a good plan.  One must look at where we started from, that is, areas, in particular, the north west, that effectively were left behind.  I refer to the connectivity that we are talking about in terms of roads, the N14 Lifford to Letterkenny, the A5 and the roads that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about.  It is the first time that the north west has been connected correctly to what somebody described as the main economic driver of the country, which at this stage is County Dublin.  There is the road connection to the north west, the rail connection to Sligo and then the vision that will be air connection to Knock airport, which is much more than a regional airport.  That is the real benefit that the north west will experience in the future.  Of course, there is the connection of the roads: the N17 from Sligo down as far as Tuam - the Tuam-Gort bypass is built and the connection between Galway and Limerick is built - and the connection of the M20 from Limerick to Cork.  That is the connectivity required.  One of the staggering statistics that amazed me from the previous census was that two thirds of the population of the island live within 20 km of the sea.  It is so important to connect up all that area, from Belfast to Dublin, down into my county of Wexford, the connection between Oilgate and Rosslare connecting the ports, the connectivity between Rosslare, New Ross, Waterford and Cork, and back up along the Atlantic corridor.  For the first time ever, we have a plan that will connect all those areas - roads, people, airports, railway links and, of course, the most important aspect of all of this, jobs.  It revolves around jobs.  There are 660,000 jobs to be created.  There are jobs that will be operational in 2040 that have not even been invented yet.</p>  <p>  There are so many good projects in this plan.  The school programme, at primary and post-primary, amounts to &euro;8.8 billion, but that is not only for the schools and classrooms.  As we come up to the completion of that programme, it is to move on to the next stage, which we did not get to do because we did not have the money in the past decade, for PE rooms and computer rooms so that we can start the children off with good habits in young classes, achieve improvements in post-primary classes and move on from there.</p>  <p>  The three elective hospitals are important.  We have too many waiting lists.  We also have also too many hospitals.  The three elective hospitals that will be built I hope will be of a scale where we can do away with the waiting lists.  We can use the economy of scale in Dublin, Cork and Galway for those three new units, to 2,600 beds, for the hospital groups to get themselves organised and to put in place those beds where the population bases are and use the hospitals to the best of their abilities.  It is not that they all will be in one hospital.  A general hospital might become an area of expertise in one specific treatment or that type of thing.  It is important to have that vision for this.</p>  <p>  We also must remember that there will also be the technological universities.  That will be so important for my region because it has suffered more than any other region.  We have the lowest level of third-level participation because there was no university in the south east.  When one conducts the analysis on why students do not return, it shows it is because they leave for college and the smallest percentage returns.  That has had a significant impact on the region of the south east.</p>  <p>  The other aspect of this that is important for my county, Wexford, is Rosslare Port.  It will be really important in terms of Brexit.  I spoke about the connectivity from Wexford to Dublin - the major economic organ of the State - and to Cork.  While everybody is of the view that all roads lead to either Dublin or Cork, in my view, the opposite is the case.  The roads lead to every other part of the country.  That is the future so that we do not have everything having to be done in two or three areas, and we can develop the counties that are within an hour and a half distance with motorway network being constructed around the country.  Those areas will then thrive and become economic generators in their own right.</p></speech>

I believe it is the first time a plan such as this has been announced, committing as it does to building up our infrastructure and public services.  However, the main players in this are the people - all of us here, our children and their children - and the impact this forward-thinking will have on their lives in the future.  This is a very significant announcement.  It is a &euro;116 billion plan, a roadmap for Ireland catering for a larger population, an extra 1 million people.  We want to take different approaches to future planning by focusing not only on bricks and mortar, but also on social, economic and cultural development.  We are investing in our towns, cities and, above all, rural communities.</p> <p> Investment in our health service is a key element of the plan, and I am very supportive of the plans to improve and enhance our health service.  Capital funding for our health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was in the previous ten years.  Through these investments, together with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, we have a solid plan to create a better future for our children and a better health service for all.  A major programme of investment in health infrastructure will be guided by a recognition that the best health outcomes can be achieved by directing our health services towards primary and community care, where people's needs can be met locally, in order that our local people can have high-quality acute and emergency care provided to them in appropriate hospital settings.  This will include completion of our national hospital projects already under way.</p> <p> The development of our national children's hospital at St. James's Hospital is a landmark project which will deliver a state-of-the-art children's hospital for the country in 2022.  I fully support this project and as I travel by it daily I see the real progress that has been made on the ground in recent months and the significant impact it will have on the area.  I also welcome the plan to relocate the Coombe maternity hospital from its original site to St. James's Hospital, which will bring together adult, paediatric and maternity services all on the one campus.  We have long awaited this, particularly our maternity services.</p> <p> We will deliver 2,600 more acute hospital beds, which will make a real difference to patients and address in some way the overcrowding in our hospitals.  In addition, we will deliver 4,500 new community beds, which will provide both long and short-term beds for the elderly.  This is significant as in recent weeks many Deputies on both sides of the House have raised the significant problems faced by many elderly people trying to access long-term care beds and respite care.</p> <p> There is a commitment to improve our mental health services with investment in a 120-bed hospital in Portrane, north Dublin, as well as a ten-bed child and adolescent mental health unit, a ten-bed mental health intellectual disability unit and additional acute mental health units across the country.  I know the Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly and Finian McGrath, have warmly welcomed the opportunities that this could create for people with disabilities and older people into the future.  We will also see construction at the National Rehabilitation Hospital of a 120-bed facility, which is badly needed to support services provided at the hospital.  This plan will provide for the development of cancer facilities in line with the national cancer strategy, which is very important.</p> <p> In my own brief, I look forward to continued commitment on our drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, and the Healthy Ireland initiative, which is making great progress in promoting a healthier and more active lifestyle for people young and old.</p> <p> We in government are committed to supporting families.  Much work has already been started in this area, such as the roll-out of the affordable child care schemes, investment in early years education, and the provision of parental leave.  I hope this will continue.  I also welcome the &euro;8.4 billion investment in primary and post-primary schools, which my colleagues have spoken about.  Here in Dublin, we are seeing a significant commitment to our transport network.  I hope, if I am around in 20 years' time - at my age, I doubt I will be - to continue travelling as a senior citizen, with my free travel card, on the new Luas lines, underground and DART.</p> <p> I also welcome the commitment to improve housing stock and availability under a new &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund.  I continue to have people come into my office daily looking for both social and private housing.  I hope in the future we can consider all people for housing and not just circle the wagons around one specific kind of housing because many people in this country right across the board need housing.</p></speech>

We can all bore holes in it and say it is not to our liking, but I will be fair about it.  Where credit is due I will give it, and where I see holes in it or where I am disappointed I will point that out as well.  However, I hope at all times to be constructive in my contribution to the House.</p>  <p>  It is good to have a plan such as this laid out, to have some idea of where we are going in the future and to deal with many of the problems we have.  While we can talk about the fanfare and the launch of the plan and so on, which is fair enough, how much of it we can achieve in the long term is what I, and every Member of the House, should be interested in.  I do not disagree with anyone from whatever constituency being parochial.  We must have a national plan.  However, we must also recognise that we must try to bring with us those areas that have been left behind.  I acknowledge that in some urban areas there have been appalling difficulties, appalling poverty and bad housing as well as the difficulties we have in many parts of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  This brings me to my own constituency.  I welcome the fact that the N5, a national primary route, will now be included for development.  It should happen over the next few years.  This is the vital route from Longford to Westport, on which there is a huge amount of traffic, and which involves significant business from Roscommon and County Mayo, with many employers exporting material constantly complaining about the bad state of the roads.  As a Deputy for the region, and with other Deputies and Oireachtas Members, I have met the chambers of commerce in Galway and Mayo on numerous occasions.  Some of these companies' headquarters are in America and they have smaller units in Ireland, and they constantly complain about the state of the roads.</p>  <p>  The proposed works regarding the N5 are good.  Regarding the N4, which also goes through County Roscommon, I very much welcome the fact that the motorway will come from Mullingar to Roosky, but then we will have a long stretch of road, a big area, again going right through Roscommon and down to Sligo that will not be developed.  Again, this should be somewhere in the plan.  Admittedly, the Government has to bring it so much of the way and look at the funds it has available to do this, but we should have a longer-term plan to commit ourselves in total to bring that motorway to Sligo and eventually to Donegal.</p>  <p>  When we think of transport issues we must think of counties such as Sligo and Donegal.  All of us throughout the country accept that our regional and county roads need a lot more money.  As my party's spokesman on the OPW and flood relief, I see every week the amount of damage now being done because of weather.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has spoken very strongly about climate change here and is very committed to his role in that regard.  How much of his plans he can achieve I do not know, to be realistic.  There is a financial commitment to it because we will have to spend significant amounts of money on our infrastructure because of our changing weather patterns.  It is quite obvious that the weather patterns are changing dramatically and having a serious effect on this nation, and we will have to spend more and more resources as a result.</p>  <p>  The are other benefits for my constituency.  The focus on Athlone is good for County Roscommon as long as we keep our county boundaries.  I believe the focus on Athlone will have a ripple effect on a part of our county but not all of it.  The south and the middle of the county will do very well but I am still concerned about the north of our county because that area desperately needs development.</p>  <p>  I believe the Acting Chairman wants me to adjourn the debate.  I hereby do so.</p></speech>

To be fair, I acknowledge the role of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in keeping the northern relief road on the agenda, as he has with regard to the M20.  I was in receipt of correspondence previously from the Minister on the M20 Cork to Limerick route, but there is a need for the interurban network of roads to be facilitated also, which why I am making the case here today for the N72 and N73 bypass.</p>  <p>  The Minister may be in possession of the economic assessment case made by Indecon consultants and issued in June 2015.  It makes a strong case based on the future projected growth of towns such as Mallow.  We welcome wholeheartedly the funding provision made for the M20.  There is a parcel of funding behind it of approximately &euro;900 million, and we acknowledge some grant aid has been given through Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to allow for feasibility studies and further works on the northern relief road.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give us further clarity on timelines for the progression of the project?  Is there a possibility that further moneys might be made available for the project?  The key findings of the Indecon international economic analysis state Mallow is the largest town in the north of County Cork and is one of the fastest growing towns in Cork with regard to population.  The agrifood sector is a key sectoral strength in the immediate conurbation, and it supports more than 12,000 people in the agriculture sector alone.  We have seen the growth of Dairygold as one of the key reference points nationally for the production of milk powder and the expansion of dairy.  This is giving rise to major transport movements through HGVs, and it is putting a constraint on the local infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Is it possible for the Minister to engage further through TII, with a view to seeing whether there is a possibility for further grants to be made available, from his finite budget, to progress this project and reflect the realities of the fact Mallow is a growing town, ensuring it facilitates and dovetails with, or runs in parallel with, the M20 Cork to Limerick project?</p></speech>

The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  As a result of the national financial position, there were very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis.  For this reason the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years.  The capital plan Building on Recovery 2016-2021 and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for investment in road improvement schemes.  The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten-year capital investment plan will align with the existing capital plan, as supplemented as part of the capital plan review.  Allowing for the extra funding secured under the capital plan review, roads investment in the four year period to 2021 will be &euro;4.26 billion.</p>  <p>  The Mallow relief road is one of the limited number of improvement projects included in the original Building on Recovery plan.  TII is advancing these projects on a phased basis, in line with the annual funding allocations available to it.  The inclusion of the Mallow project reflected the fact there was recognition at Government level of the impact on the people of Mallow and on businesses in the area of the amount of traffic travelling through the town centre.  The project requires necessary project approvals.  In this context, the approval process includes compliance with the requirements of the public spending code and my Department&rsquo;s capital appraisal framework, together with the submission of the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for development consent.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council is responsible for progressing the project in liaison with TII.  In this context, I understand from TII that a feasibility report, referred to by the Deputy, on the scheme has been completed recently and that Cork County Council is now preparing a brief to commence the procurement of technical advisers to bring this project through phases one to four of TII&rsquo;s project management guidelines.  These phases cover project appraisal, design and progression through the required statutory processes.</p></speech>

Given his commitment to ensuring the interurban networks get attention throughout the country, as per his statements on the national development plan, I hope the Minister will keep Mallow in mind, and when funding becomes available to progress the schemes beyond the project appraisal, design and progressing through the statutory processes, that funding would become available to ensure the project continues and stays on the political agenda.</p></speech>

This family of four girls is on the Fingal County Council housing list, but had to leave the area to go to Dundalk as they feared for their safety.  The family chose to come to this area as it has local connections with relations living there.  Fingal County Council has offered to pay for the family's emergency accommodation indefinitely.  I telephoned Fingal County Council this week and it confirmed to me that whether it is six months, three years or whatever it takes, it will pay.</p>  <p>  The cost per month for this accommodation to the State is more than &euro;5,000 per month.  The family is going into its 12th week in the emergency accommodation, which has cost Fingal County Council more than &euro;15,000.  The family has found a suitable property to rent in Dundalk and has the opportunity to set up home and make a fresh start.  However, Fingal County Council is unable to provide a housing assistance payment for the family in Louth, but is able to do so in other nearby counties such as Meath.</p>  <p>  All the family requires is a deposit and the first month's rent.  The amount of money it is seeking from Fingal County Council is approximately &euro;2,600, which would be a considerable saving compared to more than &euro;5,000 monthly costs.</p><p>This family is stuck between a rock and a hard place, as Fingal County Council has stated it is unable to provide it, leaving this family stuck in emergency accommodation.  In the long term, the cost of the housing assistance payment, HAP, for this family in Dundalk is less than the cost of emergency accommodation for one month.<br/><br/>If Fingal County Council would pay the deposit and a month's rent, the family would be able to come off the Fingal County Council list and go onto the Louth County Council list.  After that, Louth County Council would be able to take over the HAP payments.  This would possibly take four weeks.  The cost of the rent would then be approximately &euro;1,500 per month, rather than the current cost of more than &euro;5,000.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a family of four girls.  They are staying in a bed and breakfast, in a single room with two double beds.  One of the family members is permanently disabled, and her health and mental health is quickly deteriorating.  That family member is currently out of education and is only seven years old.  She has a life-limiting, life-threatening metabolic condition, known as mitochondrial<b></b>disorder, and is tube-fed.  She is behind on her school work and is not sleeping properly.  How could anyone sleep properly with four girls in one room with two double beds?  If the family was able to move into this rented accommodation, she would then be able to take up her education in a local special needs school and have a healthy routine.</p></speech>

One of the key commitments in Rebuilding Ireland is to help homeless families and children exit homelessness and move into independent tenancies.  The housing assistance payment forms a key element of the Government's response to achieving this.</p>  <p>  HAP is a flexible and immediate form of social housing support, enabling households to choose where they wish to live.  The national roll-out of the HAP scheme was completed in 2017, and HAP is now available in 31 local authorities.  It is working quite well in counties like Meath and Louth and in Fingal and other areas that were mentioned here today.  There were 31,200 households supported by the scheme by the end of 2017, with a target of an additional 17,000 households during 2018.</p>  <p>  One of the measures put in place in early 2017 to support families through the use of HAP was the establishment of a homeless HAP place finders service in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, which leads the response to homelessness in the four Dublin local authorities and in Cork.  The homeless HAP service supports families in emergency accommodation by nominating them to viewings with the place finder service and encouraging and supporting them in finding private rented accommodation.  More than 2,000 families are being supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme has had success in Dublin, Cork, and the Fingal area referenced by Deputy Fitzpatrick, where the housing team has done great work.  Likewise, the housing team in County Louth are doing great work, providing housing solutions for many people who are homeless.  Following this, the scheme was introduced to all local authorities earlier this year.</p>  <p>  A critical aspect of the homeless HAP place finder scheme is the results that it is achieving in preventing families from entering emergency accommodation.  For example, a family provided with a notice to quit from a tenancy can be supported by the local authority to secure a tenancy without ever having to enter homeless accommodation.  Accordingly, the scheme is playing a vital role in prevention.</p>  <p>  Preventing homelessness is a priority for the Government.  Increasing inter-agency prevention efforts is a key function of the inter-agency group on homelessness, which was established by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, following the housing summit in September 2017.  The group is chaired by Mr. John Murphy, a former Secretary General, and includes representation from the Department of Health, the HSE, Tusla, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The group is expected to make its first report to the Minister in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Of course, delivering more social housing is critical to addressing homelessness, and my Department is working closely with local authorities to accelerate delivery.  Last year an additional 7,000 new social houses were delivered across all schemes throughout the country, and this year we expect to have 8,000 new houses.  That is in addition to the 17,000 HAP places that we hope to have as well.</p>  <p>  While the level of homelessness remains a significant problem, solutions are being implemented.  Over 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved in 2017, and my Department is working to build on this in 2018.  The homeless HAP place finder service will remain an integral part of our response, and will certainly help counties like Louth, Fingal and other areas to find accommodation for people who find themselves homeless.</p>  <p>  I understand that there is a particular issue with the case Deputy Fitzpatrick has raised, and I am happy to discuss it with him.  I have been assured by the officials in my Department that a solution can be reached.  As Minister State, I commit to working with the Deputy and with the local teams in Louth and in Fingal, which are doing great work.  We will find a solution for this family.  I can assure this House of that.</p></speech>

I repeat that there are four girls living in one room, with two double beds and no facilities for cooking or washing clothes.  As I said, one of these girls is a seven year old child who has a life-limiting, life-threatening metabolic condition and is tube-fed.  She is out of school and her health is suffering.  I have spoken to a local special needs school in Dundalk that is willing to take her on.</p>  <p>  I do not blame the Fingal County Council or the Louth County Council and I agree with the Minister of State that they do tremendous work.  However, it makes no sense to pay &euro;5,000 per month for one room in emergency accommodation when the family can get a house where each member will have their own room for roughly &euro;1,500.  It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I have great confidence in the Minister of State.  This Government has given a tremendous commitment to look after the housing needs of the people over the next two years.  I work very closely with Mr. Denis McArdle, who looks after the homeless people in Dundalk, and with Mr. Joe McGuinness, the housing officer in Dundalk.  Louth County Council is willing to take this family on, but the position at the moment is that Fingal County Council is paying, and one cannot be on two local authorities housing lists.  We have to get the family off the Fingal County Council list and onto the Louth County Council list.  In the meantime there might be four weeks without payment.  The Minister of State is a very capable person, and I am not just saying that to build my case.  This family is in a very bad way.  It is not nice when one sees a seven year old child being wheeled into one's office in a wheelchair.  I am pleading with the Minister of State, and I have faith in him.  Please, can we help this family?</p></speech>

The first of these is this family and their circumstances.  It is so important that we find them a home as quickly as possible.  As a Government and as taxpayers, we do not want to see anybody in emergency accommodation.  It is not a place to raise a family and it is not a place in which to be.  It does not provide value for taxpayers' money either.  For everyone in the D&aacute;il, and certainly for everybody in government, the priority is to get people out of emergency accommodation and into permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick also points out that from a taxpayer's point of view, we must use our money better.  There is a cheaper solution available to give these people a better home and I am determined that we make that happen.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick is asking is that we use common sense.  I have no doubt we can do that.  Working with Ms Margaret Geraghty and all her team in the Fingal local authority and with Mr. Joe McGuinness and his team in the housing section of the Louth County Council, including Mr. Denis McArdle, we will find a solution to this.  I have no doubt about that and my Department officials believe we can do that as well.</p>  <p>  It is about trying to find people a housing solution and find them a home.  Certainly there is a lot of pressure in the Dublin area and in Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow but the pressure extends even further.  I refer to County Cavan, represented by Deputy Brendan Smith, who is in the Chamber.  There are housing difficulties in many parts of the country.  Thankfully, after a year and a half of Rebuilding Ireland, we are beginning to make the progress we need.</p>  <p>  Taxpayers' money is being spent.  This year will see almost &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money spent on housing solutions.  This spend includes the local authorities, all the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that benefit from taxpayers' money and our approved housing bodies.  Everybody is coming to the table to provide solutions.  We need to do that as quickly as possibly and in a common-sense way.  That will involve inter-agency work.  It means working at local authority level and that is certainly something we will do.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I, along with all the officials in our Department, are determined to be solution-focused and to find a home for as many people as we possibly can.  While there is no doubt that the number of homeless is still far too high, last year homes were found for more than 4,000 people.  This year we will go way beyond that.  As I said, emergency accommodation or a hotel is not a place for a family.</p></speech>

I want to make a strong appeal, through the Minister of State, to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  I appeal to the Minister to give urgent and detailed consideration to the very detailed application submitted by the principal and the board of management of the Convent of Mercy national school in Belturbet, County Cavan, to be included in band 1 of the urban DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, scheme.  Over the years, I have been privileged to work along with the principal, the staff, the boards of management and successive parents' associations in trying to bring investment to that particular school.  The school is a pivotal part of the local community and pursues as much involvement in extra-curricular activities as possible.  Indeed, I have been at many of these events in the school over the years and it is a very important part of our local community in Belturbet.</p><p>The board of management submitted a detailed application.  The criteria are very much based on the statistics gathered in past censuses.  The Pobal indices for 2011 and 2016 all point to the inclusion of the school in the DEIS 1 band.  The Department has the detail, but the position has deteriorated since and the number of areas of disadvantage has, unfortunately, increased, which considerably strengthens the school's case to be granted this status.</p> <p> The Minister of State will be aware from his County Cavan connections that Belturbet is a Border town and, unfortunately, because of the Troubles when roads were blown up in the area and so on, the community suffered terribly.  There has been a lack of employment opportunities in the town which has suffered from the general disadvantage that has affected Border communities.  I commend the local community, those working in statutory agencies locally and the teachers who ensured they provided the best possible education for the children under their care.  The DEIS designation at primary level is valuable and the school in Belturbet has submitted a strong application which meets all of the criteria laid down by the Department.  According to previous correspondence with the Minister, decisions will be made at the end of quarter 1 this year.  I appeal to the Minister of State to convey a strong message to the Minister who I appreciate cannot be present owing to other commitments.  However, I ask the Minister of State to convey to him the strong case I have made and ensure every aspect of the application submitted by the board of management will be given detailed and favourable consideration.  The community does not look for handouts.  It is seeking support to enhance the school environment for all of the children.  I hope the Minister of State will have positive news on the application.</p></speech>

I discussed the issue with him earlier and he is very much aware of it from the correspondence he has received from the Deputy.  He is sorry he cannot be present, but I will make sure to convey to him the additional information provided by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  DEIS is the main policy initiative of the Department of Education and Skills to address educational disadvantage at school level.  DEIS Plan 2017 published in February last year introduced a more robust and responsive framework for assessing levels of disadvantage in schools and set out details of an updated DEIS school support programme.  The DEIS identification process uses data from the following sources: Central Statistics Office small area population statistics, as represented in the Pobal small area HP deprivation index, combined with centrally held data from the Department's primary and post-primary online databases as provided by schools.  This new approach removes the administrative burden on schools to provide socioeconomic data for their pupil cohorts and ensures consistency and uniformity in the assessment process for all primary and post-primary schools.  The system is also responsive to demographic changes in schools, with the capacity to update school data on an annual basis from the school annual census returns and socioeconomic data every five years following the CSO national census of population.  This development was strongly called for by stakeholders during the review of the DEIS programme undertaken by the Department in which I was involved at the time.</p>  <p>  The initial application of the model assessed all schools and found that most schools had pupils from disadvantaged areas but that the concentration of disadvantage varied significantly.  It is important to note that the Department's assessment is not based on the location of the school but on the CSO small areas statistics from which a school derives its pupil cohort.  Accordingly, the demographics of neighbouring schools can differ in terms of assessed levels of need which are based on the pupil cohort within each school.  Following the initial application of the identification process, 79 additional schools were brought into the programme, while a further 30 existing DEIS schools were identified for increased levels of support with effect from September 2017.  An updating of the identification model is under way and will take account of data provided by schools for the current school year, combined with the Pobal HP index of deprivation, based on census 2016.  It is envisaged that the process will be completed by the end of quarter 1 this year, or in a month's time.  If the exercise reveals that any school meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage, it may be included, subject to available resources.  It is also important to note that all schools, including the Convent of Mercy, Belturbet, have available to them a range of supports provided by the Department to meet the identified additional educational needs of their pupil cohorts.  They include additional teaching and other resources to meet special educational needs, language and behavioural supports and educational psychological supports.  Further services provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers are also available to support teachers and school leaders in the delivery of teaching and learning in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-22a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022200041#RR00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  The 2016 census demonstrated through the measurement of the levels of disadvantage that all areas of Belturbet fell into either the marginally below average or very disadvantaged category.  That represented a deterioration in comparison to the position following the 2006 census.  The Pobal map shows that the largest population currently resides in the most disadvantaged area of Belturbet.  It is an area of significant disadvantage.  One good initiative undertaken by the education and training board in recent years through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in partnership with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Youth Work Ireland was the introduction of an intervention programme designed to target older children deemed to be at risk.  The programme is necessary and worthwhile.</p>  <p>  The Department has classified the school incorrectly in that it is included in the rural instead of the urban classification.  That is a misreading of the position at official level.  That the school should have urban status is demonstrated by the fact that it is a participant in the non-statutory school meals local project scheme which is funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  A school has to have urban status to be included in the scheme.  There is a difference in designation between the two Departments.  It is a small town school which should have urban status.  On its own initiative, the school established the role of home-school liaison officer in 1997.  Even at the time, it recognised the need to provide additional support for children and families.  All of these factors should be taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  The principal, Ms Breege Flynn, and her staff would not look for something unless it was needed, nor would the chairman or members of the board of management or the parents association.  The school community works in the best interests of the children and the local community.  I would not table a Topical Issues matter unless I thought the application merited serious, urgent and favourable consideration.  I appreciate that the Minister of State will speak to the Minister about the application, but I appeal to him to do so in the strongest terms.</p></speech>

I recognise the work principals do with boards of management, parents associations and the local community to fight for resources for their schools.  The Deputy is correct that they generally do so only when they know that they need them.  The new process in place will examine applications objectively.  I will convey the Deputy's clear message to the Minister, in particular, on the issue of the urban-rural classification.  I will raise the issue because it is important.</p>  <p>  When the data have been assessed, the analysis will be beneficial in making decisions.  For the first time, the Department has introduced an objective statistics-based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS programme in order that all stakeholders will have confidence that additional resources are being targeted at the schools identified as having the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage.  The schools included in the programme, with effect from September 2017, are the ones which have been identified as having the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohorts.</p><p>The schools that have not been included at this stage, and which include the Convent of Mercy national school, Belturbet, County Cavan, which Deputy Smith has just raised, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage among their pupil cohort under the new identification model.  It is also important to note that this is the first step in a process, and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date if the Department's assessment indicates a level of disadvantage that warrants inclusion in the programme.  With the analysis at the moment and the additional information the Deputy has provided, I will make sure this case is looked into and I will raise it on his behalf with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p></speech>

Tuigim go mbeidh s&eacute; ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille, n&oacute; ar a laghad ag ligean &eacute; dul tr&iacute;d.  My understanding is that the Government is not opposing this Bill.  I welcome that and thank the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, which is a significant move towards promoting a positive and safe online culture for all.  I acknowledge the work of the Law Reform Commission report on digital safety and harmful communications, particularly its author, Fiona O'Regan.  That report prompted the discussion of a digital safety commissioner, which is supported by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, the Ombudsman for Children and CyberSafeIreland, and the Minister has spoken positively about it.  I propose this Bill because I want to keep this on the agenda.  The Minister has broadly supported the concept but the Taoiseach has not always been so enthusiastic in his support for it.  The D&aacute;il needs to make clear that this is an important role and office.</p>  <p>  The office should be a permanent statutory body with considerable powers rather than an office internal to the Department.  In the Bill I have outlined several powers.  When it goes to Committee Stage, Deputies may have other suggestions and observations on any additional powers and functions that such an office should have.  I hope the Minister will hold to the line that the office would be a statutory body, responsible for the promotion of digital safety for all, supporting and implementing measures to improve digital safety and advising the Government of the day on policies relating to digital safety.  It is a new departure which would bring us up to date given the times in which we live and the risks and potential harm experienced by users of the Internet, especially children, and it would attempt to mitigate some of those risks.</p>  <p>  However, it is not intended as an office solely responsible for child protection functions.  It would also deal with online abuse, harassment, hate speech, and so on.  It would also be responsible for the promotion of a positive online experience, which should be emphasised.  The Internet is a significant public space.  It is part of the life of most citizens and increasingly of the lives of younger citizens.  It creates great value which must be reflected also in discussions on the risks and harms associated with it.  It has already changed our relationships with one another to a large extent and will continue to change public life in ways that we are yet to imagine.  We should consider legislation that will ensure the Internet plays a healthy and restrained role in public life.  That applies across a wide range of areas.</p>  <p>  Technology and online platforms evolve very rapidly and dramatically.  The difference between the range of products and platforms available in 2007 and today is night and day.  The rate of change over the next ten years could be just as rapid.  It is vitally important that the remit of the office is drawn in such a way as to ensure that it stays abreast of all changes and is in a position to evolve as the challenges evolve.  We need a measured, proportionate and sensible response to the risks and hazards.  This Bill and a digital safety office commissioner is a part of that.  We face significant challenges and many, particularly parents, are concerned about what is happening there.  It is hard to blame them when we read the stories of predatory behaviour, harmful material and online bullying.  While bullying in any circumstances is bad, the idea that it can follow the child home bothers many parents and must be a very difficult experience for the children affected.  While it is true to say we face significant challenges, there is no sense or value in a moral panic.  It would not assist us in resolving the difficulties.  We need legislation which ensures that safeguards exist and that criminalises behaviour that deserves to be criminalised while also promoting a positive experience and a healthy online public space.  We also need increased resources for the relevant offices that ensure corporate responsibility.  The Taoiseach has correctly said that there is a role for the major providers and platforms.  We also need legislation to ensure that where they are not stepping up to the mark and putting in the safeguards, they should be made to.</p>  <p>  The remit of the commissioner has been defined in a broad manner in this Bill so that the scope of his or her work and the subject matter can evolve over time.  The primary proposed functions of the commissioner would be, among others, to promote digital safety for all, to support and encourage the implementation of measures to improve digital safety, including oversight and regulation and a timely and efficient procedure for removal of harmful digital communications.  He or she would ensure that take-down procedures and removal of material are made available to all affected individuals by digital service providers free of charge.  He or she would ensure that there is a code of practice of safe and responsible Internet usage, develop national digital safety standards and ensure compliance with them, and he or she would have powers to revoke a certificate of compliance with same.  He or she would collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to digital safety.  The rate of change will continue and needs to be analysed and evaluated constantly and responses to it developed.  The commissioner will also be responsible for advising the Government of the day on policies that may or should be implemented to ensure all users of digital platforms are protected in a way that keeps up to speed with the ever-changing nature of digital technology.</p>  <p>  The commissioner would also have the responsibility of working with the Ombudsman for Children in publishing guidance material, including guidance material for schools, relevant to digital safety for children and to harmful digital communications, which would include support and guidance material for parents.  Crucially, the commissioner would be responsible for ensuring digital service providers, such as websites and social media platforms, abide by minimum codes of practice and national digital safety standards.  Central to this would be the take-down mechanisms I mentioned.  It is essential that this provides timely, quick and effective remedies so that people can be confident that the website or platform they or members of their family are engaging with will deal swiftly with abusive material, harmful communications or material posted without consent.</p><p>There should be recourse directly to the office, but we should seek to have quick, effective and timely remedies put in place by the platforms themselves, having been forced to by the commissioner, in order to reach the standards because if there is a significant delay in dealing with harmful material then damage is done, even if it is eventually removed.  Some providers have good mechanisms, but some do not have any.  Certificates of compliance will ensure that users and parents can distinguish and choose between safe websites and unsafe websites and platforms.</p> <p> One of the significant differences between this Bill and the Bill proposed by the Law Reform Commission is the establishment of an advisory committee.  This would be focused on the wider community with 50% of the committee drawn from civil society, youth and children's groups.  It would include young people.  This would ensure that new developments, technologies, trends and platforms would come to the attention of the commissioner quickly and that the office would have the ability and scope to evolve over time, as technology does.</p> <p> This Bill would be a significant step in improving the online experience of all and in giving people more confidence in their safety from abuse and harmful material.</p></speech>

Many parents feel out of their depth when it comes to the use of technology.  Meanwhile, children are growing up with it and are far more versed in its use than many Members in this House.  Despite this, many young people are still not fully aware of the dangers present when it comes to the use of social media and various apps.</p>  <p>  The Internet Content Governance Advisory Group made a number of recommendations to Government in a 2014 report on what needs to be done.  Four years later we still have not implemented the bulk of the recommendations in that report.  The use of technology has been invaluable in education, communication and business.  There have, however, been darker sides to this technology with a range of child protection issues - harassment; bullying; exposure to inappropriate content; and predatory behaviour, all of which have made the headlines recently.  Legislation is simply unable to keep up.  The time is overdue for the setting up of an office of the digital safety commissioner.  This office would have the role of promoting online digital safety, reviewing and regulating harmful digital communications on the Internet and other digital platforms with the intention of establishing safer and healthier attitudes for all users of digital platforms.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs Committee saw how this issue falls across various Departments.  It was great to see the four Ministers in before the committee.  It shows the Government has a unified response on this serious issue.  This is why we need a one-stop shop on which young people, parents, industry and legislators can rely to advise on best practice around digital safety.</p>  <p>  I support the idea of an advisory council that would include members from civil society groups, Government Departments and the industry to provide regular feedback to the commissioner.  All Members are aware that digital technology will continue to play an increasing role in the lives of young people.  We need to be sure that we have the tools in place to educate young people on how to use this technology in a respectful and safe way.  We need parents to be educated and aware of the potential dangers of their children using such services.  We also need the industry to be aware of its obligation to safeguard users.  As legislators we need to ensure there are robust regulations and standards in place to improve digital safety and a timely and efficient procedure for the removal of harmful digital communications.</p></speech>

I also thank the Law Reform Commission for its work in preparing the report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety, which was published in September 2016.  Deputies will be aware that the report&rsquo;s recommendations were effectively split in two parts: the first concerning the reform of criminal law, and the second concerning the establishment of a digital safety commissioner.  Deputy Brendan Howlin introduced the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, which addresses those parts of the Law reform Commission report on the reform of criminal law and harmful communications.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire&rsquo;s party brought forward a similar Bill.  Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill was discussed on Second Stage in the House on 31 January and, as on that occasion, the Government will not be opposing the passage of the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017.</p>  <p>  I strongly welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation because as the father of four young children I believe online safety is one of the greatest challenges we face today.  It is, however, important that our response to the risks is measured and that we acknowledge the benefits as well as the threats that are out there.  The online and offline worlds are one and the same in the lives of today&rsquo;s teenagers.  We need to work with them and listen to them so that our solutions are credible in their eyes.</p>  <p>  I and three colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs yesterday.  I thank that committee for its work on this subject, and I look forward to receiving its report and recommendations shortly.  The fact that four Cabinet Ministers appeared before a committee together, something which I believe is unprecedented, is a testament to this Government&rsquo;s commitment to working together to make the Internet a safer place for all users, but especially for our children.  In addition to the Ministers who appeared at the committee yesterday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, also have roles to play, and their Departments are involved in the organisation of the open policy debate on online safety.  I will return to this subject later.</p>  <p>  An interesting aspect of yesterday&rsquo;s discussion was that the committee members wanted to know where overall responsibility should rest for online safety.  Some committee members proposed that we would have a Minister for the Internet.  It is tempting when speaking about any issue which cuts across many Government Departments to gravitate towards this type of solution.  The reality is that no single Department or Minister can be responsible for solving all of the issues relating to online safety.  There are at least six Departments involved in this area and I believe our goal should be to find a way to work together in a better and more seamless way from the public's point of view.</p>  <p>  As the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, online safety for children has been a personal policy priority for me.  We were all deeply disturbed by the reports of recent cases of horrific online behaviour perpetrated in Ireland.  As a society we must respond, but we must also realise that a solution appropriate to these cases is not necessarily the solution for all types of online behaviour and content.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum entirely, we are talking about hurtful comments and cyberbullying, where the perpetrators can in many cases be young people themselves.  I have said many times that there is no one single action which will fix the Internet.  I was struck by Professor Brian O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s contribution to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last year.  He explained that all research over the past 20 years showed that a multi-stakeholder approach to online safety is required.  We need to find 21st century solutions to these problems.  Yes, legislation may form part of those solutions, but it is not a panacea.  It should be seen as only one part of a wider range of actions that we should consider.  I would also like to recognise the work which is already under way across a range of Government Departments, work which was strongly acknowledged at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.</p> <p> My position on the need to establish an office of a digital safety commissioner has been widely reported and acknowledged.  The specific roles envisaged for the digital safety commissioner set out in this Bill include promoting digital safety for all persons and supporting and encouraging the implementation of measures to improve digital safety.  Recognising the proactive role which the Ombudsman for Children has played in this area, the proposed commissioner would support the preparation and publication by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children of guidance material for schools.  Other functions refer to education and awareness measures including collecting, analysing and disseminating information relating to digital safety; supporting, encouraging, conducting and evaluating research about digital safety; publishing reports and papers relating to digital safety; and promoting positive use of the Internet and active online citizenship.</p> <p> The proposed commissioner would also have a role in coordinating the activities of Government Departments and other bodies in this area.  I believe all stakeholders would agree on these aspects.  It is important to note that some of these functions are already being carried out, at least to some extent, across a range of Departments.  We can and should identify practical steps that we can take in the short term without necessarily waiting for the establishment of a statutory office.  Work is currently under way to identify those steps.</p> <p> I acknowledge the suggestion of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire about establishing an advisory council.  That is a very welcome and constructive suggestion.  I also acknowledge the suggestion of Deputy Denise Mitchell regarding a one-stop shop for best practice.  We do not need a statutory basis to set up something like that, but it is something that needs to be established.</p> <p> In the interest of clarity, I must emphasise that there are aspects of this Bill which raise jurisdictional and other legal issues and which require far greater examination and scrutiny after Second Stage.  Specific legal difficulties in the Bill include the following.  First, there are significant issues with definitions in the Bill.  For example the Bill does not define what is meant by &ldquo;harmful communications&rdquo; other than those which will be addressed through criminal law.  Second, the Bill provides for a role for the courts where an entity is established outside the State in respect of a harmful communication.  It is not clear how this would work in practice.  Third, the Bill imposes a number of obligations on digital service undertakings established in the State.  Fourth, the overlap with other State organisations with statutory and non-statutory roles in this area is not clear.  I flag these issues in order to be helpful and not as a hindrance to the progression of this legislation.</p> <p> The Bill also fails to take into account the impact that such a measure would have in a European context.  As we all know the Internet does not respect borders and for that reason a joined up approach at a European or even global level is key.  In fact, next week the Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference will be held in Ottawa, Canada.  It provides an ideal opportunity to have such issues progressed.  The European Commission published its communication in respect of illegal content on online platforms last September and it is due to bring forward proposals on the next steps by May of this year.  This is significant as the European Commission is taking action to ensure an effective system of notice and take-down is observed by online platforms in respect of illegal content.</p> <p> Other member states have brought in measures which seek to impose stricter measures on Internet companies.  There are examples of legislative and even constitutional restrictions on certain content across the European Union, but results have been mixed so we need to learn from this.  We are in a far stronger position when we work in tandem with our European partners.  Action at European level, whether it relates to criminal or harmful content, will bring about far more coherent results than a purely national approach, not least in respect of Internet providers that are not based in Ireland.  Given the action which the Commission is taking, it could be premature to take unilateral action in respect of a statutory code of conduct at this time.  However, this is something that should be kept under close and constant review.</p> <p> We must also recognise in this debate the role which is being played by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will always have statutory responsibility for illegal content in Ireland.  I commend it on its recent successful operations, including Operation Ketch.  We must recognise that it has been extremely effective in ensuring that illegal content is removed.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, is working on legislation in the area of harmful communications which will further strengthen the hand of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I also commend the joint approach by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Webwise and the Professional Development Service for Teachers in marking Safer Internet Day.</p> <p> Another example of the activity taking place with which I am familiar is my responsibility for implementing the revisions to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.  While a final text is yet to be agreed at European level, this directive will ensure that video sharing platform services such as YouTube have measures in place to protect users, especially minors, from harmful video content.  Some 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every single minute.  We will also be required to formalise the regulation of non-linear or on-demand services such as Netflix and the RT&Eacute; player.  This is another positive step in making the Internet a safer place for all users, but especially children.  It is likely that the revised directive will be agreed in the coming months and my Department will begin a public consultation on how best to implement its provisions.</p> <p> Online safety is complex, but some of the solutions are clear.  We need to do more, but we also need to make sure that there is greater awareness of all the resources and supports that are available right now.  We want to make sure that our children are not only tech savvy, but also safety conscious; that parents know where they can turn to for help; and that there is a joined-up approach to everything we do.  These are measures that can be strengthened today without waiting for legislative change.</p> <p> As I have outlined, a number of Departments and agencies are already involved in delivering many services which are aimed at safeguarding citizens online.  Rather than being overly prescriptive in this area, I am keen to work on practical steps we can take now.  This means working with parents, young people, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and technology companies to take actions that will make a real and practical difference.</p> <p> I convened a meeting between my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, on this issue last November.  We agreed that the most appropriate way to move online safety forward would be to hold an open policy debate to help us identify gaps and the practical steps needed to fill them.  As I have mentioned, this open policy debate will be held on 8 March and six Departments, led by my own, are involved in organising it.  The overall aim of the event is to raise awareness among all participants of the activities being undertaken by the Government, the European Commission, industry and NGOs.  The ideas and feedback generated on the day will also feed into a Government action plan which will underpin future actions and policies.  All Deputies are welcome to attend on the day and are asked to contact my office if they are interested in doing so.  I sincerely hope they do.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The output of the open policy debate will allow Government to set out an integrated set of measures to continue to tackle the issues arising in respect of online safety, and to strengthen communication and information for the general public in respect of supporting children and young people to stay safe online.</p> <p> Once again I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing forward this Bill, which the Government will not oppose.  As I have previously highlighted, there are significant legal and jurisdictional issues that must be overcome before the Bill could be enacted, but it is important that we debate these points and come forward with practical, implementable solutions.  That is why in tandem with moving forward the legislative side, we must identify areas we can progress in the interim.  There are lots of areas in which we can work together and take a co-operative approach.  I value the contributions which all Deputies, on all sides will make to this debate tonight, to the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and to the open policy debate in March.  It is only by working together that we can begin to make the Internet a safer place for all citizens, but especially for our children.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill and would always support an initiative such as this.  We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Ireland is completely behind the curve in regulating and legislating for the online and social media sphere.  As it stands, the online world is largely self-regulated.  The recommendation for the establishment of a digital safety commissioner was made by the Law Reform Commission back in 2016.  Rather than act on this recommendation, the Taoiseach stated that he would be loath to go down that road.  The Taoiseach called on the tech companies to step up to the plate and do more to protect the people from the dangers of online intimidation, bullying and so on.  The Government has effectively washed its hands of any obligation to protect its citizens from the online world.</p>  <p>  Since the commission published its recommendations, we have seen a number of horrendous examples of the dangers of the online world.  There was the case of Matthew Horan, the 26 year-old who used numerous social media sites to gather thousands of images of children as young as nine.  There is Nicole Fox Fenton, the 21 year-old woman who took her life after endless torments from cyber bullies.  There is the awful abuse suffered by former Senator, Lorraine Higgins.  There is the case in Belfast of a 14 year-old girl whose nude photograph was posted on Facebook numerous times.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his statement and welcome what he said yesterday.  He and I stand together on one thing.  The reason I am passionate is that I am a mother of three young kids.  It is incumbent on any of us here as legislators to find ways to protect children online.  It is not all about children online; it is about everybody online but particularly our most vulnerable, namely, our children.  Unless we put rules and regulations in place to protect them, how can we keep them safe?  There is no doubt that parents are behind the curve on this issue.  They are looking to us and to the Government for leadership and to come forward.  I am very frustrated that we do not have a digital safety commission in place.</p>  <p>  I must acknowledge the work of the Internet safety office.  I compliment the fantastic work it does with all of two staff.  The work those two staff deliver is done incredibly well.  They produced 40,000 booklets last year of which there were four in the range.  Anyone who got one into their household will know they were fantastic.  However, 40,000 was not enough.  They do really good work on educating the parents and the children themselves.  I agree that the digital safety commissioner should have a dual function of implementing social media safety measures, educating people about safe online behaviour and working with Government policy on safe online behaviours. </p>  <p>  It was fantastic to have the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and the three other Ministers at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs yesterday.  In the earlier session of the meeting, before the Ministers arrived, we heard from Professor Brian O'Neill, the chairman of the Internet content governance advisory group.  That is a mouthful in itself.  I pushed Professor O'Neill because this document was produced in 2014 and they had 30 recommendations including three main recommendations.  Not one of them has been implemented, which is regrettable.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is talking about an advisory group.  That is something we can do in the here and now.  We do not need to wait for big legislation or anything else.  Children can input into this as well.  That is a huge part of it.</p>  <p>  The kids are nearly laughing at us having these discussions at this stage.  They know where it is at.  When we talk about Snapchat maps, which we had during the summer and we talked about Sarah, we were talking after some of them had actually uploaded or downloaded or knew about the location buttons.  That is why we need a digital safety commissioner, so that it is all funnelled through one particular grouping and we can protect the kids.  Parents should be aware straight away when there are different maps going on.  We do not need to hear it a few weeks later.  There should always be awareness.</p>  <p>  On the Law Reform Commission, discussion is taking place at the moment of the digital age of consent and whether it should be 13 or 16.  A digital safety commissioner would be best advised and would have all the research done on how we could protect children if the age remains at 13.  Parents would feel there is a safety net and protection in place.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon made a very detailed report on this issue to the Law Reform Commission and recommended the age of 13.  The ISPCC, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children also suggest the age of 13.  However, Professor O'Sullivan and Dr. Mary Aiken have made very compelling arguments as to why the age should be 16, in respect of understanding how data can be used and who owns and controls it when it goes up online.  A digital safety commissioner would be able to report back to the Government with key recommendations on this matter.  Many Deputies and Ministers are doing a lot of heavy lifting behind the scenes to try to figure out if the age should be 13 or 16.  It is a big conversation piece at this time.</p>  <p>  I welcome the event on 8 March.  It is brilliant and I would be delighted to attend.  The gathering together of all these people in one room to thrash out the sort of things we are discussing this evening is welcome.  I hope they will discuss the role and function of the digital safety commissioner.  The Minister is right that we cannot be insular and just think about it in an Irish context.  We have to think of it in a European and a global context.  People might not realise that a lot of these sites are not based here and might not be licensed through here.  We are lucky to have direct communications with the ones that are here.  The ones that are not here are the ones we have to understand and look at on a global basis.  </p>  <p>  The committee has had wonderful speakers making presentations.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was a member of the committee for many months before Deputy Mitchell joined him.  We had a lot of heavy lifting and engagement.  We had An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in and it has done a phenomenal amount of work, as the Minister said.  One of the things that came out of yesterday's committee meeting was how underresourced the Garda team is.  It is a very small team and its manpower gets sucked into focusing on one or two cases.  The Garda is so dependent on Europol and the US for gathering all its information.  It does a phenomenal amount of work behind the scenes, which people would not realise.</p><p>I have been critical of the Government in the past couple of weeks because of the lack of - or even a whisper of - a digital safety commissioner.  While the Minister and his team at the Department are very committed, I sometimes feel that the Taoiseach is sitting on the fence on this issue.  It is incumbent on him to step up and protect the youth of this country, to row in behind the Minister and to decide under what Department the digital safety commissioner will operate.  He must give the go-ahead in order that a digital safety commissioner can be appointed.  It falls across a number of Departments.  Before I came here tonight I had to speak with Deputies O'Callaghan, Browne, Thomas Byrne and Dooley.  No individual Deputy can take sole ownership of this issue because it falls within all Departments.  I believe we need to find the correct home for it and a Department needs to take ownership of it.  It is in a good home at the moment and I would like it to stay there but it needs a permanent home in order that someone can take up the mantle and protect the youth.</p></speech>

I am glad that the Minister and the Government are also supporting it to the next stage of proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Minister will forgive me if I am a little bit cynical about his response.  We had a good engagement at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs yesterday.  I am not sure whether there is a precedent but four Cabinet members appeared before us in unison to speak on the issue of Internet safety and to articulate what each of their Departments is doing to protect minors and to get people to engage in order that as a society, we meet the challenges presented by the vagaries of the online community.  My cynicism - it has a small "c" - stems from the fact that were one to parse through the speeches made by each of the four Ministers, not one of them is proactive in putting up his or her hand and asking for responsibility for the role of digital safety commissioner within his or her Department.  Instead, we are subjected to another open policy debate.</p></speech>

He is a decent, progressive man but I would be obliged if he would let me get on with my speech.  I may be wrong, as I often am, and if so I stand to be corrected in due course but I will make my few points.</p>  <p>  The Internet content governance advisory group, ICGAG, report was set up at the behest of the former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, and it contains a set of recommendations that have not yet been adopted.  I strongly believe we now have legislation before us that can be subject to amendment but that allows for the appointment of a digital safety commissioner.  However, until the Government clearly tells us under which Department it will sit, I predict we will be here this time next year talking about the same issue.  A recommendation was made by the ICGAG that a Cabinet Minister or a Minister of State would be appointed.  As it cuts across the various Departments - I acknowledge the challenges the Government faces on this issue - I do not see why the Government could not appoint somebody who has a certain skill set to act outside of the silos so as to ensure there is direct political responsibility for this.  </p>  <p>  To return to the four speeches that were made yesterday, if one parses through the Departments involved, namely, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills, it is clear that there is excellent work going on in the individual Departments.  If I was to proffer an opinion - I do not have the wisdom of Solomon on these matters - I would say that matters are often passed on to the Department of Justice and Equality if there is any sort of bespoke or eclectic element to it.  I am not sure if the Department of Education and Skills would be the most appropriate place for the office of the digital safety commissioner.  I believe it stands somewhere between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  If I was to offer an opinion I believe it would work best with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but as I say, I do not have a monopoly on wisdom in this area.  There was no indication from any of the Ministers yesterday that they wanted to take this on or that they wanted to ensure they would have political responsibility for this at Cabinet level.  We are not seeing the level of advocacy at ministerial level we need.  I suggest that someone could sit under that level as a Minister of State who could cross-cut each Department and collate the information available in each.  Three or four excellent civil servants could be appointed and it could have a budget, and we could get on with it.  If that does not happen we will probably be here this time next year discussing this issue.  </p>  <p>  I have not carried out a proper analysis of the number of Private Members' Bills.  We are all producing them.  The Minister has referred to the Labour Party Bill that seeks to tackle online harassment.  We now have this Bill, introduced by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, which seeks to establish the office of the digital safety commissioner.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il is drafting legislation on this issue as well.  We have a plethora of Bills and we need some degree of co-ordination at the political level.  This is a non-partisan issue and there has been a massive willingness on the part of all politicians, on a cross-party basis, to co-operate on it.  There are outlying issues relating to the digital age of consent - some of us are conflicted as to whether it should be 13 or 16 and there is work to be done on that - but if we are all working in unison and in tandem with one another, we can achieve something.  I believe there is a massive onus on this generation of politicians or the incumbents under this mandate to try to achieve something on this.  There is massive demand from parents in particular to ensure that somebody in government will grasp the nettle on this issue.  That is what people want to see.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the office of the digital safety commissioner will sit somewhere between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, given that this is an issue that affects minors in the main.  I support the Bill.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about resources.  Yesterday I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, about the Garda national protective services.  We had an interaction with the assistant commissioner at the committee before Christmas and were told that fewer than 100 people were deployed in the area of online child exploitation, cybersecurity and cybercrime.</p><p>I believe strongly that if this country is able to announce a multi-billion euro national development plan, somewhere within the Exchequer's coffers there is money to be made available to buttress the existing resources to assist the Garda in particular and the Office for Internet Safety, which I understand has probably fewer than five staff members.  They do a great deal of work.  Similarly, in education, there is the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, which is responsible for ongoing professional development for teachers, which has a small number of staff who are trying to roll out programmes across the country.  There are major challenges in that respect, as articulated by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, yesterday.</p> <p> If we can provide better resources to existing services we can start making a greater impact but in supporting this legislation, I would make the case that if it passes all Stages, and, hopefully, it will, and if the Government intends to amend it as it sees fit, it would amend the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill and not state that it will take on its own Bill.  Hopefully, the Minister might come back after 8 March and after the open policy forum because much of what he will hear in the open policy forum are messages he has already heard through official formal and informal channels.  We all know what we need to do.  We need to pass this legislation, appoint an appropriate Minister with responsibility for this area, and give that Minister the resources and the political responsibility to do that.  If that is done, we will be able to get on with the job in hand.</p></speech>

As I said at the committee yesterday,  I agree with everything that has been said on this issue.  We need to work in a spirit of co-operation.  There is much we can do by working together on it.  There is a great deal of material available, and I pointed out yesterday that a tremendous amount of work has been done by the Department of Education and Skills.  We could use that material, and much is being done by the technology companies also.</p>  <p>  The issues that were raised are not to do with the big technology companies; it is to do with the smaller apps that are being developed.  We know that regarding terrorism and such issues there is a sharing of information and the skills set and tools with new app developers.  That needs to happen on a far broader scale than is currently happening.  Let us all redouble our efforts to do that.  </p>  <p>  I flagged the issues regarding this legislation.  I am happy for Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to come back and engage with us to see how we can overcome some of those challenges.</p></speech>

I will deal with some of the specific issues that arose during the debate.</p>  <p>  On the objective of the Bill, I echo what Deputy Sherlock said and hope we can work with this legislation that has been initiated and amend it as the process proceeds.  I would expect that we can have a pre-legislative scrutiny stage but it seems to me that there is a possibility that a money message will be required.  There has been some discussion this week about the Government in that regard and, in fairness, the Minister's Department is not one of the significant offenders, but there is a delay in money messages being provided for Private Members' legislation.  That is slowing down the passage of legislation, and the Government as a whole needs to reflect on that.  If it serious about new politics, it needs to allow Opposition Bills pass not only Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and pre-legislative scrutiny but to progress to Committee Stage.  Technical issues may arise, and the State and the civil servants have much more resources to examine some of those, as well as regulatory issues, but the Government should be embracing such legislation.  I am not directing that at the Minister but at the Government as a whole.  I hope we can engage on that point.</p>  <p>  There was some engagement on a particular Department.  That is an interesting discussion.  My personal view is that the area of online safety is not only an issue that affects children.  For many adults or for any user of the Internet, and I would include vulnerable adults in that, there are challenges, risks, harmful material and material posted without consent.  Predatory behaviour can affect adults just as much as children.  We need to be conscious that children are the most vulnerable citizens, but it is an issue that affects the population as a whole.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about Departments.  It is not necessarily an immediate proposal but, in future, the entire area of the Internet could be considered in tandem with the areas of technology and science, perhaps in terms of the Civil Service, Departments and so on, and not only in terms of the Internet.  A greater focus on the entire area of science would benefit us socially and from the point of view of enterprise and so on.</p>  <p>  The challenges that exist online are very different.  There is no silver bullet in that regard.  The Internet is global.  It is not possible to fence ourselves off from the rest of the world online.  There are different challenges.  The matter of the age of consent deals with data, but there is a misapprehension that that could deal with predatory behaviour also.  That is not the case.  The approach to dealing with predatory behaviour is very different.  In terms of the approach to dealing with harmful material, the appointment of a digital safety commissioner would be a significant step in ensuring that providers tackle that in the first instance.  However, its own harmful material can be of itself a criminal offence and where criminal offences are committed online, that is a matter for the Garda.</p>  <p>  On the last occasion representatives of the Garda were before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I commended them on their considerable success in tackling the problem of underage harmful material.  That was a considerable success against a particularly heinous crime.  I commended them on that occasion and I commend them again now, but we need to ensure that the Garda is properly resourced in that regard because it is a very challenging area.</p>  <p>  With any issue online, a wide variety of responses is needed.  The digital safety commissioner is one response.  Everything related to the Data Protection Bill is another but there is a wide variety of others, probably of a legislative nature but also in terms of resources for the Garda.</p>  <p>  I take on board the points the Minister made on some areas that may require amendments.  The definition of harmful communications can be addressed.  I believe that is addressed in Deputy Howlin's Bill or perhaps Deputy Sherlock's-----</p></speech>

It should be possible to regulate their activities here to some extent.  If they seek certification to be in compliance with codes of practice and national minimum digital safety standards, I believe we can deal with issues like that that may not be dealt with here, but if we need to deal with that at a later stage I would be more than happy to work with the Minister on it.</p>  <p>  I hope to be in a position to attend the forum on 8 March.  Deputy Sherlock made a solid point.  There is consensus on the need for a digital safety commissioner in particular among the children's rights and child protection organisations, some of the online safety organisations and, I believe, the Minister, whatever about the Taoiseach.  I hope this debate assists him in persuading the Taoiseach on that.  There is consensus here.  Obviously, it is welcome to have that discussion but I do not believe it is necessarily required for us to continue to progress this Bill.  However, I am happy to work with the Minister, other parties' spokespersons and the organisations.</p>  <p>  The point made by all Deputies in the debate that there is a desire across parties to deal with this issue in a non-partisan and progressive way is true.  I hope that we will be in a position to deliver on that and that by the end of this D&aacute;il term, we will have a digital safety commissioner.</p></speech>
