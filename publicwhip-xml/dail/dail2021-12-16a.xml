    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600003#A00500"><p>The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has implications across the economy.  With regard to the impact on transport, the Government will continue to monitor impacts on trade and key supply chains as it has done through the challenges arising from Brexit and the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Road hauliers are currently supported in the cost of diesel through the diesel rebate scheme, introduced in 2013.  In budget 2020, in recognition of the challenging environment the haulage industry faced at that time with regard to the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, the scheme was enhanced to the extent that when the retail price of auto diesel is over &euro;1.07, the marginal rate of compensation increases to 60% of the excise paid up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre when the price of auto diesel is &euro;1.16 or over.  In recognition of the vital role the haulage sector plays in the economy, the 2020 enhancement has been maintained since.  It is worth noting also that businesses registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December to discuss a range of issues, including fuel prices, decarbonisation of the heavy goods vehicle, HGV, sector and skills issues, including the HGV driver shortage.  At the meeting with IRHA, the Minister and I agreed to consider a proposal to expand the relief available to hauliers under the diesel rebate scheme, but with a link to the phasing out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector.  Details of that proposal are to be submitted by the IRHA to the Department.  The meeting was constructive.  We will meet the IRHA again in the new year.</p>  <p>  On supports for taxi drivers, the vast majority of measures we have taken in support of the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place.</p></speech>

She will be aware that taxi drivers are back to square one in relation to this pandemic.  I raised this with the Taoiseach and he pointed towards a booming economy in quarter 3 as some sort of defence of the Government's position on support for taxi drivers and the industry generally.  Taxi drivers have been put to the pin of their collar and beyond.  The night-time economy is gone.  The daytime economy is 50% or less.  Taxi drivers who are on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, are having the PUP reduced.  We are told by the Minister for Social Protection that taxi drivers can apply for the PUP again but that is not happening in practice.  They are being refused access to the PUP time and again.  They need the Minister of State's support.</p></speech>

I appreciate that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  On the pandemic unemployment payment for small public service vehicle, SPSV, drivers, we all acknowledge how that industry has been hit during the pandemic.  As many as 70% of them availed of the PUP at the height of the pandemic and, as the Deputy may be aware, the PUP has been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid.  The self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given eight-week period.  There is also an enterprise support grant of &euro;1,000 for drivers coming off the PUP that can go towards the costs associated with returning to work, personal protective equipment, PPE, etc.  There have been waivers of the licensing fee and a refund of motor tax for taxi drivers.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has met on a number of occasions with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles - that is a statutory committee established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 - and he has been discussing many of the issues affecting the industry at present.  My time has run out.  I will let the Deputy back in.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is outlining the supports there but she knows as well as I do that the real question here relates to the PUP, and that needs to be resolved.  It is not working the way Government says it is and I would like them to meet.</p>  <p>  On haulage and truck drivers, will the Minister of State outline the engagements she has had?  She will be aware of the frustration within the sector.  The protests that have been happening are motivated by the substantial challenges in the sector in terms of the increasing price of fuel.  Tinkering on the edge with the rebate scheme and the alternative fuel scheme will not address it.  They need urgent action.  How quickly can they expect to see measures that impact on their running costs and fuel costs?</p></speech>

Last month, the Minister met a representative of the taxi dispatch operators.  Other members of Government, including the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, have also met with taxi driver representatives.</p>  <p>  As I say, the self-employed operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in any given eight-week period, and the other supports that were in place throughout the pandemic continue.  I refer to the motor tax rebate.  Even the age of your vehicle now has been extended to the end of 2022.  There are a number of supports there.</p>  <p>  On the haulage sector, our meeting with the IRHA last week was very constructive.  This is, I acknowledge, a sector that is very challenged in reducing emissions.  There are no alternatives there - nothing, that is, in the short term.  That is why we are waiting on the IRHA to come back to work with us in relation to a proposal around that.  I have been engaging with association representatives over a number of months on a number of issues related to the driver shortage as well as skills and I have to say my meetings with them have been very constructive.</p></speech>

I do not expect the Minister of State to have read it yet, but it is something she and her senior officials should read over the Christmas break.  I look forward to hearing what her plans will be.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600004#B00200"><p>The Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network.  The NTA works with the relevant public transport operators responsible for day-to-day operational issues to make public transport accessible.  The Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for all, and especially for persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural areas.  This is being done by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible for persons with disabilities, persons with reduced mobility and older people.  The Department provides dedicated, ring-fenced funding to the NTA for its multi-annual public transport accessibility programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, through the funding from the Department of Transport, the NTA provides a gamut of supports to assist persons with disabilities to travel independently on public transport.  For example, the travel assistance scheme provides assistance for people who need it to use public transport or plan journeys on Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead and DART services.  It is a free service run by Dublin Bus and is available within the greater Dublin area for people aged 18 and over.</p>  <p>  In addition, the just a minute, JAM, card has been available for use on public transport services since 2019 and enables people with a communication barrier to tell others discreetly and easily that they need just a minute.  Furthermore, disability awareness training is provided by all public transport operators to their staff to assist persons with disabilities to travel on public transport services.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns outlined in the report on the cost of transport for persons with disabilities, which are primarily related to more personalised or individualised transport requirements, which in many cases have an important role to play.  Of course, specialised non-public door-to-door services do not form part of the public transport sector for which the Department of Transport has statutory responsibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600004#B00300"><p>The findings from this report are quite stark.  It outlines extra costs annually of between &euro;9,500 and &euro;11,500 a year for a person with a disability, and transport costs are included in the amount.  I accept that some of the costs are for the adaptation of cars, but they also include the use of taxis.  There has been a 37% increase in the cost of taxis for people with a disability because of the lack of public transport accessibility.</p>  <p>  I do not deny the strides that have been made, as the Minister of State outlined, but the report's findings detail current costs.  I ask all Ministers and the Taoiseach for a response to the report from each Department and, similar to the approach with the climate action plan, that a clear plan will be put in place on how each Department will tackle any increased costs for people with disabilities in any area under its remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600004#B00400"><p>I assure the Deputy that my Department is actively engaging with the relevant agencies and Departments to strengthen the public transport offerings throughout the country by providing additional funding for increased public transport services.  The Government has committed to using the research into the cost of disability to inform future policy direction, and the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, steering group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will consider actions required by Departments on foot of this report.  The Department of Transport and its agencies will continue to play their part in making public transport accessible and will, through our membership of the NDIS group, work with the other Departments that have responsibility for individualised, personalised transport support schemes.  I could list the other initiatives on which we are currently working, but they are in the reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600004#B00500"><p>Key to where I and other Members of this House want to get to, and where I hope the Government wants to get to, is that every single policy is disability-proofed across the Government in the same way we are or should be focusing our climate policies.  This report is another long overdue wake-up call on the challenges faced by persons with disabilities.  The stark reality of the significant costs incurred involuntarily by them is quite staggering - an extra 25% annually on top of the average industrial wage.  That cannot continue.  It is something I will push in all Departments every time I have a Minister or the Taoiseach in front of me in the coming months and years.</p></speech>

The NDIS steering group will be key in this area to ensure a whole-of-government approach.  The NDIS sets out the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  It aims to improve the lives of people with disabilities and contains precise, measurable actions and timescales for delivery.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has overarching responsibility for the implementation of the NDIS.  The strategy contains six public transport related actions for which the Department, the NTA and public operators have lead responsibility.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is leading the establishment of a working group under another action to consider the integration of disability transport and mobility support services.  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is being overseen by the NDIS, which comprises key Departments.  This will be an all-of-government approach.</p></speech>

This investment will help support the delivery of almost 1,000 kilometres of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways.</p>  <p>  The total expenditure delivered on active travel through my Department in 2020 was &euro;108 million, with &euro;8.3 million also spent on greenways.  This year, we have seen a significant increase in delivery and expenditure on active travel infrastructure, with the provisional spend for 2021 at &euro;185 million.  This is in addition to approximately &euro;27 million spent on greenways in 2021.</p>  <p>  Focusing on active travel, this year &euro;281 million was available for active travel projects in the greater Dublin area, regional cities and rural areas.  This provided for approximately 1,200 active travel projects to be developed across the country, in cities, towns and rural areas.  Therefore, overall, there has been a large increase in the delivery and expenditure on active travel between 2020 and 2021, although it is also true there has been a significant underspend compared with available funds.  The NTA is the main agency spearheading the delivery of cycling and walking infrastructure, with the local authorities.  Factors constraining delivery of active travel infrastructure this year included the impact of Covid restrictions, planning issues and staffing constraints.  However, the larger budgets and projects are now bedding in, new staff are being recruited by the local authorities, and the situation is improving.  We expect a much higher drawdown on available funds next year and increased delivery.</p>  <p>  The NTA is working with local authorities to ensure effective and efficient delivery of active travel funding.  Details of the active travel projects to be funded and delivered next year are being developed by the NTA and can be made available to the Deputy when this is finalised in January.  It is anticipated that approximately &euro;290 million will be available next year to help roll out walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am happy that 2021 has been a year of very significant delivery on cycling and walking infrastructure despite Covid and other challenges.  It is apparent all around the country that progress is being made.</p></speech>

How many millions of euro were involved?  She indicated that &euro;290 million will be available next year.  Why does that fall short of the commitment of &euro;360 million?</p>  <p>  I am conscious that last week's annual report by the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, stated there is a significant discrepancy between the ambition and policy and the implementation.</p> <p>That is what I see in regard to cycling and walking infrastructure.  It is very concerning because communities want to see this infrastructure delivered.<br/><br/>What is the position in terms of staffing, given the Minister of State mentioned that staffing was an issue?  How many of those active travel teams have been recruited?</p></speech>

I will give the statistics.  As per the quarter 3 report from the NTA supplied to my Department, 92 new positions have been filled across local authorities out of a total of about 250 allowed.  This includes staff in local authorities outside of the greater Dublin area and regional cities, where, until this year, there were no NTA-funded active travel staff in place.  In the coming weeks, the NTA will provide its quarter 4 report on the resourcing plan where we expect a significant increase in the number of positions filled.  There will be a lot of pressure on local authorities next year.  Now that they have increased resources in-house, we expect them to be able to roll out these active travel projects across the country.  I will get the Deputy the exact figures in regard to his earlier question and I will provide them to him separately.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to the NTA.  To go back to the CCAC&rsquo;s annual report and that implementation gap, the policy and ambition are not translating into action.  One of the pieces that came through very strongly in that regard was the fractured nature of existing service delivery and project implementation.  I see the annex of actions for the climate plan as they relate to transport, and I see the Department of Transport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the County and City Management Association, CCMA, local authorities and other relevant stakeholders.  To me, that seems a business as usual approach and there is no lead agency focused on the delivery of these projects.  I know the greenways have been given to TII.  Will the Government specifically task the NTA to give it absolute authority in terms of delivering these and to give it oversight of the implementation?</p></speech>

The level 5 restrictions had an impact on the roll-out of greenways because those projects were not seen as essential projects during the level 5 restrictions, which meant any non-essential construction could not occur during those months.  That has impacted on the roll-out of a number of those projects.</p>  <p>  All local authorities spent much of this year recruiting new staff after that formal authorisation was given to them in March to recruit NTA-funded staff.  The NTA will be driving that.  Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I have allocated a lot of funding for active travel throughout the country.  It is imperative that agencies working with local authorities and the local authorities, which will be over the roll-out of many of these projects, prioritise these projects over the next 12 months.  Now that the allocation of resources is there, the excuses are not there for any kind of slowdown or delays for many of these projects to be rolled out.</p></speech>

Two BusConnects spines have been rolled out to date and one of them is in my area.  If we are going to anticipate the problems that are emerging, we have to pick up the feedback from people where this is being rolled out.  I do not believe what is being done at the moment is enough.  A Dublin Bus telephone number has been given but it is a general number, and there is then a BusConnects number that is permanently engaged.  It is part of the public feedback but it is not adequate.</p></reply>

I agree with the Deputy that it is important that people have an opportunity to give feedback and their thoughts on its roll-out.  It is great to see improvements happening on the ground with this year&rsquo;s launch of the H spine and the C spine.  Next year will see further phases of the new network rolled out, while planning applications for the core bus corridors will also be lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  I am sure all of us who campaign for improved public transport welcome these developments.  I would also like to acknowledge that consultation with the public and stakeholders has been an integral part of the BusConnects programme and has positively influenced its development so far.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the breadth and depth of public engagement on BusConnects Dublin is certainly unique in a transport context and quite possibly in any public policy context.</p>  <p>  In terms of the new services that have been rolled out already, the National Transport Authority and the bus operators are keeping all aspects of the new network under scrutiny and are closely monitoring the new services following their introduction.</p>  <p>  All households in the areas served by the H spine and C spine received information booklets as the services were introduced and those booklets provide information on how to provide feedback and comment, whether by telephone, email or online.  If there are issues in regard to the phone lines being engaged, I will raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as well as any other barriers for people in trying to submit their comments.  Those feedback channels are in addition to the three rounds of public consultation that informed the development of the new network and the 72,000 submissions received as part of those consultation processes.  Therefore, while I agree with the Deputy that feedback is important, I think the channels already established would seem to be appropriate at this stage.  If, as the Deputy said, they cannot get through for whatever reason on the telephone line, there is an email and online method as well.  Nonetheless, if there are challenges around that, I will certainly raise that with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

There is no doubt some of the new services are working well.  I can only look at the spine that I can see directly.  There is no doubt some of it is working well but some of it is not working well at all.  Some of the buses do not connect in terms of timetables.  I can see double-decker feeder buses with practically nobody on them from 4:30 a.m. and every half an hour until 11:30 p.m.  It looks like there are loads of services but, at the same time, for the past month or six weeks, my office has almost become a complaints department.  To be honest, I am fed up with it at this stage.  People are saying this is clearly not working and they are getting back in their cars where these services are not working and where services are not direct anymore.  The chaos around some of the schools is very obvious.  It is very frustrating.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to consultation.  Thousands of submissions went in from my area but people do not feel they were listened to.</p></speech>

The information I have is there are channels and clear information for people to make their complaints and give their comments around existing services.  I know the NTA is liaising closely with the transport operators in reviewing the introduction of these new services and it will take appropriate action, where necessary, to mitigate the impact of these services.  I will certainly relay the Deputy&rsquo;s comments back to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p>  <p>  With regard to the core bus corridors, the NTA intends to re-engage with the community fora established during earlier consultation phases on the core bus corridors as the various schemes proceed to construction.  The NTA is also establishing a transport users advisory group.  The purpose of that group will be to provide advice and recommendations to the NTA from the perspective of both the transport users and those engaged in active travel.  That advisory group will provide the NTA with the viewpoints that can feed into future policy and programmes as they are implemented.</p></speech>

I welcome that there will be an ongoing look at this and possibilities for feedback.  I also received the brochure the Minister of State talked about.  I rang the numbers on many occasions, I have left feedback and I have left my mobile number.  I asked for a phone call back to me last week and have not got it yet.  If we do not pick up the complaints or the problems at this stage, how are we going to address them?  I heard there were very few complaints about the first spine that was rolled out.  I wonder is that because it rolled out very well or because there was inadequate feedback.  It is very important that complaints are picked up.</p> <p>People will not ring in if it is going well.  They will ring in if something is not working for them and they need to be encouraged to do that or to provide feedback in whatever way they possibly can.  It is all over the local Facebook pages but that is no use.  People are complaining to each other and there has to be a better way of dealing with this.</p></speech>

The programme for Government has set a target for 70% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and for 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030.  The climate action plan, published on 4 November 2021, has since increased the target to 80% renewable electricity by 2030.  Both plans also set out how Ireland will take advantage of the potential of at least 30 GW of floating offshore wind power in our deeper waters in the Atlantic.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s increased ambition in ORE and pending a review of the overall national ports policy in 2022, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, conducted an assessment of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate the ORE sector and assist in Ireland achieving its emission reduction targets.  Taking account of the conclusions and recommendations of that assessment, I have decided that a multi-port approach will be required to address the needs of the ORE industry and a policy statement will be issued in the near future setting out this approach.  ORE will develop in phases on the east, south, south-west and west coasts, and a multiple of ports will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and at different times for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments.  This multi-port approach will help maximise the economic benefits at regional as well as national level in terms of the creation of jobs and new SME enterprise that can support the development of the ORE industry.  Funding for ORE-related port infrastructure is available under the connecting Europe funding, CEF, facility which is the funding instrument for the EU's trans-European transport network, TEN-T.  My Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports.</p></speech>

What sort of timeframe is involved and how soon can we expect to see that?  She will know that Carbon Trust and Wind Energy Ireland identified more than 12 months ago that no Irish port was ready to support the construction of offshore wind farms.  They indicated that in the region of &euro;50 to &euro;100 million would need to be invested in one port and the Minister of State is talking about multiple ports.  When will the policy statement be ready?  The Minister of State also mentioned the CEF.  What scale of funding will be required, where will it come from and how soon will it be available?</p></speech>

That was presented to the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change on 8 December and went to Government on 14 December.  The policy statement is in line with the existing national ports policy, which recognises the role of commercial State ports in servicing offshore renewable energy.  The policy statement reiterates that position and signals the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ORE developers on the provision of port facilities in Ireland.  On the opportunities around this, a multi-port approach will help to maximise the economic benefits at a regional and national level.  The Department is assisting, as appropriate, the eligible TEN-T ports to put forward applications for studies or works related to the provision of offshore renewable energy infrastructure at their ports.</p></speech>

We hear from the sector itself that the window of opportunity is narrow and that we need to act urgently to grasp the opportunity to reach our targets for 2030.  We hear from the offshore wind sector, particularly the floating offshore wind sector, that they are concerned with the scale of ambition and the stated ambition in that area.  We should act quickly on this, designate those ports and invest in them to harness the opportunity.  What is the scale of funding that will be required and how will it be delivered?</p></speech>

This is because of more favourable sea areas with significant water available at depths of under 60 m, combined with proximity to an existing and relatively strong onshore transmission system.  It is intended the 5 GW target will be facilitated through two phases of offshore wind deployment with two specific auctions to take place under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, 1 and RESS 2.  A consultation to inform the approach to the second phase will include the option of including some floating offshore wind as a special category in RESS 2.  The significant potential for offshore renewable energy in the Atlantic is not envisaged until later in the decade.</p>  <p>  On port timelines, Wicklow Port and Arklow Harbour have entered into arrangements with individual offshore renewable energy project developers to serve as operation and maintenance spaces.  Plans are also under way for the deployment of facilities at Rosslare Europort and Cork Dockyard.  Drogheda Port is proposing to develop large-scale deepwater port facilities on the east coast, and Shannon Foynes Port Company and the ESB are planning a large-scale redevelopment in the Shannon Estuary at Foynes.</p></speech>

Member states may, if they choose, apply higher standards in their own jurisdictions.</p> <p> Under Irish law, a person aged 70 or over must provide a medical report from their GP when applying for or renewing a driving licence, regardless of health status.  Depending on the report, the applicant may be granted a licence for one or three years.  On consideration of the current position, I have accepted a recommendation from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, that the initial age for mandatory medical testing, where an applicant is not otherwise required to supply a medical report, should be increased from 70 to 75.  This change will require amendments to the relevant regulations.  The regulatory amendments required are being progressed and the estimated date of implementation is currently February 2022.  However, this will depend on legal advice and the availability of drafting resources.</p> <p> In Ireland all driving licence applicants must complete a self-declaration on driver fitness.  Drivers aged over 70 and those with a specified condition must produce a medical report with their application.  The National Office of Transport Medicine wrote to the RSA in January 2019 recommending that the requirement for routine medical certification of drivers over 70 be lifted.  However, the authority noted that public perception of mandatory medical testing for older drivers is reasonably favourable, even if it is not supported by available research.  </p> <p> We hope that the new regulation will be in place by February 2022.</p></speech>

I am concerned at the February date because when previously raised, there was an expectation that this would be in place by December of this year, assuming that there were no wobbles or hold-ups.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the delays that emerged over recent months to cause the date to be pushed out to February.  Has it been sent to the Parliamentary Counsel for advice?  How quickly would the Minister of State expect the counsel to respond?</p>  <p>  Realistically, GPs are up to their eyes administering vaccines at this stage and to be drawing perfectly healthy people into GP surgeries to get medical certificates confirming that they are perfectly healthy does not make any sense.  Similarly, at a time when respiratory conditions are more widespread, to be drawing vulnerable people into GP surgeries does not make sense.  There needs to be greater speed in bringing this change about, if possible.</p></speech>

The February 2022 date will depend on the legal advice and the availability of drafting resources.  I take Deputy Moynihan's point regarding the pressure on GPs at the moment.  In order to address the social distancing requirements and the additional burdens on our medical services during the pandemic, the requirement for those over 70 to provide a medical report was temporarily removed in order to protect our citizens and take pressure off our medical services.  From March 2020 to June 2021 people aged 70 or over could apply to renew their driver licence without a medical report where they did not have an identified or specified illness.  To date, there has been no indication of any negative effects on road safety because of this concession.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's points on board and if I can get more information on that February 2022 timeline, I will revert to him on it.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by many people who are waiting to renew their licence.  Their dates are up now or will be fairly shortly but they are holding off on renewal, pending this change.  Where do they stand?  Will it be based on their date of birth?  If a person's birthday falls now but this new measure does not come in until next February, where do they stand?  Will they still need to have a medical certificate or can they wait until February?  Is there a danger that they would lose their licence if they wait too long?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation in that regard.  Will it be based on birthdays from a specified date going forward and where do people whose renewals are now due stand?  It really is case of getting this provision available as quickly as possible because it is a very practical and positive measure.</p></speech>

I know the issue of a rail link to Navan was one of several that generated a significant number of submissions during the original public consultation held by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in November 2020.  The GDA transport strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and will ultimately be submitted for ministerial approval in 2022.  Therefore, it is not appropriate at this juncture to speak about prioritisation of one particular project over another.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, there is a long lead-in time for big projects like this.  If it is included in the final strategy, this project will require significant planning and design before it is shovel-ready.  As it stands, the draft strategy, which covers all modes of transport and all counties in the GDA, proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period.  On the proposal itself, the background report prepared for the NTA considered again the strategic rationale for such a rail link.  It considered rail and bus options, re-examined the potential alignments of a rail link and provided a high-level assessment of cost and demand.  While the benefit-to-cost ratio returned by the economic assessment was less than that seen for some other projects, the report concluded there was a strong strategic rationale for the proposal and that is why it has been brought forward for inclusion in the draft strategy.</p><p>Consultation on the draft strategy is currently open and is running until 17 December.  I encourage the Deputy to make the case for the rail link in the final version of the<i></i>strategy, which will be submitted for ministerial approval in 2022. </p></speech>

As she said, thousands of people from right across County Meath made submissions in support of the proposed extension of the rail line to Navan via Dunshaughlin.  The evidence base has now been built for this project.  It was contested for some time but anybody who recognised the opportunity that was there knew that the business case for the proposal would stand on its own two feet.  Indeed, it does that and more.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the opportunity, within the constraints that exist, to expedite and deliver this project ahead of the indicated timeframe of 2031 for the construction stage.</p></speech>

It is due to commence shortly.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the revised transport strategy will be ready for approval and publication by mid-2022.  Alongside the national development plan, NDP, the Department's forthcoming land transport investment framework will put in place a strategic framework to ensure that investment in the transport sector in the coming decades aligns with the overarching Government policies such as spatial targets for 2040.  </p> <p>It is a major project that will require significant design and planning.

There is serious frustration in the community that the project has been delayed to the extent that it has been.  We understand the process but it is incredibly frustrating that the Government is moving from one review to another to a framework to a strategy.  The case has been made in black and white.  The project needs to be delivered.  People want to see a date where rather than driving and sitting in traffic on the road to Dublin, they can get on a train.</p>  <p>  I recognise the investment and the commitment in the NDP but it is backloaded.

What supports are under consideration by the Department?  What work is it doing to help the sector to transition to a more carbon-friendly model?  This is a huge issue that we must deal with and on which we must work directly with the sector.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600008#F00800"><p>We can all acknowledge that transitioning the haulage sector to low or zero carbon will be more challenging than other road transport sectors given the size and weight of trucks and the distances they travel.  Ireland&rsquo;s HGV fleet is particularly reliant on fossil fuels, specifically diesel.  Biofuels will help with the transition. The renewable fuels for transport policy statement which was published last month sets out a future trajectory of increase in biofuels use in land transport in line with climate action plan targets to 2030, as well as a range of measures and incentives for future supply of renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen.</p>  <p>  As the initial investment in alternative fuel technology for HGVs is expensive at the moment, the Government is providing incentives to the sector to make the transition.  The alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, is intended to help to bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and those powered by alternatively fuelled power-trains.  Some &euro;2 million was allocated to this scheme in 2021.  Given the excellent response to the initiative, the Department allocated an additional &euro;1 million in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility.  Funds for 2021 have now been fully allocated, but the scheme will continue in 2022 with further funding available.</p>  <p>  The Department has also commissioned a number of studies to identify actions that haulage operators and companies can take to reduce carbon and other emissions.  These include a road freight decarbonisation study co-funded with TII and three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork.  Collectively, these projects will form a substantial evidence base on which a longer-term decarbonisation strategy can be developed.  We are also developing our ten-year haulage strategy, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and on helping the haulage sector to move to a low-carbon future.</p></speech>

It is interesting to hear the initiatives that the Department is bringing forward.  There will be many challenges before the haulage sector.  Internationally there has been much difficulty in logistics, which is the Minister of State's area of responsibility.  We have to be conscious that there is another key demand on the whole industry where it is expected to try to reduce its carbon footprint.  If the Government is going to insist on that, and if that will be insisted on at European level, it is important that we introduce a suite of measures and supports to help the sector.  It is interesting to hear from the Department that efforts are being made.  There is also the issue of autonomous vehicles.  Ireland could be an international test bed in that area.  It would potentially reduce a lot of stress on haulage workers in the very near future as technology advances.  That could be one area that might help to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, which would be important for the Department to consider.</p></speech>

Reducing emissions in the sector is one issue.  The other issues include how we are dealing with the driver shortage and how to make the profession more attractive.  There has been the first phase of a public consultation, with further consultation on the draft strategy next year.  Between Covid, Brexit and other challenges facing the industry, this is a really good time to get the feedback from the industry on how we can support the sector and the supply chain.  We have seen how reliant and flexible it was through the Brexit transition.  Our supply chain was robust.  They were flexible, as they told us they would be.  We were all fearful about the transition on 1 January but the sector has really done us proud.  We need to ensure we support it in every way possible.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I met representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, last week to discuss many of these issues.</p></speech>

That is important to acknowledge.  It has been one of the areas that we relied on.  New additional pressures have been put on.</p>  <p>  On emissions, the Minister of State has said that the Department will do more public consultation, which I welcome.  It is important that there be a grassroots level engagement also.  As we have seen recently, there has been a great degree of friction between the Government and hauliers in Ireland.  That must be worked on and improved.  Fuel prices must also be acknowledged as the elephant in the room.  They are a concern for many families but especially those who are on the road daily, keeping our shops supplied and businesses going, and working to get our exports out of the country.</p>  <p>  As this will be my last contribution before the holidays, I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the staff of the House a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

The Minister and I agreed at the meeting to consider a proposal from the IRHA to expand the relief available to hauliers under the diesel rebate scheme, but with a link to the phase-out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector.  Details of the proposal are to be submitted to the Department for further consideration and we will meet the IRHA again in the new year.</p>  <p>  It is a sector that is very challenged and needs to be supported.  One way is through the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles scheme, which is a medium- to long-term solution for the sector as new technologies come on board.  In the meantime, the sector does need our support.  I have engaged with it a great deal over the last 12 months since I came into this role and that is something I will continue to do along with the Minister.</p></speech>

When will the Department expedite the roll-out of this scheme to all the schools that have applied in Limerick and north County Tipperary?

The programme aims to support walking, scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools and to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities.  This will help alleviate congestion at school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  All schools were eligible to apply to the programme and information was circulated from the Departments of Education and Transport to schools nationwide.  By the deadline of 16 April, 931 applications had been received from schools in every county in Ireland.  Following that, 170 schools were notified on 21 June that they have been selected for inclusion in the first round of the safe routes to school programme, including eight schools in Limerick and two schools in Tipperary.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;15 million has been allocated for projects at the 170 schools included in round 1.  The subsequent schools will be engaged with on a rolling basis in each local authority area.  This funding is being provided from the &euro;1.8 billion funding earmarked in the programme for Government to support sustainable transport.  It is important to note that all active travel funding looks to improve links to schools where possible, not only the safe routes to school programme.  The required investment at each school will be dependent on the changes required in each particular case.  As most interventions at or near applicable schools will take time to implement, especially if they require planning permission, the &euro;15 million budget will extend beyond 2022.  The budget for the cycle parking element of safe routes to school programme in 2022 will be &euro;3 million.</p>  <p>  The schools selected were assessed against a range of criteria including school type, location and the school&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable travel.  Schools that have applied this year and that have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply as they will be included on a rolling basis.  Thus, we will get through the first 170 and then it will be rolling after that.  Hence there are no plans for an additional call for schools to join the programme.</p></speech>

If one school is completed, does another school automatically come in then in Limerick?  It is great we see eight city-based schools being included in the safe routes to schools programme under this round.  However, we have schools in villages in rural areas.  In north County Tipperary we have the likes of Newport and Birdhill.  In County Limerick we have Castleconnell, Moroe and Caherconlish.  Then we have rural schools.  When do they come into the programme?</p>  <p>  It is such an innovative idea.  It ticks every box with respect to climate change, active travel and health.  It should be expedited.  Extra funding should be put in to get this rolled out faster.  I note there are extra staff being taken on by the Green Schools initiative in An Taisce, the NTA and the local authorities.  Will the Minister of State explain the mechanism for when the works will commence for the other schools that did not get on the first list but have been approved?  Is it based one school joining when another finishes?</p></speech>

They are Gaelscoil S&aacute;irs&eacute;al, St. Nessan&rsquo;s National School, Scoil &Iacute;de, St. Paul's National School, Laurel Hill Col&aacute;iste FCJ, An Mhodhscoil, Limerick School Project National School and St. Munchin's College in Corbally.  In Tipperary they were Gaelscoil Chluain Meala and Loreto Secondary School.  It is important to note the other 29 schools in Limerick and the 22 in Tipperary that have applied this year but have not been included in the first round of funding will not be required to reapply.  They will come into the programme on this rolling basis.  There are different stages.  Once a school is completed the local authority moves on to the next schools that have been successful as part of the roll-out to the first 170.</p>  <p>  It is also important to say safe routes to school programme funding is only one part of the active travel programme.  Schools can work directly with local authorities around other active travel projects outside the programme.  As the Deputy knows, we have &euro;360 million funding per year for walking and cycling infrastructure that local authorities can tap into also, within towns and villages.</p></speech>

It is about the mechanism for me.  Is there a time limit on when the local authorities must have the eight schools in Limerick and two in Tipperary that have been selected done?  I ask that the Minister of State, as she has responsibility for this programme, look to see how we can expedite it.  This is a win-win.  This is something every parent, child and local area would buy into.  The fact we are doing 170 schools this year is to be welcomed but I would like to see an awful lot more done.  Will the Minister of State commit to looking at the programme to see what can be done?  There is &euro;260 million provided every year for active travel.  What can we do to expedite the roll-out?  Of the 29 schools in Limerick, is that the number yet to be done or the total number in Limerick?  I will assume 29 is the number that got through.  Of those, eight have got it.  When can the 21 remaining schools be completed?  In Tipperary two schools got it and 20 remain.  When will they be reached?  I ask that the Minister of State look to see how we can expedite the roll-out of the programme because this is something that is welcome in the city and urban areas and in villages and rural areas.</p></speech>

At the moment, the six infrastructure officer teams in An Taisce Green Schools are currently working on stage 4 of this process.  That is the communication and liaison interventions.  The infrastructure officers have now met the majority of round 1 schools to discuss the situation outside those schools, any new information on school locations etc. and possible solutions.  In addition, the work that has been undertaken includes a survey of all the schools, parental surveys, front of school audits and walking and cycling audits that are being carried out to assess the existing pedestrian and cycling infrastructure within 500 m of a school.  This information is going to inform the process so it is being captured as well.  Speed surveys are also being carried out to assess the existing speed outside schools.  This data will then help inform the delivery plans and further engage with the school population.  The NTA and safe routes to school teams have produced a draft safe routes to school design guide to assist the local authorities to provide the technical guidance.</p>  <p>  The infrastructure officers are holding weekly meetings with the active travel engineers to update on the safe routes to school programme in Limerick.  There are on-site visits to schools, except for Scoil &Iacute;de and St. Munchin's College, with executive engineers to discuss the possible measures.  Tipperary is holding its discussions.  It has weekly meetings in relation to schools in Clonmel.  With the roll-out of the resources to the local authorities, we will be monitoring this to ensure these 170 are progressed as quickly as possible.  Part of that was to give them the staffing that many of them said they did not have.</p></speech>

It is the NTA that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the rural transport programme which operates under the Transport For Ireland Local Link brand.  The NTA works with the relevant transport companies that are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the services.</p>  <p>  From a policy perspective, the Minister has made his beliefs clear that there is a need for a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland.  The Department has been undertaking a review of sustainable mobility policy, which incorporates public transport in rural areas.  We intend to develop a new policy framework for the next ten years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme and we hope to publish our new sustainable mobility policy early next year.</p> <p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid-19 public health emergency has had a profound and swift shock on the public transport sector.  Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to &euro;620 million.  For 2021, more than &euro;670 million has been provided in public service obligation, PSO, funding in order to ensure the existing level of public transport services, albeit at a higher cost, continue to operate in a safe manner.  By comparison, the level of PSO and LocalLink funding provided in 2019 was in the region of &euro;300 million.</p> <p> I know of the Deputy's deep interest in the development of public transport services generally and more specifically in respect of the two areas she mentioned.  I am advised by the NTA that, in addition to rail services from Laytown, commuter services are provided from Bettystown and Laytown by Matthews Coaches.  These are commercial services and are licensed by the NTA.  The NTA has no role in the setting of fares for commercial services.</p> <p> On bus services, the NTA has indicated that Bettystown and Laytown are considered suburbs of Drogheda when planning their public transport services.  Routes D1 and D2 provide four bus services linking both centres to Laytown station to the south and the town of Drogheda to the north west.</p></speech>

The majority of those people have relocated from Dublin and travel to Dublin every day.  We have a situation where the cost of an adult monthly train fare from Laytown to Dublin is &euro;247.  The fare from Balbriggan to Connolly Station in Dublin is &euro;145 a month and Drogheda to Dublin is &euro;264 a month.  The average cost of an adult return ticket to Balbriggan is &euro;11.05 and the equivalent to Laytown is &euro;21.15.  There is a distance of 10 km between Laytown and Balbriggan.</p>  <p>  The issue is about reducing our carbon footprint.  I have asked the NTA on numerous occasions to extend the short hop zone to Laytown and Bettystown to encourage more people to leave their cars and get on the train.  The NTA has refused to do this, but the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is responsible for policy.  We know that at the stroke of a pen he could direct the NTA to extend the short hop zone.  Will that be done?</p></speech>

Such stations have fares that are not well suited for the pay-as-you-go service provided by the Transport for Ireland, TFI, Leap card because cardholders would need to maintain a high minimum balance on their Leap cards before they could use them.  The best fare for such intercity services is typically obtained by booking in advance, which again is not suited to the TFI Leap card.  The NTA is actively investigating alternative ticketing solutions that would be better suited to intercity rail services as part of a next-generation ticketing initiative.</p>  <p>  The NTA has adjusted a number of fares in order to mitigate the fares charged at the outside edge of the short hop zone.  A number of tickets between Gormanston, Laytown and Dublin have either remained at the same price level or seen a reduction since 2018.  The NTA is actively engaged on the development of a very flexible TaxSaver ticketing product suitable for occasional use in response to the change in public transport use as a result of Covid-19.  It is hopeful of bringing something forward early next year.</p></speech>

The Minister is responsible for policy.  When we talk about getting cars off the road we are happy enough to slap a carbon tax on people, but not to make a basic adjustment to extend the short hop zone to that area to encourage more people to leave their cars at home.  Is the Minister of State seriously saying that the Minister cannot direct the NTA to extend the short hop zone to Laytown and Bettystown?  If that is the case, it is farcical because he can of course do that.  If there is any sincerity at all in climate action and reducing our carbon footprint, he would extend that short hop zone in order to get the volume of cars off the road that are travelling to and from Dublin every single day.  Will he do that?  Will he instruct the NTA to do precisely that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600010#H01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 33 and 48 together.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the SPSV industry has been badly affected during the Covid-19 pandemic that, for an extended period, brought about an almost complete collapse in passenger demand for taxi and other SPSV services.  While recent months saw a welcome return of demand, with the NTA reporting 86% of drivers back at work in October, the recent increase in infection rates has given rise to the necessary reintroduction of a number of restrictions.  Conscious of the potential impact of such restrictions on affected sectors and society in general, particularly as we approach what is traditionally a busy period around Christmas, the Government has sought to ensure that any restrictions are targeted and appropriate.  It is continuing to monitor the situation closely as it develops.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I confirm that the vast majority of measures that we have taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place.  I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, at the height of the pandemic.  As the Deputy may be aware, the PUP reopened for a limited period to support people who lose their employment as a result of Covid restrictions from Tuesday, 7 December.  Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in any given eight-week period, net of expenses.</p>  <p>  Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the Covid-19 enterprise support grant, worth &euro;1,000, which will meet the costs associated with returning to work and that will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP claim.  Taxi drivers can use this grant for the purchase of personal protective equipment, protective screens and cleaning materials.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, which provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and gross pay to employees, is now expected to continue until 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, support for SPSV operators continues to be available, both now and into 2022, through a series of specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators that cannot be deferred.  Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and they are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million.  The NTA has put schemes in place to refund motor tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive national car test fees for the same period.  Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website.  The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring that no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.  Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero- or low-emission vehicles, we have confirmed that there will be a further reiteration of the current eSPSV grant scheme in 2022, following the allocation of funding for next year as part of the budget 2022 process.  There has been an exceptionally high uptake of this grant scheme in 2021.  It received a total of 1,488 applications and, at the beginning of November, &euro;8.5 million had been paid to applicants, with the remainder of funding allocated to applicants with current provisional grant offers.</p>  <p>  In addition, Microfinance Ireland announced in September that loan finance, up to &euro;25,000, is now available to support applicants to the scheme, as many SPSV owners were finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers.  Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.</p></speech>

Many are being refused it.  I got a message while I was sitting here ten minutes ago from another taxi driver who has been refused access to the PUP.</p>  <p>  Overnight when the restrictions came back in, all late night work disappeared.  I was struck by a response that Deputy O'Rourke received from the Taoiseach last week to the effect that just because the late night work is gone, it has not entirely dried up.  Anyone who knows or lives near a taxi driver or canvasses where a taxi is in the driveway looks up to see whether the blinds are down because everyone knows how important the night-time economy is for a viable income for a taxi driver.  We need to stop treating taxi drivers like second-class citizens in our public transport network.  They are vital and the job they have done during Covid has gone underappreciated in government.</p></speech>

They felt like that again.  I welcome that they can now apply for the PUP, though as Deputy Duncan Smith said, there seem to be difficulties in practice.  I am not even sure the Government would have done that except for pressure from taxi drivers, and indeed the Opposition, to ensure they got the PUP.</p>  <p>  More than that is needed.  As has been said, the late night sector is crucial because bringing people home from night clubs and social events is a large portion of their business.  The PUP on its own is not enough without being coupled with the regulatory reforms needed to help them weather this loss of business.  Overhead costs have remained essentially the same and the assistance from the Government has been totally inadequate.  If action is not taken, there will be fewer taxis on our roads.  There does not seem to be a coherent plan to ensure taxi drivers can stay viable and on the road.</p></speech>

We all accept our public transport system would not operate without taxi drivers.  Taxi drivers feel they are the last to be considered in any way.  Even when taxi drivers got back to work, elements of that work are no longer there to the same degree and that was before we were worried about Omicron and the current situation.  The factory runs they would have done in the mornings as a considerable part of their work are not there due to the way people are remote working.  We could not survive in relation to school runs and health and hospital runs.  We can talk about all the necessary supports but taxi drivers are being refused the PUP.  We are not putting those supports in.  The idea of the supports was to keep those industries and families right through those periods so everybody could do the right thing from a health perspective.  We need to ensure we have this service afterwards.</p></speech>

It was a valuable opportunity for him to get first-hand information on the issues affecting the industry, as well as an initial assessment of the impact of the latest restrictions brought about by the recent public health advice.  This committee brings a broad range of stakeholders, including taxi drivers and passengers, together to advise the Minister and the NTA on policy.  In the past, taxi representatives have played a constructive role on the committee and many measures taken to date, including the extension of the taxi age limits and the waiver of licence fees, originated as recommendations from the committee.</p>  <p>  That is an appropriate forum for dealing with issues in the sector but it is important to say a number of measures are still in place, including the refund of NCT and motor tax, the waiver of licence fees at a cost of &euro;6 million, the PUP, where they can earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period, and the &euro;1,000 enterprise grant scheme.  The Minister will continue to engage with the sector on supports as the pandemic continues, as we are doing across government.</p></speech>

It is dominated by other interests, such as hospitality, hotels and the apps.  It is not that they should not be taken into account but it is a taxi advisory committee and the taxi drivers feel they are a relatively marginal voice in it, that the committee has no real power or weight and is a fob-off, gesture and fig leaf.  That area is in urgent need of reform.  We need a representative body that has a serious influence on policies and is properly representative of taxi drivers, co-ops and so on around the country.</p>  <p>  On the ten-year rule, many taxi drivers are still concerned about having to replace their vehicle.  Further flexibility is needed there.</p></speech>

She and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have to deal with the issue because Deputies Duncan Smith, O'Rourke, &Oacute; Laoghaire and I are all getting engagement from taxi drivers being refused the PUP.  That needs to be dealt with.  I believe the Minister and the Minister of State need to meet with the taxi representative associations.  There are other issues but these are the issues they face at this point.  We need to keep this vital part of the public transport infrastructure in place.</p>  <p>  There are other issues to be dealt with.  We need to look consistently at the ten-year rule.  There have been short-term fixes.  We need a long-term electric vehicle, EV, scheme that makes sense and is reviewed consistently.  The sector has called for a look into and timeline on the new fares agreement.  The big thing is the Minister of State needs to meet with them, see their needs, keep the show on the road and ensure they are able to avail of the PUP.

They have played a crucial role in the current supports, including the refund of NCT and motor tax and extending the vehicle age.  At the start of the pandemic, the industry regulator the National Transport Authority immediately extended age limits for taxis and hackneys and has done so three times.  The most recent extension is up to the end of 2022, thus ensuring no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  These are considerations that the Government is taking on board, noting that one of the huge costs for taxi drivers is the replacement of vehicles, as well as the other measures in place.  The Minister will continue to engage and work constructively with the sector, as have the Taoiseach and other Ministers across government.  There is a recognition that restrictions are having an impact on this sector and others.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her question and the opportunity to update Deputies on the status of my Department's work on the CI&Eacute; regular wages scheme.</p> <p>As many in the House will be aware, the CI&Eacute; Group has two pension schemes, namely, the regular wages scheme, RWS, and the 1951 superannuation scheme, and issues around the schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CI&Eacute; Group and its employees.  The CI&Eacute; Group is actively engaged in introducing changes to both schemes aimed at rectifying the significant deficit in order to meet the statutory minimum funding standard required by the Pensions Authority. <br/><br/>A ballot of RWS members on a Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, proposal took place in June 2020 and was carried by 83% of those who voted.  The proposed changes were agreed by the trustees of the schemes, the employees and the CI&Eacute; Group following extensive and prolonged engagement between all parties.  Following this process, CI&Eacute; prepared and submitted draft statutory instruments to my Department to give effect to the proposed amendments, to establish a new defined contribution scheme and to consolidate the existing statutory instruments comprising the main scheme.  These changes involve significant amendments that are necessary to address the minimum funding standard requirements.  There are a number of steps involved before a statutory instrument can be made, including the statutory consultation process.  Further, under the Transport Act 1950, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on any amendments to CI&Eacute; pension schemes.  I can advise that this consultation is under way and I expect that the details will be settled shortly. <br/><br/>Once the final details have been settled, we will direct CI&Eacute; to publish the amending schedules or schemes in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>for a consultation period of not less than 28 days as required under the Transport Act.  The Minister must then consider any objections or representations which have been made during this period, prior to confirming a scheme or any amendments to such schemes.  I am not in a position to comment on proposed aspects of the scheme prior to the approval of both Ministers and subsequent publication as part of the statutory consultation process.<br/><br/>I would also like to take this opportunity to again reassure the Deputy that officials in my Department, in conjunction with advisors from NewERA, have been working on the draft statutory instruments as expeditiously as possible.  In this context, we hope to be in a position to confirm the schemes in early 2022.</p></speech>

I have already conveyed apologies to Deputy Pearse Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who will take over from me in a few moments.</p>  <p>  I will quickly answer the question put to me by Deputy Farrell.  The Government's Housing for All strategy includes an action from my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.  My expectation is that we will receive information relevant to the design of the vacant property tax in the first quarter of next year and I anticipate, in the aftermath of that, I will be able to bring proposals to Government and the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act has enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners last month in respect of the new LPT valuation period from 2022 to 2025.  This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing the design of a vacant property tax.</p>  <p>  Before introducing the tax, it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties.  It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long term or short term in nature.  There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy, such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person's estate.  Appropriate exemptions from any charge will have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.</p></speech>

Since 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the introduction of a vacant homes tax as another lever to increase supply, end the scourge of dereliction and put vacant homes back into use.  In June 2017, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, called on the Government to introduce a vacant property tax in budget 2018, a budget that was negotiated between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  That was four years ago.  No vacant homes tax has been introduced in any year since.  The Government published its Housing for All plan on 2 September without any firm commitments on introducing a vacant property tax to penalise those who allow residential properties to remain idle and unused.  What has been committed to is a data collection exercise.  Will the Minister confirm that he rejects the conclusions of the 2018 Indecon report that was the grounds for the Government's previous rejection of a vacant homes tax?  If he plans to introduce this tax, will he spell out its design?</p></speech>

The 2018 Indecon report reflected the housing market as it stood then but we are now in a situation where we need to make even more urgent use of properties and land available for housing and accommodation purposes.  That is why the Housing for All strategy contains a different commitment to the introduction of a vacant property tax.</p>  <p>  That said, the vacant property tax is only one of a number of measures we will need to implement to make progress in tackling the housing needs in our country.  We are making progress.  The construction of more than 30,000 homes had commenced by October 2021.  That is an increase of 49% on the previous year.  That is a signal that our strategy is working.</p></speech>

In its quarter 2 report for 2021, GeoDirectory found that more than 92,000 homes, or 4.5% of the housing stock, lay vacant in June this year.  Recent research suggests we have the tenth highest vacancy rate in the world.  It is a national scandal.  Why has the Government not introduced a vacant property tax in each of the past five years?  Will the Minister commit to doing so as soon as possible?  I know he has said he will give us further details in the future but we need this as soon as possible.</p><p>I also draw the Minister's attention to recent stories in the <i>Business Post</i>, which found the Minister and the Department massaged the facts regarding rates of vacancy to undermine the proposition of a vacant homes tax.  Most recently, it was reported that briefing notes provided to the Minister for Finance cherry-picked data relating to vacancy rates, omitting documented evidence of high residential vacancy rates.  That is completely unacceptable.  Does the Minister agree?  Will he commit to expediting the introduction of a vacant homes tax as soon as possible?</p></speech>

I receive full, impartial and comprehensive input and advice from my officials on this and every other matter.  The information notes I receive and the evaluations that are given to me are part of how that guidance is provided to me.  I have had ongoing engagement with my officials on this matter and they have provided me with comprehensive briefings on this and other issues.  I repeat that I reject any claim that the information provided to me is in any way massaged or presents anything less than a full picture of this issue.</p> <p>I will say again that the impact we are making at the moment, although we know we need to do more, is that 31,000 homes were commenced over the past 12 months.  I have outlined to the House how we will deal with this issue and make the design choices on the vacant property tax.</p></speech>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis.  It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  In monetary terms, the overall support provided today by the EWSS is more than &euro;6.6 billion, comprising direct subsidies of almost &euro;5.7 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of more than 696,900 employees.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the EWSS are based on self-assessment principles.  The legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of the business disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I draw attention to the fact that despite the exit from most public health restrictions during the summer, eligibility criteria were not tightened in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which was enacted in the summer and which extends the scheme beyond the end of June 2021.  Indeed, the reference period to which the metric must be applied was broadened in that Act to span a full year, thus relaxing the conditionality to qualify to benefit from the scheme in most cases.</p>  <p>  Many businesses were fully closed or limited in their capacity to trade due to the public health restrictions in place during the earlier months of 2021.  This change in the assessment period meant that such businesses could generate the equivalent of up to 70% of their calendar year turnover from 2019 or customer orders for the remainder of 2021 and still remain eligible to claim support under the scheme.</p>  <p>  To address the specific question regarding businesses, for example, hotels that are operating at just over 70%, such businesses would not be eligible for the EWSS as their turnover exceeds the threshold for support.  The scheme is a calibrated in such a way as to ensure support is available for those businesses most adversely impacted by the pandemic.  The eligibility requirement of a 30% reduction in turnover has been a key feature of the scheme since its since introduction.  I have no plans to alter that criterion.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that against the background of the imposition of revised public health restrictions, the Government decided last Thursday that the enhanced rates of the EWSS subsidy will apply for a further two months, that is, December of this year and January of next.  This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is being extended to the end of January.   Provision is also made to allow me to extend this scheme up to 30 April 2022 by ministerial order if deemed necessary.  As Deputies are aware, and I thank them for their support last night, amendments to the Bill were tabled this week to give effect to the EWSS and CRSS schemes mentioned.</p>  <p>  To conclude, the Government will, as we have done since the onslaught of this pandemic, continue to monitor developments closely and make the right decision at the right point.</p></speech>

I have a specific question.  I am glad he brought up the hospitality industry.  As we all know, there is quite a large fluctuation in turnover in hospitality businesses because of the seasonality associated with their sector.  Is it a case that if a hotel, for instance, is not enrolled in the EWSS scheme for the month of December, it is also not eligible for entry to the scheme for January?  If it is the case that it is also ineligible with regard to turnover for January, is that something the Minister might wish to consider amending?</p></speech>

In order for a company to participate in this scheme from next year, it must be participating in the scheme for the month of December.  I am aware of concerns that have been raised by a number of hotels that have a very high seasonal dimension to their business.</p>  <p>  For a hotel or any business to be excluded from the scheme at the moment, however, means that its business performance is better than a 30% decline against the period in 2019.  That means that business is trading probably not in line with how it would have hoped given the pandemic but is still trading better than a 30% decline in its turnover.  The challenge is that any threshold I fix will have businesses that fall just outside of it.  I am aware that is the case for some.</p></speech>

To address the final part of my question, I accept his bona fides that the EWSS is to support jobs and employees.  Reports have emerged over the past 48 hours, however, that some of the money used to subsidise companies went on to basically provide dividends for shareholders, which is not the intended goal of the scheme.  I know the Minister is not happy with that and has gone on record to say that he is seeking to tighten up the restrictions or conditionality associated with it.  When are we likely to see higher levels of conditionality associated with the EWSS?  Will it require any changes to primary legislation to bring that in?</p></speech>

They did so based on the effect of the pandemic on their business.  The near overwhelming experience both Revenue and I have had is that of employers participating in the scheme in good faith.  It is the case that a number of companies that found that their business performance was better than expected have returned the EWSS payment that was available.  I will repeat what I said yesterday.  Companies that find themselves in that position should consider their choices with regard to a scheme that has played such a vital role in protecting our economy and should continue to act in good faith.</p>  <p>  With regard to the commitment I have given, I have said at this point that I will consider this matter.  I want to be very careful that we do not make changes to the scheme that might preclude businesses that may well be profitable but are far less profitable than they were in the past from participating into the future and still need this scheme to have a viable and successful future.</p></speech>

Some of these companies have earned 71% and 72% on projected turnovers.  This stops them from entering the EWSS.  These 11,000 jobs must be protected.  These 11,000 employees will end up being on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  At least if these employees are on the scheme, their employer is still paying a PRSI contribution into the system.  It will help keep 11,000 people in jobs this year.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he has raised this with me on a number of occasions.  I appreciate that a number of businesses we value and that provide very valuable employment to our country find themselves in a position that they are slightly outside the entry threshold of a 30% decline in their business.</p> <p>This figure of 70% has now been consistently in place since our wage subsidy schemes have been introduced - both for temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the EWSS.  We have always had and clearly communicated an unchanging reference period for turnover and reference decline threshold.  For some time now, under the EWSS in particular, we have maintained the approach that a business can only enter the scheme if their its turnover decline is 30% or more.  I have no plans to change it because of how clear it has been for so long.  Any threshold I fix is will face the challenges of business that are slightly outside of it.  </p></speech>

If they are in employment, while there is a reduced PRSI contribution, their employer is still giving money back to the State.  It does not cost the full amount to have somebody on a PUP payment.  This keeps people employed.  It keeps people within the sector that has been hit not only last Christmas, but now this Christmas.  The Minister is interfering with their margins into next year.  Not only are they down 28% or 29% this year, the Minister is now putting them in a position where they have no working capital for the first two months of next year.  That is putting hotels in trouble, which may mean that he will have to correct that.  They could end up with the banking system or the social welfare system.  This is a way bigger picture altogether.  This can be fixed for &euro;7.5 million.  Other companies have received &euro;108 million under the scheme and they have been in the newspapers this week.</p></speech>

While I appreciate the companies to which the Deputy has referred are facing many difficulties and challenges and they have like many other businesses had a tough couple of years, I reiterate that fundamentally the reason they are outside the scheme at the moment is their trading performance is better than a 30% decline versus 2019.  For some time, we have made clear that to enter the scheme, a company&rsquo;s change in business and change in turnover has to be greater than a certain figure.  That was clearly communicated in budget 2022 and in many other statements from me during the year.  Therefore, while I appreciate that not being able to access this scheme can have an effect on the business, equally it is important that I am consistent in saying that if the entry into this scheme is a certain figure, it does not change suddenly.  It is for that reason that this figure is being maintained.</p></speech>

The short answer to her question is that I just finished the Finance Bill last night in the D&aacute;il, including with her good self.  We have just completed the Finance Bill for this year.  The review will be completed well in advance of next year's finance Bill.  As of yet, I have not set the terms of reference, initiated the process as to who will do the work or indicated by when the review will be complete.  If I were to give the Deputy my judgment now, I would say it would need to be completed probably before next summer, so that we would have time to consider its findings.  I would say that we will be able to indicate what the terms of reference would be and how the work will be done early in the new year.  Given that we have just finished the Finance Bill, I hope the Deputy will bear with me when I say that I cannot give her a clearer answer today to those questions.</p></speech>

However, this scheme was introduced in 2016 and became operational in 2017.  The most recent formal review was many years ago.  The tax strategy group did a chapter on it with various options.  They pointed out that the scheme is four times more expensive than envisaged.  The comments from the ESRI, which have been repeated many times, are that the help-to-buy scheme is adding to demand pressures.  Social Justice Ireland states that the help-to-buy scheme has disproportionately benefited purchasers who buy higher-value properties.  Indeed, anecdotally, in and around Galway, we are now helping professional people.  The scheme is there to help everybody and I have no problem with that but, generally, professional people have a much higher salary than others.  For example, consultants are now benefiting from this scheme, and rightly so because it is there.  However, the scheme is certainly not helping those that it was intended to help to get on the housing ladder.  The urgency of the review can not be overemphasised.</p></speech>

More than 29,000 first-home purchasers have benefited from the scheme since it was set up.  On the reviews that we have had, while the Deputy is correct that the most recent independent cost-benefit analysis of this was in 2018, this process is subject to a review in the tax strategy group papers that are published every year.  This scheme is examined regularly by my Department.  While the cost of the scheme has gone up since it was first implemented, it has been extended for longer than had been anticipated.  More properties are participating in the scheme.  We also made a change last year to give additional support to first-home purchasers due to the many changes that were happening because of the pandemic.  I believe this scheme provides valuable help, but we will have a fundamental look at it in 2022.</p></speech>

However, it has also contributed to the housing affordability problem without a doubt.  I am not alone in thinking that.  All of my colleagues in opposition have said that.  More importantly, the ESRI has said it.  Social Justice Ireland, who keep their ears close to the ground, based on research, have repeatedly said it.  The scheme is helping people who are already in a position to have a deposit for a house.  I would like the review to examine the salaries of the people who are availing of the scheme, their professions, whether they are single persons or a couple, the amount of the deposit that they had and whether the recipient could afford a house in the first place.  We need a detailed analysis of the scheme to see whether it is achieving the purpose that it was set out to achieve.  I will be the first to say "Sorry", if I am wrong.  However, we need that review and we need clarification on who will carry out the review and its terms of reference, which are extremely important.</p></speech>

I do not accept that a scheme that supports the purchase of approximately one in ten homes is itself the cause of the significant house price inflation that we are facing.  The cause of where we are at the moment is the well documented and understood issues relating to lack of supply that the Government is making progress on.  Some 60% of those who used the help-to-buy scheme, on the analysis that we have done, did so while needing this scheme to help fund their deposits to buy their first home.  That is valuable help.  It is help that nearly 30,000 people have benefited from and they need it.  However, the issues to which the Deputy referred and the questions that she posed will be looked at in the review of the scheme, which will take place next year.</p></speech>

Has the Government any plans in this space?  We also might have an opportunity to discuss the work that the Minister of State doing on credit unions.  He is putting significant work into this.  In yesterday's update from the Central Bank of Ireland, the ambition and the hunger of the credit union sector was not reflected or acknowledged in the language it used.</p></reply>

The Central Bank issued a report yesterday about the challenges facing credit unions so I will briefly bring people up to date on that.  Credit unions' financial situation improved in the past year.  Of the 210 credit unions in the country, all but nine were in surplus in the past 12 months, which is positive and is much improved from the previous year.  The report pointed out that relative to the amount credit unions are saving, their loans are only 27%.  That is the issue with growing their loans.  There are many schemes for businesses and so on but they are still concentrating on personal loans, which have been their bread and butter over the years.  They have reduced some of their deposits with caps introduced by individual credit unions, and that has also prevented the situation deteriorating.</p> <p> On the matter of common bonds, section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997 sets out the requirements in relation to the common bond.  The credit union advisory committee, CUAC, in its review of the implementation of the recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions report in 2016, recommended that the common bond be subject to detailed consideration in consultation with stakeholders.  The credit union advisory committee is a group established by the Minister to advise him or her on credit union issues.  That matter is currently being examined, and when I get the opportunity in a few moments, I will tell the Deputy about the review progress.  I expect the Government to approve significant proposals regarding credit unions early in the new year.</p></speech>

I would like some detail on that review process and its timeline.  Will that happen in the first quarter of next year?  Will the recommendations the Minister of State is hoping to bring require legislative change?  If so, do we have any sense of a timeline on that?</p>  <p>  A number of us met with credit union representatives a few weeks ago and the Minister of State was on that call.  There was a sense of ambition from them, a sense of wanting to respond to the various challenges facing communities.  With banks withdrawing from them, the credit union is the perfect organisation to step into that sphere right across the country.  There was also a sense that they wish to do different things to respond to different demands.  It is quite interesting that yesterday's report from the Central Bank highlighted climate change as a challenge for credit unions, whereas the credit unions see climate change as an opportunity to partner with communities, homeowners and families to respond to it.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the review, the timeline and any potential legislative changes.</p></speech>

On climate change, credit unions are exceptionally well placed to provide loans for retrofitting schemes for individual houses throughout the country.  As regards the common bond, in 2017 CUAC made five recommendations to open up the common bond to assist credit unions in developing their business model and growth potential.  Those recommendations included the removal of the anomaly whereby credit unions are prohibited from introducing businesses to each other but can introduce businesses to other financial institutions.  Any changes to the common bond should happen promptly and the rules regarding common bonds should be made clearer and be better communicated.  In most cases the arrangements for common bonds have been in place for a significant period of time and not many people know the particular boundaries in that regard.  CUAC made those recommendations but they were not progressed at the time because there was resistance in the area.  I will have recommendations in the early part of next year, certainly early in the first quarter.</p></speech>

The Minister used the word &quot;promptly&quot;.  Those recommendations were made in 2017 and we are now in 2021.  Will the new proposals mirror some of those recommendations?

I have met all the representative bodies in the credit unions a few times in the past year and we now have movement from all the main credit union organisations on some refinement of the common bond boundaries and improvements to share and syndicate loans between different credit unions.  We are not going to unravel the entire structure of the common bond.  There will be improvements to the common bond structure, and what I will be proposing is substantially agreed by all the bodies at this time.  I will send them a formal document early in the new year.  That may require legislation and that will be progressed as soon as we get approval.  I will ask the sector to respond promptly when we issue the proposals because we have covered this ground entirely.  I gave those organisations a commitment that I will come back to them with one final draft before we publish it.  I will seek their input early in the new year.</p></speech>

For the EWSS, that figure is now at more than &euro;6.6 billion in respect of 696,900 employees and 51,700 employers.</p>  <p>  In County Clare, the EWSS is in use for 630 employers and 6,725 employees, while 795 businesses are availing of the CRSS and 60 businesses are using the BRSS.  In Limerick there are 970 employers and 10,930 employees on the EWSS, with the CRSS supporting 945 businesses and the BRSS supporting 75.  I was also asked by Deputy Lawless about Kildare, where there are 950 employers and 12,055 employees on the EWSS, with 705 businesses on the CRSS and 55 on the BRSS.</p></speech>

It has been 18 months of misery on the health front, for those in employment and those who are trying to shore up a business and keep it surviving at this time.  This has been one of the successes in stabilising the economy and it is very much appreciated by those in business.  I am glad 6,000 people in Clare are benefiting from it and that the Minister recently announced an extension of the EWSS for a further two months.  I am also glad the Covid stability fund is there for businesses such as nightclubs that will have to remain closed until 9 January.</p>  <p>  However, there are anomalies in these supports.  Some 11,000 employees in the hotel sector are facing a degree of uncertainty at the moment because new criteria for the EWSS were introduced in budget 2022.  The anomaly arises in the case of seasonal hotels like those in the west.  A seaside hotel could be closed at this time but may have every intention of opening in the early spring.  The other anomaly relates to largish hotels that might be doing pretty good trade in the lead-up to Christmas.  They will have pulled out of the EWSS because of that trade but may not expect to be at those trading levels in January 2022.  Due to that break in trading, they will be precluded from the EWSS for the first four months of 2022.  That leads to a lot of uncertainty for them.  I already mentioned the 11,000 jobs.  Most of these are family-owned hotels or rural hotels in the west, but that model is also replicated in other parts of the country.  They need an added degree of certainty.  There has been a 60% collapse in bookings leading into Christmas.  They are going to need a little more certainty as we face into the new year.</p></speech>

It has been invaluable in supporting our domestic economy and it will lay the foundation for the continued economic recovery of Ireland from this pandemic.  It is valued by many businesses that are on it at the moment.</p> <p> Regarding the particular matter the Deputy has raised, I respectfully say that there is not an anomaly with regard to it.  In fact, there is clarity regarding how people do or do not get into the scheme.  I have been clear for some time that the business threshold is that there has to be a decline in turnover of 30% or more versus the reference period in 2019.  I accept that in setting any business performance level there will be at times employers who are just outside of that, but that can happen in any threshold decision I make.  If a company is not in the scheme at the moment, the most likely reason is that its business performance is higher and better than a 30% decline.  I accept this is something that will pose a challenge for a number of employers at the moment, but it is a matter I have been clear about for some time in order to try to create the certainty that I know the Deputy values.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600016#O00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  Some hotels will be left out of the scheme.  Elaina Fitzgerald has been on the airwaves quite a lot lately.  She is head of the Irish Hotels Federation.  Her hotel in Adare, County Limerick, is one such hotel that will probably do pretty well coming into Christmas, but will not benefit from the scheme.  That is her analysis, something that is replicated throughout counties in the mid-west.  The cost of supporting 11,000 jobs in the hotel sector for the month of January is approximately &euro;4.2 billion.  Stability and certainty needs to be in place because if jobs are not supported many people could end up on the PUP.</p>  <p>  In my limited speaking time, I wish to refer to the revaluation of guest houses.  I understood it was going to stop, but it is still happening.  I was told many months ago that it does not make sense for a hotel on the Muckross Road in Killarney to have to pay commercial rates while a 40-bed bed and breakfast does not.  That might be fair and true, but valuation people are calling to the doors of bed and breakfasts in Clare to measure their square footage.  On top of dismal trading this year and last, they are now being asked to pay commercial rates.  Their families live at one end of their houses and they have one or two beds at the other in order to make an income.  They should not pay commercial rates.  I ask that the Government step in and call a halt to this.</p></speech>

I will have my officials look into it because I appreciate that at this point in the year, given everything that has happened with this disease, the strain and anxiety that smaller hospitality businesses are facing is very intense.  I will look into that for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  On the EWSS, I need to indicate to the D&aacute;il that I believe our health service will allow us to reach a point in the new year where we will need to phase out the EWSS.  It is a scheme that has played an invaluable role in our economy, but it was primarily designed to deal with the threat of mass unemployment in our country.  It has prevented the threat of mass unemployment, but we cannot find ourselves in a position as we move through 2022 that we have a labour market shortage and a high demand for workers while running the unemployment wage subsidy scheme at the same time.  We are not at that point yet and that is why we have extended the scheme.</p></speech>

The Minister gave a county breakdown to Deputy Crowe.  Does he have a similar breakdown of the sectors that are receiving EWSS?</p>  <p>  The scheme involves a huge amount of money.  A larger budget than many Departments have has been, and continues to be, spent on it.  Are sectors still receiving the EWSS despite not being impeded by restrictions?  Well over a year ago I asked the Minister to extend the EWSS to the hospitality sector when it reopened to help businesses claw back the many costs they incurred and to try to help them keep afloat as things reopened slowly.  If sectors are in receipt of the EWSS but have not been under restriction for some time, I would be glad if the Minister could update the house on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600016#O00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  I will share the full breakdown with her by sector which I have available to me.  Very broadly, around 26% of the scheme was made available to the hospitality sector.  After that, sectors such as retail are very high recipients of funding from the EWSS.  It is available for sectors.  I do not have the figures available now, but I will get the information sent onto the Deputy's office across the day.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point on sectors that may not need support, it is important to state that the entry into the scheme is not done by sector but rather by business.  In order to be on the scheme, a business performance has to indicate a decline of 30% or more.  We could definitely make the case that some sectors are doing better than others, but even within sectors that are doing better, there will, as the Deputy will know, be firms that are experiencing challenging conditions because of public health guidance and, therefore, that is why they are on the scheme.</p></speech>

The action plan for insurance reform contains 66 cross-departmental actions that aim to improve the cost and availability of insurance.  This reform agenda is progressing well.  The first implementation report published by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department last July showed that 34 of the 66 actions had been completed.</p>  <p>  Key reforms include the establishment of the insurance fraud co-ordination office within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in September and the publication of the final report of the Central Bank&rsquo;s review of differential pricing in the motor and home insurance markets.  I will shortly go before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to deal with pre-legislative scrutiny of the elimination of loyalty penalties in the course of 2022.  I appeal for everybody on that committee to complete pre-legislative scrutiny today so that we can move onto the legislation as quickly as possible and pass a Bill in the D&aacute;il and Seanad early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Other reforms include the expansion of the national claims information database to gather data on public liability and the publication of the first report on this subject.  We now have information we never had before, which is helpful.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s third report on the claims information database on private insurance has been published in recent weeks.  We also have the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, and perjury is now a criminal offence.  Personal injuries guidelines were completed at the end of April and have been implemented.  We will produce a review early in the new year on how they are progressing in practice.  We said we would do that after a six-month period and work is commencing on that.  We will publish an interim report on that within a short period, which will be available in the new year.  We established an office to promote competition in the insurance market, which is essential because of the small size of the Irish economy and the impact of Brexit which affects competition.  We are introducing new regulations on solicitors' advertising.</p>  <p>  All in all, quite a lot has happened.  Motor insurance premiums decreased by 8% last year and 7% so far this year, based on the most recent figures from the CSO.</p></speech>

Instead of reductions, the businesses in the entertainment sector are under huge pressure right now and have seen hikes in their premiums.  Public liability insurance costs have also increased by 15%, according to the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  There have been reductions in some sectors, but increases in others.  The insurance industry needs to be taken on.</p>  <p>  It is essential that insurance companies immediately reduce insurance premiums to reflect, euro for euro, the 40% reduction in personal injury awards since the new personal injury guidelines came into effect.  I must call on the Minister to remove the delay the Government has placed on the Sinn F&eacute;in Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill which would hold insurance companies to account and ensure they reduce premiums in line with the reduced cost of claims.  What is going on with this?</p></speech>

Some in the industry and some who have been lobbying for a long time would have stated that we should have made some of these moves previously but, as the old saying goes, we are where we are.  I would separate out public liability insurance.  That is a specific piece of work that needs to be done.  It is absolutely necessary we follow through as quickly as possible in dealing with differential pricing and what you can only term morally as "criminal" as regards the loyalty penalties.  We need to see that the personal injury guidelines work from the point of view of those who are paying insurance premiums.  It has not happened to date.  I want to know the Minister of State's engagements with the insurance sector and then we need to make moves on duty of care and other matters.  I am also in on another question and we will get more time later.</p></speech>

There have been reductions in car insurance, which affects every household in the country, this year and since the guidelines came in.</p>  <p>  Three major insurance companies were at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach this week.  Two of them said they have reduced prices by 10% this year so far and another said it reduced them by over 5%.  That is confirmation of what the CSO is saying.</p>  <p>  In relation to business insurance, an important Central Bank report issued recently showed that for the vast majority of businesses the average cost of insurance is under &euro;2,500.</p>  <p>  There are high-risk sectors in the Irish economy that have difficulty getting insurance and those sectors need to be helped.  That is why I met specifically with the Alliance for Insurance Reform on a couple of occasions recently, and I will be doing so immediately in the new year again, on the euro-for-euro reductions we are seeking.  Those reductions that are happening have been confirmed by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  Obviously, some people are not happy and want to appeal them to the courts as well, and that is taking some further time.</p></speech>

It has made driving, which is a necessity, costly.  It is not a luxury anymore.</p>  <p>  The public thinks the Minister of State is being too soft on the insurance companies.  They are the ones that are profiting from the reductions in claims because the Minister of State will not implement the legislation Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward.</p>  <p>  Only this week, the Alliance for Insurance Reform called on the Minister of State to deliver on his promise to deliver a properly balanced duty of care, if applicable, to every premises and event in the country.  I call on the Minister of State to stop letting the insurance industry off the hook and to put the public first for a change.</p></speech>

That goes without saying.  There is an absolute requirement that those engagements are robust.</p>  <p>  I will deal specifically with public liability insurance.  Let us accept we need insurance.  We particularly need insurance in what is high risk.  We have seen the tragic circumstances in Tasmania.</p>  <p>  I have dealt with the Minister of State in relation to the entertainment industry, the leisure industry, and especially in relation to what we term bouncy castles.  Following on from some conversations with Deputy Fleming and the Minister of State at the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, I am dealing with Insurance Ireland specifically.  We will also be dealing with the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, specifically on guidelines and regulations that are probably needed within that industry.  It is from the two ends.  We need licensing, regulation and protections and then we need duty of care so that there is also a protection of these businesses.  There are community centres, businesses and community organisations that face hitting the wall and we need action now.  It is beyond time.</p></speech>

It makes no sense whatsoever insofar as flood cover insurance is concerned.  In my county of Clare, a county of 118,000 people, one person in 12 is unable to get flood cover on his or her insurance largely due to flood events that happened ten, 12 or 15 years ago.  What we have since is a national database of flood maps.  We have had umpteen work programmes that have remediated flood areas but still the insurance sector, time and again, is levying on other people.  Because one house in a community of 2,000 or 3,000 homes took in a drop of water in 2009, the whole community has to pay a penalty.  It is becoming a major barrier to people trying to sell their houses.  If you go to a bank or if you go to your solicitor and conduct conveyancing, you will be advised not to take out a mortgage on that property because it cannot get flood cover.  This also needs to be in the realm of insurance reform.</p></speech>

Before we came in here, we had it already arranged that I will meet with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, at the very beginning of the new year to progress that legislation.  Work has already been done on it in consultation with the Attorney General.  It is an absolute priority for the Government to get that legislation published as soon as possible.  It is only fair to businesses.  If somebody has a fall in a person's property, it is not always the fault of the proprietor.  That is something we have to rebalance in legislation.  I think everybody in the House will agree with introducing common sense in that area.  We will be moving on that immediately in the new year.  Also, a reform of the PIAB process is being finalised.</p>  <p>  On the event in Tasmania, obviously, the sympathy of every Member of this House goes out to those affected by that shocking tragic event.  All we can do is extend our condolences to the families of the people involved.</p>  <p>  Flooding is a major issue.  I have met with the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Minister of State and those involved, and through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, they are working on the flood map.  The issue is to reduce the flood risk in those areas.  That is the only way to make insurance more available in the flood risk areas.</p></speech>

What engagement is the Department of Finance having with utility companies and what can we do to address this for consumers?</p></reply>

The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in conjunction with supply constraints and is being witnessed across the European Union and other countries.</p>  <p>  Wholesale electricity prices both in Ireland and across Europe have risen substantially in 2021, with high international gas prices, low levels of wind, increasing carbon prices and a lingering 2020 winter.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the Government approved the establishment of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme under which a payment of &euro;100 will be made to every domestic electricity customer as a once-off measure to mitigate the effects of the unprecedented rise in electricity prices on domestic electricity customers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware work will commence on that early in the new year.  It will require legislation.  We look forward to the co-operation of the House on that issue so that people can get the value of this in the spring of next year.</p>  <p>  It will run in conjunction with the fuel allowance, which runs from October right into April.  There is cold weather in January, February, March and into April and it is important that extra &euro;100 would be available, not only to the people who are on the fuel allowance but to everybody else in society who is experiencing the high cost of fuel.  That will be a benefit.  It is a once-off situation.  I know of no other country in the world that is doing that.  It is an excellent initiative.  There is substantial funding available for that.</p>  <p>  The discussions we are having with the sector are through the regulator.  The ESB will provide the cheques directly to the individual suppliers which will credit every consumer's account.  The people will get the benefit of that as early as possible in the new year.</p></speech>

Anything that helps should be prioritised.  I welcome the tax and social welfare adjustments and the announcement this week in respect of the &euro;100 credit for account holders.  These are important to counter rising costs of living.</p>  <p>  I still feel we need to do much more in the longer term.  We have seen commentary in recent weeks that energy prices are the main driver of inflation at present.  We have seen the road hauliers crying out for relief on fuel costs.  Typical home energy costs and motoring costs have increased significantly.  Since this time last year, the price of electricity, gas and other fuels has increased by 29%.</p> <p>Home heating oil has skyrocketed by 71% in just 12 months.  Petrol has gone up by 20% and diesel by 29%.  All of these increases are having a major impact on households.  I ask that we would develop a long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from the volatility on international wholesale energy markets.</p></speech>

Those who oppose the carbon tax are trying to reduce the Government's ability to assist those households.  We must be consistent.  If we want funding to help people with the rising costs of energy, we must raise it through a carbon tax.  It is important that we have support in the House when it comes to raising the expenditure in order that we have the funds available to spend on those measures.  People in receipt of the fuel allowance will get the &euro;100 I have just mentioned as well.</p>  <p>  The ESRI has shown in a recent report that if people shop around and change their electricity supplier, the average household can save more than &euro;300 on its electricity bill per annum.  I encourage people to shop around as an immediate way of getting a better price for electricity.</p></speech>

Consumers are facing massive price hikes by utility companies.  We have taken some first steps this week, but more needs to be done.  With Christmas just around the corner, people are concerned about more money coming out of their pockets.  Can we give any further subsidies?  The situation is impacting those in particular who are on tight budgets and it is causing them massive hardship.</p></speech>

The Finance Bill included some new measures of support for people working from home.  The previous scheme was very narrow, but we included a new scheme of statutory benefits in the Finance Bill that was passed in the House last night.  There are benefits for people working from home in recognition of the extra costs involved.</p>  <p>  In terms of people being able to afford the extra costs, an increase in the minimum wage is due shortly.  Most people in the public sector and the vast majority of those working in private businesses will be given a pay increase in the coming year.  That is in addition to the increase in the tax bands for people who are working, not to mention the increases to which I already referred on the social welfare side.  People will have additional money in their hand to meet some of the additional costs that are arising this winter.</p></speech>

We are going to see increasing volatility in fossil fuel prices as we move to net zero.  Would the Government consider some form of policy that would have a buffer in the tax take so that in times of sharp changes, either up or down, the State would maintain a steady upward drift in the price of fuel but would to some degree insulate people from the short-term volatility?</p></speech>

We accept that we have difficulties at present with the energy crisis.  We are going to have continuing difficulties and we must look at easing the pain as much as possible as we move towards a just transition.</p>  <p>  I put on record my disappointment at the fact that the &euro;100 mitigation offered to people has been put on the back burner &ndash; no pun intended.  We need to move as quickly as possible.  Even at this late stage, if at all possible, I request that we could get movement.  I think we could all get agreement on that.  This is not one of these offers that is made consistently at this time of year that we can meet next week.  We are not talking about something that is beyond agreement and getting sorted.  We need the type of long-term protections Deputy Bruton spoke about.</p></speech>

The ESRI stated again this morning that it expects the inflation rate to peak by the end of the first quarter.  I know that means we will continue to have rising prices, but as the year progresses, some of the issues that have emerged in terms of world supply and Covid will ease.  I hope that will be some help.</p>  <p>  In terms of a buffer, that is why we have carbon tax increases planned for the years ahead, in order that we have funding in place to help people, especially those on social welfare, who are the direct beneficiaries of the carbon tax measures we have in place.</p>  <p>  We would love to be able to provide people with the &euro;100 this side of Christmas.  Many people pay by coin in meters and others are in apartment blocks and the bills might not be in their name.  That takes a couple of weeks to sort out.  We could not proceed with a scheme and leave those people out of it this side of Christmas and give it to the rest of us.  A couple of weeks' work will be required in the new year and I know everybody will help to move the legislation swiftly through the Houses as soon as we come back.</p></speech>

We know the difficulties businesses, community organisations and community centres encounter in this regard.  I dealt with the Minister of State previously about a case where a premium of &euro;11,000 was put on a local community centre in Blackrock in my constituency.  None of that is sustainable.  Could he outline timelines on the movement on duty of care, in particular, but also his engagement with the sector?  We know that there are not enough players in the market at this point and we need to sort that out.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600018#Q01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 100 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I am sure the Deputies will appreciate that neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals at specific prices.  Everybody knows it would be deemed gross interference in the market.</p>  <p>  With regard to the impact that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU may have had on the general liability market in Ireland, I am informed by the Central Bank that when looking at all jurisdictions during the Brexit preparation period from 2018 to 2020, the number of firms writing general liability insurance in Ireland via a freedom of service or freedom of establishment basis had not decreased, and the overall premium levels written by them have remained static.</p>  <p>  It is also my understanding from the Central Bank that while some UK and Gibraltar insurers decided to withdraw from the Irish market post Brexit, the vast majority &ndash; more than 95% - have implemented contingency measures.  Some of that will come up in the course of the pre-legislative scrutiny process this afternoon, as there are some technical difficulties with some of the UK and Gibraltar companies as a result of their intention to continue to provide cover in the State.</p>  <p>  While Brexit may have exacerbated insurance issues for certain sectors, I understand that a more prominent reason for the withdrawal of some international insurers from Ireland in recent years has been the instability in the personal injury claims environment.  In this regard, I believe that the personal injuries guidelines are a key achievement of the action plan and should help to reduce this uncertainty.  That will also have a knock-on effect on legal costs, as many of the claims will now be dealt with in the District Court rather than the Circuit Court, and claims previously dealt with in the High Court will now be dealt with in the Circuit Court because of the reduced level of awards.  As a result, there will be a major knock-on effect on the cost of insurance.  There is a commitment from all involved to provide a euro-for-euro reduction regarding the savings.</p>  <p>  The general damages that were examined by the personal injuries guidelines deal specifically with the most common injuries - the slips, trips, sore backs and sore necks.  They are the most common injuries that make up most of the claims.  They did not cover serious or catastrophic injuries following a car accident or a very serious fall resulting in lifelong medical requirements.  We only covered the most common injuries.  The cost of care in the future for specific damages was not covered.  We did not want to interfere with somebody who may end up in a wheelchair for the next ten or 20 years.  Such cases were excluded from the personal injuries guidelines.  Some of the claims that are being made will come under the new guidelines and others will not.  We did not want any reduction in damages for more serious injuries and, in fact, some of them have increased marginally in recent times, which we all support.</p> <p>The key issue we are going to have is to get people to use the PIAB process more closely.  It was great when it started but people have tried to bypass it extensively in recent times.  The only issue of concern that I have, and I want to put it on the record, is that while the awards through PIAB have come down, the chief executives of all of the insurance companies have, one by one, confirmed to me directly that they are using the guidelines to the letter of the law, and none of them are offering an extra grand over the figure to settle the case quickly.  That is important.</p> <p> The Government, the Alliance for Insurance Reform and the individual companies are determined that we will follow it through to the letter of the law.  The only issue is that some people are rejecting the new awards because they are lower than they used to be, and some of them are going to work through the courts to test out the new guidelines.  I hope the courts will stand over the guidelines that the Judiciary actually wrote and designed.  When we get that certainty, it will be a major improvement.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact we are looking at the anomalies that have been caused by Brexit, the gift that never stops giving, but we have to move on in that regard.  It was a vital piece of work in regard to the personal injury guidelines.  We know that in an awful lot of cases, the insurance companies did not fight cases and they just paid out, no matter how good the case would have been from a legal point of view, and we are talking here about soft tissue injuries.  I want to know about the Minister of State's engagement with industry because, for public liability insurance, we do not have the players in that sector.  I hope the Minister of State will be supportive of that piece of work, on which I have engaged with him previously.  As he said, there are certain high-risk sectors where we need to look at regulation and at facilitating the groups into block-buys and whatever else, and I am specifically referring to the leisure, entertainment and community sectors.  That is necessary.  I would like to get specifics on the Minister of State's engagement and get a view on whether we can get more players in.  Is there a timeline with regard to when the Minister of State thinks the duty of care legislation will be in place?</p></speech>

It is one of the biggest single outstanding actions in the action plan that we announced 12 months ago.  I would hope that by the end of January we will have a firm date.  There is a meeting of the Cabinet subgroup dealing with this issue towards the end of January, by which time we will have a full review of 2021.  I expect that at that date we will have a clear timeline.  I do not have a date today because it is subject to legal discussion between Department officials and the Office of the Attorney General.  My hope is that by the end of January, around the time we come back, we will have a date for that.</p>  <p>  With regard to my engagement with the industry, it is well known and is public knowledge that I recently met individually each of the chief executives on the matter, having done that earlier in the year.  I met Insurance Ireland to make sure it, as a representative body, is making sure there is good feedback in the area.  I met the Alliance for Insurance Reform specifically in regard to the pinch points where people cannot get insurance.  I have committed to meeting them again in January to progress that particular work.</p></speech>

I have an issue that was brought up with me by some of my younger constituents.  Obviously, we have had supply chain issues that have also been caused by Brexit.  There are worries in regard to a certain Santa Claus.  We hope the Minister of State and his colleagues in government will be engaging from the point of view of ensuring there will be no difficulties as regards the problems we have with the Irish protocol and no visa difficulties.  We assume that public liability insurance issues that may arise in regard to Santa Claus and his workers have been looked at and dealt with, and that the Government can assure my younger constituents that the difficulties we are facing in the wider world will not be impacting in regard to the supply chain and Santa Claus.</p></speech>

Before I came in here, we made a phone call to Lapland.  The Government in Lapland has told us there is no insurance required whatever for anybody in Lapland who ever has an accident, which has never happened because Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus make sure that all the helpers are fully protected, so there has never been an insurance claim.  That policy will be carried out, no matter where they go in the world.  I think the United Nations made that clear decades ago.  I think all children will be quite satisfied that the domestic border between Ireland, or between Russia, Mongolia, China or any other country, does not exist with the sat navs that are used from Lapland.  All the children can be fully assured they will get their presents when they wake up on Christmas morning.  I thank the Deputy for raising that issue and I want to put that to bed once and for all.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for their co-operation.  If I do not see any of them between now and the new year, I offer my best wishes for the festive season.

It is accepted that the Irish retail banking system is relatively concentrated by international standards and the recent decisions by some banks to leave the Irish market will further impact on this.  However, against this, it should also be noted that some new lenders have entered the market and are playing a greater role in the provision of new mortgage lending.  More generally, it is likely that increased competition in the provision of financial services globally will take place and that this will have an influence in Ireland with potential new entrants to both bank and non-bank lending, deposit-taking and payments markets for households and businesses.</p>  <p>  The European Union&rsquo;s initiatives in the context of the capital markets union, which aims to improve the provision of financial services across borders within the Union, also have the potential to further improve levels of choice regarding savings and investments for consumers, and to improve access to finance for businesses in the Irish economy.  Further, the scope for provision of services within the Union will be enhanced by the adoption of digital financial technologies already under way.</p>  <p>  Even in a concentrated banking system such as that in place in our economy in recent years, price competition is possible, particularly in a growing economy.  Trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers.  Interest rates on new mortgages, excluding renegotiated mortgages, have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.73% in October 2021.  SME and consumer loans interest rates have also declined over the same period.  I fully appreciate that enhanced sustainable competition in the market will be of benefit to consumers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now under way in the Department of Finance will assess various aspects of the banking market and will consider options to encourage greater competition in the credit and banking market, including possible options to develop the mortgage market.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned the very welcome decline in interest rates to an average of 2.73% in this State in October but we have to remember that compares to a eurozone average of 1.28%, so it is more than double the average for comparative European markets.  To put that into actual figures, the average Irish mortgage holder will pay almost &euro;180 a month more for every month of their mortgage compared to the European average, so that can total &euro;2,200 a year.  The Minister of State rightly points to what is a concern that those of us who sit on the finance committee have been going through for the past year, namely, the announced departure of two very significant lenders from this market in the last calendar year.  This is very worrying.  Their replacement by new lending options has been welcome but, we have to be frank, it is not a great deal.  We cannot replace the likes of Ulster Bank with what we are seeing coming into the market.  It was absolutely a pillar of Irish lending for over a century.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the opportunities within the capital markets union.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is in Brussels today to discuss that at the eurozone meeting as President of the Eurogroup.  I ask the Minister of State where is the enthusiasm and the rush to actually get this done.</p></speech>

In truth, the reason for that is multifaceted.  </p> <p>While the credit risks and capital requirements in Ireland are elevated due to the historic loan experience and loss experience, the level of non-performing loans is higher in Ireland relative to other European countries, which affects the cost of mortgages.  I do not know why that is the case but it is a simple and straightforward statement of fact.  The higher cost-to-income ratio has also been characterised by the Irish banking sector in recent years and low levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared with other jurisdictions can also have an impact on rates here.</p> <p> It is important to note that new mortgage lending is running at a strong level.  In monetary terms, mortgage lending in the first nine months of 2021 has amounted to &euro;7.2 billion.  This is 32% higher than in the same period last year and is now at the highest level of any year since 2008.  In the last 13 years we had a much more muted mortgage market and the figures we have this year are higher than any period since 2008, which is good news for many people.</p></speech>

We see in so many different areas the opportunity and competition that present not just to Irish consumers but also to Irish exporters in terms of goods and services.  One area where it is not being felt is in financial services, particularly lending and mortgages.  While the declining interest rate is welcome, there is no equity in comparison with the average European mortgage holder.  How are we going to utilise our membership of the Common Market over the next decade to give Irish mortgage holders greater choice and competition and cheaper mortgages?</p></speech>

As time progresses the ECB will try to equalise all the issues with reserves across the various member states.  We have had a historic higher level of defaulting, we had a higher level of people not paying mortgages and we still have a higher level of arrears, relative to other EU countries.  As long as that is the case, it will have a knock-on effect on those people who are paying the interest rates.  It is a little bit like insurance - if the costs are higher, it will be reflected in the costs to the people who are paying.  The banking review that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, established recently will examine the range of bank and non-bank providers involved in the provision of mortgages in Ireland.  It will also assess the impact of competition, consumer choice and protection, and market and regional coverage of any financial area in the country.</p></speech>

This is particularly the case in areas where there are viability challenges, in the area of high-density urban apartments for example.  As with investment funds generally, tax occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the fund and it is important to make that point.  That is what most people would want.  The end beneficiary should pay the tax, not the intermediary which is just the investment fund.  It pays tax as well but the beneficiaries should be caught for most of the tax, as is currently the case.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in the case of both Irish real estate funds, IREFs, and REITs, withholding taxes apply on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.  In 2019, I made a number of significant amendments to both regimes to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.  Due to the small number of market participants within the REITs regime, and to protect taxpayer confidentiality, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to provide data with respect to the residential holdings of REITs.  On IREFs, I am advised by Revenue that is not possible to provide data on the number of residential units acquired by IREFs in a year, or whether these units were existing dwellings, forward purchases or forward funding.  However, I am advised that IREFs invested approximately &euro;2 billion in residential assets in 2018; &euro;3.5 billion in 2019; and &euro;4.1 billion in 2020.  A county breakdown of this investment is not available, with the exception of Dublin.  IREFs invested approximately &euro;1.9 billion in residential assets in Dublin in 2018; &euro;3.1 billion in 2019; and &euro;3.5 billion in 2020.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this increased activity, it must also be recognised that institutional investors still account for a relatively small share of the residential housing market.  According to the latest available CSO data, the real estate sector, a close proxy for institutional investors, accounted for just 3% of the purchases of all dwellings in 2020 and 6% of the purchases of new dwellings.  According to CBRE Group, investors owned approximately 19,500 properties in 2020, accounting for less than 1% of the total housing stock.</p>  <p>  In response to a previous question I mentioned that mortgages for private individuals this year alone were at their highest levels since 2008.  So far this year the mortgages raised by people in this country have been worth &euro;7.2 billion.  When we add on the ambitious Housing for All programme with local authorities and approved housing bodies, people will see that the overwhelming majority of houses being built in the State are either provided through social housing by local authorities or approved housing bodies or through people getting their own mortgages, using the various schemes out there such as the help to buy scheme.  The vast majority of houses are being purchased exclusively with beneficial ownership, be it the house owner, the local authority or the approved housing body.</p></speech>

It shows that house prices across the State have risen by 13.5% annually.  Families cannot afford to buy homes.  As I have already told the House this week, there are families in Tipperary whose landlords have given them notice.  They are looking to a rental market that is either non-existent or overpriced.  The Minister of State will be well aware of the price of this starvation of the overall residential property of the market that has resulted from the advantages that continue to be given to these trusts and funds.  In many areas of the country, these are contributing to the shortage of housing available because many are being sat upon with a view to increasing profits in the future, putting them further out of the reach of families.  This is what we know about; what about the areas we do not know about?  Can the Minister of State honestly say that the tax advantages continuing to be enjoyed by these funds are helping Irish families to get a roof over their heads?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s office, as well as mine, is getting those requests every week.</p></speech>

They pay no corporation tax or capital gains tax.  I have a quote from the Minister of State from an RT&Eacute; Radio 1 interview he did earlier this year.  He said that on any profits being made there is a tax of 20% or 25% depending on the structure and that any profits they make are taxed at a higher rate: "double the rate of corporation tax" as the Minister of State put it.  We have looked at the figures and the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement simply was not true.  The figure of 17.9% the Minister of State was citing was relative to the taxable event, meaning distributions to shareholders; it was not relative to rental profits.  In 2019 tax paid by IREFs relative to pre-tax profit was 9.1%, which was less than the 25% paid by any other landlord and less than the 12.5% paid by any other company.  Furthermore we know these funds pay no capital gains tax or corporation tax whatsoever.  The Government&rsquo;s defence of these funds snapping up homes at the expense of renters and struggling home buyers is that they stimulate supply.  However, the financial stability review published by the Central Bank last month found that the majority of residential units purchased by investment funds were existing and not new stock.  That point was made on page 70 of that review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600020#S01300"><p>I thank the Deputies for continuing to raise this issue.  The essence of my point all along has been that the beneficial owners are the people who pay the tax by and large.  The VAT and other small taxes are paid directly by the fund.  There is a strong withholding tax regime in place for the transfer of funds.</p> <p>For example, in the Irish REITs market, including Hibernia, IRES and Newgrove, the amount of gross dividend withholding tax paid was &euro;15.3 million in 2021; &euro;13.4 million in 2020; and &euro;12.2 million in 2019.  These are very substantial figures that are worthy of mention.  Individuals are also liable to tax at their marginal tax rates over and above the withholding tax rate.  Corporates are liable to tax at 25%, with credit for dividend withholding tax.  Institutional portfolio investors are liable to tax on their REIT dividends at 12.5%, which is the rate generally applicable to trading income.  </p> <p> As I mentioned, the overall issue is housing supply.  The &euro;7.2 billion in mortgages issued to private individuals this year is a record and the highest it has been since 2008.  The amount of funding going into local authority housing, social housing and approved housing bodies is hugely significant.  In the vast majority of cases, the beneficial owners of the new housing being built will be private individuals, local authorities or approved housing bodies and only in a minority of cases will the beneficial owners be these funds.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Doherty, among others, has been calling for the full report to be published.  It has taken too long to get to this point.  It has been a long and harrowing road for the families of those who suffered the most horrendous abuse.  They hoped that this report would finally give them the answers they have been waiting on for years.</p>  <p>  We now know that more than 100 occurrences of sexually inappropriate behaviour were carried out by one resident who has been given the pseudonym "Brandon" in the report and that there were 18 victims.  We know that Brandon was moved from time to time but while such moves gave respite to victims and staff in one area, they allowed Brandon to carry on abusing new victims in the area to which he was moved.  This was the most awful of situations.  These victims were the most vulnerable in our society.  They were non-verbal and placed all of their trust in centre and the HSE to protect them.  That obviously did not happen.  Those victims were failed.  After the bravery of a whistleblower and after the reports to HIQA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the individual identified as Brandon was eventually isolated and the abuse stopped.  </p>  <p>  This can never, ever be allowed to happen again.  Even after all of this and despite public calls for the publication of the report, the full report is still not being published.  The executive summary, while detailed, is still not the full report.  The families and the public need to know all of the facts.  Why continue to drag this out?  The families and the public deserve the full truth.  To properly protect our most vulnerable patients going forward, we need to learn from the mistakes here.  The executive summary is not enough to do that.  There are continuing questions for the HSE.  The executive summary raises questions regarding the management and leadership of the HSE during this period.  </p>  <p>  I am also annoyed that the publication of the executive summary has come on the last day of this D&aacute;il term.  Given the gravity of what is contained therein, sufficient time must be allocated in the D&aacute;il to debate the report and its findings in full.  Will the Government press the HSE to publish the full report?  I am sure that the T&aacute;naiste will agree that there needs to be accountability for the failures in how all of this was managed.  Given the seriousness of the issues, will he commit to providing time to debate this report in full at the first opportunity when the D&aacute;il resumes in the new year?</p></speech>

I am very conscious that in discussing this matter, there are families who have been deeply impacted and who are deeply hurting.  Anyone who has read or listened to the reports on the issue is going to be shocked and upset by what has happened.  Certainly, when I read about it, I was horrified that this could have happened.  I even felt disbelief that something like this could happen and continue to happen for a period of time.  All of our thoughts, in the first instance, are with the individuals and families affected.  I cannot begin to imagine what they have been going through this morning and in the years gone by.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, who is responsible for disability services met with HSE officials on Tuesday to discuss the publication of the Brandon report.  The HSE informed her that it intends to publish the executive summary of the Brandon report today.  They also informed her that it is communicating with the families of those directly impacted who were due to receive the executive summary yesterday in advance of wider publication.  With regard to the full report, the Minister of State is seeking advice from the Attorney General as to whether she can publish it either fully or in redacted form.  At the moment the HSE is saying that is not possible but the Minister of State is not accepting that at this point in time.  She is seeking advice from the Attorney General as to whether she can publish it in full or if not in full, at least in redacted form.  The HSE has confirmed that it has put some help in place to help families during what will be a very difficult time for them and to answer any queries they may have.  Families have been contacted by psychology or social work staff who have been known to them since 2018.  A contact phone number has been provided to families, with any calls being answered by a psychologist.  </p>  <p>  The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount.  The Government's first concern, and that of the Minister of State, is to ensure that the needs of the current residents are being prioritised.  It is important that lessons are learned and that changes are made.  The focus must be on ensuring that the findings and recommendations of the report are implemented.  The HSE has assured the Minister of State that there are no ongoing risks to service users and that national governance and accountability structures to oversee the implementation of recommendations arising from the report are now in place.</p>  <p>  A debate on this in the D&aacute;il would be entirely appropriate, perhaps when we resume in the new year when Members have had a chance to read and consider the report.  Of course, the allocation of time for a debate is a matter for the Business Committee.</p></speech>

That is the precedent and I welcome the fact that we will have statements on this report.  As the T&aacute;naiste said in his response, lessons have to be learned here.  We need the full report to be published.  We need all of the facts to be on the table and from that, hopefully, will come accountability and a framework to ensure that this never, ever happens again.  The T&aacute;naiste said that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working with the Attorney General on the publication of this report.  It is critically important that the full report and not just the executive summary be provided to the public, that there is full accountability for what happened here and that lessons are learned.  We can then engage in this House to try to make sure, collectively and on a cross-party basis, that this never, ever happens again.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is engaging with the Attorney General to see if it can be published.  That is certainly our preference.  If it cannot be published in full, for legal or other reasons, surely at least it could be published in redacted form, taking out sections or names to protect people's privacy and confidentiality if that is appropriate.</p></speech>

It made profits of nearly &euro;10 million last year but here is the rub.  It also paid out a dividend of almost exactly the same amount as subsidy to Hailstone Holdings, an offshore company in the Isle of Man tax haven.  This is some coincidence.</p><p>These related companies ultimately flog Mercedes cars to well-heeled people across the country.  The O'Flaherty family made a tidy profit last year while the people of Ireland picked up the bill for the wages of their workers; a bill paid for with the borrowings that future generations will have to pay.</p> <p>This would make Boycie, the car dealer in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, blush.  We know from <i>The Irish Times </i>that Prometric and its related companies were at it too.  This is a company the State uses to operate our driver theory tests.  It paid out &euro;1.25 million in dividends last year having received a total of approximately &euro;1.5 million in wage subsidies to date.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is absolutely extraordinary.<br/><br/>The wage subsidy schemes that this House has supported have saved jobs and kept good businesses going but surely the scheme was never meant to line the pockets of big investors.  Even Santa Clause would not be this generous.  I can guarantee that this story does not end here.  The Government is big on corporate welfare but it is not big on corporate obligations.  The truth is the Government was warned that this abuse would happen.<br/><br/>From the get-go, the Labour Party and I have argued for strict social, economic and labour conditions to be attached to the schemes.  We have said in the House that there should be no supports for companies registered in tax havens, for companies with enough cash to pay dividends or for companies that ignore recommendations from the WRC or the Labour Court.  Other countries attached conditionality to ensure state aid would not go to companies registered in tax havens.  France and Austria included dividend bans but no such strings were attached here.  All we currently have are Revenue compliance checks.  It is clear that companies that are, and were, profitable should be looking at whether they really need that support from the State.  The Minister for Finance seems to agree with me.  <br/><br/>We have called repeatedly for the EWSS to be transformed into a permanent short-time working scheme with conditions.  We know that these schemes operate well to save jobs when the economy is in difficulty.  Will the T&aacute;naiste call on O'Flaherty Holdings and Prometric to repay the pandemic supports that they obviously did not need?  Will the Government now carry out a full audit of the payments made to companies to find out if other companies profited from wage subsidy schemes in this way?  Because we are at risk of losing tens of thousands of jobs next year, will the Government put in place a permanent revised short-time working scheme with conditions as I have consistently advised?</p></speech>

What I can say in the round is that it is my view that companies that have recorded substantial profits this year or are in the position to pay substantial dividends should refund the money they received under the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  A number of companies have done so.  They received the money in good faith.  They did not know how hard they would be hit by the pandemic.  The EWSS allowed them to keep on staff that they might otherwise have let go or put on short time.  However, if it turned out that the year was a good one for the company and it made substantial profits and could pay its shareholders a dividend and did not really need the wage subsidy money, then I think that money should be repaid.  That is the view of the Government as well.</p>  <p>  Both the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, were organised and designed in a hurry.  We needed to get money out to workers and businesses quickly.  We always knew that some people would not necessarily need the money.  That applied to both schemes.  However, particularly when it comes to the wage subsidy scheme, where substantial profits are made by companies or they find themselves in a position to pay dividends, it is appropriate they should return that cash to the taxpayer.  Some companies have done that, in fairness.  Others have not and they should.</p></speech>

No conditionality whatsoever was attached to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  I can understand that this scheme, in particular, was introduced in a rush.  It was an urgent scheme and a good one to keep people close to their employers and keep people in work.  However, the lesson should have been applied to the operation of the EWSS.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste discuss with Revenue the need to properly audit companies that have benefited from the scheme?  It is unfortunate that all we can do in this House, because this behaviour is not unlawful, is plead with profitable companies to return this money to the taxpayer.  That is not acceptable to me.  We should learn lessons from the way that this scheme has operated. </p>  <p>  I wish the T&aacute;naiste, Matt and his family a very happy Christmas.

More than &euro;6.6 billion has been provided under the EWSS comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.729 billion to companies and PRSI forgone of just under &euro;1 billion.  It has helped to protect approximately 700,000 jobs in 60,000 companies.  The legislation incorporates important safeguards to ensure that it is correctly claimed by companies.  Revenue is undertaking assurance checks on the scheme to ensure that conditions have been met and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Qualification for EWSS is based on the employer demonstrating that his or her business experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders during a specific period and that this was caused as a consequence of disruption related to the pandemic.  Revenue is rigorous in its structured programme of checks to ensure the eligibility of businesses for subsidy payments under the scheme and will pursue any instances where a business fails to qualify for the scheme, whatever the reason.  </p>  <p>  While the question of what dividends a company may or may not be in a position to pay shareholders is a matter outside the current legislative remit of the scheme, the Minister for Finance wants it noted that some companies have voluntarily repaid some or all the subsidy received.  Revenue has put in place procedures for the repayment of wage subsidies where businesses wish to make them.</p></speech>

While the Government has been quite <i>laissez-faire</i>, as has rightly just been referred to in many ways, in giving out EWSS support and other Covid support schemes, certain groups who have been hit time and again, longest, hardest and most repeatedly are being frustrated in applying for or simply denied the income supports under the PUP that the Government said it was reintroducing over the past few weeks.  People are encountering major difficulties in securing the payment or being flat-out denied it.  They are, once again, jobbing musicians, entertainers and performers, taxi drivers and people in the night-time economy.  People in those categories are simply being refused the PUP on the spurious basis that there is no record of four weeks' PRSI contributions.  These people do their tax returns at the end of the year and could not possibly show that.  They would have to go to an accountant to get it.  People are being given lower PUP payments than they were given in March 2020.  They are being told they must come to appointments but they may not be able to get those appointments before Christmas.  They are people working in exactly the same job doing exactly the same kind of work are being given different payments or none, or they are being told they will be paid but not when and how much.</p><p>This is completely unfair.  This is the Government being Scrooge in respect of the people most affected by the public health measures in the teeth of Christmas.  I will give some examples.  Daniel is a taxi driver who applied for the PUP.  He was told to come in for an interview but he must also get a PSC card and may not get his interview before Christmas.  John is a musician.  He rang that PUP helpline this morning.  The helpline could not clarify if he was being reinstated on the PUP or at what rate it would be paid at.  Another taxi driver is self-employed.  He applied for the PUP on 7 December and has had no word from the Department of Social Protection.  It is less than two weeks to Christmas.  Yesterday he spent eight hours on a taxi rank and earned only &euro;16.80.  He had to keep their car going to keep warm.  Shane is a musician and self-employed.  Work had not returned to a level on which he could survive on without support.  He had loads of gigs booked for the Christmas period that are all completely gone.  He was refused the PUP.</p> <p>I could go on through the list.  This is just not fair.  In the teeth of Christmas, I appeal to the Government to instruct the Department of Social Protection to go back to the regime we had in March 2020 whereby people in these sectors who apply for the PUP are given it at the March 2020 rate and are not asked to jump through multiple hoops or denied that support before Christmas.</p></speech>

I am sorry to hear those stories.  I know so many people who work in the night-time economy and they had been looking forward to a very different Christmas one where they could do their job, practise their art and maybe make a little bit of money for Christmas and for the year ahead.  They now find themselves in a very difficult position.  We want to make sure those financial supports are in place for the people in the night-time economy and the experience economy who are going to need them because we are going to need them back whenever we get over this Omicron wave.  If the Deputy wants to pass on those details to me later on or directly to my office, I will make sure the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, gets them.  I will speak to her today and see if there are any particular flexibilities we can reintroduce because we do not want to leave people without any money for Christmas, for all the reasons I think Members will understand.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the PUP has been reopened on a limited basis for individuals, including self-employed people who work in the night-time economy and taxi drivers, who lose their employment on or after Tuesday, 7 December because of the additional public health restrictions.  These measures have a negative impact on sectors like hospitality, the night-time economy, the arts and entertainment sectors, and the loss of employment must be linked to those new restrictions.  Individuals, including taxi drivers, who satisfy the criteria are eligible for the PUP.  The eligibility for the PUP includes self-employed people but they must have been a self-employed PRSI contributor and checks to ensure that are carried out by the Department.  I am told the majority of claims are processed quickly and without the need for engagement with the customer before payment commences.  The Department says it is not aware of any particular problems in processing claims from any particular sector.  There is flexibility provided to self-employed people receiving the PUP to take up occasional or intermittent work and retain their PUP.  This measure has assisted people to maintain their business during the pandemic and provides that a person can earn up to &euro;960 from self-employment over an eight-week period without losing his or her PUP.  In total, 55,300 such payments are being issued this week, of which 3,800 represent new applications received in the past week as a result of the restrictions introduced on 7 December.</p></speech>

I talked to them this morning and they still felt there was no movement.  Many of them are being denied.  Whatever the Department is telling the T&aacute;naiste, I tell him they are being refused on spurious grounds around PRSI contributions that they could not possibly show.  If their gigs have collapsed for December, they are being asked in for an interview and being told they must prove they had those gigs.  That means going around to every single venue and getting letters saying there was to be a gig and it has been cancelled.  How does someone prove that with a week to go until Christmas?</p>  <p>  There are also people who are on a lower payment because their PUP was phased down.  Somebody else who comes in after 7 December can get the &euro;350 payment,  if he or she can get it.  They are in the exact same situation but one person is getting &euro;350 and another &euro;203.  It is cruelly unfair.  We are asking for consistency and for the Department not to put hoops in front of people in advance of Christmas.  The Government should take the same attitude the T&aacute;naiste just displayed towards the EWSS, that is, get the money out first and tie up the anomalies later.</p>  <p>  Will the Minster for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media please meet the Music and Entertainment Society of Ireland, MEAI, before Christmas to discuss the problems musicians and entertainers are facing?</p></speech>

The new plan put in place by Mr. Connor Green and his team estimates they will be able to increase output by approximately 400%.  There are 100 children on their waiting list.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste and the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, say in the House and in many an interview that they were going to solve this problem once and for all.  That was three, four, five and six years ago.  There are children who have been waiting for three, four and five years in acute pain.  We have the HSE draft plan for 2022.  In fairness to the current Minister of Health, he said changes can be made as it is a draft plan.  Will the Government make sure funding is given to take those children out of the pain and misery they have endured over the past three, four and five years?</p></speech>

On behalf of the Government, I reiterate that reducing the scoliosis waiting list and the spinal surgery waiting list is a priority for Government.  It is important to say the HSE's service plan for 2022 has not yet been approved or published.  The HSE is aware of the level of priority the Government, and indeed all parties, attach to this issue.  The Minister for Health will shortly bring the service plan to Government for approval.  The plan will include very significant investment in 2022 to increase scoliosis surgery capacity at Cappagh Kids, Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals.</p>  <p>  The HSE has received a number of specific proposals from Children's Health Ireland on scoliosis and will be in a position to fund these proposals.  The full details will be confirmed in the service plan when it is published.  The Minister recently met scoliosis clinicians and patient advocates to discuss this with them, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, wished me to re-emphasise that he is allocating &euro;22.2 billion next year for health.  That is the largest budget for health in the history of the State.  It is probably 50% greater than it was only a few years ago.  However, as I have learned in trying to deal with that issue, both as Minister for Health and as Taoiseach, it is not just about money.  The money will be allocated for these developments in these three hospitals but as we will all find out, it is not just a matter of money.  Sadly, it is much more complicated than that.</p></speech>

If the HSE and successive Governments have been aware of the situation over the past number of years, as they should have been, it is very unusual the HSE would leave this out of a draft plan.  The T&aacute;naiste is correct that money does not always solve everything but if somebody like Mr. Green and his team put a draft plan together to increase output by 400% then surely they are held to account if that is not done.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health to make sure the funding is put in there.  It is not just about one part of the country.  There are affected children waiting right around the country.  If we can resolve this issue by taking them out of pain with this proposal, and there are 100 on the Cappagh list alone, I urge the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister to put the funding in place to resolve it.</p></speech>

I know of the major efforts that have been made in recent years to improve the situation, whether it is sending children to Germany and England, or new theatres and additional funding.  There are periods during which it has been improved, and waiting lists have been shortened, but then things go backwards again.  That is, unfortunately, the problem and the situation we have been in for a very long time.  The difficulty often relates to finding skilled medical and non-medical staff willing to do this work and to continue to do it for years on end.  That has also been a real difficulty.</p>  <p>  As I said, the HSE service plan is only in draft form.  I can confirm it will include very significant investment to increase scoliosis surgeries at Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital and the Children's Health Ireland hospitals at Temple Street and Crumlin.  I hope the HSE and those hospitals are able to spend that money next year because they will have it.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, will meet with Women of Honour today to discuss these concerns.  I am told there is no issue with legal representatives attending should they wish to do so.

His innate patience entitles him to a very good present from Santa Claus this year.</p>  <p>  I will ask about the vaccination roll-out programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, in responding to me last week when I asked him to consider establishing a community vaccination and testing centre in Drogheda, seemed to agree with me but it seems the HSE, naturally, does not think the town of Drogheda, the largest town in the country, should have a vaccination centre when it should.  The T&aacute;naiste will know there were massive queues, for example, in Simonstown vaccination centre in Navan, which is half an hour away from Drogheda, last Sunday.  Many people from the Drogheda area went to that centre, which covers an area with a population in excess of 100,000 people.  It created queues of up to five hours. </p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, Drogheda is Ireland's largest town.  He visited it a couple of weeks ago for a very important jobs announcement.  I ask him to back our calls and advocate for a centre for Drogheda.  The 50 to 59 age cohort is particularly affected as many of them in the area were vaccinated late in the summer after others in the 50 to 59 age cohort.  Those people in Drogheda got the Janssen vaccine, and we know its efficacy waned very quickly.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, announced plans last night to boost the vaccination programme, if I can use that term, but I noticed he did not include Drogheda on the list of new vaccination centres.  He needs to do so in the interests of that cohort and the national roll-out of the vaccination programme.  The area is entitled to it given its size and scale.  I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste would engage with the HSE in that regard.</p></speech>

Drogheda is not currently on the list but I agree with the Deputy that it is a very large town.  Indeed, the entire south Louth and greater Drogheda area has a population of well in excess of 50,000, if not more.  Perhaps it is an appropriate place for a centre.  That is an operational decision for the HSE, but I will certainly make sure its chief executive is made aware that this matter was raised in the House and a centre has been suggested.</p></speech>

They have increased by 13.5% in the past year and rents have increased by 7%.  Almost 9,000 people are living in homeless shelters, including 2,500 children.  The Government has failed abysmally to meet any of its housing targets over the past year.  In the first nine months of this year, less than one third of the social homes to be delivered were constructed.  Only 25 cost rental homes were tenanted this year.  During the previous election, the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, promised 10,000 affordable homes each year.  This year, zero affordable homes were delivered - none at all.</p>  <p>  There are tens of thousands of vacant and derelict homes throughout the country and the Government has done nothing to tackle this.  When will the Government bring in a vacant homes tax to bring those homes back into use?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600024#W00900"><p>It is planned to bring in a vacant property tax in the budget, so it will, in essence, be legislated for this year and will most likely be applied from 2023.  Revenue is collecting data at present as part of the current revaluation to find out why places are vacant.  There is not very accurate data on how many vacant properties there are or why they are vacant.  They can sometimes be vacant for a good reason.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the increase in house prices in the year gone by, but I will point out there is one area that is positive and that we should not allow to go without mention.  It is that 31,000 new homes commenced construction in the past 12 months.  That is a considerable turnaround on where we were only a few years ago.  Some 31,000 homes are being built at the moment, which is an increase of 49% on last year.  To see a 50% increase in new homes being built during a pandemic is very significant and perhaps gives us a little hope for the next couple of years.</p></speech>

It was progressive legislation, but there is also a practice going on, which I never heard of until recently, called "price scalping".  This happens when something is in demand and there is not enough supply, for example, in relation to gaming consoles at the moment.  The sting is that somebody buys the console for &euro;500 and sells it to one of the high street shops which buy and sell products and which I will not name.  The initial buyer gets a 10% premium and the company, which is not far from here, sells it for an exorbitant price, up to 175% of the retail value.  If you go online or down to that shop, the product, which normally costs &euro;500, costs &euro;880.  It is profiteering and touting by another name.  Are there plans to ban this practice?</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, we brought in ticket touting legislation, which was the big consumer legislation for this year.  Next year we will have a new consumer protection Act which will replace the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  It is being led by my Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, in particular.  It is the big reform of consumer law.  That will happen next year and that might be the opportunity to deal with it.</p></speech>

I have a question on the unprecedented rise that has happened and is happening in the cost of construction materials.  Building suppliers are getting daily notifications of price increases coming in January.  Building contractors who are building some of the 30,000 homes the T&aacute;naiste mentioned for local authorities throughout the country are trapped in a fixed-price contract.  They cannot recover any of these increases.</p>  <p>  Lately, the Office of Public Procurement issued a circular about tenders or contracts that have not yet been signed or contracts that are out for pricing and how to deal with the variation in prices in those contracts.  There is a cohort of builders in this country comprising small and medium-sized contractors trapped in contracts that have no flexibility to give them something back towards the increases that have occurred.  Has the Government any plans to facilitate this?</p></speech>

It is complicated because it depends on the contract.  Some contracts allow provision for inflation and some allow claims to be made for additional cost, while others do not.  We have run into an issue around school-building where contractors tendered for a certain amount, believing they could build a school for that amount and make a reasonable profit.  Now, because of the increased cost of building materials, they cannot build a school without making a substantial loss that they cannot bear.  We are examining it but also want to make sure we are not taken advantage of and do not find that even more or all of the cost is passed on to us.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in particular, is working on it.</p></speech>

I wish everybody a happy, holy, peaceful and restful Christmas.</p>  <p>  My question concerns a restful Christmas.  The Brothers of Charity do sterling work throughout the Twenty-six Counties and have for decades, but they are starved of funding at present.  The worst area is respite.  Families who have challenging young adults, and maybe adults, need respite.  What keeps them alive is the weekend they get every month or two months.  It is being hammered and the Brothers of Charity need the funding.  They have dedicated staff and I thank them.  They will be working over Christmas.  The families need respite.  In County Tipperary it is an acute problem.  They are not getting respite, parents are getting sick and are under huge strain.  In a year when the Government has spent about &euro;5 billion extra on top of what the HSE always had, I cannot see why this valuable organisation should be starved for cash.</p></speech>

There is no organisation left starved for cash after this budget.  One of my major priorities in funding this year was respite.  The real issue is we have to reduce staff in buildings where we have the virus.  I am happy to say all the organisations are working hard to bring it back up to 100% capacity to ensure families get the respite they need.</p></speech>

There is a cohort of families who will find it difficult over the Christmas season.  Five weeks ago in Leaders' Questions to the Taoiseach I raised the inability to recruit and retain staff in the crucial area of home care services.  Despite the increased allocation of hours in the budget by the Government, people depending on home care services received cuts in their approved home care package due to the incapacity of private home care companies to provide these packages.  Then we saw the HIQA report of 5,000 patents waiting to get the home care packages because of lack of capacity.</p>  <p>  The Ministers have gone outside the box with Student Universal Support Ireland and social welfare for people to come into this field, but they are bringing them into the same bad pay and conditions in the private health companies that have caused people to leave.  Is the policy of the Government to recruit carers directly to the HSE to provide crucial services for people who are at a loss?</p></speech>

On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I wish everybody a happy, peaceful and restful Christmas and thank everyone in the House for the work they do.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question has been raised many times in the House.  It is important to record that this year we have already delivered 2.5 million more home care hours than last year.  A total of 55,000 people received home care every day in this country.  I thank the Government for increasing the budget to &euro;666 million.  Funding is not the issue and the list of those waiting for funding has dropped by 88%, but there are 5,300 people waiting on home care supports.  As we speak, Anne O'Connor, the chief operations officer of the HSE, and industrial relations, IR, in the HSE are having a meeting.  I know for a fact that community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, Cork and Kerry, is recruiting 300 staff into the HSE and we are doing targeted recruitment in areas, especially rural areas, where there is a lack of carers.  We are trying to think outside the box and I am working on this every day to try to make a difference.</p></speech>

Vaccine efficacy wanes over time and the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, and the European Medicines Agency, EMA, say the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine needs to be boosted after three months.  The EMA even said it should be two months.  The booster roll-out is progressing well but is focusing on cohorts by age.  We are dealing mostly with young cohorts who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, are now in need of a booster and will be at the end of the queue.  Can we look at reassessing the need for a booster and having a roll-out based on need and vulnerability?  That would mean recognising the younger cohorts who are more vulnerable at this time.</p></speech>

I do not have it in front of me but there was some revised NIAC advice today on that issue.  When it comes to the third or booster dose, they are working down through the age cohorts, from 50-somethings through 40-somethings and 30-somethings and then those aged 16 to 29.  We are saying to pharmacists and doctors to use common sense and discretion and, if they have vaccines they can use, to use them.  I understand NIAC has identified those who received the single-dose Janssen vaccine to be prioritised.  They are not at the end of the list.  I think they are at the same time as the 30-somethings but I will get the Deputy the exact information on that.</p></speech>

I raise a matter relating to non-EEA doctors who are working in Ireland.  Under the current rules, a non-EEA doctor cannot get a stamp 4 residency permit unless he or she has been working here for more than five years.  The T&aacute;naiste talked earlier in the week about changing the rules so that a non-EEA doctor can get a stamp 4 permit after two years.  That would allow such doctors to get onto specialist training programmes.  When will those rules be introduced?  What kind of timescale is being considered?  It is an extremely important matter.  More than 6,000 doctors in the healthcare sector are not in specialist training.  Can we bring in these changes on the earliest possible date and will the Minister give us a timeline?</p></speech>

Non-EEA, non-European doctors make an enormous contribution to the Irish heath service.  They have been doing service jobs in hospitals throughout the country for decades.  They have also done a phenomenal job during the pandemic.  Non-European doctors are not always treated very well in our system.  It is hard for them to get consultant posts or to get on specialist training schemes.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and I are working on it and will change it.  We have already changed the system to allow for a two-year work permit so a doctor does not need to change his or her work permit every time he or she moves hospital every six months.  In addition, we are going to offer stamp 4 visas to non-European doctors who are here for more than two years.  That will allow those doctors to qualify for specialist training schemes and apply for consultant posts on the same basis as an Irish or EU citizen, once they have been working in our system for two years.  We will be implementing those changes in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

What is the Government currently doing to replace the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, which were discontinued for new applicants in 2013?  An indication was given at that time that an alternative scheme would be put in place.  We are now almost nine years on and that has not happened.  It is inequitable because some people who were in receipt of the allowance prior to 2013 are still receiving it, and rightly so, but those who would have been entitled had the scheme not been suspended are not considered for any supports.  There is a need for personal transport because not everyone is in a position to access public transport.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme needs to be revised because "the limited medical criteria for eligibility ... [are] excessively restrictive".  That is a quote from the Ombudsman's recent report, Grounded: Unequal Access for People with Disabilities to Personal Transport Schemes.  The report highlights all of these issues.  What does the Government plan to do to address these issues and to ensure equality and, indeed, quality of life?</p></speech>

It relates to a constituent who simply has not been able to access particular services for an eating disorder.  I give thanks for the efforts of the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and even more welcome has been the wider funding.  The issue is being resolved.  However, this is a clear case of an individual and a family who have been caught between the stools.  The person in question is over 16 but under 18.  There has been a failure within the health service to apply an element of flexibility, common sense and joined-up thinking.</p>  <p>  As I said, this case has now, thankfully, been resolved, largely due to the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  However, there are dozens if not hundreds of young people throughout this country who are facing these barriers every day.  We need to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We come across issues all the time when somebody ages out at 18 and transfers from child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, to general adult mental health supports.  We know the services for eating disorders are not as robust for adults as they are for under-18s.  We have seen a spike in eating disorders in the past two years, especially for young girls aged 13 to 15.  The national implementation and monitoring committee is the oversight body for Sharing the Vision.  A CAMHS subcommittee has been set up and it will look at the age groups and examine whether CAMHS should continue treating its service users until they are 21, 23 or 25.  We know, for example, Jigsaw offers supports to people between the ages of 12 and 25.  It is something we are keeping under review.</p>  <p>  It will take a while.  If inpatient supports are provided, it would not be feasible to have a 13-year-old or 14-year-old girl with an eating disorder on the same corridor as a young man of 21 with psychosis.  We will have to look at many elements of this issue.  We will address it under the mental health Bill I will be bringing to the D&aacute;il next year.</p></speech>

That is an alarming and stark figure, because while many of us can stand up in here and talk about any manner of public policy, inflation will impact on our competitiveness, public pay policy, the pay policy of private companies and our ability to spend the significant amounts that many of the Ministers sitting behind the T&aacute;naiste have allocated.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline how the Government intends to identify the underlying causes of the inflation?  I welcome the announcement of the &euro;100 grant as a token towards addressing fuel costs.  I also ask the T&aacute;naiste to take into account those people who use prepay cards in their consumption of electricity.</p></speech>

The underlying causes of inflation are largely international and outside our control.  They relate to supply chain difficulties that arose particularly during the pandemic, when supply chains were disrupted.  A post-pandemic international economic boom occurred when pent-up demand was released when lockdowns were eased.  Central banks have also printed trillions of dollars.  When central banks have very low interest rates and print trillions of dollars through quantitative easing, things that cannot be printed become more expensive.  We know that from history.  That is why central banks will have to rein in quantitative easing next year.  Central banks in the US and UK have already increased interest rates to help bring inflation under control.</p>  <p>  The positive news from the ESRI is we anticipate inflation, which is now very high, will top out and start falling next year.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute, which is run by the trade unions, has made a similar prediction that would see inflation come back under control next year.  That said, we need to help people with the cost of living.  That means pay rises, which kick in in January.  There will be welfare and pension increases in January.  There will be tax cuts for middle income workers and we will help to reduce the costs of public services.</p></speech>

The Seanad has spoken.  Experts have told us the EU is involved in a stalling tactic.  We know what Mary Robinson has said.  We are told the existing provision for compulsory licensing will not do the business.  We are only talking about that dealing with the patent aspects of intellectual property.  We would still have considerable issues over trade details and secrets.  We would be dealing with the matter with a patent-by-patent and country-by-county approach, and that would not work.  COVAX is not going to cut the mustard.  The Government needs to follow the Seanad.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste and the Government would meet with experts such as the People's Vaccine Alliance.

This is a European competence, as a trade issue.  The position of the European Union is that compulsory licensing is a better approach than the TRIPS waiver approach.  However, neither is a silver bullet and neither will result in vaccines being produced all of a sudden on their own.  What is required is a comprehensive response.  That is what the Government and I support.  We will consider any proposal that is presented to the WTO that would result in more vaccines being produced.  As was the case with small pox and polio, we will not defeat this illness on a national basis.  It must be done on a global basis.</p></speech>

Several of the T&aacute;naiste's Government colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have spoken out against the tendering process and in support of the local employment services and job clubs.</p> <p>We had a motion passed unanimously in Cork City Council this week seeking the same thing.  We had a report from the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and from the Committee of Public Accounts, of which Government Deputies make up the majority.  They concluded, the Committee of Public Accounts in particular, that JobPath has not delivered value for money for the taxpayer, and, with a 7% success rate, I do not think it has delivered for the jobseeker either.</p> <p> If Government Deputies, councillors, the Committee of Public Accounts, the social protection committee, the workers and the unions are asking the Government not to go ahead with this tendering, why is it continuing to do so?  It is also regrettable that the Government passed a motion in this House that it does not intend to do anything about.</p></speech>

It is a legal requirement that the service be put out to tender.  It cannot just be handed to a group because one likes or knows them or because one thinks they do a great job.  There has to be a competitive process.  That is the advice the Minister has.</p></speech>

That is a huge achievement.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, I came to the D&aacute;il from the corporate world and it is my firm belief that this progress needs to be replicated in all companies across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I tabled a Bill in collaboration with the National Women's Council of Ireland that would require gender quotas at boardroom level for all Irish companies.  This is a recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality and it would be the quickest way to get to a point where business is a more diverse and inclusive space.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister responsible for enterprise, lead with me on this important issue?</p></speech>

I share the objectives of the Private Members' Bill, namely, the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill 2021, which is designed to increase the participation of women at the highest levels in the corporate world.  I look forward to meeting with the Deputy on the Bill and having it debated in this House in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy acknowledged, we are now up to 30% female directors on ISEC companies.  We are moving up the EU league table in that regard.  It is not enough, however.  There are still five all-male boards of listed companies and it is still the case that 34% of listed companies have no females on their senior leadership teams.  That is not acceptable and needs to change.</p></speech>

These men were selected for torture during internment in the North in 1971.  Separately, the survivors of the Miami Showband murders are to receive at least &pound;1.5 million in damages due to a decision in the Belfast High Court.  Separately again, the Glenanne Gang member, Garfield Beattie, was returned to prison for threats against the Aont&uacute; deputy leader, Councillor Denise Mullen.  Her father, Denis Mullen, was murdered by Beattie in her presence when she was four years old.  Garfield Beattie stated that, &ldquo;Every Catholic murdered in Armagh and Tyrone was by British Army weapons.&rdquo;  I have scanned the Government for any reference or statements on this in the last week and there are none.

He has 20 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600028#DD00300"><p>I will be sharing my time with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  We will take ten minutes each.</p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to update the House on the situation regarding Covid-19 in Ireland, as well as the measures being taken to address the threats posed.  I will come to Omicron shortly, but I would like to start on a more positive note.  In spite of the very significant threat posed by the Delta variant, it is clear that the national effort being made over the last number of weeks has been working.  The efforts of every single person, every family and every business have all been working.  These have been in tandem with a big increase in testing, in PCR and antigen testing, a wider roll-out and use of the Covid-19 pass, the roll-out of flu vaccines, serial testing in nursing homes and many more measures.</p>  <p>  It is because of all of these measures, but most importantly because of the efforts that people have been making, that the number of cases, which had been rising very rapidly, has levelled off.  It is because of the successful roll-out of the booster programme as well as the important fact that people are looking to get the booster vaccine, that we have also recently seen a steady reduction in hospitalisations, including a steady reduction in the number of people in critical care.</p> <p>This is important.  I want to acknowledge, in short, that the national effort taken against the Delta variant has been working.</p> <p> What has changed now is the emergence of the new Omicron variant.  We know it is taking over from the Delta variant quickly.  We know it is significantly more transmissible.  To give colleagues a sense of this, last week the Omicron variant made up about 1% of all new cases in Ireland.  By the weekend, it had gone from 1% to 5%.  By Tuesday, we were reporting that 14% of new cases were the Omicron variant.  I can confirm to the House that as of today, the Omicron variant makes up 27% of all new cases.  We have therefore gone from 1% to 27% in approximately a week.  We know that the variant is spreading rapidly.  Yesterday, the UK recorded its highest number of cases in one day since the pandemic began.  We know that the variant is going to result in an increase in cases in Ireland soon.  The only question is how high that increase will be.</p> <p> The advice I have so far is that vaccines provide significant protection against severe illness from the Omicron variant, which is important.  However, they provide less protection against symptomatic infection than they do against the Delta variant.  They provide significantly less protection against becoming symptomatic.  The strong advice I have is that the booster critically provides a dramatic and an essential additional level of protection against the Omicron variant, both from becoming symptomatic and from becoming severely ill.</p> <p> I urge every single person who is eligible for the booster vaccine to get it as a matter of urgency.  This is particularly true for people in the high-risk categories.  These groups, as defined by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, are as follows: everyone aged 50 and above, anyone who has an underlying condition, all of our healthcare workers, all of our residents in long-term residential care and pregnant women.</p> <p> The epidemiological situation both here and internationally, as well as the emerging evidence in relation to the Omicron variant, is being kept under close review.  My Department, the HSE, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, are meeting on a regular basis to review the evolving situation.  As we are all aware, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting today, right now in fact, to assess the current situation.  The Government will of course consider any advice and analysis offered by NPHET.</p> <p> Given the seriousness and the urgency of the threat posed by the Omicron variant, a number of actions have already been swiftly implemented.  To protect our healthcare system and our economy, we have responded quickly with new travel measures, which colleagues will be aware of.  As Deputies are also aware, the Government agreed to introduce a package of new public health measures, which took effect from 7 December.  These are aimed at reducing the current levels of socialising across society to interrupt or indeed slow down the spread of Covid-19 in the community.  We are not alone, of course.  Many EU countries are introducing new Covid-19 restrictions.  These include reintroducing measures, some of which we have retained here, such as the use of face masks and Covid-19 certificates.  Others are having to go further, including for example a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and the introduction of stricter measures in Germany.  It is fair to say that the situation across the EU remains fluid and uncertain. </p> <p> Our national vaccination programme is one of the most important tools we have in responding to Covid-19 and, in this case, in responding to the new threat posed by the Omicron variant.  We have a high level of vaccination by international standards.  We should be proud of it as a nation.  Critically, as well as having one of the highest levels of people vaccinated, we have always prioritised the most vulnerable first.  This is important.  In fact, Ireland has the highest percentage levels of vaccination anywhere in Europe among those who are over the age of 50, 60 and 70 and among the higher at-risk groups.  This is welcome.  It will have saved, and will continue to save, many lives and will keep many people safe.</p> <p> We have taken the same approach with the booster programme, where we have prioritised those most at risk first.  A large majority of these groups have now received a booster vaccine.  Our aim is that by the end of the year, which is within the next two weeks, everyone in those groups defined by NIAC will have had a booster, will have an appointment for a booster or will have had an opportunity to go and get a booster at a walk-in clinic.</p> <p> We are also doing well on the total number of people who have received the boosters, and not just at primary vaccination.  Now, the figure is approximately 1.4 million people, or about a third of adults in the country.  It puts Ireland third in the EU and it puts us eighth in the world in number of adults who have received a booster.</p> <p> I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to everybody working right across the country, in every one of our constituencies and in every county, who has been working night and day to make this vaccine programme such a success.</p> <p> However, as I am sure colleagues will agree, given the scale of the threat posed by the Omicron variant, given how fast it is moving and given just how much extra protection these boosters provide, we are going further.  Last night, I announced a significant scaling up of the programme to bring us to in excess of 300,000 doses a week on average over the coming weeks.  I would like to thank our healthcare workers, our GPs, our pharmacists, our service men and women in the Defence Forces and so many others right across the country.  We have put out a national call over the last number of days and, by God, people have responded.  I want to thank everybody for responding to that call to arms.</p> <p> Capacity is being increased across the board, in the vaccine centres, in the GP surgeries and in the pharmacies.  The vaccine centres will now be open from 8 a.m to 8 p.m., seven days a week.  Additional staff are being deployed.  Extra booths are being added where possible.  Staff from the Defence Forces are coming in.  We are redeploying staff from other parts of the health service.  We are opening three new centres - one in Cork and two in Dublin.</p> <p> While three quarters of GPs were already involved in the vaccine programme and doing incredibly valuable work, now nearly all of the 1,300 GP clinics across the country have agreed to get involved and to increase their capacity where they have the ability to do so.  Obviously, they still have serious obligations to keep their patients well on non-Covid-19 issues.</p> <p> The GPs will continue to prioritise the NIAC groups.  However, as of today, they also now have the ability to move through all of their patient groups as the capacity allows.  The number of pharmacies has increased immediately from 550 to 700.  We are pushing to get up to 1,000 in the next two weeks.  Critically, for GPs and pharmacies, last night I approved the waiving of the 15-minute post-vaccine wait on foot of a recommendation from NIAC.  The GPs and the pharmacists asked us to waive that.  Given the context of the urgency we have right now, it would help them, so that is in place as of today as well. </p> <p> High-risk children will start to be vaccinated next week, initially through the paediatric hospitals, and then through the vaccine centres.  The following week, from 28 December, the online portal will open for the parents of high-risk children to register them.  It will be on a self-identification basis.  The vaccines for this group will start on 3 January.  From mid-January, the vaccine centres will open to other children and other adult cohorts.  We all know that many parents have many questions.  Comprehensive materials are being put up on the HSE website.  Next week, those in their 40s will begin to receive appointments for the following week for vaccines to begin.</p> <p> I see that I am out of time.  I want to finish by saying it is an urgent situation.  I would like to wish all my colleagues a happy Christmas.  I acknowledge the broad political support there has been for the national effort and particularly for the vaccine programme.  This is urgent and I want to thank all of my colleagues for everything they have done and continue to do.  We need to this do together.  I have no doubt that we will.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

I do not underestimate for a moment the significant challenge that the pandemic has presented for schools in their operation and in their everyday running.  </p> <p>I sincerely acknowledge the hard work and commitment of all education partners, working together with the Department of Education and public health, to ensure that our schools have been in a position to operate throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  I also acknowledge the work of public health, whose support has been critical in these efforts.</p> <p> As Members will be aware, the operation of schools is vital for our children and young people.  From social development, to academic learning, to well-being, school is a crucial service for them.  If the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it is the vital importance of our education system.  Significant resources have been made available to schools throughout the pandemic to support them in their continued operation.  However, the education system is not defined by Covid-19.  Budget 2022 includes a number of investments in our education system that will create a stronger, brighter future for our learners.  We have further reduced the primary staffing schedule from the present historic low of 25:1 to 24:1 from September 2022 onwards.  The primary staffing schedule reduced by one point, to an historic low level of 25:1, in 2021 and further investment in new teaching posts will see the general average reduced to 24:1 in 2022.  We have provided an additional annual allocation to the DEIS programme of &euro;18 million in 2022, growing to &euro;23 million the following year.  Together with a further one point improvement in the staffing schedule for DEIS urban band 1 schools, this will create the largest ever education package to tackle educational disadvantage and represents an increase of more than 20% in funding for the DEIS programme in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p> The budget for 2022 includes a capital allocation of &euro;20 million to schools for the purchase of books, audiobooks and other media for the purposes of improving their existing literacy resource banks.  This funding is additional to that given for the school book rental scheme and is intended to promote the joy of literature, words and reading within our schools and classrooms.  The budget also seeks to support our excellent school leaders by extending administrative principal status to all teaching principals in schools with two or more special classes, or in special schools where a principal was previously a teaching principal.  Furthermore, provision has been made for a minimum of one day of administrative leave per week for teaching principals.  I look forward to advancing these initiatives, together with our partners in education.</p> <p> The Department has always been guided by advice from our public health authorities, including NPHET and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in respect of the infection prevention and control measures appropriate for schools.  We are appreciative of the priority and guidance these expert bodies have provided to the education sector throughout the pandemic and we continue to engage with them where further measures are recommended or needed.  The wearing of face masks by children aged nine years and older in a number of settings, including for children in third class and above in primary schools, has now been introduced on a temporary basis and will be subject to review in mid-February 2022.  A set of frequently asked questions relating to face masks and face coverings in primary schools was published online and sent directly to primary schools.  The FAQs provide further guidance to schools regarding the use of face masks or face coverings in the third to sixth class cohort.  Advice from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, on supporting children in wearing face coverings in primary schools was also published online and forwarded to schools.  Further resources have also been published by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.</p> <p> As I have set out previously, any engagement between parents and schools will take place in a spirit of partnership and co-operation to ensure the safety of the whole school community.  The guidance seeks a solution-focused approach between schools and parents to resolve any issues that may arise.  Where significant issues have not been resolved locally, contact should be made with the Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 support helpline by email or telephone and a departmental inspector will provide further support.  The guidance recognises that in the case of certain children with additional needs, schools may be already aware of difficulties they may face regarding the appropriate use of face coverings.  Schools will be best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face coverings may not be possible for them, and to discuss this with parents and guardians as required.  In such circumstances, schools do not require medical certification to provide an exemption to the wearing of face coverings.</p> <p> The Chief Medical Officer recently confirmed that it is his view that there is a role for the use of antigen tests as an additional tool in our schools.  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, have introduced a programme where antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises.  Parents and guardians of a primary schoolchild with a confirmed case of Covid-19 following a PCR test are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal.  The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case.  Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod within a seven-day period, antigen testing is being made available to every child in the class.</p> <p> It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a "detected" PCR test for Covid-19.  By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly.  It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme.  No personal details of the child will be shared.  These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order using a freephone number or online portal for delivery to their home.  It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing.  Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school whether they participate in antigen testing.  School principals will not be required to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results.  Information materials for parents has been shared with schools and publicised directly to parents. </p> <p> While Covid-19 has had an effect on all aspects of education, it is clear that some students have been impacted more than others, especially students with additional educational needs and those who are at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, was introduced to mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on learning loss and well-being arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to schools, from which each school can provide additional teaching support for the pupils who have experienced difficulties in settling back into school and engaging with learning.  These hours are additional to any other teaching hours allocated to the school, such as special education teacher or English as an additional language hours.  Schools have the flexibility to identify the pupils who have been most affected by the school closures, and schools can use these additional hours throughout the year to support these students.  It is a matter for each school to recruit the teachers required to provide the hours or, alternatively, a school can offer additional teaching hours to teachers already in the school who have less than full teaching contracts.  Any registered teacher may be recruited to provide CLASS hours, irrespective of whether the teacher is otherwise employed by the school.</p> <p> Ventilation is one part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19.  Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices was provided in early May.  The guidance outlines that CO2 monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas and rooms may not be adequately ventilated.  As such, a number of portable CO2 monitors were sent directly to primary and secondary schools as part of a free scheme.  In excess of 36,000 monitors have been provided.  To assist schools with this work, the Department recently announced the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45 million for primary schools and special schools as part of additional support in the context of Covid-19, and &euro;17 million was allocated for post-primary schools.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can use their minor works grant, including for the purchase of HEPA air cleaners where identified as necessary.  Schools may also apply for emergency works grant assistance to address larger-scale issues, as has always been the procedure. </p> <p> Well-being is a central focus of schools and the Department.  Specific supports have been put in place for schools to allow for well-being measures.</p> <p> I am pleased to have had the opportunity to address the House.  I am very appreciative of the tremendous support that has been given by all our partners in education and the school communities on the ground, as well as Deputies, in what has been a particularly unprecedented time in the education sector.  I am appreciative of their support and I wish them a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600031#GG00100"><p>This is the last opportunity we have to be reassured that the Government has a handle on Covid before the D&aacute;il recess.  There is a lot of talk from the Government about personal responsibility.  That is part of it, but I believe that the vast majority of people are already doing their best to keep themselves and their families safe.  We must act with our healthcare workers and the burden this pandemic is putting on them in mind.  We can reduce our social contacts, make sure to mask up and test regularly, but there are limits.  The role of, and obligation on, Government is much larger.  That starts with getting the communication right.  That means an end to mixed messaging and contradictions, Ministers flying kites or speculating in the media and senior politicians in government blaming others when they do not get things right.</p>  <p>  Over the past few months, the Government has failed to make the right call time and again in many areas.  It made the wrong call on antigen tests from the beginning.  It dismissed them and the role they could have played much earlier in keeping people safe.  The Minister recently refused to subsidise them in order to increase usage and accessibility, and supplement PCR testing, where appropriate, with all of the necessary caveats.  That is despite the very clear advice from the Covid-19 rapid testing group established in April chaired by the Government chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson.  Rapid tests will be an incredibly important screening tool this winter as families gather for Christmas and will be a financial burden on far too many who are already struggling with the rampant rise in the cost of living.  </p>  <p>  The Government has failed on ventilation and making schools as safe as possible.  Despite the very clear advice from the expert group on ventilation, which reported in March, the Government failed to use the summer to protect classrooms.  The Government denied for months that schools were sites of transmission.  That does not mean that they cannot be relatively safe, but the refusal of the Government to invest in proper systems to control the spread of Covid-19 in schools has made them far riskier than they should have been.  We now have a window to right that wrong while schools close for Christmas.  When they reopen, every poorly ventilated classroom must be fitted with CO2 monitoring systems and HEPA or appropriate air filtration systems.  There is a very cold January ahead, as we know.  The Government must do everything it can to make schools safer and do right by our children before they reopen.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health also needs to step up the booster campaign.  It is unforgivable that the Government took its foot off the pedal after the summer.  The vaccination workforce dropped by a third and that has delayed the booster campaign for weeks, if not months.  The Government failed to ensure that flexible arrangements were in place to rapidly ramp up the workforce and vaccination capacity.  It has not made full use of the pharmacies and pharmacists around the country who have been eager to administer as many vaccines as they can.  The Government has failed in many ways regarding booster vaccines, despite the mountain of evidence that they would be needed.  This has set us back.  There have been incredible problems with the booster campaign to date, especially the booking systems.  The Government has blamed the slow pace on no-shows, when in reality many no-shows are people who had already been vaccinated or were issued with multiple appointments.  The Government must acknowledge when it gets it wrong rather than blame people who have already done so much.  </p>  <p>  Alongside boosters for the immunocompromised, the most important task over the next two months is vaccination for those aged under 12.  There are many parents with concerns that must be addressed and they must be reassured.  Parents must have access to any necessary information to ensure a high uptake of the vaccine among this cohort.  The Government must do more to reach people who are unvaccinated as best it can.  The vaccines are safe and effective.  We must make sure that people know this and have the opportunity to get them.  A high uptake across the entire population is essential to control the spread and consequences of Covid-19 for all of our people.  </p>  <p>  Our hospitals are in the depths of a very difficult winter.  At the start of this week there were 534 patients on trolleys, tucked into ward corners and corridors.  Over the past week there were more than 325 patients on trolleys in Limerick and 281 in Letterkenny, and five other hospitals had more than 100 patients on trolleys.  That is a very unsafe environment in normal times, never mind in a pandemic, for patients and staff.  It illustrates the failures of this and previous Governments that have left our hospitals vulnerable and the State in a uniquely exposed position throughout this pandemic.  It makes us all the more deeply concerned about the Omicron variant.  While it has been reported as potentially less severe, that is little comfort if it is more transmissible when our hospitals are already at capacity.  </p>  <p>  As of yesterday evening,, there were only 83 open and available general beds in hospitals.  Some nine hospitals, including Waterford, St. Vincent's, Sligo and Mayo, had none.  Only three have more than five.  Incredibly, in the 2022 budget not a single additional inpatient bed was provided or budgeted for over and above what was in place.  Our ICUs are full.  There are no available beds for children and only seven available beds for adults in four counties.  We know we have capacity problems in healthcare and the Government has simply failed to put extra capacity in place.</p>  <p>  This is only going to get more difficult for our front-line healthcare workers over the next month.  They are already well beyond burnout and exhaustion, yet they soldier on.  We owe them a debt of gratitude, but I fear that will not be repaid anytime soon.  They deserve breaks, their annual leave and to work normal hours for fair pay.  They also deserve the recognition and bonus payments that were promised.  We heard a lot of talk from Ministers, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party before the budget about a recognition payment for those on the front line.  The budget came and went and nothing happened.  After the budget, nothing has happened.  This is the last sitting of the D&aacute;il before the Christmas break, yet the Government has done absolutely nothing to recognise the hard work of those on the front line in health care.  They will be the very same people that will have to do Trojan work over the next number of weeks and months.  Shame on the Government for not resolving that issue when it should have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600031#GG00200"><p>I do not think anyone would have anticipated that we would find ourselves in such a precarious and difficult position again this Christmas after the shocking situation last Christmas and January.  We are contending with consistently high case numbers as well as the arrival of the Omicron variant, which is wreaking havoc in other jurisdictions.</p><p>The first issue I want to raise is testing.  It applies in every county, but in Louth there is still an <i>ad hoc</i>response to demand.  There have been pop-up test centres for a few days here and there, but these are not publicised for some strange reason.  Given that they only operate sporadically, it has been quite confusing for people in recent weeks.  Due to the surge we are currently experiencing and the arrival of the latest variant, it is time we had two full testing centres in Louth until such time as numbers fall again.  </p><p>The matter of boosters also needs to be addressed.  I checked the HSE website a couple of hours ago.  In Louth, booster walk-in clinics are only being scheduled for three hours a day today and tomorrow for those aged over 60 and for three hours a day for three days next week for those aged over 50.  The Minister referred to extended times, and I will monitor the website to see if it is updated to reflect that comment.  People are reporting difficulties in getting an appointment in local pharmacies in Louth.  Boosters have been offered in 700 pharmacies this week, an increase of 150 on last week, which is good, but is still well short of the thousand pharmacies that participated in the first vaccine roll-out.  There are 1,900 pharmacies in the State, and it is vital that more come on board given the urgency the new variant has caused.  I am also concerned that the pace up until now has been far too slow.  It is not today or yesterday that we learned that everyone will need a third dose.  By my calculations, we are 15% behind where we were in June during the first vaccine roll-out.</p><p>The Minister for Health said that plans to increase capacity are gathering pace, but the urgency only began this week and it is frustrating at this stage of the pandemic that basic public health efforts such as the booster jab are still slow to get off the ground.  Another issue that needs to be resolved is updating vaccine passes for those who receive boosters to ensure their stated vaccine status is correctly reflected in their vaccine pass.  We need clarity on the current status of that and when we can expect it to be completed.  I have heard no clarification whatsoever about that to date.</p> <p>Schools are another issue.  The Government's response to dealing with Covid-19 in schools has been shambolic, to say the least.  Finally, there is some recognition of the need for HEPA filters, but why does it take several weeks, or indeed several months, for everything to happen with the Government?  There are parents who will not send their children to school next week because they worry about them contracting Covid before Christmas.  If parents had any confidence in schools being safe environments for children, this would not happen.  The Government needs to get a handle on this and listen to parents, teachers and experts in ventilation in terms of managing our schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600032#HH00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na hAir&iacute; ar deis leo thabhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</p>  <p>  I would like to raise the plight of community groups and the difficulties they are facing during the pandemic.  They have kept operating, in most cases, in very difficult circumstances.  The Government needs to do more to help them.  They are saving the State a fortune and, in some cases, are saving lives.  For instance, our first responders are ordinary men and women giving up their time to help communities to cope with the gaps in the ambulance service.  I recently asked a parliamentary question about the funding provided to first responder groups throughout the country and the answer I received stated that community first responder groups fundraise for themselves within the communities in which they serve making them completely self-sufficient.  The answer, in effect, is not one red cent comes from the Government to provide funding for those first responder groups.  That is scandalous.  What do they receive?  They receive ambulance cast-offs for equipment and the odd voucher for training.  Every community group is struggling to fund-raise.  The first responders groups are no different and yet we expect them to get out of bed at 3 a.m. to provide assistance to somebody having a heartache.  It is not right.  It needs to be fixed.  I know at first hand what it is like as I am a first responder.</p>  <p>  Many groups that provide assistance and support to our older people have had the same difficulty with fundraising.  Our older people have been isolated enough during the pandemic.  Please do not continue to give them the cold shoulder.  They should not have to rely on the crumbs from the property tax nominations of our councillors.  There are groups helping our older people to age in place, which leads to better outcomes for everyone and saves the State money.  Our older people have given a lifetime of service and paying tax and they deserve to see a return of that investment.</p>  <p>  On the subject of our schools, we had an announcement of funding of sorts earlier this week.  Clarity is needed.  I believe the forms refer to 2022-23 expenditure.  Schools need to know if they are to buy HEPA filters at the expense of next year's necessary repairs.  Clarification on this would be appreciated.</p>  <p>  Finally, we need to see some clarity from the Government.  There are more mixed messages this minute than there are at supermarket tills before Christmas week.  I have a gospel choir in Monasterevin where I live and they all sing off the one hymn sheet.  The Government is singing off no hymn sheet.  It is ridiculous.  The confusion adds to the anxiety of parents, teachers and business owners.  God knows, we have enough anxiety around as it is.  The Government must get the messaging right.  There must be fewer reactionary comments and more forward planning.  It should share the science behind the decisions and perhaps people will be more understanding.</p>  <p>  I wish everybody a very happy Christmas.  Thanks for everything.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that the sense of partnership between the Department and individual school communities is non-existent.  The feeling is that schools are being abandoned, that teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, are being abandoned and that individual school principals are being abandoned, and what they have had as a source of comfort for more than 18 months has been the mantra from Government that schools are safe.  When HEPA filters have been raised for the past 18 months, they have been told schools are safe.  When antigen testing was being put forward as a tool to battle Covid within schools, they were told schools are safe.  Indeed, when the issue of substitution was raised with the Minister, she seemed to be in some way surprised that substitution was even being raised when everybody else in politics knew that schools were screaming out about the issue.</p>  <p>  What I want to do for the Minister is to provide her with three solutions for the new year.  I find the lack of political partnership within these Houses a little discouraging as well.  I wrote to her on this very day last month, 16 November, and I asked her to meet with all spokespeople on education from all Opposition parties so that collectively we could convey to her what we were hearing from school communities and she could then act on it in a spirit of partnership.  That meeting has not taken place.  There is no sense that that meeting will ever take place.  In fact, the only reason she is here today is because members of the Opposition demanded it.  That lack of communication from her even to members of the Opposition is mirrored by the poor communication from the Department to individual school communities who feel that they are not being listened to.  The only reason schools are open and in any way functioning is the dedication, the patriotism and sense of genuine public service of our teachers, SNAs and principals, all those volunteers who go with every school community, and school caretakers and the secretaries.  I remind everybody, perhaps in future political debates or debates in public discourse, that whenever they feel the need to criticise teachers or SNAs, they should remember this pandemic and that it was not the political leadership of the Government or the Department of Education's attitude that kept schools open but it was teachers, SNAs, school principals, secretaries, caretakers and everybody in those school communities.</p>  <p>  I have three suggestions.  First, there needs to be an early decision on the leaving certificate.  It is not tenable for us to say that the leaving certificate can go back to the way it was in 2017, 2018 and 2019 when it comes to 2022.  The level of disruption that fifth year and sixth year students in this senior cycle have endured has been unfair.  They missed out on some in-school teaching last year.  They are now in a situation where, effectively, there is a substitution crisis at second level and much of what they would have been expecting to learn is just not being taught.  An acknowledgement of that early from the Department would be welcome along with a process rolled out this year as happened last year.  Let us just do it.  Let us acknowledge that they have lost out and that they can have a hybrid model of in-school written examination allied with the assessed grade model similar to that rolled out last year because, in fairness, any second level principal will tell the Minister that students are not learning as they should be and whatever adjustments the Department is saying to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will be rolled out will not go far enough.</p>  <p>  Second, we cannot treat every school the same when it comes to this pandemic.  Areas in my constituency have the highest infection rate in the country.  Why not have a crack team of education and public health officials proactively engaging with these schools where a raft of students and half the staff are out to ascertain what resources they need, be it HEPA filters and so on?  Why do we have such a generalised view of what every school community is doing?  It is not difficult to get the data.  Here is a high infection area.  Here is an area where it is clearly a problem.  Here is an area where the school is obvious struggling.  Let us proactively engage with that school.  What happens?  For example, in a school in my constituency with the highest infection rate in the country a number of weeks ago, 58% of the students were out and people could not get anybody on the phone for a week.  That is a practical suggestion for the Minister.  Let us get rid of the trench warfare between different Departments,  let us work together and identify areas where the infection rate is high, and let us proactively engage with those schools.  However, that would, of course, take the Department of Education to actually believe that it has a role in the day-to-day management of schools.  The attitude the Minister has inherited is that you are on your own.</p>  <p>  Third, as a practical suggestion, I note that the roll-out of vaccination for five- to 12-year-olds will take place in vaccination centres in the new year and I welcome that.  It will be a game changer for education.  Why are we not doing it in schools?  Why do we not roll out the vaccination for five- to 12-year-olds, not in vaccination centres but in schools?  While we are at it, why do we not vaccinate the school staff in the process?</p> <p>It just makes so much sense.  We are asking parents to go to a vaccination centre to get their children vaccinated.  Why not be proactive and go to the school community, vaccinate the children on site and vaccinate the staff - teachers, SNAs, secretaries and caretakers - at the same time?  It makes perfect sense.  It has been done before.</p> <p> I will leave the Minister with three points.  Let us change the leaving certificate and do what we did last year.  Let us have proactive engagement with areas of high infection rates in a way that will make a difference, and let us vaccinate young people where they are learning to ensure schools can remain open.</p></speech>

This is especially timely given the risks and challenges associated with the new Omicron variant.  The current level of Covid-19, both nationally and internationally, is of concern and yet again is placing a huge strain on public services, not least the health system.  I again acknowledge the enormous contributions made by all healthcare staff in the continued operation of vital services throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges that face us, I take the opportunity today to provide an update, following statements last month, on some of the significant progress that is being made to further enhance protections, in particular for the older population and people using mental health services in response to Covid-19.  I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made in the administration of booster vaccines to the over-80s population within the community.  Among the 164,000 people in this age cohort, more than 140,000 vaccines have been administered to date through the excellent work of GPs.  GPs are also administering additional doses to over-70s in the community, of which there are approximately 339,000 individuals.</p></speech>

It is expected that this group will be substantially completed in the coming weeks.  The 60-69 age group are being vaccinated through vaccination centres, with more than 208,000 vaccines administered to date.  The expectation is that this group will be substantially completed by the end of December.  Importantly, test positivity has been reducing in some older adult age groups, which shows that where people have been taking up the offer of a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in high numbers, we are seeing significant reductions in the incidence of disease.</p>  <p>  I also welcome NIAC's recent recommendation to extend the booster vaccine to all individuals aged 16 years and older, and that the interval between completion of primary vaccination and the booster dose be reduced to three months.  In making its latest recommendations, NIAC has reiterated that vaccine booster doses should continue to be offered in the priority order previously outlined.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people, I am pleased we are continuing to protect those most at risk of severe illness and poor clinical outcomes.</p>  <p>  Huge inroads have been made in the administration of booster vaccinations through the home vaccination service.  The first phase of the programme, which commenced at the end of October, included people who are immunocompromised and individuals aged 80 years and older.  The programme was extended to people aged 60-79 years last month.  To date, more than 780 vaccines have been administered and the programme is expected to be completed by the end of December.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of the booster vaccination programme among people aged 65 and over in long-term residential care facilities, including nursing homes, has been substantially completed since the end of last month, having commenced on 4 October.  Vaccination teams were operational within all areas of the country, seven days a week, which saw the majority of care facilities complete the booster programme within a three-week period.  Following extensive discussions with the Department and the relevant health agencies, I very much welcome the expansion of the booster vaccination programme to individuals of all ages living in long-term residential care facilities.  To date, more than 4,500 booster doses have been administered to persons aged younger than 65 years who reside in long-term residential care.  As of 12 December, more than 24,000 residents aged 65 years and older in long-term residential care facilities, including nursing homes, have received their booster vaccination.  Community vaccination teams will continue to administer vaccines for people who were advised to have their booster vaccine deferred or who are in facilities where there was an outbreak of cases at the time.  The booster programme, which has been extended to all healthcare workers, including those in nursing homes, is progressing and will add further to the protections afforded to front-line health staff and the people under their care.</p>  <p>  I take the opportunity today to assure the House that significant supports continue to be made available to nursing homes in response to Covid-19.  The outbreak assistance element of the temporary assistance payment scheme provided to the private and voluntary nursing home sector continues.  I am delighted to announce today that the outbreak assistance element of the scheme, which was to conclude in December, will now be extended until March 2022.  Some &euro;134 million has been made available to the sector between 2020 and 2021.  Due to the extension of the outbreak assistance until March 2022, which we will keep under review, &euro;1.75 million has been paid to nursing homes under 75 separate claims since the end of June.  A broad suite of other supports and measures continue to be provided to nursing homes, including 23 Covid-19 response teams; the supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge; where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals; a suite of focused public health guidance and training resources, including a further series of infection prevention and control webinars delivered by HIQA in September, with nearly 800 attendees from nursing home staff; and temporary accommodation for nursing home staff to support measures to block the chain of transmission.  All of those assistance measures are still in place.</p>  <p>  Of note, serial testing has been reintroduced to all nursing homes for two cycles and commenced on 6 December.  The second cycle will begin in early January.  I reassure the House that I meet regularly with the HSE, HIQA and the Department on the evolving impact of the pandemic in nursing homes and I continue to monitor the situation very closely to ensure all necessary supports and guidance are sustained and enhanced where required.  There is no doubt the protection of people living in nursing homes has been prioritised once again through the roll-out of the booster vaccination programme and the continuation of a broad range of supports.  Furthermore, almost &euro;18 million has been allocated under budget 2022 to ensure the continued implementation of the recommendations of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel report.  This investment will provide for further improvements across the sector, including, among others, the establishment of a permanent multidisciplinary, enhanced community support team in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, and the pilot of the safe staffing framework for long-term residential care.</p>  <p>  I wish to provide an update on the progress that has been made in mental health services to address the emerging challenges posed by Covid.  I am very pleased to confirm that all consenting individuals in long-term residential mental health care have received their booster vaccine.  In addition, the roll-out of booster doses to people with certain mental health difficulties in the community is well under way.  All eligible mental health staff are being called for their booster vaccine through their community vaccination centres.</p>  <p>  While there are new and evolving challenges posed by Covid-19, we continue to make significant progress in our shared, collective response to the virus.  Our health system continues to adapt and reconfigure through the provision of additional investment and enhanced supports to ensure the continued delivery of much-needed services.  This includes the provision of services to some of the most vulnerable in society, including older people in nursing homes and individuals with severe or enduring mental health difficulties.  The Government has moved quickly in an attempt to stabilise the current situation and will continue to do so, building on current public health guidance, revised travel measures, a world-class vaccination programme and the continued roll-out of the booster vaccine.</p>  <p>  It is essential, however, that we all continue to adhere to basic measures to protect ourselves and those around us.  This means isolating and getting tested if we have symptoms; wearing a face covering, where appropriate; making sure indoor spaces are well ventilated; maintaining social distancing whenever appropriate; and covering our coughs and sneezes and keeping our hands clean.</p> <p> I conclude by again appealing to anyone who is not yet vaccinated to come forward and speak to a medical professional about their concerns, and to those offered the booster to please take it.  I was one of the cohort that was vaccinated in late May with the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  I have to say I was concerned over the last month that the efficacy had waned so I was delighted to receive my booster from my pharmacist last Monday week.  It was a relief.  It is something I have raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health in regard to that cohort who received Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  In my age group at the time, it was the class of 1966 who were called and I met so many people that day.  I am conscious there are many 20 to 30-year-olds who also received the one-jab Janssen vaccine, although they were delighted at the time.  I welcome the fact they are going to be accelerated, as the T&aacute;naiste said earlier.  If we all contribute to this collective effort, we will keep our society and economy open, we will maintain our progress and we will keep people healthy and safe.</p> <p> I wish everyone in the House, all the staff and all my colleagues a happy, healthy and safe Christmas.  I am very conscious of all of the people who will be working in retail, the health sector and hospitality over Christmas and who might not get Christmas Day off, as we hope to.  I wish everyone a happy and safe Christmas.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the response to the different sectors has been far from fair and equal, particularly in the sporting community.  The rules and regulations on a return to sport during this pandemic have seldom been seen to treat all sports equally.  We saw it last month with the sudden decision to allow only vaccinated children aged between 12 and 17 years to play indoor sports.  This decision caused much pressure and stress on coaches and volunteers across the State and they turned children away from training and matches.  Thankfully, the Minister eventually saw sense, engaged with stakeholders and rescinded the decision.</p>  <p>  On Monday, I was delighted to see a major investment in sport of nearly &euro;80 million to help sporting organisations recover from the impact of the pandemic.  However, once we dig into the figures, we cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment and unfairness because there is an ever-growing gap for sporting organisations beyond the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, which are being treated particularly generously compared to smaller sports.  The vast majority of sporting organisations are being treated like an afterthought when it comes to funding.  For example, Basketball Ireland, a sporting organisation with a higher than average level of female participation, certainly significantly better than rugby, and an organisation with over 250 clubs spread right across the island, received just slightly over &euro;1 million in the funding announced on Monday.  While this funding is to be welcomed, and I am sure it will make use of every cent, that funding pales in comparison with what the IRFU will receive.  The IRFU has about 50 clubs across the island and whole chunks of the island have no rugby clubs present at all, yet it will receive 17 times the funding that Basketball Ireland receives.  We have to ask where is the logic in this.  The funding allocation gives the impression that rugby is 17 times more popular than basketball but club numbers do not reflect this.  We need to see funding that reflects sporting participation, not funding based on who can lobby the best.  We need a sports facilities strategy and we need to see fair play in Irish sports funding.</p></speech>

I am relieved that, at long last, it seems HEPA filtration is being addressed but I cannot understand why, even at the 11th hour, with Omicron upon us, the onus is being put on schools to apply.  Given the Department&rsquo;s delay and the urgency of the situation, I do not see why the Minister cannot announce today that the Government will buy the HEPA filters and deliver them to schools over the Christmas break.  We bailed out the banks overnight so surely we can get HEPA filters to schools over the Christmas break to protect our children from the long-term effects of a novel virus.  We all want our schools open but we want them open safely.  Repeating the mantra that schools are safe did not make them so.  Defending poor decisions can never supersede our children's safety.</p>  <p>  Ethics are also crucial to education.  Our children can see a virus that is blazing through countries in the global South because we, in our vaccinated comfort, allow it.  The lack of action on the TRIPS waiver has tripped us up, resulting in Omicron.  Last night, the Seanad Opposition had a Private Members&rsquo; motion supporting the TRIPS waiver and thanks to a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator and a Green Party Senator who spoke against the Government amendment, the Government withdrew that mean-spirited amendment.  We should remember it was the tax of workers that paid for the research and development that went into the vaccine.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and our MEP, Chris MacManus, for their work on No Profit On Pandemic and A People's Vaccine in Europe.  With the Christmas season upon us, I urge Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens to press Fine Gael on its resistance to sharing and its chilling belief that inequality is good for the capitalist economic model.  Greed is not who we are.  We are a small island but we are a great one and a generous one.  Sharing is who we are.  We must work to make sure our shared world is vaccinated.  I too was boosted last weekend.  I commend the many volunteers for their efforts, despite some having to take abuse.  We really need to commend them.  I thank our healthcare workers, who are once again courageously facing another variant to protect our people this season.  I know from Naas General Hospital that it is their solidarity to each other that is keeping them going.  I salute each and every one of them.</p>  <p>  Nollaig shona to everyone here and across our small, great and generous Ireland.</p></speech>

There is a real urgency about getting the boosters out.  On Tuesday, I called for the age restrictions to be lifted for boosters.  It seemed like that was going to be done yesterday.  An announcement was made that there would be no age restrictions applying to GPs and to pharmacists, which was a very welcome development.  Unfortunately, that was not the case and pharmacists have been told today they have now to go back on that and they are only allowed to provide the boosters to those over 50.  The issue about that, of course, is that a flood of bookings was made yesterday with pharmacists from people of all ages and pharmacists now have to tell those people their appointments are no longer valid.  It makes no sense whatsoever to do this.</p></speech>

They are currently dealing with complaints from the public about the news that went out.  There is a need for clarification on this.  There is no justification for making a distinction between what GPs can do and what pharmacists can do.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  These are, of course, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson people in the main, who are now highly susceptible because of the waning immunity.</p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise, and which I want the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister along with the other one, is that there is no official record of boosters.  This is going to raise huge problems over Christmas and in the new year.  Other European countries are moving to require evidence of the booster.  In Austria, for example, to where many Irish people will travel over the Christmas break, people must have a booster and evidence of the booster, but people currently do not have that.  People who have had Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson have no evidence of it.  Equally, people who had their vaccines early in the year, such as healthcare workers, have no evidence.  The situation is similar in France.  This has to be dealt with quickly.</p></speech>

The Minister left after 30 minutes.  I intended the tenor of my contribution to be constructive but the fact there is nobody here will alter that slightly.  Given the fact there is an absent chair where a Minister should be, I cannot help but feel this is symbolic of a Department that is not in control of what is happening on the ground and has been absent for much of the time, while the crisis has got worse in our schools.</p> <p>I wanted to come in here and be constructive but I cannot help but also channel the anger of the teaching community, including principals, teachers, SNAs, and parents who have contacted me and others around the Chamber daily, in the Opposition and the Government alike, expressing fear and frustration.  That needs to be brought to the fore tonight and it is lamentable that the Minister has left after 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Had the Minister been here I would have acknowledged two realities that existed in our school community over the past four months since they reopened in September.  First, the Department of Education, the Minister and various different representatives of the Government have repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>that schools are safe.  At the same time, in the past two weeks the highest recorded number of Covid cases has been among those five to 12-year-olds who sit in those cold classrooms every day and then they are among their parents and grandparents.  We were told by the Minister there was no crisis in getting substitute teachers while at the same time school principals were going on Twitter to call for substitute teachers to go to their schools.  Second, not too long ago the Minister told us she was on the side of children with special educational needs and then she sought to remove banked hours for special education teachers.  Those two realities existed in our schools.<br/><br/>I have not had the opportunity to talk to the Minister, but every week during her Questions on Promised Legislation slot I have raised the issue of mitigation in schools.  It has been a slow and arduous process even to bring it to where we are now.  There has been a fund and I acknowledge there has been an increase in fund for essential small budget work, but it is still not in place for HEPA filters.  We have a scenario in our schools where the essential grant scheme has been doubled to &euro;45 million but where there will still be schools that will have to choose between refurbishing a bathroom, fixing a window or providing a HEPA filter.  Then we have a ludicrous scenario whereby the responsibility for what HEPA filter goes into a school is left with a school principal.  School principals are already cut to the bone in the work they have been asked to do.  If you read the Minister&rsquo;s comments today, you will see that they have been left in charge of antigen testing, sourcing substitute teachers, and dealing with incredibly low morale in schools and with the panic of parents and guardians alike.  Now we get a budget for essential air filtration devices and it is left to school principals to source them, go online and become an expert on where these air filtration devices can be purchased.  The Taoiseach said last week they would cost between &euro;1,400 and &euro;1,700.  Others are saying they are buying them for &euro;120.  We have a seller&rsquo;s market now.  Schools will open up in January and most of them will still not have been able to source HEPA filters by then.  That is a shambles and once again it will be a failure.<br/><br/>We are moving into our third term of sixth-year students who do not know what examination they will be sitting come May and June.  That is a failure of contingency planning and a failure to learn lessons and apply a sense of compassion and decency to these students.  They have already suffered so much with the interference in their learning environment and taking days off to isolate or for whatever reason.  I met some of those leaving certificate students during the week on a Zoom call and they told us they did not get to a sit a junior certificate.  They have never had a State examination and yet we still have this scenario where they do not believe they will be sitting a traditional leaving certificate.  However, we have not yet intervened to say what our contingency plan is and that they can be safe in the knowledge they will be going back to the hybrid model.</p></speech>

I have been speaking about this a lot recently because, when used correctly, antigen tests are extremely effective, particularly in situations where people are asymptomatic.  With the Omicron variant so transmissible and in our community, it is more important than ever that we use antigen tests before and after meeting with groups or engaging in indoor socialising or activities.  For a few months I have been calling for an increased social media campaign to make sure we reach young people with the correct messaging around antigen testing.  This is extremely necessary, especially as we approach Christmas.  They are pretty inexpensive and widely available and using them could be the difference between keeping your friends and family safe this Christmas and not.</p>  <p>  I commend the success and speed of the booster campaign.  It is reassuring to see older family members, healthcare workers and the vulnerable having that added protection.  I must admit I have particular concerns for those who received the Janssen vaccine.  Given the waning immunity we know is associated with this vaccine, it is important its recipients are boosted as soon as possible.  More than 236,000 people received the Janssen vaccine and a majority of them are aged between 18 and 34.  They are right in the age cohort that is most likely to be socialising and mixing with friends in indoor environments and they are entitled to do that, but it seems we are setting this age group up for increased spread and infection.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister of State if there are particular concerns among NPHET and NIAC on an increase in infection in these age groups.  Are we seeing any increased level of infection or cause for concern?  France has determined that those over 65 years of age who got the Janssen vaccine before October are deemed no longer to be fully vaccinated.  There is much confusion among Irish tourists set to fly to France over the holiday period, especially those under the age of 35 who received the Janssen vaccine and who do not know yet whether they will be allowed into bars and restaurants at this stage.  I ask the Minister of State to work with her French counterparts to provide clarity to this group.</p>  <p>  Our vaccine roll-out has been one of the most successful in the world and our third dose campaign is following suit.  However, the messaging is starting to get confusing as to who can get a booster, when they can get it and where they can get it.  It is essential we nip any confusion in the bud and that we are unified in our approach and in the message we are giving to the public.</p>  <p>  I mention the digital Covid certificate.  Like many other Deputies, I have been receiving a lot of correspondence from constituents wondering when their digital Covid certificate will be updated with details of their third dose.  We know some countries require proof of a booster dose to travel, and I am sure many others will be following suit.  I hope an EU-wide approach will be taken to this but I would welcome clarity today on how this will work and whether it is something the Department is working on.  I know the priority is to get boosters in arms but for those who already have their boosters, having that recognised in their Covid certificates is the next step.</p>  <p>  I have also been contacted by a constituent who, unfortunately, had an extremely rare reaction to their first dose of the vaccine and had to be hospitalised.  This person may never be able to be fully vaccinated and has been advised by medical experts not to take any other brand of vaccine either.  This person is completely pro-vaccine and would get fully vaccinated if it was medically possible to do so but it simply is not.  They can no longer engage in a lot of indoor activities as a result.  I am sure the number of people who are medically unable to take a vaccine is extremely small, but we should consider introducing some sort of exemption for these people.  Other countries, such as the UK, have exemptions for people who are medically unable to take the vaccine.  While I know they are at no less risk than someone who is unvaccinated by choice, it is important to recognise the medical advice they have received.</p>  <p>  I thank our front-line healthcare workers and all those involved in the ongoing fight against Covid-19.  We owe them a debt of gratitude and I am not sure how we will ever repay them.  We should remember that the best present we can give those working on the front line is to try our best to keep ourselves and those around us safe this Christmas.</p></speech>

The prime example of that is that only a few weeks ago we renewed the emergency powers legislation and the lead Opposition party said the restrictions were long past their sell-by date.  Yet we are back at the stage where restrictions are being examined.  I do not say that as any criticism of the Opposition because the Covid pandemic shifts and turns and variants emerge.  This time last year we were facing into a Christmas with a new variant with Covid restrictions being discussed and proposed, and during the following weeks we saw that variant have a devastating impact on case numbers in this State.</p> <p>In that context, we must be concerned about Omicron.  We do not have all of the relevant data yet but it is important that the Government has taken the steps it has taken because we are better prepared now than most European countries for dealing with Omicron.  Across Europe, countries are considering new restrictions.  In the Netherlands, bars and restaurants now close at 5 p.m. and that will be extended into the holiday season.  Austria and Germany have proposals under which unvaccinated people will not be able to use certain types of retail.  The UK has gone from appearing to have a very laid-back approach to this pandemic to scaling up its warnings significantly.  </p> <p> I support the Government's approach to this.  We were never about zero Covid or about letting it rip; we always sought to manage this and to strike a balance between risks and freedoms.  In general we have gotten it right.  Of course, we have gotten it wrong on occasions too but on balance, Ireland has managed this pandemic well.  I do not say that in a self-serving way from this side of the House.  I say it because objective observers have said it.  We have one of the lowest mortality rates and one of the highest vaccination rates in the European Union.  The Bloomberg index that balances restrictions, freedoms and Covid incidence rates continuously places Ireland in the top tier.  While there are some things we could do differently, by and large Ireland has managed this pandemic well and many of the people I meet acknowledge that.</p> <p> With Omicron on the horizon, the booster vaccine is incredibly important.  We are still awaiting details on Omicron but what we know already is very worrying.  Some of the data appear to suggest that previous infection offers little protection against reinfection.  It would appear that vaccines like Sputnik and Sinopharm and even Astra Zeneca offer ineffective or even very poor resistance to Omicron.  That means that many people awaiting a booster really want to avail of it.  Of course, we had very limited use of Astra Zeneca on this island and the cohort that was targeted with it has now, by and large, received a booster dose.  I would say to anybody who is due to receive a booster dose and has not yet availed of it, especially those who have taken one of the vaccines about which we have concerns, to go and get a booster dose.  People who have been infected before may think they will not need a booster but the evidence would appear to suggest that they also need to get a booster shot.  That means that the Government must do better than it has done to date with the 1.4 million boosters that have been administered already.  It is only 20 days since Omicron was declared a variant of concern.  The booster programme has given us a significant level of protection.  On my way to the Chamber today I received a call informing me that my daughter's dental appointment in January has been cancelled because the dentists are going to be involved in the vaccination programme.  When we get to the other side of January we will have come a long way.  I believe that because I trust the HSE and its vaccination programme because it has the track record.  While everybody is right to have concerns, we have had one of the best vaccination programmes in Europe and there is no reason to believe we will not have one of the best booster programmes too.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to consider the evidence on Astra Zeneca as it emerges.  I am deeply concerned because thousands of people in the North received Astra Zeneca as their primary vaccine and we do not know when they will receive their booster.  We know that they have not had restrictions in the North for a significant amount of time and we also know that infections in one part of this island invariably lead to infections in other parts.  I would say to people who are eligible, particularly if they have taken Astra Zeneca, to get their booster dose.  The Government needs to have contingency plans in place if people in the North do not receive their boosters at the same speed as people in the South.  We need to respond to the people in the North.  They are as much a part of our island and our country as anybody else.  If we get our booster programme done, we should step in and assist people in the North as well.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to welcome some of the Government Deputies but they have gone again.  Last week when we were in committee they did not stay in the Chamber for their slots and we missed ours.  In the new year, it would be good if Government Deputies would stick around for the Thursday evening slots.</p><p>Throughout this pandemic I have raised on a number of occasions the fact that people who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 have slipped through the net <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the supports they need and what they actually get.  Another case has come to my attention this week concerning a young man who has muscular dystrophy.  He lives in the same house as his parents who provide care for him both day and night.  This young man has his own quarters and lives as independently as possible but Covid has brought particular challenges to the house.</p><p>Stephen emailed me recently to say that he had applied for home care hours from the HSE.  He was awarded one hour per week of home help and two hours per week from the local independent living centre.  Stephen and his family were told by the HSE that they would get more home care hours but then that was rolled back on because of shortages of healthcare workers in the south east.  Effectively, through broken promises he had hours that had never been given to him cut back.  He worries for his parents and is fearful of what would happen if something were to happen to them.  Those fears became a reality this week when his parents contracted Covid-19.  He emailed me to tell me that he is now confined to his room to avoid contracting the virus.  For his own safety, he and his parents are trying to cut down their interactions with each other, save for essential care like the use of his respiratory machines and so on.  The situation is by no means ideal.  Stephen is worried about his parents and they are concerned for him.  When they asked the public health nurse about the possibility of further home help hours they were told that Covid would prevent home carers from coming in anyway.  They have had no HSE care for two weeks.  Stephen has his own quarters in the house which are accessed by a separate, outside door so anybody providing care to him would not need to go into the part of the house that his parents are in.  They are now left in a situation where Stephen's ill parents are doing everything they can for him while also taking every possible measure to limit their contact with him.  They have been left with no choice but he is worried for them.  He is increasingly isolated and his parents are very stressed, ill and worried for him.  They have no choice but to continue what they are doing.</p><p>Vulnerable people are slipping through the net because the health service is not meeting their needs.  This was true before Covid but it is especially so since the virus has presented itself.</p></speech>

We just need to ensure that we have adequate testing capacity.  We know what can be done and we know what needs to be done.  The same goes for HEPA filtration in schools.  Whatever streamlining is necessary just needs to be done.</p><p>We all know the difficulties we are facing at the minute with Omicron.  While we do not know the full scale of what we will be dealing with, none of it is particularly good.  We know that boosters are the way to go but we need to deal with issue of recording the fact that people have received boosters.  We have had multiple teething problems rather late in the day.  In my own constituency there were issues with Fairways Hotel vaccination centre.  A number of people called to my office who had checked the system, heard reports on the media and understood that the centre was dealing with those over 50.  That changed and the centre was only dealing with those over 60.  In fairness, these people accepted that and were willing to move along with the system but we need to deal with these anomalies.  We need to address the fact that GPs are operating a slightly different system from the one operating in pharmacies.  We know that we need to maximise capacity and get it done.</p><p>It goes without saying that at a European level, we need the European Union to stop stalling <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>vaccine inequity and enacting a TRIPS waiver.  We must play our part and call it out for what it is.  We need to have decency and integrity at an international level.  Beyond that, it is in our own self-interest because none of us is safe until all of us are safe.</p><p>I would like an update on the most recent cyberattack on the Coombe hospital.  I do not have all the details but I believe the hospital is operating.  We all know of the difficulties we have had in terms of cybersecurity, with a report published this week on weaknesses in the HSE.  The National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, has a plan to upgrade its resources which is absolutely necessary.  There has been much engagement on this but we need to do absolutely everything we can here because it looks like ransomware and cyberattacks are a pandemic that will be with us for a long time to come.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her engagement on Sruth&aacute;n House and necessary respite.  </p>  <p>I hope there will be a solution on that. <br/><br/>The HIQA report shows that we still have serious issues around homecare.  I know she is doing her upmost but we need to expedite it so that we can provide the resources and services that families need.<br/><br/>I wish the Minister of State a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

I will start on a positive note because we have to be positive during the ongoing pandemic.  Hospitalisations and ICU admissions have plateaued or fallen.  That is a good indication of the direction of things.  So far, so good.  However, there are dark clouds on the horizon.  You only have to look at Britain where the cases are going through the roof.  Britain is probably two to three weeks ahead of us with its booster campaign.  The indications are that we could be facing an extremely difficult four to six weeks of infections.  Hopefully that will not translate to hospitalisations or ICU admissions.  If it does we will have a different situation on our hands.</p>  <p>  The booster campaign has been very successful but people queuing for four or five hours is not conducive to creating the spirit we had before.  People will just not go.  That needs to be ironed out.  The ongoing public health emergency has been extremely challenging.  This is something that our public health services have never seen before.  We all have friends who work in hospitals.  The environment they have to work in is beyond traumatic.  We have said many times, we have huge gratitude for those who are protecting us and our loved ones.  There are signs that Omicron is overtaking Delta.  It seems much more infectious.</p>  <p>  I have two criticisms.  The first is not an abstract matter.  The TRIPS waiver is a mechanism that provides equitable access to vaccines for those who have not had access.  For the EU to block that is shameful.  If you cannot do it now when can you do it?  Italy and Portugal have unilaterally supported the TRIPS waiver but Ireland has not.  If I was a conspiracy theorist I might ask why that was the case.  Is it because there are so many multinational pharmaceutical companies in this country?  Maybe the Minister of State could answer that.  The Seanad passed a motion on the TRIPS waiver yesterday.  Ireland has to step up and say that we stand with countries across the world which need access to vaccines.</p>  <p>  On ventilation, I welcome the Government's allocation of &euro;62 million to improve ventilation but it is late to the table.  This should have been done over a year ago.  Ventilation is crucial and HEPA filters have been proven to be really good.</p>  <p>  This is not easy by any means.  Regardless of who you are, the colour of your politics or what Government is in office, the difficulties are huge.  We wish everyone in the health service the best.</p></speech>

On Tuesday Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization said that the sheer weight of numbers with the Omicron cases will put hospitals under pressure internationally.  This morning Dr. Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical advisor, told the House of Commons health committee that the R value of the Omicron variant could be as high as five, making it four times as transmissible as Delta.  By today it will be the dominant strain in London.  Public health experts have not ruled out 1 million cases per day by the end of the year for the UK.</p>  <p>  Here in Ireland Omicron has increased from 1% of total cases at the start of last week to 27% of new cases now.  The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that it may be, and I think it will be, the dominant strain by next week or sooner.  Even if Omicron proves to be a less severe strain than Delta, and I hope it does although that has not yet been proven, the sheer weight of numbers, as Mike Ryan put it, will most likely put unprecedented pressure on hospitals in the new year.  Will there be more pressure on the hospitals than in January 2021?  It is possible.  The hospital system did not collapse under the strain last January, thanks largely to the efforts of our healthcare workforce, but it was a close run thing.  The Minister of State cannot give a guarantee that our hospital system will stand the strain this time.  No doubt the Minister of State will point to how 30% of private beds can be accessed under the deal.  The deal was a 12-year deal.  It was signed on 8 January last year.  When will that deal be extended?  Does it run out on 8 January?  In any case, the Minister of State cannot give a guarantee that 30% extra would be enough.  There should be no risks taken.  All the hospital capacity in the State should be available to the State.  The Government should nationalise the private hospitals and put all their resources at the service of the public health effort.  Public health must come before private profit.</p>  <p>  Professor Christine Loscher was right.  The schools should be closed tomorrow.  They should not open next Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.  Primary schools are the No. 1 location for the spread of the virus.  How many school goers might contract Covid over those three days next week?  Is it hundreds?  Is it thousands?  They will be mixing with parents, grandparents and other generations over Christmas.  It is not a case of keeping the nerve, as the Taoiseach says.  It is a case of using common sense.  Keeping the schools open next week is reckless.  They should close tomorrow.</p></speech>

That is clear.  It will probably be when schools return in January.  Last night, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly warned that it was entirely possible that the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variants meant that the number of Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations could exceed the spike of last January.  Once the children take their Christmas holidays next week, are plans being made for 2022?  I welcome the funding from the Minister for Education for HEPA filters.  It is crucial that the funding is there and I thank her for that.  Some 1.7 million people will have their booster doses by Christmas.  The boosters will increase protection against severe outcome from Delta and possibly from Omicron.  The incidence of Covid-19 among those aged five to 11 years is falling now.</p>  <p>  Omicron is expected to be the dominant strain in Ireland next week.  That is how rapid it is.  It doubles infection every two or three days.  The Irish public have come with us in this pandemic.  If you give them the plan they put on the green jersey and do what they are asked for the greater good. </p>  <p>  Are there plans to increase health care capacity to treat the expected higher numbers of cases?  Have we staff on standby for testing and tracing?  What are the plans for the vaccine certificate?  Are we going to follow France and declare invalid vaccine certificates where the person has not had a booster?  Will there be a renewal process for certificates?  Will new vaccine certificates be put in place?  There were some difficulties with the system at first.  I have encountered many cases where people were vaccinated but were repeatedly offered appointments.  That glitch ended up costing them when they went to get their certificate and it took a long time for the issue to be fixed.</p>  <p>  The ramping up of the booster campaign is welcome.  However, I am concerned when I hear that GPs are being instructed to prioritise booster clinics over routine care because in my area, it has been hard to get doctor appointments.  I understand that we have to do this but we should be mindful of those who need other care.  People still need to see the doctor for other things and that should be taken into consideration.</p> <p>I also wish to acknowledge that we have had a really successful vaccine roll-out.  It was probably one of the best in the world.  Now we are giving out the booster dose.  I am hoping to go the nearest clinic to me tomorrow to get mine.  I encourage people to get their booster because it is important.  We must all be mindful of everyone else.  My own mother is nearly 87 years of age and I am working with people all the time.  It is important that all of us, if we can, go down and get our booster because there is a booster vaccine centre near all of us.  I encourage people to go.</p> <p> It is also important to recognise all our front-line workers.  This year has been another exceptionally hard one for people.  We have had all the different variants of Covid.  Nobody is expecting these because we seem to be going from day to day.  None of us want to be here again asking what is going to happen next.  However, from knowing the Minister and Ministers of State, I know how hard they have all been working in the background.  I know how hard it is with this disease that is changing constantly and I know the work that goes on.  It is important to acknowledge the work the Minister and Ministers of State are doing.  I would say this has been a very hard year for the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and all the Ministers of State.  I wish everyone a really happy Christmas and a lovely new year.  Again, we do not know what is happening in the new year.  We do not know what is facing any of us.  We do not know what challenges we will have.  All we can do is be there, support each other, support our communities, work with people and work with our Government.  All of us can solve this by working together and not by finding faults.  I am not saying there have not been mistakes.  As the Minister and Ministers of State will tell you, I will always say it when there is an issue somewhere.  I constantly address these issues, especially those to do with my own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  I can honestly say, as someone who, like all of us, works so hard to represent the people of my own constituency, that the amount of work that goes on in the background must be acknowledged.  Again, I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a happy new year.</p></speech>

I too join other Deputies in wishing the Ceann Comhairle and all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas a very happy, peaceful and indeed healthy Christmas.  It has been a very challenging year for the House and its Members.  I thank all the staff for their patience and assistance during that time.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the Covid-19 situation.  Who thought we would be discussing the pandemic at a second Christmas?  We thought over the last couple of months that things were changing but we need only look at the epidemiological forecast.  It looks extremely challenging, especially if we look across the water.  It is likely we are facing a very significant wave of infection generated by the Omicron variant.  Initial evidence suggests Omicron infections can be milder to vaccinated people but it seems to be significantly more transmissible.  The situation in London is an indication of what we could be facing here.  We are in a race against time to ensure as many people as possible are offered a third vaccination before Omicron becomes more established here.  The national effort being deployed and the news today that additional resources are being deployed are exceptionally welcome.  I also welcome the news that the HSE centres will have extended opening hours and that we are on track to administer at least 300,000 vaccinations in the next week.  I pay tribute to all the front-line staff, pharmacists and GPs working on the national effort to administer as many third doses of the vaccine as possible.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to raise the issue of people who received the one-shot Jansen vaccine.  Many of them took it quite some time ago and evidence suggests immunity is waning.  Many of them have contacted me and are asking that they be permitted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  While there may be a very challenging few weeks ahead, we know there is cause for hope as the antiviral medications are coming on stream.  Hopefully, those combined with the boosters will ease the incidence of very serious infection.</p>  <p>  Just as I paid tribute to the front-line workers, it is also important to pay tribute to teachers and school staff because they have put in so much work to ensure students are safe and to reduce infection in those situations.</p>  <p>  Last of all, I pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle and his colleagues in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank him for his assistance during the year and wish him and his family a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

Keeping schools open and functioning well is so vital.  The latter aspect is important; it is not just about them being open but that they are functioning well.  Now, over the Christmas period, is our chance to get that right and ensure children are returning to school buildings in January with all the mitigation measures necessary to allow schools to reopen, stay open and function well.  We need to throw the kitchen sink at this.  There can be no necessary expense spared.  In truth, that has not happened.  The Government has been dragging its heels on some of the issues.  There is no question about that, in my mind.  This is far too important to get wrong.</p>  <p>  HEPA air filtration systems have a vital role to play in our schools.  I am glad the Government is finally coming to acknowledge this and at least conceding to the principle of it.  However, the way it has been announced is not practicable, workable and will not deliver the results we need it to.  Doing it under the cloak of the minor works grant is incredibly inefficient.  Firstly, it puts these filtration systems in competition with other desperately needed projects within a school, and that is wrong, especially at a time when school budgets are already overstretched.  It is putting filters in competition with broken windows, doors, gutters or whatever other items are badly needed.  This is at a time when kids are freezing in their classrooms with the windows open.  Schools need every support they can get and they do not need to be in a position whereby they are deciding between HEPA air filtration systems and replacing the window.</p>  <p>  The work involved is massive.  In the last week of term, the Department of Education has dropped one final Christmas present of significant additional administration on the desks of school leaders and principals - and it is not that they have been short of it.  They are already handling a substitution crisis and doing contact tracing, which is something I will come back to.  The scientific jargon in guidance documents provided by the Department is like another language.  An expert in the area might know what to buy in a minute but for principals, this is taking up a significant amount of their time this week and it will do so into next week.  There are formulas on square footage, what is necessary and all this kind of stuff.  These are principals who are stretched to the pin of their collar, to be honest.  The least the Department could have done would have been to provide access to expert advice and support for principals that stated in plain English what they need to buy and where they can buy it.  It would be much more sensible and logical to procure these filters centrally and distribute them by need.  This has been done by the Department of Education and many others in relation to Covid-related expenses.  I do not understand why the Department has not done this.  I expect it would be more cost-effective and would certainly involve less administration for schools.  The Department has shifted the burden onto school leaders, who are already under incredible pressure.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise contact tracing again.  As far as I am concerned, it is a public health function and should be led by public health.  The Opposition and many school leaders fought for school-specific contact tracing teams.  When that happened at the start of the year I believed they were a step forward.  They were largely successful.  Then in September, out of nowhere and even though we were dealing with new variants, these teams were taken away.  In fact, any and all contact tracing was effectively taken away and it is fair to say we are paying the price for that now.  When schools ring the HSE, they cannot get through to tracers and cannot get a call back.  The new plan for contact tracing again passed the buck onto school leaders.  There seems to be very little that the Department feels it or the HSE would be better off doing.  Instead it feels it would be better if the principal or the board of management did it.</p>  <p>  School communities feel as if they have been taken for fools and asked to believe transmission does not occur in schools.  There are some concessions on that now, I think, but ultimately the resources that should follow have not arrived.  Let us not operate on the basis schools that are immune but acknowledge that Covid can enter schools and that schools are important.  That is the point.  It is not that they are inherently safer than anywhere but that they are important.  They are crucial.  They are crucial to our children and to our society.  Thus, we need to throw the kitchen sink at them and do everything we can.  We must put in every measure needed to ensure that schools reopen in full in January, that they do so safely and that they can function well.</p>  <p>  I would like to make an additional point, as this is my last speech.  The Minister of State is aware of the case of Calum Geary.  He is entering 2022 still denied access to an education, as is his right, with a sign language interpreter.  </p> <p>I urge the Minister not to allow another year to go by where deaf children like Calum continue to be denied an education.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600039#PP00200"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute.  As we all know, we had our first official case of Covid-19 in Ireland in February 2020, almost 22 months ago.  It is fair to say that, since that date, we in this country and everyone throughout the world have endured a very difficult period.  So many people have suffered and continue to suffer.  The many thousands of people who have contracted Covid-19 and are still feeling the effects of long Covid continue to struggle with their day-to-day lives.</p>  <p>  In the past, I have supported the efforts of the Government in tackling this crisis.  Unlike others, there is no point in trying to make political gain from this situation, but the simple truth is that people have grown very weary and tired.  The public messaging, especially in the past number of weeks, is very confusing and is adding to the frustration of people and the business community.  The Omicron variant is the latest battle in this war against Covid.  It remains to be seen how this will to affect us all moving forward.  On the one hand, we have advice stating that this will be the worst variant to date, while other advice states that it is much milder than previous variants.  All this advice is coming from what is termed "expert opinion".  I can understand why the public has grown tired and weary at this stage.</p>  <p>  I call on the Government to make its messaging much clearer.  Surely, it is not hard to outline a plan, including what parameters are being used and what actions we need to take, to ensure that society remains open.  The business community is screaming out for this.  At this point in time, the hospitality sector is unaware whether it will be open during the festive season.  It is now 16 December and a whole sector is still in limbo.  I understand that we are dealing with unknowns, but we need a rock-solid plan to get out of this situation.  It is clear from previous occasions that simply locking down society is not the answer.  All it does is put the brakes on this virus for a period.  Once society opens up again, the virus again takes hold. </p>  <p>  What most people cannot understand is that we have all been told that vaccinations will get us out of this situation.  We have one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, yet we are still in a very difficult situation.  Are we any better off than this time last year?  Moving forward, my big fear is that we are facing a crisis in another area, namely, cancer.  I am concerned about it because it is very important that cancer is detected at an early stage.  I hope that I am wrong on this occasion, but I fear we are heading towards a real crisis with this issue.  How many people have missed vital appointments, scans and check-ups as a result of Covid?  How will this affect them in the future?  The waiting lists are off the charts now.  Who will get on top of this plan?  People are very worried and concerned.</p>  <p>  I spoke earlier the week in a debate on private health insurance and the fact that we need private hospitals to tackle the backlog and the waiting lists.  Why is this not being openly discussed?  During that debate, we discussed giving private health insurers additional scope for profit margins.  We should be discussing how they can help the system reduce waiting lists.  Some 46% of the population have health cover but what about the other 54% that do not?</p>  <p>  My biggest disappointment during this crisis is the fact that, despite the additional millions of euro being invested in the health system, very few additional ICU beds were put into operation.  We were all told that the main reason for the lockdown measures was to reduce the pressure on the health services, especially ICUs.  It would be interesting to know how many additional and fully functioning ICU beds were created from the millions of euro in additional funding that was pumped into the health system.</p>  <p>  It is only right and proper that we acknowledge the great work being carried out by school principals, teaching staff, SNAs and all other staff in keeping schools fully functioning.  The school system has performed brilliantly and continues to do so, but having spoken to several school principals there is a sense that more could be done.  At times, school principals feel that they are not getting the most up-to-date support or that messages are mixed.</p>  <p>  One area that needs to be addressed is the use of HEPA filters in classrooms.  They are used successfully in many other countries throughout Europe.  We unfortunately have a situation in many schools where windows are being kept open resulting in freezing cold temperatures in the classroom.  Children are trying to do schoolwork in freezing conditions and with their coats on.  This is not the environment we want our children taught in.  What is the policy on HEPA filters?  Why are they not pushed more in this country as they are in other European countries?  Again, this is another area where public health and Government advice is not clear.  Surely, if filters can be used to monitor a classroom and allow windows to be kept closed in the depths of winter, then they should be deployed.  Why are they not being deployed?</p>  <p>  I will once more reiterate the point that I will support the Government in these measures.  It is very important that it tackles the virus, that clear measures are taken and that people know what is happening.  I will not support continuous lockdowns because they have not worked in the past and will not work in the future.  We need a plan to live with this situation.  Society cannot be continually locked down.  This is the equivalent of putting a small plaster on a gaping wound.  It simply does not work.</p>  <p>  I urge the Government to look again at the effectiveness of HEPA filters in schools and why they are not being actively used.  The bottom line is that we need a plan that will work long term and not just as a stopgap.  It is very important that we look after the health of our citizens and the education of our children.  A lot more can be done that we are just not doing.  Why are we not using the private hospitals that we spent millions of euro on during the past 22 months to help cancer patients and others?  There was talk that the Government was thinking about buying some of these hospitals.  People will respect the Government if it makes a decision.  Ireland is known to be a very intelligent country.  Maybe it is time we got some external people in to give a little advice, such as real businessmen and entrepreneurs.  They seem to be travelling around the world getting massive money for public speaking in other countries.  Why can we not ask them to give us the help in Ireland?</p>  <p>  We all had our ups and downs over the past 12 months, but the Ceann Comhairle is always fair and I appreciate his guidance.  In fairness, he kept the House going during 2021.  I wish him, his staff, all my colleagues in Leinster House and everybody else a happy Christmas and a happy new year.</p>  <p>  The people of Ireland have sacrificed a lot over the past 22 months.  A clap on the back is not good enough.  As a father and grandfather, I would like to know that when my grandchildren go to school on a Monday morning they are protected.  The amount of we borrowed and have invested is not in the thousands, hundreds or millions but billions of euro.  Have we moved any further in the past 22 months?  It can be very frustrating and annoying.  As I said in the Chamber two weeks ago, I am very annoyed that I can walk down a street in Dundalk or Drogheda and everybody seems to ask me what is going on.  Nobody seems to know what is going on.  I ask the Minister of State to be open and upfront.  The Irish people can take it on the chin.  I ask her to try to be honest and let us try to get the work done.  As I said, I have supported this Government since the coalition came into office nearly two years ago and will continue to do so.  It is a tough job, but we just need to make the right decisions and protect the citizens of Ireland. </p></speech>

I wish them all, and their families, a happy and peaceful Christmas.</p>  <p>  I will concentrate on this afternoon's announcement by the Minister for Health that we will expedite the roll-out of the vaccine by opening vaccination centres for longer hours, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., which is very welcome.  I have two provisos from a Limerick perspective.  First, I am conscious that health staff are exhausted at present because of their long hours.  I was very lucky and privileged to get my third Moderna vaccine shot in Scoil Carmel on O'Connell Avenue in Limerick city last Saturday morning.  Staff there were highly efficient, courteous and professional.  I could not speak highly enough of the service the staff rolled out.  Scoil Carmel is in the city centre and does not have the same capacity as the vaccination centre at Limerick Racecourse.</p> <p>It is against a backdrop where it is being rolled out exponentially by the GPs and pharmacists.  Is the Minister satisfied there is sufficient capacity in Scoil Carmel to ensure the roll-out of the vaccine at speed?  We are trying to get ahead of Omicron.  It was 14% a day or two ago; it is now 27% and escalating at a rapid rate.  To get ahead of it, we need resources.  That is about personnel and capacity in vaccination centres.  Is the Minister satisfied there is sufficient capacity at Scoil Carmel, in addition to the GPs and pharmacies, to ensure we get the vaccine out as quickly as possible?</p> <p> We are coming into the Christmas period.  If we are opening from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., we must set out clearly to the public when the centres are open.  I noticed it will be a combination of walk-ins and appointments.  It needs to be rolled out by the HSE, if it has not already done so, as to how it will work over the Christmas and new year period.  Everyone wants to work to get ahead of the Omicron variant but HSE staff have been under constant pressure for a long time.  Capacity at Scoil Carmel is not the same as at Limerick Racecourse.  We need a plan and to explain to the public how to get appointments and what the walk-in clinics will be, spelled out down to the days of the week.  I acknowledge that the roll-out of the most recent vaccination programme by the HSE in the mid-west has been excellent.  There are no complaints.  It is operated in an efficient manner.</p> <p> The main thing at the moment is whether we will have sufficient personnel.  We should be conscious that people will need time off with their families over Christmas, that the capacity at Scoil Carmel is not as high as that at Limerick Racecourse and that the public must be fully aware of how it will operate over Christmas.  It looks as if, from listening to the experts, this Omicron variant is more virulent than Delta or any of the others.  It is creeping through the community at an unmerciful and rapid rate.  We must get ahead of it.  The right decision is being made by Government.  We must have the capacity and personnel but we are coming into the Christmas period and I am conscious of the human toll on HSE staff giving vaccinations and on GPs and pharmacists and their staff.</p> <p> We need a roll-out programme.  What I want to see over the coming days, if it is not already in place, is 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., how people can get appointments, where the walk-ins are, where the capacity will be and, if there is a need for additional capacity, how we can upscale faster so that when we come to new year, we are ahead of the Omicron variant.  It is not easy but it is extremely important that we do it. </p></speech>

We have learned more about the Greek alphabet than any of us cared to learn and the sooner we forget it the better.  People in the healthcare system are exhausted, as are those in the education system.  I will stick to the education system, which is what I know best.  That is not to say I do not acknowledge the work of our front-line healthcare workers.</p>  <p>  They are exhausted from the daily in-and-out of dealing with Covid and from the low level anxiety we are all experiencing but which is doubly potent when you are in a classroom of 30-odd children.  You have low level worry about your own health and that of the people around you, the teachers in the classroom and the special needs assistants are the same.  I spoke to my school secretary recently about the number of phone calls she has to make to harass parents who have to find their way in because their children have the sniffles or whatever else.  That all factors in and keys in.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said on the huge extra burden placed on principals this year.  Deputy Cullinane said governments must acknowledge when they get it wrong but Opposition must acknowledge when we get it right.  The vaccination rate in Ireland is among the best in the world.  I disagree slightly on HEPA filters.  I think the minor works scheme is the way to do it because principals are used to using it.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on streamlining the advice because we cannot expect principals to be ventilation experts.  Principals are used to the minor works scheme format and it is a good way of getting it to them.</p>  <p>  It is affecting the way people teach at this time of year.  This is usually a joyous time of year in teaching.  Everybody is crammed in for the Christmas concert, play or whatever else.  Unfortunately, we have had to atomise our children out in a way that does not come naturally to people who choose to teach in a primary school.</p>  <p>  Masking of third to sixth class children was difficult to bring in.  It goes contrary to what I would like to be doing with my children but the children have taken to it.  There is no problem.  My boy is heading in with his mask on and is used to it. </p>  <p>  We have reacted as best we can to the substitute shortage.  It is extremely difficult as there is a straight-up staffing problem in getting enough substitute teachers in place.</p>  <p>  I reiterate a suggestion Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made earlier and there was not a Minister for Education in the House to hear it.  He suggested schools should be used for vaccination sites at primary level.  That is a great idea because we do it already.  There are other injections that children get in schools.  It would minimise disruption for parents and teachers.  The teachers would be well able to manage getting the kids in and out.  That suggestion has merit and should be looked at.</p>  <p>  We have to look to the medium term.  First and foremost, we have to make an early decision on leaving certificate 2022.  The students of that cohort deserve as early a decision as we can give them.  Their schooling has been so disrupted over recent years.  The sooner we can give them certainty about whether they will sit a physical exam or have a blended exam like last year, the better for their mental health as much as anything else.</p>  <p>  Much of the good work being done in education is being masked by Covid at the minute.  Good progress has been made on the pupil-teacher ratio over the last two budgets.  The CLASS scheme, which the Minister of State introduced, has great potential but has been hamstrung by the fact that many special educational needs, SEN, teachers are being drafted in to provide substitute cover.  We have to look to remediate the disruption in education, particularly for children who are vulnerable in terms of additional needs or socio-economic factors.  Damage has been done to the education of our children.  Hopefully, as we begin to move beyond this pandemic, we need to look to how we remediate it.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, we need to trust our teachers.  The reason our education system has performed so well, despite chronic underinvestment over a long period, is we still attract good people into teaching.  It is a valued profession and we must continue to trust it.  There has been an erosion of that, which should be rowed back.  We need to invest in our education system, in our children and their well-being and in the physical fabric in which we educate, that is, the school buildings.</p>  <p>  We need to prioritise the citizens' assembly on education and make sure we are looking at an education system that is fit for purpose.  The senior cycle review is important in that.</p>  <p>  In the much broader scope, as we move beyond this pandemic, we need to re-examine the social contract across education, health and society.  Since the general election in February 2020, there has been a massive expansion in the State and there needed to be.  It was shown that the market was not going to respond or look after people during a global pandemic.  As we move beyond this pandemic, we need to re-examine and revise that social contract and define what we feel the role of the State is in the life of the nation.</p></speech>

I hope 2022 will bring better times for all of us.</p>  <p>  Today we are speaking of Covid-19 and its impact.  Every person I speak to is concerned about the impact on our hospitals and our ICUs.  People are concerned that our health services will become overwhelmed with Covid patients.  While we know that the number of patients becoming infected with Covid-19 in Ireland in the fourth wave, which we are in the middle of now, is higher than at any point other than last January and February during the third wave, we also know that the number of people in hospitals and ICUs is significantly lower.  That is positive.  However, what Covid has done is expose many of the weaknesses in our hospital system.  Ireland, with 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population, is far below the OECD average of 4.4.  We also know that Ireland has 5.2 adult ICU beds per 100,000 population, compared with the OECD average of 14.1.  I know those are 2019 figures and we have improved somewhat but we are still below those averages.  Those failings in our hospital system have been exposed.</p>  <p>  We are now at a critical juncture because of the highly infectious Omicron variant and many people are concerned about what may happen in our hospitals in January and February.  We need to look today at contingency plans for all our hospitals.  We need, in particular, to look to those hospitals that are already at crisis point.  Before I came to the Chamber, I visited one or two websites.  I looked at the Irish Patients Association website, which monitors the most overcrowded hospitals.  Two of the top three were in the north west, namely, Letterkenny University Hospital and Sligo University Hospital.  Letterkenny hospital is in second place and the Sligo hospital is in third place, with 166 patients on trolleys for the week ending 10 December.  That did not only happen that week.  I will give the Minister of State further figures to show this is an issue that has been escalating.  If we consider the top five most overcrowded hospitals in the ten weeks before 10 December, Sligo University Hospital features six times on that list.  I had a quick look to ensure this did not happen only in recent months or was primarily driven by Covid-19.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, provides figures through Trolley Watch, and I thank it for them.  According to the annual figures, in 2006, there were 784 people on trolleys in Sligo University Hospital.  Those numbers have continued to grow, year on year.  In 2012, there were more than 2,000 people on trolleys.  To the end of November this year, there were 3,852 people on trolleys.  We will exceed 4,000 this year.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that we are not just looking at figures; we are also looking at the trauma and pain that patients experience and the unrelenting pressure on staff.  We know that excess deaths occur as a result of overcrowding and waiting.</p>  <p>  A few weeks ago, an INMO protest at Sligo University Hospital was averted at the very last minute.  On that particular day, there were 25 patients waiting for a bed, the third highest total in the country.  I raised the issue with the Taoiseach, who told me that extended financial provision had been given to hospitals, and I accept that.  The truth is that is simply not enough for the hospital.  Two and a half weeks ago, he stated: "I will ask the HSE to focus specifically on Sligo to determine how we can help further and alleviate pressure there in the next while."  I do not know what has happened in the two and a half weeks since he promised that the HSE would further support the hospital.  All I can say is that I am getting more emails and Facebook messages about the chronic overcrowding there.  I received another two messages earlier from people who were in the emergency department over the past few days.  One woman told me it is beyond dangerous.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that all hospitals need support but those hospitals in the most difficult position now and that consistently have the greatest numbers of patients on trolleys must be prioritised.  I know there is no magic wand and I am happy that the Government has had a lot of success dealing with Covid and with the vaccination programme, etc.  However, our hospitals are now in a very dangerous situation.  Where hospitals require specific support, as is the case for Sligo University Hospital and Letterkenny University Hospital, I ask the Minister of State to look at providing that support over the coming weeks, like the Taoiseach promised.</p></speech>

We now have a vaccine that has worked quite effectively.  It is stopping infection and death in the country.  No one ever said it was going to stop infection, and that should be clearly pointed out.  We also have a Covid savvy population.  Even before the call came from NPHET, people were making the decision not to mix as they had planned to in the run-up to Christmas.  They made decisions to try to protect their families over the Christmas period.  I hope the same situation as last year will not come to pass.</p>  <p>  I also salute the workers on the front line across the board, particularly our healthcare workers who are at the coalface in hospitals and ICUs.  The next couple of weeks and months are going to be a difficult period for those workers.  </p>  <p>  I raise the urgency of the need for a response and to build up the booster programme, and access to it.  On 29 November, the Canal Communities Local Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Force discussed the issue of the booster vaccination programme at a meeting.  I had attended the Citywest vaccination centre at 8 a.m. that day.  I was a walk-in patient because I had not received an appointment from the HSE.  I am 60 and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, so I was expecting a booster shot a bit earlier.  I was feeling anxious and went to the vaccination centre.  I queued, along with all the other walk-ins.  They were 60-year-olds, some on walking sticks and others in pushchairs.  Some of them were very healthy and seemed grand.  We queued for two hours in the cold and damp in the marquee outside.  When we got inside, we were another hour queuing.  It was quite chaotic.  That has happened subsequently in Croke Park, Swords and other vaccination centres over the past two weeks.</p>  <p>  After their discussion, the members of the canal communities task force said we have to get these boosters into people's arms as quickly as possible.  They wrote a letter to the Minister for Health on that matter on 29 November.  The letter stated succinctly that a motion was passed to ask the Minister to provide the booster vaccine in local communities through whatever means possible, such as primary healthcare centres, GP surgeries and community centres, and through organisations such as Safetynet.  The task force asked the Minister to do it as a matter of the utmost urgency in the interest of public health.  The activists in the task force felt, after discussion, there was a need to send this letter to the Minister.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and I also signed the letter, as members of the task force.</p> <p>The two key words in it were &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  I even checked last week and only four pharmacies in our area were doing the booster programme.  One of those contacted said it was not going to get any of the boosters until January and the other three were full.</p> <p> I was also quite concerned that last week, up to 8 December, only 34% of 60 to 69-year-olds were boosted with their third vaccine.  Obviously, that has increased in the last eight days but that was a huge concern.  I believe that if access was more local, it would be taken up much quicker.  The Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days.  It will be the dominant variant in the next week or two.  Does the Minister of State feel that 300,000 vaccinations per week is sufficient?  I worked out that would mean it would take at least eight to nine weeks to cover the next 2.4 million people who need that vaccine very quickly.  In the meantime, the Omicron variant is developing and could have a big impact on our hospital care beds and ICU units.  That is a big concern.</p> <p> Looking quickly at where we have the vaccines at the moment, GPs were doing approximately 75,000 to 85,000 per week.  Dr. Mary Favier said on the radio yesterday that could easily be doubled on the basis of what we are doing now with more GP practises involved in it.  They could, therefore, be reaching 150,000 to 170,000 per week over the next number of weeks.</p> <p> Mr. Jack Shanahan from the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, said yesterday that not as many pharmacies are involved in the vaccine programme as there was in the summer when they were doing 50,000 per week.  He said if there is a will and the supplies are there, there is a capacity to do 80,000 to 90,000.  Therefore, between GPs and pharmacies, we are talking about 240,000 to 260,000 vaccines per week.  I did not know that dentists had become involved.  Although dentists seem to be involved in it now, I do not know how they will meet that.  Then, we are really looking at the vaccination centres, pop-up centres and SafetyNet playing a role in backing up 240,000 to 260,000 vaccines.  The vaccination centres are doing 200,000 at the moment anyway.  We are talking about bringing in the Army as extra vaccinators.  We should be targeting up to 500,000 per week.  We would then have everybody vaccinated within the next five weeks.  In the meantime, Omicron is developing.  I raise that question because I believe it will be a serious issue if we leave it for eight weeks to get everyone vaccinated, and that is not including our five to 12-year-olds.</p> <p> The other point I will make is about the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, which was discussed last night in the Seanad.  The motion, which was supported, called on our Government to support the TRIPS waiver of the WTO and push the European Commission to support it.  The fact that the Government withdrew its own countermotion means that it should be supporting that.</p></speech>

It is very positive that he is well and thank God for that.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who was here earlier, also recovered from Covid-19, as did a number of other Senators and Deputies.  None of us in this House, therefore, including staff, are immune to suffering the effects of Covid-19.  We are all human beings at the end of day.  I wish the Ceann Comhairle well and hope he has a very peaceful, safe and happy Christmas.  I thank all the staff in the Oireachtas for the incredible work they do.  There is huge pressure on all of us during this pandemic.  My colleagues are also under pressure in their respective constituencies and receive representations on a daily basis all the time.</p>  <p>  Specifically, with regard to special education, one of the main concerns I had with this pandemic is the risk of regression for children with additional needs.  It  is a very real concern.  There was regression because children with additional needs learn best in person.  Remote learning is just not ideal for them.  It is extremely difficult for them.  We will move mountains to make sure the schools reopen in the new year, particularly for children with special educational needs, SEN, in special schools and classes and in mainstream classes.</p>  <p>  In terms of regression, one of the first things we put in place was the supplementary scheme back in February at a cost of &euro;10 million.  That helped approximately 14,000 children receive additional targeted hours during that period of time.  We also expanded the summer provision for the very first time so the whole of the school community - all 4,000 schools - were eligible to apply.  Some 81,000 children were eligible.  We doubled the spend on it and increased the funding to &euro;40 million this year, and more than 24,000 children availed of it.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh mentioned the Covid-19 learning and support scheme, CLASS, earlier.  We put a significant amount of funding, &euro;52.6 million, into that.  That is a total amount of more than &euro;100 million to support these children.  The CLASS is not just for children with additional needs but also children going to Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools and perhaps children who have not availed any sort of support within the school education system before.  Some children were affected in terms of their mental health by anxiety, concern around socialisation or whatever it is.  We left it to the discretion of the principals and school community to look after them.</p>  <p>  I thank school community, as I am sure the Minister, Deputy Foley, did earlier.  I commend the principals, secretaries, school staff and SNAs.  We have 19,000 SNAs in the country doing incredible work, serving the very intimate needs of children with additional needs, particularly in the special schools.  Out of 126 special schools, three to four of them are quasi-medical.  An SNA needs to give a huge amount of care to these children in those circumstances and in very challenging times.</p>  <p>  It was mentioned earlier that many in the school community and the health services, as Deputy Collins said, are exhausted.  We are all exhausted.  Everybody is tired and this pandemic is very trying for everybody, but particularly those at the front line.  I assure this House today that all the contributions made by all the Deputies will be brought back to the Ministers, Deputies Donnelly and Foley, and, indeed, to Ministers of State such as myself.  No stone will be left unturned to make sure we look after both education and health insofar as we can.</p>  <p>  Funding is important, and &euro;600 million in total has gone to the school community.  There is no point giving funding if it is not going to the right place, however.  It is important that we, as line Ministers, ensure that the money goes to where it should be going and not down into empty void.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and wish everyone a very happy Christmas.</p></speech>

It has not been moved.  It is a massive blight on the area of Ballycotten.  We pride ourselves on the coastal area.  It is also a health and safety issue that has been ongoing since last February and has not been addressed.  I spoke to the landowner and contacted the Minister's Department last year.</p> <p>A contractor would have gone down and removed the ship, with the permission of the landowner, but that was ignored.  I have come back here again at the end of the year, unfortunately.  I have read the report on the <i>MV Alta</i>by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB.  While I have read that, I have come across statements on the report by a barrister in which he stated &quot;The Marine Casualty Investigation Board ... report into the grounding of the MV '<i>Alta</i>' ... is deplorably deficient and should be withdrawn as a national embarrassment.&quot;  I am quoting from this gentleman&rsquo;s statement because it goes on to state that in the case of the <i>MV Alta</i>, the failure to make appropriate recommendations following previous incidents are the reasons for the current unnecessary problem.  There is now, again, a failed MCIB report into the incident that cannot even identify the legal basis, we as a nation, have in place for such incidences.  While the MCIB report states that the State is empowered by the Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks of 2007 to remove the wreck of the <i>MV Alta</i>, the review of that report notes that convention has not even been ratified yet, so the Department is coming from the wrong side.  These are not my words but those of a review of the situation.  It states that an issue arising from the <i>MV Alta</i>grounding is there was no indication that a derelict vessel was in Irish waters for some weeks.  They reckon the ship was in Irish waters for approximately two months.  A British naval vessel, however, had spotted the <i>MV Alta</i>afloat and Deputies may not be aware that the <i>MV Alta</i>came from somewhere over in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>I raise this matter because there have been other instances with marine tragedies over the years.  The 35th anniversary of the <i>MV Kowloon Bridge</i>disaster is coming up this month.  As an island State, we seem to have no joined-up thinking when it comes to who is responsible for these wreckages.  We could be met with a natural disaster at any time.  We are the gateway in the Atlantic, for ships that go up north or come back down the other side of our country to get to France.  Our seaways are extremely busy.<br/><br/>People in Ballycotton have raised the issue with me to ask why the Department has not got rid of this wreckage.  On top of that, the Department gave responsibility for removing the wreckage to Cork County Council.  They are not experts in salvage in Cork County Council.  In fairness, the county council did tidy it up and they did make it safe.  Unfortunately, as we speak, that wreckage is starting to break up.  It is an absolute eyesore and nobody is taking responsibility for the wreckage.  Yet, when there was an easy option of removing it from the rocks in Ballyandreen Bay, the Department unfortunately ignored it.  That would have been a quick fix.  The contractor intended to remove the ship for free because he possibly would have got the value of the salvage.  The landowner would have had the peace of mind that nobody was trespassing on his land and that he was not going to be sued.  <br/><br/>Could the Minister of State give a timeline or a date when the <i>MV Alta </i>will be removed from Ballycotton? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600043#TT00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The relevant legislation that allows for the removal of abandoned vessels in Irish waters such as that referred to by the Deputy is the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993.  This Act gives effect to the International Convention on Salvage of 1989, to which Ireland is a signatory state.  Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport has the general superintendence of matters relating to wrecked or stranded vessels.  The Act also sets out responsibilities from an operational perspective for other bodies.  Sections 51 and 52 are of particular note with regard to the duty of the owner and the appropriate authorities.  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel, stating that &quot;the owner of the wreck at the time of its sinking, wrecking, stranding, grounding or abandonment shall as soon as possible raise and remove it or otherwise render it harmless&quot;.  The Act also provides for a number of appropriate authorities, such as a harbour authority, a local authority or the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless if they consider a wreck is or is likely to become an obstruction or a danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment or to related interests, which include the health of the public.</p><p>Separate provisions apply regarding the sale of wrecks and a receiver of wrecks appointed under the Act deals with these matters.  The Act allows for the receiver of a wreck to sell the vessel where the owner of the vessel cannot be located.  However, the sale of a vessel is not always a viable option, as a vessel may be in such condition that it holds no significant monetary value.  Furthermore, the Act does not contain provisions in relation to the costs associated with the removal of a wreck where the sale of that wreck is not possible and the owners of the vessel cannot be located. </p><p>In relation to the <i>MV Alta</i>, which washed onto rocks close Ballycotton, County Cork in February 2020, Cork County Council took the lead in dealing with this wreck in its role under the 1993 Act as the appropriate authority.  In this role, Cork County Council is taking a number of actions, such as removing stores, including fuels and lubricants from the vessel and engaging consultants to carry out a number of reports on the vessel.  These included reports on the wreck compiled by a marine surveyor, an environmental and ecological impact study and an assessment of hazardous material.</p><p>I wish also to highlight a working group established by the Department of Transport on foot of recommendation in a report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board on the grounding of the <i>MV Alta</i>.  While incidences of wrecks coming ashore on the Irish coasts are rare, this group was established to explore the risks and potential costs to the State presented by derelict ships entering Irish territorial waters and coming ashore in Ireland and to make proposals for means to identify, monitor, track and interdict derelict ships before they endanger other ships and seafarers in the vicinity.  The group, which is led by the Irish Coast Guard has met on a number of occasions and the Irish Coast Guard is currently liaising with the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, with a view to evaluating satellite options for identifying vessels of this type in the future.  Officials in the Department of Transport are available to support relevant appropriate authorities in the exercise of their functions, as set out in the legislation in question.  </p></speech>

He mentioned the section of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993, which gives effect to the International Convention on Salvage of 1989.  However, it says that the Minister for Transport has the power to appoint an official, known as a receiver of the wreck, to organise the process of dealing with it.  If I go back to where we are today, that ship is still below.  The onus, from the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, is on Cork County Council but that council will have to do it for free because there is no money, so we are back in the same situation again.</p><p>It is amazing, because the MCIB that was set up does not seem to have any joined-up thinking.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, in the European Commission <i>v.</i>Ireland, found that the MCIB lacks independence, contrary to EU law.  The aforementioned review notes that it is also deficient, incompetent and:</p> <blockquote> 	engages chronically underfunded or supported investigators to carry out statutory investigations on a shoestring [budget].  This report  is a dreadful indictment. </blockquote>  <p>These are not my words but came from the barrister referring to that case taken in the European Union's court.  </p><p>The information I am trying to get from the Minister of State - and I appreciate his reply - is the fact that I cannot get a response here.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport has the power under the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 to send somebody down there to remove that wreckage and remove that eyesore in Ballycotton.  It is a danger.  It is still attracting people to go down and try to board the ship.  It has been done on a number of occasions.  Unfortunately, we will be here, perhaps next year, and will be using the line, &ldquo;I hate to say I told you, so but I told you so&rdquo;.  God forbid that somebody is killed.</p><p>It is a red flag for this country.  We need a proper marine investigation board to nip these things at the bud, as I said.  This ship was floating for months or weeks in Irish waters.  It was never spotted until it washed up in Ballycotton.  We need to get it removed.  </p></speech>

While the legislation in question that deals with salvage and wreck matters outlines roles and responsibilities for an appropriate authority, it does not specify provisions in relation to the costs associated with the removal of a wreck or the sale of that wreck.  It is not possible when the owners of the vessel cannot be located, as has arisen in this instance.  The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks of 2007 provides the legal basis for states to remove, or have removed at the shipowner's expense, wrecks that may have the potential to affect adversely the safety of lives, goods and property at sea, as well as the marine environment.  Primary legislation is required to ratify the convention and it is intended to progress this as part of a future merchant shipping Bill.  However, I must stress that the convention does not cover all wreck removal scenarios.  </p> <p>For example, when the owner of a vessel cannot be located and insurance details cannot be found, pursuing that owner for costs will continue to be difficult.  As I stated in my opening remarks, the incidence of wrecks coming ashore on the Irish coast is rare and not being able to locate the owner of the wreck has added further complexities to securing or removing the vessel.  Engagement between the Irish Coast Guard and the EMSA on satellite options for identifying similar future scenarios will be of assistance.  Officials from the Department of Transport have attended interagency meetings on this issue and will continue to be available to support the relevant appropriate authorities in the exercise of their functions, as set out in the legislation.  I will bring the Deputy's specific points to the Minister for Transport when I see him next.</p></speech>

I understand that, according to that report, there is a need to continue to provide financial supports for Shannon Airport into 2022.  The regional airports programme, which has been extended to Shannon Airport for 2022, must be extended permanently.  What is in the report in that regard?  We welcome the fact that &euro;10 million was announced the day before yesterday for Shannon Airport under aviation supports, with &euro;4.6 million for route activation programmes.  Shannon Airport needs a connection into Europe.  The Heathrow route is now back.  It will go back to two flights a week in February and three flights a week in March and we hope to have an early morning flight as well.  Transatlantic flights to Boston and New York with Aer Lingus will also return early in the new year.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the recommendations contained in the medium-term review carried out by NewERA into the financial situation at Shannon Airport.  We need to hear that the Government is committed to providing financial supports in the medium term and with regard to Covid more particularly.  The regional airports programme should be extended to the airport permanently, not just for 2022.  Shannon Airport's passenger numbers have reduced from 1.4 million to just under 400,000 last year, which is a reduction of nearly three quarters.  It has been exponentially hit.  I await the Minister of State's response regarding this report.</p></speech>

I understand that the Minister brought to Cabinet a report that was carried out by NewERA on the financial situation of the Shannon Group, including Shannon Airport.  It is important that the report is published and that the recommendations are made known and implemented.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned that Shannon Airport is now included in the regional airports programme, which is very welcome, but that must be done on a permanent basis.  Doing so would be in total compliance with EU state aid rules and that vital funding stream would give some certainty to the airport regarding its future.  The national aviation policy is set to be reviewed.  I am chair of the Shannon Airport Oireachtas group, which works with Deputies and Senators from across all parties in counties Clare, Limerick and Tipperary.  We hope to extend that to Galway too.  We are going to work with the airport to put together a proposal for the Minister on the national aviation policy.  We need to give a fair slice of the national aviation cake to Shannon Airport because it is a driver of economic activity in the west and mid-west, supporting 46,500 jobs.  It is important that the recommendations contained within this report are implemented.  I welcome the allocation of a further &euro;10 million to the airport that was announced during the week but I would like to see that type of money being invested in the airport on a permanent basis.</p></speech>

Regarding the review carried out by NewERA, this is a requirement under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Within the first six months of each financial year, commercial State bodies, including the Shannon Group, are required to submit to their relevant Ministers a draft annual rolling five-year business and financial plan.  Therefore, in May 2021, Shannon Group submitted financial forecasts, although, due to the uncertainty arising from Covid-19, they covered the period from 2021 to 2022 only.  Given its role as a financial adviser to the Minister, the financial forecasts were reviewed by NewERA.  In July 2021, a report was submitted by NewERA to the Departments of Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration.  Given Shannon Group's status as a commercial State body, the details of the report are confidential and commercially sensitive.</p>  <p>  As part of its report, NewERA provided observations on the significant financial impact on, and challenges for, Shannon Group arising from Covid-19.  This financial analysis was assessed by the Department of Transport in the context of the 2022 Estimates process and its engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, also updated the Government on the financial position of Shannon Group as part of a recent memorandum to the Government on Shannon Group and aviation supports more generally.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that, early in the Covid-19 crisis, this Government put in place a range of economy-wide supports to help to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  Shannon Group has, as appropriate, availed of these supports, including the recently extended employment wage subsidy scheme.  In addition, Shannon Airport is benefiting from aviation-specific supports under the regional State airport programme, which was put in place for 2021.  This is in addition to &euro;6.1 million allocated by the Government to ensure the completion of a safety and security project at the airport this year.  Shannon Airport, and our other State and regional airports, have also received funding under the Covid-19 supplementary supports schemes, which have an increased budget of &euro;116 million.  This funding, which the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, announced yesterday following the recent approval from the European Commission, provides State airports, including Shannon Airport, with the flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  In total, this year the Government has allocated an unprecedented &euro;24 million to Shannon Group in direct grant support.  This is in addition to the aviation-specific supports granted last year and the economy-wide supports that Shannon Group has availed of throughout the crisis.  I assure the Deputies that the Government will continue this support into 2022.  Shannon Airport is eligible for continued Government support under the regional airports programme next year.  Given the challenges ahead, the Government has approved an allocation of &euro;36 million for the programme in 2022.  This is an increase of some &euro;15 million on the allocation provided under the programme this year and reflects the increased budget necessary to support both Shannon and Cork airports under the programme along with Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal airports in 2022.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond Shannon Airport, I understand that Shannon Group's engagement with the relevant local authorities on the transfer of Shannon heritage sites to them is progressing well.  However, due to the complexities involved in the transfer, due diligence exercises must be concluded before any necessary formal consents of the Ministers for Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform can be given to execute any transfer of the sites, with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh was recently appointed as chairperson of Shannon Group.  I am pleased to let them know that the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, had a good meeting with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh last Friday.  They discussed the current status of the group and the key challenges, risks and opportunities for the future as Shannon Group continues to successfully position itself for recovery.</p></speech>

I am also surprised that the Minister of State said it was confidential and commercially sensitive because I read about its contents in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  The article stated, &quot;A review of Shannon Airport has found that the group should continue to receive State funding, the Cabinet has heard.&quot;  I am a Deputy for the mid-west.  Shannon Airport is vital.  This is very simple.  Shannon Airport must be included in the regional airports programme.  Clearly, this report stated that it needed funding for next year.  That is what the media reports are telling us.  </p> <p>We know that because flight numbers are down.  I want the message to go back to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, loud and clear that we expect the regional airports programme to be extended to Shannon Airport on a permanent basis.  We need route connectivity.  We welcome the &euro;4.6 million in funding announced yesterday included in the &euro;10 million for route supports.  We cannot exist on the western seaboard without support.  The national aviation policy comes up for review very shortly and we will make recommendations in that area as a collective group.  I want to hear that the Minister of State will take the message back to the relevant Ministers that the regional airport programme needs to be extended to Shannon Airport on a permanent footing.</p></speech>

I am surprised that the report is confidential, will not be published and that we cannot see its recommendations.  I have no doubt that the Government has supported Shannon.  It put &euro;23 million into the airport last year.  We need certainty and to get into the regional airports programme on a permanent basis.  The Minister of State indicated that this will happen next year, which is welcome.  We need to be included in it on a permanent basis in order that we have certainty and will be able to draw down money to carry out essential capital works.  If we do not get that support, the airport group has to finance it itself.  I join my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, in insisting that we are included in the programme and that the Minister of State bring that message loud and clear to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.</p></speech>

I will convey it to the relevant Ministers.  So far this year, to the end of last month almost 325,000 passengers used the airport.  This is an 80% reduction on the same period in 2019, when approximately 1.7 million passengers used the airport.  While passenger numbers remain suppressed, it is welcome to see that passenger numbers for last month were significantly up on the same period in 2020.  There have been no transatlantic flights from Shannon since the onset of Covid, but the commitment by Aer Lingus and United Airlines to resume transatlantic flights from March next year is to be welcomed.  I can also inform the House that Aer Lingus will increase flights on the London Heathrow to Shannon route to twice daily from 18 February and three times daily from 27 March.  Ryanair is planning to operate 20 routes, including the first Shannon to Malta service.</p>  <p>  The Omicron variant has the potential to significantly impact on the sector, however.  While the implications remain unclear, I can assure the House that the Government will continue to monitor the financial impact of Covid-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis, in consultation with all key stakeholders and relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that before Covid-19, the Shannon Group was successfully delivering its commercial mandate, resulting in the group being an economic driver in the mid-west region.  It was on a growth trajectory since its formation in 2014 and the Government wants this growth to return for the benefit of the region and the national economy.  With the substantial supports provided by the Government to date, I am confident that Shannon Airport and all of our airports will be well positioned for the recovery that we hope to see continue in the sector next year.</p></speech>

The indicative LEADER budget for 2023 is &euro;180 million for the period 2023 to 2027.  The new programme is &euro;36 million per year, as opposed to &euro;50 million.  No matter how we dress this up, that is a reduction.  The Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, made a submission to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because it is the formal managing authority for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and, therefore, LEADER.  In effect, the Minister in the Department of Rural and Community Development is responsible for the LEADER budget.  That is why I want to know why there has been a reduction and what we can do about it.</p>  <p>  This unnecessary cut will have real effects on local businesses and communities in my constituency and elsewhere.  There are solutions if the Government is prepared to look at them.  This is about rural Ireland.  For three decades, the programme delivered by local development companies has brought much needed jobs to rural areas and developed rural communities.  The aim behind the LEADER programme for the period 2023 to 2027 is to continue to support a community led local development approach to rural development.  We cannot do that if we are reducing the budget.</p>  <p>  We need to work together to assist enterprises and communities in rural parts of Ireland, like my area, Carlow-Kilkenny, to improve the quality of life and economic activity.  Can we consider how this funding could be used to drive bottom-up community led investments to create and maintain enterprise in rural Ireland?  If we set this budget in stone, we will deprive rural communities of critical capacity building supports and funding for vital enterprise, tourism and community led development.  What we are doing will also conflict with the national rural policy, Our Rural Future, which is specifically linked to the LEADER approach.</p>  <p>  Can the Government please take another look at the numbers?  The Minister of State will say that there is no reduction, but that is not what those living with the programme are telling me.  What is the process and delay in the report of the review of the local community development committees, LCDC, structures?  That report will enable the Government to deliver on its programme for Government commitment to empower independent local action groups to deliver the new programme in the period 2023 to 2027.</p>  <p>  I also want to ask the Minister of State about the process.  I have spoken to many different groups.  I have heard from several different groups that there is a lot of red tape in applying for LEADER funding.  It has become a major issue.  I understand we have to have transparency - everyone agrees with that - but there are definitely issues in applying for funding.  I ask that this be changed because it is an obstacle to communities applying.  I ask that the matter be addressed.</p></speech>

The LEADER programme has been in operation in Ireland for 30 years.  To mark this anniversary, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, recently launched the national rural network networks booklet of LEADER case studies.  Case studies are excellent examples of the impactful and innovative initiatives that the LEADER programme has delivered across Ireland in that period.  In recent months, I have visited a range of projects and initiatives in communities across Ireland and have seen first-hand the great work being delivered by LEADER groups.</p>  <p>  The Government clearly recognises the vital role that LEADER plays in delivering high quality rural development projects at local level and will continue to support investment in rural Ireland.  In the 2014-20 CAP programme period, &euro;250 million was allocated to LEADER.  For the period from 2021 to 2027, the funding allocation will be maintained at &euro;250 million.  This comprises &euro;70 million provided for the transitional period from 2021 to 2022 and the recently announced indicative allocation of &euro;180 million for the period 2023 to 2027.  The maintenance of &euro;250 million in funding from the 2014-20 period is evidence of the Government continued support for the LEADER programme.  I am aware that the &euro;70 million made available to LEADER groups in 2021 and 2022 has already supported a range of new projects approvals and expressions of interest for new projects remain open across LEADER areas.</p>  <p>  In discussing the issue of investment in rural development, it is also important to take account of the record levels of investment across a range of schemes and initiatives.  For example, a range of schemes have been implemented in recent years such as the rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme, the walks scheme and outdoor recreation infrastructure.  Local development companies have been involved in the delivery of some of these schemes, as well as maintaining their role in respect of LEADER delivery.  Their involvement in this regard has been very beneficial and is very much appreciated.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also saw increases the secured in all of the Department of Rural and Community Development's rural schemes and the national development plan, NDP, outlines a clear commitment to a continuation of investment in rural Ireland as a matter of priority.  Capital funding allocations for the Department have significantly increased,, from &euro;88 million in 2018 to &euro;205 million in 2025 under the NDP.</p>  <p>  At present, preparations for the design of the range of schemes that will make up Ireland's new CAP strategic plan are well advanced.  The total funding available for this package of schemes for the period 2023 to 2027 amounts to &euro;9.8 billion.  The total funding for these essential schemes for the 2021-27 period increased by 30% over the 2014-20 the CAP period, representing a clear commitment to rural Ireland by the Government.</p>  <p>  A national public consultation process on the new CAP strategic plan was recently put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The consultation process ran for a month and closed on 8 December.  I understand a number of submissions were made regarding the new LEADER programme as part of this process.</p> <p>Such stakeholder consultation will remain a central element of the design of the new LEADER programme.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, met with all the representatives of the Irish Local Development Network ILDN, on 2 December to discuss a wide range of issues, including the LEADER programme.  Further meetings are scheduled with the ILDN this week at official level as part of this continued direct engagement.</p> <p> I am confident that the Government's ongoing commitment to rural Ireland and its continued commitment to funding the great work being done by LEADER groups across the country will help to deliver on the range of actions for our rural communities into the future as set in the Government's ambitious rural development policy, Our Rural Future.</p></speech>

I welcome the further meetings scheduled with the ILDN this week.  That is so important.  I am getting different figures from what the Minister of State is giving me.</p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment from the Government to invest in rural Ireland.  I see in my own community in Carlow-Kilkenny the community spirit that this important funding has brought.  However, we need more communication and information on it.  There is definitely a breakdown there.  I ask that the Department would conduct an information campaign.  I am aware that the Minister is speaking to all the different stakeholders but there are definitely concerns.  I am hearing them on the ground.  I ask that there be more engagement and that we have more information.  The Minister of State said that there is a 30% increase in funding.  I welcome that but, as I said, I need to get more clarification on the figures.  Overall, we must welcome any funding that is brought into rural Ireland, including my own area.  We also have to make sure that this delivers and that there are never cutbacks here.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister of State about the application process.  That is an issue that has been raised with me when one is applying for funding.  I would ask that the Minister of State engage and see what can be done on that because there is a lot of red tape.  I would ask for a commitment that that be addressed.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the submissions have been made.  I note December is the time that everything is brought back to the Department and will come back to all the different stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I would repeat that information and communication is the real issue when we are talking about rural Ireland.  This must be addressed and maintained.</p>  <p>  I will welcome any funding that comes to rural Ireland, particularly to my own area in Carlow-Kilkenny.  I noted we were down slightly last year and I would ask that the Minister of State address that as well.</p></speech>

I am in no doubt that there is real value in the continued support for bottom-up locally-led initiatives that address the needs of communities all across the country and this is the hallmark of the LEADER approach.  In fact, this direct link to local communities is also central to the mission of my Department and to Government's vision for rural Ireland, as outlined in Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  Local development companies play a central role in delivering LEADER and a range of other rural development and community initiatives run by my Department and the benefits of this role are well recognised.  In recognition of this, the Government has committed to continue the support for the LEADER programme by way of the allocation of &euro;250 million over the period 2021-2027.  LEADER will thus continue to be a vital component of a well-funded CAP strategic plan in the coming years.</p>  <p>  As preparations continue for the development of the CAP and LEADER programme, I can assure the Deputy that direct and meaningful consultation with the key stakeholders will form a central part of that process.  Following on from a recent national consultation process on the CAP strategic plan which was launched by my Government colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, it is intended that a draft of the plan would be submitted to the EU Commission early in the new year.  There will then follow a process of intense negotiation and discussion with our colleagues in the EU Commission in order to finalise the details of all the schemes in the strategic plan, including LEADER.  Stakeholders such as the ILDN which are central to LEADER delivery will continue to be consulted with as this process develops.</p>  <p>  I am confident that our new CAP strategic plan will deliver real and meaningful support to communities across rural Ireland.  Within this, the significant national and EU funding which has been allocated to LEADER will ensure that we can build on the benefits that LEADER has delivered all over Ireland in the past 30 years.  I am confident that the new LEADER programme will continue to build on the great work of the past 30 years and play a central role in delivering on the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  I will take the Deputy's question about her constituency back to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p></speech>

On many occasions, I have raised the issue of this heinous crime, through D&aacute;il questions, debates in this House, at Oireachtas committees and directly with the British authorities.  Sadly, nobody has ever been brought to justice for these murders and the injuries inflicted on so many others on that tragic night of 28 December 1972.  Not alone has nobody been brought to justice, but the families have never got the truth about the perpetrators of this dastardly act.</p><p>I repeat that I believe that there has not been an adequate or comprehensive investigation by the authorities in Northern Ireland into this bombing.  I put on the record of this House, in September 2020, information that had come directly to me courtesy of the good work of Professor Edward Burke of the University of Nottingham.  Professor Burke's detailed report on the activities of loyalist paramilitaries, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan area, shows very clearly that there was collusion between some British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries in a series of attacks in Cavan and Monaghan.</p><p>One of the subheadings in Professor Burke's detailed article is: &quot;Blowing up Belturbet: Loyalist operations in County Cavan&quot;.  That article includes the following:</p> <blockquote> 	At approximately 9:00 p.m. on the night of December 28, a red ford escort with at least two passengers, a young man and a woman, crossed the bailey bridge at Aghalane and made its way to the nearby town of Belturbet in County Cavan.  An hour and a half later, the same car exploded on Main Street, Belturbet, killing two teenagers, Geraldine O&rsquo;Reilly (15) and Paddy Stanley (16).  Twelve more people were injured, some seriously, including Geraldine O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s brother. </blockquote>  <p>At my request, the Taoiseach has raised this very important issue with the British Government on the need to address our ongoing request for a full and comprehensive investigation.  We need answers and the very least the O'Reilly and Stanley families deserve is the truth having suffered decades of grief for the loss of their loved ones.  Almost a half-century has passed since that fatal night in Belturbet.  We must never forget that it is never too late to get the truth.</p><p>The very well researched and very well written book by Mr. Joe Duffy of RT&Eacute; and Ms Freya McClements of <i>The Irish Times</i>, &quot;Children of the Troubles: The Untold Story of the Children Killed in the Northern Ireland Conflict&quot;, refers to the Belturbet tragedy as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	Geraldine was one of two children killed in the explosion; the other, Patrick Stanley, had been calling his mother from a phone box when the bomb went off.<br /><br />Nobody has ever been convicted of the atrocity but according to Lost Lives, 'reliable loyalist sources' attribute the bombings to the UVF. ... The bomb killed two people, both children; Paddy and 15-year-old Geraldine O'Reilly are now remembered with a memorial in Belturbet. </blockquote>  <p>That bomb, with such devastating consequences, originated in our neighbouring county of Fermanagh.  We talk in macro-terms about legacy issues and dealing with the past but what we are talking about here is life and death.</p> <p>We cannot deal with the past without getting full co-operation from all relevant security agencies.  I know many families who have lost loved ones, including the O'Reilly and Stanley families, who have not got the truth, but those families have acted over the decades with such grace and dignity.  They want to get the truth and they fully realise that getting prosecutions will not be easy.  Unfortunately, time is passing.</p></speech>

He has championed this issue for many years to try to get to the truth of what happened.  The bombing of Belturbet on 28 December 1972 was an appalling and callous act of violence that claimed the lives of two innocent young people - Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley - and injured many others.  The dreadful effects of this attack last to this day.  The suffering of those who have lost what was most precious to them goes on, and the fact that the perpetrators of this atrocity have never been held accountable for their crimes can only compound the sense of loss.  I extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved and injured.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda authorities have previously advised that the bombing and the murders were comprehensively investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time.  The Defence Forces provided expert assistance and the investigation involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  Despite every avenue of inquiry being pursued at the time, there was insufficient evidence to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.  The investigation into the bombing and the murders of the two young people has not been closed and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will pursue any new evidence or information that is made available.  The Garda would, of course, work in close co-operation with the PSNI where that could advance the investigation.  The Garda also liaises with the families on any developments that arise.</p><p>Following the publication of academic articles both last year and this year, which I thank the Deputy for raising, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, arranged for a copy of the articles, which concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, the Belturbet bombing and information on a potential suspect, to be forwarded to the Garda authorities for attention.  The &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme which aired in December 2020 &ndash; &quot;Belturbet, A Bomb That Time Forgot&quot; &ndash; was also brought to their attention.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, will continue to engage with the Garda Commissioner on progress in this investigation.  Most important, I appeal to anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case, even after nearly 50 years, to bring it to the attention of the Garda authorities to aid their investigation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600047#XX00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being present this evening.  He has often spoken to me privately on this issue and he has assured me that every possible effort will be made to pursue these inquiries through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I am also very pleased that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, confirmed to me about the information I put on the record of this House, which came to me through the detailed research of Professor Burke of the University of Nottingham following his work on British state papers, about the clear evidence of collusion between British state forces and the UVF.  I also quoted Joe Duffy and Freya McClements who refer in their book to the "Lost Lives" publication.  Those publications are detailed and reputable and the people involved have done their homework.  Nobody can question the contents of the "Lost Lives" article by Professor Burke or the book, "Children of the Troubles".</p>  <p>  Everybody is getting older.  We are heading towards half a century since the fatal night the heinous crime was committed when two young teenagers lost their lives and others were injured.  I am very pleased An Taoiseach pursued this matter at the highest level with the British Government.  We must ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keeps pressure on its counterparts in Northern Ireland and in Britain to have a meaningful investigation.  The families want the truth.  They do not want vengeance or revenge.  That is not in them.  They are so graceful and dignified.  We all realise that, sadly, the chance of getting a prosecution will be extremely difficult.  That is the reality 49 years plus after the incidents, but we must never give up.</p>  <p>  It is appalling that Mr. Johnson and his colleagues in the British Government would come up with the idea of an amnesty for murderers from British state forces and paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  They have suggested we cut off forever the possibility of getting the truth and that we close down all avenues of investigation.  The Oireachtas must ensure the message continues to go back that we will never give up on seeking the truth.  The very least the families, whom I know so well and who have suffered so much deserve is to get the truth and to be assured the agencies of both States and the Governments have their interests at heart and that they will leave no stone unturned to try to get to the truth of what happened on the night of 28 December 1972.</p></speech>

As he rightly pointed out, it is coming up to almost half a century since the bombings in Belturbet, but the pain is still very real for those families - the O'Reillys and Stanleys - who lost their loved ones, and the suffering continues for those families whose loved ones were injured in the horrific bombing.  The Garda has not given up.  If anybody has information on this, it will be investigated.  It is never too late to come forward, to tell the truth and to ease people's pain and suffering.  I commend Deputy Smith, who deserves to be praised for his tenacity in continuing to raise the very serious injustice suffered by these families.  He has never given up on the very serious crime that occurred.</p>  <p>  Looking to how we can move forward, it is important to emphasise the Garda criminal investigation remains open and any new information or evidence will be thoroughly investigated.  The Government has also raised this case with the British Government in discussions on legacy issues and it will continue to do so.  I assure the Deputy that the appalling events of that day are very much in the minds of those in the Department of Justice, in my mind and in the mind of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I will continue to engage with the Garda Commissioner on progressing the investigation into this horrific crime.  There must still be people alive today who know what happened.  As the Deputy correctly points out, time is moving on, but there must still be some people out there with information.  I urge them to come forward and to come clean and provide the information or evidence they may have to allow these families get justice for the loved ones they lost.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that this is the last item of business in a very busy schedule, a unique schedule in many ways.  It is important that individual Members still have the right to bring forward legislation and it is with great pride that I present a Bill that enjoyed cross-party support when I introduced it on First Stage.  I believe it is an important part of progressive criminal law in this country.</p>  <p>  Members will recognise the Bill as so-called Magnitsky legislation.  Since 2012, a growing number of countries every year have passed laws providing for financial sanctions against the officials of other states who have committed gross human rights abuses or who have been involved in significant corruption.  These laws collectively are referred to as Magnitsky Law, named after Sergei Magnitsky, an accountant who made serious accusations against tax officials in the Russian Federation and against law enforcement officials in Russia.</p> <p>Of course, he was then arrested, jailed, allegedly beaten and he died in prison.  In 2012, the United States Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on officials involved in this case.  Laws on similar lines have subsequently been passed in a number of states across the globe.  As I said, Magnitsky legislation refers to laws providing for governmental sanctions against foreign individuals who have committed human rights abuses or have been involved in significant corruption.  They originated in the United States following the death of Sergei Magnitsky and have now generated mirroring legislation in countries like the United States and Canada, the European Union itself, including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, Gibraltar, Jersey, Kosovo and the United Kingdom, and there is legislation pending on this in Australia, Moldova and Ukraine.  Magnitsky was a tax accountant who accused Russian tax officials and law enforcement of stealing $230 million in tax rebates from Hermitage Capital Management.  Needless to say, his accusations were not investigated but he was arrested, accused and ended up dead in jail.<br/><br/>The original Magnitsky Act in the United States, which was enacted in 2012, was expanded in 2016 into a more general law authorising the US Government to sanction those found to be human rights offenders or those involved in significant corruption, and allowed the authorities in the United States to freeze their assets and, indeed, after the 2016 legislation, to ban such persons from entering the United States.  In October 2017, Canada passed its own Magnitsky legislation, known as the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, which the Parliament of Canada passed in 2015.  That Act enables targeted measures against foreign nationals who, according to the Governing Council in Canada, among other things are responsible for, or complicit in, gross violations of human rights, or who are public officials or associates of public officials who are responsible for, or complicit in, such significant corruption.<br/><br/>There are a number of different Acts that I can reference, although I will not go into detail in the few minutes that I have.  They are not all identical and they do different things, but all are grounded on the same principle, that is, where there are gross violations of human rights abroad committed by officials of a state or agents of a state, we in a democratic country have the right to take action if they have assets in this State and thereby present, hopefully, a global network to be a chilling factor against those who would perpetrate acts of abuse of human rights.<br/><br/>In this State, as the Minister of State will know, powers are available under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2016 to seize and dispose of assets against corrupt foreign officials who have assets within our jurisdiction.  However, the difficulty with the 1996 Act is that for it to apply, a dual criminality test would need to be satisfied.  That means the conduct giving rise to the acquisition of those assets must be such that it would constitute an offence both under Irish law and under the law of the foreign state.  The purpose of the Bill I am introducing, and that we are now debating on Second Stage, is to make our Proceeds of Crime Acts more easily available to our authorities to deal with cases where there are human rights abuses abroad.  This Bill provides that certain conduct occurring outside our State is described as &ldquo;criminal conduct&rdquo; for the purposes of our own Proceeds of Crime Acts, notwithstanding that it does not constitute an offence under the law of the foreign state concerned.  As we can imagine, there are many countries where those particular actions of corrupt officials are not prosecutable there because they are not an offence there, but they would be seen as an absolute offence here.  We need to have the authority to move against them if they seek to deposit their assets in this jurisdiction.<br/><br/>It applies under this provision if the conduct as constituted is connected with a gross abuse of human rights.  Conduct is stated to constitute a gross human rights abuse if it is carried out by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, public officials or a public official of the national or regional government or public administration of a named foreign state, or an official in the performance or purported performance of official duties, or if it involves the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of a person who has sought to expose illegal activity carried out by an official to obtain, exercise, defend or promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.  That latter point is of extreme importance.  It is so often the case that we see internationally that it is the whistleblower, the person who wants to shine a light on gross human rights abuses, who is the person who is actually brought to book and, in the most extreme cases, as in the case of Sergei Magnitsky, suffers the awful situation of being beaten and dying in prison.<br/><br/>It is a short Bill with two sections.  The first section sets out the meaning of &ldquo;criminal conduct&rdquo;.  Section 1 states:</p><blockquote>	(1) Section 1 of the  Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 is amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1A):<br /><br />&ldquo;(1B) (a) Conduct which occurs outside the State and which would constitute an offence or more than one offence if it occurred within the State is criminal conduct, notwithstanding that it does not constitute an offence under the law of the state or territory concerned, if-  	(i) it constitutes, or is connected with, a gross human rights abuse, and<br /><br />(ii) at the time when an application is made for an interim order or interlocutory order, property obtained or received at any time (whether before or after the passing of this Act or the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Act 2020) by or as a result of or in connection with the conduct is situated within the State.  </blockquote> <p>That gives the authority to our Criminal Assets Bureau and our State agents to seize such property where gross human rights abuses are involved.<br/><br/>Section 1 continues:</p><blockquote>	(b) Conduct constitutes a gross human rights abuse if-  	(i) it is carried out by, or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official, being a [named] person employed by, or acting on behalf or under the direct or indirect control of, the national, regional or local government or public administration of a state other than the State (including of any territory for whose external relations a state other than the State or its government is wholly or partly responsible), in the performance or purported performance of official duties...  </blockquote> <p>The third paragraph of section 1 describes the conduct.  It states:</p><blockquote>	(c) Conduct is connected with a gross human rights abuse if it involves-  	(i) acting as an agent for another in connection with a gross human rights abuse,<br /><br />(ii) directing or sponsoring such an activity,<br /><br />(iii) profiting from such an activity, or<br /><br />(iv) providing material assistance in support of or in connection with the carrying out of such an activity, including by providing goods or services or financial or technological assistance.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>Paragraph (iii) is an important point in that profiting from human rights abuses would also be captured by this enactment.<br/><br/>Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;The amendment effected by subsection (1) applies in relation to conduct, and in relation to property obtained through such conduct, whether the conduct occurs or the property is obtained before or after the passing of this Act.&quot;  Again, it is an important point that even if somebody has property here in advance of the enactment of this legislation and is carrying out human rights abuses now, that would be captured by this legislation. </p> <p>We are living in a changing world.  Human rights abuses are being brought to our attention all the time and too often human rights defenders are under attack.  A veil of secrecy has been drawn across gross violations of human rights in many parts of the world.  Those with the courage, tenacity and bravery to try to expose that awful abuse are often cruelly imprisoned and abused themselves.  There are limited things we can do in such circumstances but as a State we surely must ensure that where such abuse occurs those perpetrating that abuse cannot stash their ill-gotten gains in our jurisdiction.  We have a growing international financial service with many billions of euro flowing through Dublin and this State all the time.  We need to have the capacity to know that this money is clean in all circumstances and where we have <i>prima facie</i>evidence we need to have the legal wherewithal to be able to act against perpetrators who want to use our jurisdiction as a safe haven for their ill-gotten gains.<br/><br/>I look forward to this Bill passing Second Stage and hopefully progressing into law so that Ireland can join a growing group of countries, starting in 2012 in the United States with the Magnitsky Act.  We have been exhorted by the European Parliament and the European high level international spokesperson to enact this legislation.  I hope the Minister of State will embrace this and ensure the Government gives its weight to bringing it into law so that we can join that growing band of progressive nations.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600049#ZZ00500"><p>I am very happy with that and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle making that suggestion.  I am delighted to speak for the Labour Party and to support my colleague, Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s brilliant initiative in bringing forward this Magnitsky Bill to tackle human rights abuses and to ensure that, as the Deputy said, those guilty of perpetrating human rights abuses will not have a safe haven in Ireland for their ill-gotten funds.  We must also ensure that we have the necessary criminal justice infrastructure in place to deal with this and to allow for the seizure of assets of human rights violators.  I am proud to be here to support this Bill and to speak in favour of it.  It is an issue that is close to my heart.</p><p>This legislation deals with money laundering as a worldwide crime and with the aftermath of issues in kleptocracies where regimes have robbed their people of their assets, raw materials and resources.  The immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union was a case in point and the case that prompted the initial momentum around Magnitsky legislation.  As Deputy Howlin said, since 2012 we have seen laws known as Magnitsky laws passed in a number of jurisdictions that provide for financial sanctions against the officials of other states who have committed human rights abuses or who have been involved in significant corruption.  These laws are named after Sergei Magnitsky.  He was an accountant who died in a Moscow prison after investigating a $230 million fraud involving Russian tax officials.  While in prison, Magnitsky was refused medical treatment and after almost a year he was allegedly beaten to death while in custody.  His friends publicised the case and lobbied American officials to pass legislation sanctioning Russian officials involved and engaged in corruption.  Magnitsky&rsquo;s tragic death is what prompted the passage of legislation and the international movement.</p><p>Many colleagues in this House and in the Seanad will be well aware of the Magnitsky case, particularly because it has been publicised so remarkably well across the world by Bill Browder, the American-born businessman who has published on the issue and whose book <i>Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and how I became Putin&rsquo;s no. 1 enemy</i>is a compelling read.  I read it some years ago and was overwhelmed by the true story it told of the appalling abuses of human rights, the human story of Sergei Magnitsky, his important work in exposing corruption and his tragic death.  I had the pleasure of meeting Bill Browder in 2019, as Deputy Howlin and others did, when he came to Leinster House to make the case for Ireland to bring forward legislation in line with the Magnitsky Acts that had been passed in other jurisdictions.  This was in order to ensure that the sort of criminal actions that led to the death of Sergei Magnitsky would not go unpunished and that those engaged in those appalling human rights abuses would not have impunity.</p><p>Since 2021 a number of jurisdictions have passed legislation on this, including the US in 2012, Britain, Canada, Lithuania and Latvia.  The case for such legislation was strengthened in the last year, particularly in light of protests over the treatment of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition politician.  The Minister of State will recall that in the other House, when I was a Member of the Seanad, in our debate on the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 on 1 February I spoke with him about the prospect of bringing in Magnitsky legislation and I raised the case of Alexei Navalny.  The Minister of State told me then that the Department was seriously considering Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s proposal and the Labour Party Bill and would facilitate it.  I am grateful to the Minister of State, as I know Deputy Howlin is, for his constructive engagement on the matter and for the fact that the Government is supporting the Bill to go through Second Stage.  That is constructive and it is appropriate that the House would not divide on this.  There is clearly a consensus across the House on the need for this type of legislation.</p><p>Deputy Howlin pointed out that we are increasingly seeing across the world that those who are taking up the mantle of the defence of human rights are coming under attack for their work.  I have been proud to work with Front Line Defenders for many years.  It is an NGO that works globally to recognise the work, bravery and courage of so many human rights defenders in different regimes.  We will all have serious concerns about the abuses we are seeing and about the need to pass legislation here to strengthen the framework in Ireland that enables us to deal with this abuse.  I am conscious that just as we talked about this in February when Alexei Navalny&rsquo;s case was in the news, so too we are talking about this Bill today as we see a build-up of the Russian military on the border with Ukraine.  We see growing concerns about the potential for human rights abuses there and for serious conflict with Ukraine.  I know that is a matter that is being dealt with at a high level in the EU this week.  It is in that context that we are bringing forward this legislation.</p><p>Deputy Howlin has set out the nature of the Bill and clearly there are powers under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, as he said, to seize and dispose of assets.  These powers may be available against corrupt foreign officials who have assets within this jurisdiction but the difficulty is that dual criminality test that would need to be satisfied.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to make the existing legislation more easily available and capable of dealing with such cases so that certain conduct occurring outside of our State will be described as criminal conduct for the purposes of our proceeds of crime legislation, notwithstanding that it does not constitute an offence under the law of the foreign state concerned.</p><p>We see this as in keeping with other progressive legislation being passed in other countries around the world and we are also conscious of the initiative of the European Parliament to encourage all EU states to take up the same cause and to pass legislation mirroring this sort of Magnitsky law.  This will ensure that foreign governments or officials involved in corrupt practices or gross violations of human rights, if they have assets in this State or in other EU states, will have to face the rigours of the law in those states.  It is a huge issue when we look at the amassing of assets that corrupt officials have done in other countries, particularly in EU member states but also in countries like Switzerland.  We need to ensure, therefore, that Ireland does not become that sort of safe haven and that we have the necessary tools and infrastructure in place in our criminal justice system to deal with this issue.</p><p>I commend Deputy Howlin on bringing the Bill forward.  I thank the Minister of State on behalf of the Labour Party for his constructive engagement on this and I look forward to the swift passage of this Bill in the memory of Sergei Magnitsky.  I recognise the immense work done on this by Bill Browder and so many others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-16a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600050#AAA00100"><p>In this, the closing debate of this D&aacute;il term and of 2021, I thank Deputy Howlin for bringing forward this Bill.  As the contributions heretofore have highlighted, it is an important Private Members' Bill because as Deputy Howlin said, the world has changed and financial institutions have changed.  In fact, the world has shrunk in the context of the ability to move assets of all types very quickly into different jurisdictions and it has become more complex for states to respond to that type of behaviour.  That is why it is important to discuss the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, the thrust and intentions of which I fully support.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing this Bill.  It is very important that it proceeds to the next Stage so that it can be fleshed out and elaborated.  It is a pity that there are not more Deputies contributing to this very important debate.  Like Deputy Bacik, I have worked for the past two years with Front Line Defenders.  Working with that organisation allows those of us who are fortunate to live in a very stable democracy to get a glimpse into the world of those who are not as fortunate, who do not live in stable democracies or who have no democracy at all.  The totalitarian states that some people live in and the fear they live in under bear no comparison to the western world.  I want to praise all front-line defenders for the work they do.</p>  <p>  This Bill has its origins in the Magnitsky legislation and it is important to remember the brutal nature of Sergei Magnitsky's death in 2009.  His courage and legacy live on in various parliaments around the world.  I am pleased that the Bill is not being opposed and will progress to Second Stage.  The international criminal justice net needs to be tightened further and Ireland needs to play its part in that regard.  While we have the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and other iterations, it is important that we review our stance and our ability to respond to these issues.</p>  <p>  The extended scope and definition of the criminal conduct element of this Bill would be subjected to inevitable and possibly protracted legal debate within various jurisdictions.  Obviously, we have to realise that some of those jurisdictions do not have the most robust legal systems.  Therefore, it is incumbent on us to play our part in Ireland and to encourage our European counterparts to do likewise.  I want to highlight a specific element of the Bill to which Deputy Howlin referred earlier.  The Bill provides that conduct constitutes a gross human rights abuse if it meets certain conditions, one of which is that it is "carried out by, or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official...".  It is important that this House scrutinises that provision further on Committee Stage because while I accept that definition, we need to be as broad as possible to ensure that various scenarios which may arise in the context of the intentions of this Bill are considered.</p>  <p>  I will leave it at that.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for everything this year.  I also thank the Minister of State for participating in this debate.</p></speech>

I also wish the staff of the Houses a happy Christmas.  We recognise the hard work a lot of people have done during the Covid period but we must recognise the contribution of the staff in the Houses to keeping both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad going through that entire time.  I also want to wish a happy Christmas to our front-line staff.  In particular, I want to mention the staff under my own Department including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the youth justice workers, the board of management unit and immigration staff who all kept going during Covid, who are continuing to work and will do so over the Christmas period.  I also want to recognise the NGOs that have done a huge amount of work during Covid and will also continue to work over the Christmas period.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Howlin for introducing this Bill.  He and Deputy Bacik have raised this issue on a number of occasions in both Houses.  I acknowledge that Deputy Howlin, throughout his entire career, has raised and championed human rights, progressive legislation and policies.  I was reminded earlier that today is the anniversary of Deputy Howlin entering electoral politics.  I will not say which anniversary but he has a very proud record in that period of time in this House and in County Wexford.  </p>  <p>  The Bill proposes that conduct which occurs outside the State and which is both a gross human rights abuse and an offence under Irish law will be considered criminal conduct for the purposes of the Proceeds of Crime Act, regardless of whether it is an offence in the other state.  There are clearly complex legal and practical issues underpinning the debate; and the limits of extra­territorial jurisdiction and the need for a dual criminality test are particularly technical.  Perhaps more significantly for this debate, important developments in relation to sanctions at an EU level occurred after the Deputy published his Bill.  While these sanctions are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, I will speak briefly on them as they are relevant to the current proposal.</p>  <p>  The complexity of the area should not take away from the principle that Ireland must not be a safe haven for illicit gains.  That principle applies as much to the proceeds of corruption and abuses of power as it does to other forms of organised criminal activity.  We have a particular responsibility as an international financial centre and we cannot allow weaknesses in the legal protection of human rights in other states to enable the shielding of property in this jurisdiction when it is, by any reasonable standard, the proceeds of crime.  While I will mention issues that need to be addressed, I acknowledge the shared goals and principles motivating the Bill and the Government will not be opposing it at Second Stage.</p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly referred to Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax adviser who alleged fraud involving corrupt officials.  He was imprisoned and died in prison in 2009 after being severely beaten and denied access to medical treatment.  In response, the US introduced the original Magnitsky laws in 2012 to target those responsible.  It extended these significantly in the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act of 2016, which allowed sanctions to be imposed on government officials implicated in human rights abuses globally.  These measures sent an important signal that perpetrators of gross human rights violations will face real, immediate and personal consequences.</p>  <p>  Other countries have followed suit and critically, after extensive negotiations, the EU agreed a global human rights sanctions regime in December 2020.  This new regime marked an important extension of the existing country by-country measures, shifting towards thematic sanctions on both state and non-state actors.  They provide for freezing of the assets of individuals and corporate entities and for a travel ban applying to individuals.  These measures may be imposed on those responsible for, involved in or associated with, serious human rights violations and abuses worldwide no matter where they occur.  These sanctions apply to acts such as genocide, crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations or abuses including torture, slavery, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests or detentions.  Other human rights violations or abuses can also fall under the scope of the regime where those violations or abuses are widespread, systematic or are otherwise of serious concern as regards the objectives of the EU common foreign and security policy.</p>  <p>  The regime is implemented through directly applicable EU instruments and does not require state-by­state actions each time sanctions are imposed.  All natural and legal persons across the EU are required to comply with them, as with all EU sanctions.  The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment provide further information and are the national competent authorities.   For financial services institutions, the Central Bank provides regular updates to providers on sanctions development and their obligations thereunder and may take enforcement action where necessary.  The Deputy's proposal approaches these issues from a different direction and would amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, following similar lines to the UK in its 2017 Criminal Finances Act.  </p> <p>The confiscation of the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime on the basis of a conviction is well established both in this State and internationally.  Following a conviction by a court, there are extensive confiscation powers under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and further specific powers under drug trafficking and terrorist offences legislation.</p> <p> The important innovation under the 1996 Act was that it applied to the civil non-conviction based model.  Confiscation under the Act is based on the property being the proceeds of crime rather than being an action against the person from whom the property is confiscated on the basis of an offence.  The person in possession of criminal proceeds is not necessarily a suspect in relation to the crime from which the proceeds have derived and the State does not need to show a link between the person holding the assets and the crime.</p> <p> The most important body in relation to the Act is the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  CAB&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, that derive or are suspected to derive directly or indirectly from criminal conduct.  The bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organized crime and a world leader in asset investigations, tracing and forfeiture.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international level to pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity.  I would caution that CAB, or indeed any agency, would face practical challenges pursuing assets in the situations the Bill envisages.  Critical evidence is likely to be in the other tate, and the co-operation of the law enforcement authorities in that State may not be forthcoming.  CAB quite correctly prioritises its resources towards organised crime within the State, and any change in that prioritisation would require further consideration.</p> <p> The proceeds of crime legislation, as first enacted, did not directly provide for extraterritoriality.  However, from the outset, courts have adopted a view that proceeds of crimes committed abroad may be in scope, and in 2005, the Act was amended explicitly to address these situations.  This also clarified the double criminality requirement the Bill proposes to amend. </p> <p> However, these questions are challenging in the context of civil, non-confiscation based seizure.  While conviction-based confiscation is widespread and uncontroversial internationally, non-conviction based models are not yet as commonly adopted, albeit this is changing and more and more countries are seeing the benefits of such systems.</p> <p> More broadly, I would argue that targeting gross human rights abuses demands a cohesive and consistent international approach and that the sanctions measures adopted by the EU should be considered a primary tool.  They operate automatically against those identified, and have greater immediacy, reach and effect than changes to the proceeds of crime legislation.</p> <p> However, I recognise that the approach to extraterritoriality in the 1996 Act should be examined further in light of legal developments, and that the Deputy's Bill is a valuable contribution to that process and will be explored further.  My Department has been giving extensive consideration to the Proceeds of Crime Act and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Based this work, I expect a general scheme proposing amendments to the Act will be brought to the Government next year.  The Department would be very happy to engage with the Deputy further as it progresses.  The key thing here is to get what the Deputy envisages enacted in one form or another.</p></speech>

That might be it.  I have had many anniversaries since and I have served in many positions.  I thank the Minister of State for recalling whatever anniversary it is.  It gives me another cause for celebration tonight.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed response to the Bill.  It is modelled on how the Government in 1996, of which I was a member - another anniversary - looked at doing something that was very radical at the time, namely, instituting CAB, so that we could remove from criminals the fruit of their criminality.  In cases where it was often difficult to bring extensive criminal cases, we looked at where you saw somebody with no means of support but with great wealth.  There was extensive debate at the time about the constitutionality of the legislation, but it has worked and it has been a most effective instrument.  It was Ruair&iacute; Quinn's idea, who was Minister for Finance at the time.  It has been a most effective device.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke of the extraterritorial - a lovely word - application of the CAB.  We had to apply it extraterritorially because many of our own domestic criminals have significant assets, especially in Spain and the Netherlands.  We amended the legislation subsequently to do that.</p>  <p>  We need to have the same broad scope thinking in relation to world affairs and not be captured by this notion that we cannot act in an extraterritorial fashion.  Of course we can, in limited circumstances.  In recent weeks we dealt with legislation on people smuggling and we enacted legislation that has impact beyond our jurisdiction.  We need that approach in the case we are discussing here.  It is the approach followed by the UK and it is an effective approach.  The Minister of State is suggesting we can take sanctions on an EU-wide basis but that does not meet the requirements.  The EU has to act in consort against individual issues.  I am talking about where there are assets in the State that are owned by someone who we know is a human rights violator, who is often involved in everything from genocide to exploitation on a massive scale, and that we would have in our own jurisdiction and our own authority the power to act against them.  That is what we need.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his constructive contribution and thoughtful presentation.  However, he should not rest because the EU is doing something already on that.  We need in our jurisdiction to have our laws sharp enough, particularly because we are a growing financial services centre.  Many billions of euro flow through Dublin city.  I have been fearful in recent times whether we have the capacity within our own financial services regulation and oversight to manage all of that in an effective way, but that is a different argument for a different day.  Certainly, where it is brought to our attention and we are clear in the knowledge that assets are the result of exploitation and human misery, we must have the capacity to act against them and provide a day in court for anyone who wants to rebut that, as we do with criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act in our domestic affairs.</p>  <p>  I hope the normal approach of thanking the Deputy for his or her great effort, that it will be got to in due course, and that the Government has a different set of ideas will not bury this important legislation.  It is important for us and I think there is an ambition for this in the House.  I think the debate would normally have attracted many more speakers were it not for the lateness of the hour and the lateness in the term.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention to the Bill.  I hope that once it passes Second Stage, we will see progress on it in the course next year.  I and my colleagues who have great experience, such as Professor Bacik, will be able to lend support to that endeavour.</p>  <p>  I conclude by wishing the Ceann Comhairle and all the members of staff a very peaceful and happy Christmas.  I apologise for this last item of business delaying them for the few minutes it did.</p></speech>
