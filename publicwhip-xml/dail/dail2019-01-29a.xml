It is the first time since 1999 that the country's nurses and midwives are going on strike across the health service.  It will cause disruption to many patients because of the cancellation of appointments and the cancellation of elective outpatient surgery and it will have an impact generally on the health service.</p>  <p>  Nurses and midwives in the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, have been seeking engagement with the State for some time.  They have given plenty of notice.  There is no doubt that the nursing profession is under pressure.  I refer to nurses working in acute wards, in intensive care, in theatres, and in accident and emergency departments.  They are under enormous pressure and morale is low.  There is a significant human resource issue and without question pay and conditions are central to the low level of morale, in addition to the impact hospital overcrowding has had over a consistent period on the working conditions and pressure nurses are under.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that agency nurses, for example, cost the health service &euro;1.4 million a week.  That tells its own story as to what is going on in terms of shortages.  The recruitment and retention of nurses is central to the dispute.  There are alternative views on the matter.  The Public Service Pay Commission has said there is not a retention or recruitment issue but I have doubts about that.  It is important to put down a marker in that we need to have more data on how many graduates are leaving student nursing colleges every year to go overseas.  The numbers are significant.  We must also examine how many nurses we are recruiting from overseas.</p><p>The system is out of kilter by any measure.  Entire cohorts of students are moving to the UK, Canada, Australia and other countries.  We then have to recruit huge numbers from overseas at significantly greater cost.  I refer to the cost of nurses with third-level qualifications and, likewise, the cost of orientation and ensuring that people who come from overseas are properly equipped, sufficiently capable and so on.  There are huge costs in that.<br/><br/>I read a very good article in the <i>Evening Echo</i>last week in which Ms Naomi O'Donovan, a midwife at Cork University Maternity Hospital, and Ms Margaret Frahill<b>, </b>a nurse manager in Mercy University Hospital, outlined their concerns regarding patients missing out on certain care.  Their concerns are the result of the pressures involved.<br/><br/>The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, held a hearing.  The matter may now go to a full hearing of the Labour Court.  The Minister seems to have indicated that he is anxious for the industrial relations machinery of the State to be deployed to help resolve this dispute.  It has taken some time to engage that machinery.  If the matter is referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court, will the Government abide by the outcome, just as it did in the Garda pay dispute some years ago?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Before I begin, I wish to offer my condolences and those of the Government to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives on the roads in the week gone by, particularly the four young men in Donegal who lost their lives on Sunday last.  I know that M&iacute;chael, Sean, Daniel and John were very much loved in their communities.  Their deaths will be mourned across the entire country.  Although their laughter may have been silenced, we remember their lives and the promise that has been cut short.  Our thoughts and sympathies are with the Roarty, Harkin, Scott and Harley families at this time.</p>  <p>  In answer to the questions the Deputy raised, the Cabinet discussed the pending nursing strike at its meeting this morning.  We are very aware that the INMO, the largest union representing nurses and midwives, intends to engage in a 24-hour strike tomorrow.  I certainly have no doubt about the depth of feeling on the part of nurses and midwives regarding their pay and their conditions.  That was reflected in an overwhelming ballot in favour of strike action.  I also have no doubt about the considerable public support that nurses and midwives will have should they choose to engage in strike action.  Efforts are ongoing at the Labour Court to see if we can have a full hearing there, with a view to a recommendation thereafter.  Obviously, if a recommendation is made, the Government will have to consider it.  It would be very rare for the Government to reject a recommendation of the Labour Court, but we would certainly have to consider it if such a recommendation arises or if we reach that point.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, I should say that in terms of patients and their care, the damage is already done.  More than 1,000 operations and thousands of outpatient appointments have been cancelled.  Even if the strike is called off at the last minute, it will not be possible to reschedule those appointments for tomorrow.  Unfortunately, in the context of patient care, the harm has already been done.</p>  <p>  We want to avert the strike if possible; we want to find a solution.  That solution has to be affordable for taxpayers.  It has to be fair to all public servants and it has to be fair to patients.  When I say fair to taxpayers, what do I mean?  A solution must be affordable for taxpayers.  We ran a small budget surplus last year and we hope to run one again this year, although that may not be the case if we end up with a hard Brexit and no deal.  It would not be fair to taxpayers to borrow money to fund pay increases.  There are good reasons a country might borrow money, but borrowing money to fund pay increases is not good policy and only leads to pay cuts down the line.  I do not want to subject anyone to that ever again.  It needs to be fair to all public servants, other people working in the health service and individuals working in other parts of the public service.  If we do a special deal for one group, it will not be possible to do the same deal for everyone.  That just would not be affordable.  We need to look at the wider picture and be fair to all public servants as well.  We also need to be fair to patients.  No matter how wealthy the country is, the health budget is limited.  I would not like to see money being diverted away from new medicines, equipment or treatments to fund pay increases.  We have to bear all those things in mind.</p><p>It has to be affordable for taxpayers, it has to fair to all public servants, including other people working in the health service, and it has to be fair to patients.  If the Deputy can find a solution in that space, the Government will be happy to be part of it.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the taxpayer has to pay for it in some shape or form.  The Garda pay dispute some time ago was resolved by the Labour Court.  The Government accepted that Labour Court recommendation ultimately and it did not upset or undermine the public service stability agreement and the public service pay norms.  There are creative ways and mechanisms through which these issues can be dealt with because it is not today or yesterday that they were raised.  I can go back to the time of the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, in the Department of Health, when there was an ongoing row with the INMO and he denied that salary was an issue then or that they were being paid worse than others in other English-speaking countries.  It is not today or yesterday that this claim has been on the table.  What has been lacking is a proactive, creative way of resolving it, unlike the approach adopted in the Garda pay dispute, which the Government contributed to in the end because I do not believe the Labour Court came up with its recommendation out of thin air.  I believe the Labour Court got a nod on high that it could make such a recommendation.</p></speech>

No Taoiseach and no Government could commit to a recommendation they have yet to see.  The Labour Court does not make its recommendations on the basis of it being mandatory on both sides.  That is not the way our industrial relations machinery works.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is incorrect to say that the resolution of the Garda dispute did not have a consequence for public sector pay; it did.  It required a renegotiation of the existing Lansdowne Road agreement and had a knock-on effect across the public service, which resulted in additional costs for taxpayers of approximately &euro;150 million that year.  As the Deputy rightly said, as is the case with any public expenditure, there is an opportunity cost because of that.</p></speech>

I want to join the Taoiseach, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, to extend sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the families and friends of the four young men who lost their lives in west Donegal at the weekend and to all who have lost their lives on our roads.  Our thoughts are with all of those affected.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.</p><p>I am struck by the very <i>laissez-faire</i>approach the Taoiseach is taking to the fact that in less than 24 hours, members of the INMO are due to commence industrial action in the first of a number of 24-hour stoppages over the coming weeks and his detachment from the fact that members of the PNA will also engage in industrial action.  I am sure he knows, as I do, that strike action is the very last thing nurses or midwives, or any medical professional for that matter, wish to undertake but, regrettably, nurses and midwives have been backed into a corner and forced to engage in industrial action because of the action, or inaction, of the Government.</p><p>Every day, every week, as the Taoiseach will be well aware, procedures are cancelled across our hospitals.  That is due not least to the recruitment and retention crisis affecting the nursing and midwifery professions, and the associated issue of pay is one of the most significant problems affecting the health service.  It has been an ongoing issue for many years, yet the Government has completely and abjectly failed to address this and the situation has deteriorated.  The Taoiseach cannot pretend that this is an issue that takes him by surprise.</p><p>Nurses, midwives and their unions have continually sought meaningful engagement to address the problem of staffing shortages as well as pay issues but he has brushed their concerns aside.  It is our nurses and midwives who have acted in a responsible and mature manner.  For his part, the Taoiseach has decided to disengage.  Nurses make a significant contribution to the health service and to society.  They deserve - and I have absolutely no doubt will enjoy - our full support in their demand for a better health service.  Last April, we passed a motion in this House, which demanded that the Government engage meaningfully with the unions to draw a roadmap to full pay equality with an implementation plan to deliver same within a short timeframe, not the eight years that it has offered up.</p> <p> At the eleventh hour, with thousands of surgeries cancelled and with strike action due to commence in the morning, will the Taoiseach do as the nursing unions have asked and directly intervene?  Will he intervene as a matter of urgency?  Will he listen to what the nurses and their unions are telling him?  They believe that this dispute can be resolved within the strictures and the conditions of the pay agreement.  They want the Taoiseach, as the employer and as the Head of Government, to intervene, stop sitting on the sidelines, get involved and sort this out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900006#D00200"><p>It is important to put on the record of the House once again that we have a pay deal already not just with nurses and midwives but with all public servants, and that pay deal runs until 2020.  It provides for pay increases of approximately 7% over that period, full pay restoration for anyone earning under &euro;80,000, increments,and  special increases for the low paid and those recruited after 2012.  That comes at a considerable cost - a cost of approximately &euro;400 million this year alone.</p>  <p>  I do not know where we will be as a country in ten or 12 weeks' time.  If we end up in a scenario whereby we have a hard Brexit with no deal, that will change things.  The Minister for Finance will produce figures later on what the Department of Finance's estimates are on how a no-deal Brexit could impact on our economy.  They are similar to the figures produced by the Central Bank last week and they are less optimistic than those produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI and Copenhagen Economics earlier.  They indicate that our economy will slow down.  It will not go back into recession and it will not be like the financial crisis ten years ago, but our economy will slow down, and while employment will continue to grow, unemployment will rise as well.  In ten or 12 weeks, we could find ourselves needing to find a lot of money to save people's jobs because there are people working in the food industry, agriculture, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and small exporters whose jobs may be under threat in a few weeks.  I have to be Taoiseach for the whole country and I have to bear in mind that in a few weeks or a few months, we could be talking about job losses in certain sectors of the economy and not pay rises, and it would be irresponsible of me not to admit that to this House and not to put it into this debate for discussion.</p>  <p>  On intervention and engagement, we have a mechanism by which we resolve disputes such as this and we have State bodies that engage in dispute resolution.  They are the WRC and the Labour Court, and the Government is part of those conversations.  Disputes are always resolved in the end and this dispute will be resolved in the end, but there are parameters under which it can be resolved.  It has to be affordable for the taxpayer, it has to be fair to all other public servants, including other people working in the health sector, and it has to be fair to patients.</p></speech>

I could go on and on.</p><p>It is a new low for the Taoiseach to reach for Brexit to explain away his dereliction of duty and failure in respect of our nurses and midwives.  Brexit is not of their making.  Brexit or no Brexit, people need top quality health services.  Brexit or no Brexit, people need their surgical procedures, outpatient appointments and so on.  Brexit or no Brexit, we need to deal with these issues.  Brexit or no Brexit, the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, ought to intervene directly, as the nursing unions have asked him to do, to find a fair and meaningful settlement for our nurses and midwives.  I am very well aware of and familiar with the industrial relations apparatus of the State and guess what?  The nurses and the midwives are too.  They are also aware that the buck stops with the Taoiseach because he is the person in charge.  He is the Head of Government.  It is unacceptable for him to sit on the sidelines in circumstances where he knows that their pay claim is just and justifiable, and must be resolved.</p></speech>

There is massive support for the nurses and if they have to go on picket duty the length and breadth of the country tomorrow, they will be joined by other groups of workers, by members of their community and by hundreds of people who will be beeping horns and showing them support because they want them to win, not because they want the sort of headlines that we see in the newspapers today, that the average staff nurse is earning &euro;53,000 that will rise to &euro;55,000 by next year, which are lies, damned lies and statistics used against the nurses at this 11th hour to try to condemn them on the picket lines.  I hope none of this is coming from the Taoiseach's spin machine.  We have all read the INMO submission regarding this dispute which shows that the starting salary of a staff nurse is &euro;29,000 a year and only goes up to &euro;45,000 after 15 years.  That goes to the nub of why we are here having this argument.</p>  <p>  I want to say, on behalf of Solidarity-People before Profit, that we fully support the nurses if they go out on strike. </p><p>I hope that they will not be put down by spin machines and propaganda that tries to make them out as being totally selfish.  The Taoiseach and his Government are standing up, all macho, and shaping up to the nurses.  They have a hard neck to think they can blame them for taking action when Brexit is happening.  How dare he mention Brexit in the same sentence as their strike.  These people do not want to go on strike, have not done so for 20 years and have only done so once in their 100 year history.  I will read from the submissions given to <i>The Irish Times</i>by many nurses.  One starts: &quot;I love being a nurse.&quot;  The statement continues:</p><blockquote>I don&rsquo;t love living at home because I can&rsquo;t afford to save and pay rent.  I don&rsquo;t love that my brother makes more money as a waiter.  I don&rsquo;t love missing breaks because we&rsquo;re short staffed.  I don&rsquo;t love having to cancel any plans I had after work because I&rsquo;m so exhausted.  I don&rsquo;t love telling my patients there is a 10-hour wait to see a doctor.</blockquote><p>The Taoiseach should read it.  He should know, having been involved in the health service, that these are the lives that they lead.  Unless this dispute is resolved by putting pay at its centre and treating them justly, the Taoiseach cannot continue to stand here, earning six times what a nurse earns.  Is he worth six nurses?  I think six nurses are worth much more.  We cannot contain that situation forever.  Pay has to be put at the heart of this and Joe Public knows that is the reason because Joe Public wants a better health service and knows that unless we pay and retain nurses, we will continue with 3,000 children waiting to see a psychiatrist for the first time, a trolley crisis, and a health service that is creaking at the seams.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health cannot resolve it unless they deal with pay for nurses.  The Taoiseach may end up dealing with it but he should not blame the nurses with regard to Brexit or for the cancellations that may take place because of tomorrow's strike or next week's strikes.</p></speech>

It has to be fair to all public servants, including the other people who work in the health service and in other parts of our public services.  It is not possible to meet everyone's demands and it would not be fair to do a special deal for one group and then tell the others that we have nothing for them.

The Taoiseach must feel ashamed to be a populist as he sits with the elite in Davos and defends the fact he is not taking the &euro;13 billion of Apple tax.  How popular is that?  It is popular with multinational corporations that do not pay their taxes and with bankers but it is certainly not popular with the psychiatric nurses and those who will be on the picket line tomorrow.  It is not popular with the majority of people.  Please do not be a hypocrite and use Brexit as a stick to beat the nurses with.  We should use the Apple tax as a stick to beat the Taoiseach and his Government with because what he is doing is outrageous.  Tomorrow, on the picket lines, I call on all communities and workers to show solidarity.</p><p>If they mount a demonstration outside this House in a couple of weeks, and if the hard-nosed, macho Government insists that those in a workforce with a majority of women do not deserve the pay rise they are looking for, we should bring this country to a standstill because they are out defending the health service not for selfish reasons but for every single one of us.  It would be nice to see the Taoiseach on a picket line in the morning but he certainly will not be because he will be eaten, beaten and thrown up again unless he is willing to pay the nurses.  We will be on the picket lines, showing solidarity with teachers, ancillary workers and other workers and even nurses who are not members of these unions but who say they will not pass the pickets.  The Taoiseach should go to the picket lines tomorrow if he is genuine-----</p></speech>

As others have said, looking at nurses' pay scales and the ongoing problems of recruitment and retention of nursing staff in our health system, it is little wonder that 95% of INMO members voted for the action.  The Taoiseach should take any steps necessary to prevent this strike from happening.</p>  <p>  Last week, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the European Medicines Agency said farewell to London and the staff are now moving to Amsterdam.  Their departure reminds us once again that we are now only 59 days away from Brexit.  I think we were all heartened over the weekend by the comments of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs that the agreed backstop will not be renegotiated.  We also saw over the weekend the clear wishes, as expressed in various polls, of our people North and South that no kind of hard border will be allowed to return to this island.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste has indicated that a codicil might be added to the political declaration regarding the backstop.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the 21 articles of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement will be fully adhered to, especially given the presence of Articles 17 and 20?  Can the Taoiseach also confirm that no works of any kind are taking place anywhere along the Border on roads or lay-bys to facilitate the installation of any hard border apparatus?</p>  <p>  Events at Westminster tonight and over the next four weeks will, I hope, produce a much softer Brexit than that which we rightly fear.  Like other Deputies, I am grateful for the work of our civil servants and indeed the Government in producing the contingency action plan last December and for the heads of the omnibus Bill last week.  I think the Taoiseach told us that the full Bill will be ready in three or four weeks.  The 17 sections prepared by the nine Departments seem fairly comprehensive, although I notice that areas such as fisheries, which are not covered in the withdrawal agreement, are still missing.  Are all the relevant sections of the December contingency action plan and the 87 European Commission preparedness notices all addressed in the omnibus Bill or must we wait for the secondary legislation?  Constituents have noted that, given a possible no-deal Brexit, much of the proposed contingency legislation - on health, education and pensions, for example - protects the rights of UK residents and citizens in the Republic.  Is the Government aware of any similar UK contingency legislation being prepared to protect the rights of our people in the North and in England, Scotland and Wales?</p><p>The Taoiseach told me, a few months ago, that bilateral negotiations on legislation with the UK would have to take place regarding the common travel area, which many legal scholars say, of course, is just based on precedence.  Will those bilateral discussions involve all the other crucial areas in order that there is full reciprocity for all our people on this island?</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach seek derogation from state aid rules to offer support such as the future growth loan scheme to our exporters?  Given that we are a significant net contributor to the EU budget, have the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance begun the negotiation framework for a financial support package for Ireland as the member state which will be by far the most impacted by Brexit?</p> <p> I am glad the Taoiseach has told us that the Minister for Finance has done some costings, which he is prepared to produce as those of us in opposition have been calling for.  Is it the case, even with a much softer Brexit - and let us hope it is not a no-deal Brexit - a second budget will be needed for 2019?</p></speech>

We are struggling to recruit in large parts of the public and private sectors at the moment.  It is, in part, a feature of the fact that we are almost approaching full employment.  It is also a feature of the fact that, when it comes to healthcare in particular, we live in an international labour market in which people with healthcare skills are highly sought after.  England, Scotland and most of Europe pay less than Ireland does, but even parts of the world that pay more, like the Middle East and Australia, are also struggling to recruit healthcare staff.  It is not just a simple issue of pay.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, there are 3,000 more nurses and midwives working in our health service now than three years ago.  Comparing like with like and month with month, 800 more nurses were working in our public health service last December than the December before that.  The impression that is sometimes created to the effect that there are more nurses leaving than coming in is not correct.</p></speech>

Those figures come from the Public Sector Pay Commission and are independent and can be accredited.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, a codicil is a legal amendment after the fact to a treaty or agreement.  We have seen no proposals from London or anywhere in respect of a codicil.  I am conscious votes will happen in the House of Commons later.  I was in touch by phone with Prime Minister May earlier and we intend to speak again after those votes happen.  We will take it from there in terms of the next steps.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that there are no works happening on or around the Border to facilitate the imposition of physical infrastructure.  Any works that are happening are road repairs, I imagine, or improvements to roads.</p>  <p>  To maintain the common travel area and all the benefits that flow from it, which are about much more than travel, we will need a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the United Kingdom, which we have been working on for some time, a convention on social security which the Minister, Deputy O'Doherty, and Secretary of State, Ms Amber Rudd, have worked on, and legislation in both countries.  We have shown the House the heads of legislation which covers our side of that and that will be published on 22 February.  The UK will have to do something similar.</p></speech>

Our distinguished journalist, Mr. Fintan O'Toole, says that geography is destiny.  Is it the case that other countries that will be impacted by Brexit, like The Netherlands, France and Denmark, are beginning to make bilateral arrangements for a no-deal Brexit?  The French Government is making arrangements with regard to UK-French trade and travel and the Dutch are also taking steps with the UK to protect their agrifood sector.</p>  <p>  While the comments Ms Sabine Weyand made yesterday are welcome, do these bilateral moves by some of the other 27 member states echo recent slippage in the unanimous support I thought we had among the EU 27 for Ireland's backstop and the Good Friday Agreement?  I refer to recent comments made in the Bundestag and by the Polish and French Governments.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach earlier referred to the quarterly report of the Central Bank of Ireland on the macroeconomic implications of a disorderly Brexit and it makes sombre reading.</p><p>Our growth in 2019 and 2020 would be totally wiped out.  Hopefully, in that context, we will be spared a disorderly Brexit.  Is the Taoiseach telling us the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have fully estimated the cost of Brexit and the likely impact of a Brexit with the United Kingdom in the customs union after 2020?  Have they quantified the financial support Ireland needs and would expect from the European Union after 29 March next following a no-deal Brexit or after 31 December 2020?</p></speech>

There has been enormous European unity across the 27 member states.  Where states engage in bilateral agreements, it needs to be done with the knowledge of the European Commission.  For example, when it comes to the common travel area, it is something provided for in the withdrawal agreement and the treaties already.  We will need to put in place legislation.  The House has seen the heads of the Bill with regard to rail travel between Dublin and Belfast.  France will have to do something similar with regard to the Channel Tunnel.</p>  <p>  With regard to the budget, it is not our intention to - nor do we feel we need to - revisit the budget.  The projections being released by the Department of Finance later show that a no-deal, hard Brexit will cause the economy to slow down very sharply but not to the extent that we go back into recession.  We are not projecting a return to recession.  Employment will continue to grow but not fast enough to keep pace with an expanding labour market.  Under our projections unemployment will rise, therefore, and instead of running a surplus this year, we will run a deficit in the region of 0.5% of GNP, which is manageable.  It will put us in a different position financially but one we can manage and one we have put the country in a good position for.  There are other people who, not too long ago in this House, argued that we should spend more and finance it through borrowing.  Our decision not to do that has been proved right.  At least now we will be able to afford to borrow to mitigate against the costs of Brexit if we have to.</p></speech>

The Government made numerous commitments to introduce measures to protect women and children from abuse and violence.  People will have faith in such commitments in the future only if the State makes good on wrongs of the past.  The Tuam Home Survivors Network called today for the collection of DNA samples as a matter of urgency to ensure there is no delay in returning human remains to identifiable relatives for dignified burial.  When the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, announced last year that there would be a full forensic examination of the site, the Tuam survivors felt a real wave of relief and hope.</p><p>However, as a result of the decision to grant another 12-month extension to the commission of investigation, members of that network state that they have lost faith in the process.</p></speech>

They will happen on the basis of the timeline indicated previously.  The Minister and I heard what was asked for by some of the elderly former residents of the mother and baby home in Tuam and will certainly give it consideration.  In order to take DNA samples from the remains, we require legislative authority and that will require the passing of legislation in this House.  While that does not apply to adults voluntarily providing DNA samples, we need to make sure that we have the science right.  We do not want to take samples from people and then find out that they cannot be used later on.  There is a scientific issue around laboratories and so on but on the face of it, the request appears to be a reasonable one.  People are getting on in years and are afraid that they will pass on before this is done.  We understand the request and are sympathetic to it but we need to make sure that it is doable and that we do not end up taking samples that cannot be used.</p></speech>

There is also a commitment to a 50% increase in capital expenditure on roads.  In light of the recent statements he made regarding the re-profiling of the capital expenditure programme and comments to the effect that some projects will be deferred, I ask the Taoiseach to provide an assurance that the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick will be developed in a timely fashion.  In the interests of ensuring proper regional development, I ask him to give a concrete commitment that the M20 project will not be put on the back burner and that other projects relating to it, including bypassing towns such as Mallow, will not be forgotten.  I seek assurances from the Taoiseach on this matter.</p></speech>

Much of the work has already been done, as the Deputy knows, including the Gort to Tuam section and south, beyond Limerick.  This morning, the Cabinet approved the upgrade of the Castlebaldwin to Collooney section of the N4, which will improve the road link to Sligo.  The Cabinet also gave Sligo County Council approval to sign the contracts for that project, which is really important in terms of improving road access to the north west.  It really speaks to our vision in Project Ireland 2040 to develop Sligo as a major urban centre for the north west.</p></speech>

In that context, it is vital that the health service is able to retain nurses.  The Taoiseach has suggested that the nurses' action is very unfair on patients but he must know that patients will blame him, not nurses, for what will happen tomorrow.  The idea that appointments were never cancelled before, until nurses went on strike, does not wash with the general public.  I want the Taoiseach to answer for his accusation that their action is unfair on other workers.  In reality, the rising of one set of workers benefits all workers.  It is time for a living wage and a pay increase for all workers after ten years of austerity and pay cuts.  As for the accusation that the nurses' pay claim is unaffordable, the top five wealthiest people in this country have &euro;35 billion.  The Government could introduce a millionaire's tax on anything over &euro;1 million.</p><p>It could also introduce a corporation tax in line with that of other countries or a financial transactions tax.  The idea that we have a little pie to choose from will not wash.  The Government is heading for a confrontation it cannot win.</p></speech>

We had an opportunity on Leaders' Questions already to discuss the impending nurses' strike and I am sure we will have other opportunities to do so in the future.  The Deputy is correct that appointments are cancelled for any number of reasons but 10,000 specialist appointments and 1,000 operations cancelled for tomorrow is a lot.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach committed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the establishment of a task force to look after Tipperary town and its environs.  Last year, on a bleak November day, 5,000 people protested on the streets of Tipperary but little other than the promise of a task force has happened since.  The Taoiseach also promised collaboration and co-operation.  Groups such as March for Tipp and Jobs for Tipp want to co-operate and collaborate but they are not being engaged with.  March for Tipp recently polled 774 people and 96% of them had no confidence in the county council to head up the rescue plan.  Will the Taoiseach insist that an official from his Department be put in charge of this process and that all groups that are ready, willing and able to help be allowed to do so?  There cannot be a solo run by the county council.  The people came out onto the streets because they do not have confidence in Tipperary County Council, unfortunately.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, properly addresses this issue and that he meets the groups he has committed to meet because he has not yet given me a date to meet them?</p></speech>

The inadequacy of autism services is an issue raised continually with Members in their constituency offices.  This is not an area in respect of which remedial action can be taken as, very often, there is a window of educational opportunity.  Why is the Bill not being progressed?  If it were progressed in isolation from the resources would it make the difference as stated in Senator Reilly's remarks?</p></speech>

For reasons of which the House will be aware, we have only been able to prioritise six items of legislation for this session through to the end of March.  The decision in the Department of Health, which I believe was the right one, was to prioritise the legislation on CervicalCheck and establishment of the tribunal to hear cases.  That is being given priority in terms of health legislation.</p>  <p>  On the issue of a special school in Dublin 15, the National Council for Special Education has examined this and has formed a view that a special school is warranted in the Dublin 15 area.  The exact form that should take is still a matter for discussion in terms of whether it should be autism-specific or for all children who have profound special needs and cannot be accommodated in the existing schools.</p></speech>

It is something of which NAMA always reminds us in its annual report.  Last week a receiver notified residents in Riverwood Hall in Carpenterstown that they would be evicted, that is, nine households and up to 30 residents.  It is shocking that has occurred in our constituency.  Over the weekend, one of the residents was notified by the receiver that NAMA was one of the main parties to this eviction.  It is highly inappropriate that NAMA, as a State agency, is circumventing the law, in the context of the Residential Tenancies Act and the Tyrrelstown amendment, is undermining the legislation the Taoiseach and his Government enacted and is deliberately evicting residents.  It undermines everything that is in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  I want to know everything the Government intends to do to address this and what the Taoiseach's view of NAMA is given that it is circumventing legislation introduced by his Government and is central to an eviction process which will turf out residents from their homes where they will face homelessness.  This shows a dysfunction in housing policy that is occurring on our doorstep.</p></speech>

On NAMA, which comes under the Department of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, its latest quarterly report came before the Cabinet this morning.  It talked about the many thousands of new homes that have been built on NAMA-indebted sites throughout the country.  More than 2,000 social housing homes have been provided to local authorities as well.  This is to note some of the good work that NAMA is doing.</p>  <p>  On the specific situation referred to by the Deputy, I am currently in conversation with the RTB on the Tyrrelstown amendment.  It was tested recently at the RTB and that threw up a couple of issues.  We are in discussions with the RTB around the issue of evictions.  The law is clear.  It was the legal advice at the time around the number of properties at any given time.  However, the spirit of the law has to be observed.  If it is not being observed, that is exactly what we will look at.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach, as Minister for Transport, was the first Minister to give approval for funding.  For the past 20 to 30 years, this roadway was promised by successive Governments.  As a Deputy for Sligo, who was lobbied over many years for this funding, I am delighted we can start this project.  The Taoiseach might give me an indication as to when this project will start.  For the people of Sligo and the north west, this Cabinet approval is vitally important.  Could we have a timeline as to when this project will start?</p></speech>

The N4, from Castlebaldwin to Colooney, is one of the most dangerous roads in Ireland and a road on which many people have lost their lives.  This is about road safety but also about economic development and bringing more economic opportunities to the north west.  It very much speaks to our vision of developing Sligo as one of the growth centres for Ireland into the future.</p><p>I am very pleased the Cabinet took the decision this morning to give that project the go-ahead.

In 2008, the Labour Court made a recommendation that F&Aacute;S supervisors be paid pensions.  That decision was endorsed by a D&aacute;il Private Members' Bill last year, when a more than two thirds majority voted in favour of implementing the Labour Court recommendation.

Indeed, they have lost confidence in all four Ministers in the Department.  There are scandals whereby people are dying.  I will just mention the CervicalCheck scandal whereby women are dying unnecessarily.  There is now the escalating cost of the children's hospital, whereby the Government is going to pay &euro;500,000 for another report to find out what happened.  Where were the Ministers for Justice, and Equality, Health and Finance when this was happening?  In March 2017, our little group highlighted that the proposed site is the wrong location in which to build the hospital.  The reason we provided in that regard related to the fact that the cost of getting the materials in and out of where the hospital is to be built will drive the Government's projected cost up to the moon.</p></speech>

The new children's hospital is expected to open in August 2022.  The projected cost is &euro;1.73 billion.  I accept that we need the children's hospital.  On 18 December last, the Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il that the project would cost &euro;1.43 million.  In 2017, I was informed that it would cost &euro;983 million.  In 2016, when planning permission was granted, we were told that the project would cost &euro;650 million, which is one third of the current estimate.  My big fear - I do not say this lightly - is that there is a cartel holding sway here.  The &euro;650 million in 2016 was 20% cheaper than the second quote.  There is something serious going on here.  Someone has taken his or her eye off the ball.</p><p>The Taoiseach is the leader of the country.  Deputy Harris is the Minister for Health.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is responsible for the new children's hospital.  I reiterate that someone has to take responsibility.  The Taoiseach should not forget that it was taxpayers who got this country up and running again.  What is the problem?  Could the Taoiseach please confirm whether the consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, are being paid &euro;450,000 to review this dog's dinner of a situation for which someone is responsible?</p></speech>

The investigation into this matter was conducted by a former chief superintendent at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The report alleges criminality.  Those agents have a common denominator.  They all followed the Central Bank code of conduct.  The agents acted with honesty.  They put their customers first.  For their troubles, many of them had their service terminated on a no-fault basis.  What action does the Taoiseach intend to take on receipt of that very important report, which alleges criminality at the heart of the banking sector?  The matter must be investigated further.  In that context, there must be a follow-up by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  What does the Taoiseach have to say about the matter?  I am sure he has heard of the report and that he has seen it.</p></speech>

We are constantly informed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that it is carrying out a deep analysis of all possible scenarios on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has committed to sharing the analysis at the appropriate time.  For the 120,000 people living in Ireland who are in receipt of English pensions, the appropriate time is long past.

Both countries perform an average of two cataract operations per 1,000 individuals each year.  In total, 4.5 million cataract operations were performed in the EU.  The Irish College of Ophthalmologists which represents more than 200 eye doctors, stated that there are not enough eye specialists employed in the Irish healthcare system.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have been taking hundreds of people to Belfast in recent months.  These are individuals who worked hard all their lives and who require access to an urgent, 15-minute procedure.  They are being allowed to go blind by the State.  Does the Taoiseach realise that those people from west Cork and Kerry are mainly in their 80s and 90s?  How does he intend to stop the suffering of those people and resolve the crisis relating to the performance of cataract operations?</p></speech>

I refer to calcium and magnesium tablets and Eskimo fish oil for joints.  The list is endless.  Older people whose eyesight is affected by macular degeneration, for example, take a product called MacuShield, which is not available on the medical card and costs &euro;25 for a month's supply.  The increase in VAT will give rise to a &euro;5.75 increase in price.  It seems that there is not much support from the Government for those who wish to look after their health.</p></speech>

I call on the Taoiseach to reconsider the VAT increase on health supplements.

There was no lawful adoption in Ireland before 1952.  For a period after that date, there was a widespread practice of informal adoption.  Sometimes that took place within the wider family and sometimes under the aegis of a church or voluntary agencies such as St. Patrick's Guild.</p><p>In May 2018, 126 cases of illegal registrations were finally confirmed by Tusla following an analysis of files from St Patrick's Guild.  In those cases, the adoptive parents were incorrectly registered as the birth parents on the birth certificates between 1946 and 1969.  Instead of applying under the Act and registering with the Adoption Authority, infant children were simply transferred directly into the hands of their new adoptive parents.  The information provided to register the births was falsified and the children involved were given false birth certificates and listed as being the children of the adoptive parents.  That is where the illegal registration occurred.  That generation of children are now adults in their 40s, 50s, 60s and even 70s.  They are without the benefit of a valid adoption order and their status within their families is legally uncertain.</p><p>There is an unknown number of informal adoption arrangements, and some may not be documented at all.  The people identified to date are in limbo or a no man's land as regards certainty of status.  We are informed that a scoping exercise is under way.  We know already that a further 748 adoption cases are of concern, all of which relate to adoptions by St. Patrick's Guild, which is one adoption society out of many.  To date, the Minister has not indicated what legislative action will be taken to address the illegal registrations and to provide legal certainty to those affected.</p><p>It is important to note that a birth certificate is not an identity document, nor does a birth certificate amount to proof of the family relationship that it asserts that is admissible in court.  The Bill seeks to address this uncertain status.  It defines the process of informal adoption as involving the placing of a child into the care of a married couple, neither of whom was the parent of the child concerned, with a view to the child being held out and considered for all purposes to be the child of that couple, born to them in wedlock, or to be their adopted child, without any regard to the need for an adoption order; and the furnishing of information in connection with registering the child's birth purporting to show the couple to be the natural parents of the child.<br/><br/>Under this legislation, where documentation is available and an individual desires a valid adoption, a person who was informally adopted could apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration of adoption.  If satisfied with the evidence presented, the court may make a declaration that the applicant is deemed to have been validly adopted on a particular date.  The Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths will then cancel the false birth certificate while the Adoption Authority of Ireland will issue a valid adoption certificate.<br/><br/>The second remedy deals with individuals who may have been told and had believed that they were indeed the natural children of those who reared them as their parents.  They had no reason to believe they were adopted, regularly or irregularly.  There may be no surviving records to enable them to trace the original parties to this informal arrangement.  The Bill will change the rules of evidence to protect those who wish to preserve what they had considered to be the <i>status quo</i>.  It incorporates into civil law a rule that has been applied in criminal law since 1992, namely, that a document purporting to be a birth certificate is evidence, admissible in court, of the family relationship that it indicates.  Evidence contradicting a birth certificate proffered in court will be inadmissible where the person whose birth certificate it is has consistently been treated, with regard to the rights and duties of parents and children in relation to each other, as the child of the<br/><br/>persons named on the certificate as his or her parents.  This new rule would not apply where someone fraudulently procured their own birth certificate.  The purpose of this is to allow people who have now been thrown into no man's land to have this very irregular situation addressed. <br/><br/>The Minister is offering social workers to people in their 40s, 50s, 60s or 70s so that they can pursue the issue.  These people do not need social workers.  They need a fairly simple court process to regularise their status.  It is the children of today who are homeless who need the attention and support of social workers.</p></speech>

There are six Bills on the priority list for publication this session.  Three are Brexit-related; the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, which is the primary legislation for the spring programme; the regulated professions (health and social care) (amendment) Bill; and the European Parliament elections (amendment) Bill to enable the number of MEPs for Ireland to increase.  The remaining three Bills on the priority list consist of the constitutional amendment Bills necessary to facilitate the referendums on extending the right to vote in Presidential elections to Irish citizens abroad and to change the law regarding divorce, as well as enabling legislation to establish a tribunal to deal with issues regarding cervical cancer screening. </p>  <p>  The programme reflects the need for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to prioritise work on Brexit-related legislation to ensure that the necessary primary and secondary legislation can be enacted and commenced by 29 March 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan, the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill comprises vital legislation that will need to be enacted prior to 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The general scheme of the proposed primary legislative actions was published by Government on 24 January.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, is the lead Minister for the overall Bill and will lead the Second Stage debate on it in the D&aacute;il, assisted by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee.  The draft Bill focuses on the broad themes of protecting our citizens and assisting the economy, enterprise and jobs.  Amendments to the Interpretation Act 2005, which would be required in the event of an orderly Brexit with a transition period, are also included.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan and in the update provided on 15 January 2019, work is progressing in parallel on the required secondary legislation.  On 15 January, the Government approved the drafting of statutory instruments covering a wide range of issues where secondary legislation is needed, from recognition of driver licences to recognition of some qualifications.</p>  <p>  As timelines are tight, the Government will work very closely with all Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in ensuring that the necessary no-deal Brexit-related legislation will be in place before 29 March.  This Bill will complement the steps currently under way at EU level to prepare for the UK's withdrawal, notably as regards the implementation of the European Commission's contingency action plan and the associated legislative provisions.  The draft omnibus Bill may need to be adjusted in light of ongoing developments.</p>  <p>  Aside from the legislative priorities, the spring programme also includes 32 Bills that are expected to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny and work is under way on a further 91 Bills.  Work is also continuing on other legislation across all Departments and several Bills that are at an advanced stage will be introduced in the coming weeks to be progressed alongside those currently on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.  Those on the Order Paper include the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018, the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.  It is intended to prepare and publish a further legislative programme towards the end of March.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900018#Q02100"><p>Last Friday, only after significant pressure from the Opposition, the heads of the Brexit legislation were finally published by the Government.  Even though Ireland is the country which would be worst hit by a no-deal Brexit, we are near the back of the pack when it comes to legislative preparations.  In fact, we are by some distance the least prepared of the economies that would be significantly exposed to a no-deal Brexit.  For example, the Dutch published their draft legislation early last November.  It was sent to the parliament where it was discussed and suspended until this week, when the government negotiated amendments with the opposition.  Because legislation was published two months ago, it has been scrutinised and the opposition has been given full access to Ministers, officials and background work.</p>  <p>  Now that we have draft legislation we need the background material relevant to the various sectors covered by the overarching Bill to be published.  There are as many as 11 different sectoral impacts.  We need to see the analysis that lies behind the proposals and whether the measures proposed address the issues that have been raised over the past two years in different fora and studies.  Can the Taoiseach give us an assurance that he will immediately publish this background work?  In regard to the drafting of statutory amendments, there might be a need for a more comprehensive presentation to the House on the detail of all of those statutory instruments.</p>  <p>  Given that today the Taoiseach has finally published the Government's assumptions on the fiscal impact of a no-deal Brexit, can he explain why he refused to provide this information on the many occasions we have asked for it in the past two months?  Interestingly, the projections published today show a significantly lower impact than that projected by the Central Bank study only a few days ago.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Central Bank is headed by an eminent economist who is the favourite to hold Europe's most important economic post.  Can the Taoiseach explain the basis on which the Government has decided that the impact of a no-deal scenario will be lower than that projected by the Central Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

How will the detail of that be discussed with the Opposition?  Will there be briefings on the component parts of that on a spokesperson by spokesperson basis?  Is the Bill to be dealt with entirely in a committee of the full House?  I honestly submit that is the best way to do it.  The notion of referring it to a particular select committee with either Ministers or spokespeople alternating would be cumbersome and not the correct way to do it.  Also, the importance of this legislation commands the centrality of this Chamber.  I ask the Taoiseach to agree to that.  </p> <p> The exact nature of the legislation to be enacted will be contingent on decisions that are being made this week and next week in the House of Commons, in Westminster.  I am reluctant to even put this in these terms but I will come to that.  The British Prime Minister today is lobbying her own backbenchers to vote for an amendment that undermines the withdrawal agreement and the backstop that she negotiated and agreed to formally twice, and persuaded her Government to formally endorse.  It is a backstop that was largely shaped by her own red lines and her submission that it would have all UK application.  How can Ireland negotiate with somebody who formally negotiates for a year and a half, and agrees, but is now seeking to undermine the very agreement arrived at?  Is that a basis on which we can continue to engage in good faith?</p></speech>

Having said that, time is running short now.  I would certainly welcome it if we could see the legislation before 22 February.  It is imperative that we have ongoing briefings not just at leadership level but spokesperson by spokesperson.  I am convinced by Deputy Howlin's suggestion that this be processed by means of a committee of the House.  It seems to me to be the least cumbersome mechanism to do that.</p></speech>

We expect that Dublin will remain firm in its resolve and that whatever happens in London, the Taoiseach will not be not convinced, cajoled or pressured to give way on the very basic protections that are required for Irish interests.</p>  <p>  On the issue of contingency planning, where we part company and where there is a very significant gap in the Taoiseach's thinking is on the commitment to prevent a hard border on the island at all costs.  He will have seen the conference in Belfast.  The Minister, Deputy McHugh, was there on behalf of the Government and spoke very well.  The Taoiseach will have seen the activism on the Border over the weekend and also the polling data, North and South.  Nobody wants a hard border.  In fact, a hard border will not be tolerated.  The big gap in the Taoiseach's planning, if I can say it to him again, is the fact that he will not rely on the Good Friday Agreement and its provision for a border poll in the event of a crash Brexit-----</p></speech>

It is a basic democratic call at this stage to let people make their decision if that eventuality occurs.</p>  <p>  My question is more generally about the Taoiseach's legislative priorities.  I urge him to make a priority of legislating to change the income thresholds for social housing because an absolute cull is happening of the social housing waiting lists where much of the time people are being forced because rents in the private sector are extortionate to do overtime on a regular basis or get marginal increases in their income that do not allow them to buy a house on the private market or pay the extortionate rents but are then taking them over the income threshold for social housing, which has not changed since 2011.</p>  <p>  I was talking to a council worker the other day who has been on the list for years.  In his wildest dreams his income would not buy him a house in the greater D&uacute;n Laoghaire area where rents are absolutely shocking.  To pay his rent he has been forced to do Saturday overtime for the past year and a half or two years, and he has to do it because there are staff shortages, but he has now been taken off the housing list.  That is happening again and again.  A nurse came into our office recently who is on the housing list since 2004.  She has just been taken off the list because her income has gone marginally over the limit.  That is not acceptable.  I would not mind if the Taoiseach had an affordable housing scheme, which he promised, so that those who go over the limit have some alternative available to them but despite promise after promise, we do not have an affordable housing scheme.  Is the Taoiseach going to raise the income threshold for social housing to stop this cull of people from the housing list or, at the very least, could he say that basic pay is what should be taken into account?  It is outrageous that marginal increases in income because of overtime that is enforced should take them off the housing list that they have been on for years.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in answering a simple question on what would happen in such circumstances stated that the dead parrot that is the withdrawal agreement would suddenly be alive and would fly again.  That was not believable.  In Davos, the Taoiseach then seemed to indicate that we might see Army personnel back on the Border.  That has created a real sense of confusion and those in Westminster are using it by saying it represents confusion in the Irish position, which gives them hope that we may move.  Will the Taoiseach clarify something in fairly simple terms?  I presume the Government's line is that we will legislate for the package of measures in the event of no deal but the key issue around how exactly the Border would work is only something we would continence once it becomes a reality.  We do not want to negotiate in advance.  Is that the Government's position?  Will the Taoiseach clarify that confusion, which has not helped matters and which became apparent last week?</p></speech>

The only more significant legislation I can recall in recent history is the ill-fated bank guarantee and the NAMA legislation.  When we are talking about very complex legislation, if we fail to have adequate scrutiny and understanding of it, we often end up with bad outcomes that we spend many years seeking to redress as all the information resides with Government for obvious reasons.  Has the Taoiseach considered whether individual Deputies, parties or spokespeople should have additional resources, specifically in terms of legal resources?  Second, in the analysis supporting the Bill, it is very important that we understand the relationship of the proposed legislation to the Belfast Agreement.</p><p>In terms of the future of the island, it is absolutely important that we both protect the Belfast Agreement and that we have a clear understanding of what we are doing legally, but from talking to lawyers, there seems to be a wide swathe of difference in what we are doing.  Has the Taoiseach given any thought to how to address this?</p></speech>

I was asked about the legislation at the start and we will have the legislation done on time.  Some countries have no legislation done and I am not sure the British will have the legislation done on time but we will.  The heads have been published and the Bill will be published on 22 February.  If we can publish it any sooner than that, we certainly will do so.  It is simpler than Members may think and I am not sure what background information there is to publish.  What the officials did was go through all the different areas where legislation may be required and they came up with 17 different areas where we would require primary legislation and then other areas where we will require secondary legislation.  Members have that information on the different areas such as healthcare, business, communications and so on.  I do not need to go through them because the heads have been published.</p>  <p>  On the procedure, as indicated when I met the party leaders last week, we will consult with the Opposition on the appropriate procedure.  I heard some support in the House for taking this legislation in a committee of the House.  That makes sense to me because it means the lead Minister, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, can be there and the line Minister can also be there.  Splitting it up into nine different committees or having Ministers coming in and out of the same committee would be unworkable.  I am conscious that I do not have a majority in the House and will require the support of the Opposition to get this through.  I would be happy to have those conversations again, either at the level of Whip or at party leader level.</p>  <p>  On the fiscal impact, the Department of Finance's projections in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit were not published sooner because they were only finalised last week and they had to go to Cabinet first.  I would say that the Central Bank projections are similar, with the Department of Finance's projections being a little bit more optimistic.  However, the ESRI and Copenhagen Economics projections were much more optimistic than the Department of Finance's ones.  The difficulty with economic and fiscal forecasts is that they are just forecasts and nobody knows for sure what impact a hard Brexit with no deal would have on Ireland.  We do not know how much it would affect consumer confidence, for example, and at what level tariffs would be imposed by the UK, if at all.  These are assumptions but we have to build our budget and we have to operate on assumptions and these are our revised assumptions.</p>  <p>  The public finances indicate that rather than having a small surplus in 2019, the budget will go back into a deficit of about 0.2% of GDP, that the deficit would rise to 0.5% of GDP in 2020, that it would rise again in 2021 and that we would then go back into surplus in 2022.  In many ways, it proves the position that the Government took around budget time to be correct.  There were many people in this House, particularly on the left, arguing that we should spend more and fund that spending through additional borrowing and because we did not take that advice-----</p></speech>

We will make sure that does not happen no matter what happens with Brexit and because we have managed the public finances prudently in recent years, we can afford to run a small deficit for the next couple of years if we have to.  That means we will not have a return to recession or to austerity measures in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit.  However, it means that we will not be able to deliver the levels of increased spending that we might have wished to have done, or that we still intend to do should we able to secure a deal.</p>  <p>  On the Good Friday Agreement and a Border poll, we all know what the Good Friday Agreement says.  It enshrines the principle of consent, that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom until such a time as the majority of people in Northern Ireland wish it to be otherwise or wish for unity to happen.  The judgment call is to be made by the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as to when those conditions exist.  My judgment, which I know is shared by many in this House, is that mixing the issue of Irish unity with trying to secure a deal on Brexit is unwise.  Some of the unionist voices who have been opposed to a deal on Brexit are concerned that some Members of this House or some political forces may be trying to exploit Brexit to bring about Irish unity.  That is not the Government's agenda, that is not what we are doing at all and we do not want to threaten anyone's loyalty or identity.  We want to deliver an agreement that avoids a hard border, that gives us a transition period and that secures free trade between Britain and Ireland.  The issue of Irish unity at some point in the future is a separate one and should be dealt with at some point in the future and not mixed up in these Brexit negotiations.</p></speech>

The committee last met on 1 February last and the next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 31 January.</p>  <p>  Although issues relevant to climate change can arise across the various committees, including committee C which covers European affairs, substantive matters of climate action policy are progressed through Cabinet committee D.  Significant work is under way across each of the areas covered by the committee through Government Departments and agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups, such as the climate action high level steering group and the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  In addition, these matters are regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the Ministers responsible for the issues.</p>  <p>  Good progress is being made on the delivery of Project Ireland 2040.  Through the national planning framework, it sets out our strategic 20 year vision for Ireland's future, balancing rural and urban development and links it with the capital investment of &euro;116 billion over ten years to meet the infrastructure needs of our growing population.  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest across the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action, and disruptive technologies innovation.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to &euro;276 million, was announced late last year.  These funds will leverage further private sector investment in innovative and targeted projects that deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, was established on an interim basis in September and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable housing.  Housing continues to be a priority for the Government and we have seen strong growth in housing completions and in leading indicators, such as planning permissions, commencement notices, and housing registrations.  There has also been a strong delivery of publicly funded social housing in 2018, and the finalised figures will be published by the Minister in the next few weeks.  We are very aware of the significant challenge in meeting housing demand and tackling the ongoing issues in the housing market.  For this reason, budget 2019 provided an increase of 25% in the total housing budget, bringing it to &euro;2.3 billion.</p>  <p>  Delivering on our EU 2030 climate commitments and our objective to transition to a competitive, low carbon, sustainable economy by 2050 are also core priorities of Government.  We are investing &euro;22 billion in climate action through the national development plan to ensure our future growth is regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable.</p><p>Budget 2019 provides for a range of provisions to lower carbon emissions and to improve sustainability, including more than &euro;200 million for agri-environmental actions to the rural development programme and more than &euro;164 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently preparing an all-of-Government action plan on climate disruption and is working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport, agriculture, heating and other relevant sectors.  The action plan will build on the progress to date and set out the steps which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.</p></reply>

In terms specifically of the &euro;100 million worth of projects that will not be advanced this year, has he had an opportunity to look across Departments, particularly the Department of Health?  Can he specify the projects that will not be advanced this year to meet the requirements of reducing other projects to the tune of &euro;100 million?.  I would be obliged if the Taoiseach could be specific because there is great anxiety about every project now in terms of wondering where the axe will fall.</p>  <p>  On the Cabinet decision to approve the children&rsquo;s hospital, what specific sum was approved by the Cabinet and did that decision involve an absolute commitment that it was the final figure and that there would be no overruns beyond that? </p>  <p>  On the capital programme generally, are there agreed public private partnerships to be advanced in the coming year and, if so, what are they?</p>  <p>  Regarding housing, it is important the Taoiseach would give Deputy Boyd Barrett an answer to his question.  I would add to it a question I asked last week, namely, could there be a review of the disparity of the income limits between local authority because there are some now that are ludicrously low?</p></speech>

No affordable housing scheme has been in place since Fine Gael and, let it be remembered, the Labour Party in government scrapped it in 2011.  Now we are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, of which Deputy Boyd Barrett has given examples.  Dublin City Council, for its part, has led from the front.  It has ambitious plans to develop both cost rental and affordable housing.  It has agreed to build 330 cost rental homes, the first in the State on the old St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and another 300 are planned for Ballymun.  It also wants to deliver more than 2,000 affordable homes as part of the Poolbeg strategic development zone, SDZ, in Cherry Orchard and in Coolock as well as 325 homes as part of the land initiative.  However, none of this can be delivered without a scheme that lays out the criteria for who may be eligible for such homes, the income levels that will apply, and on what grounds homes may be allocated.  That needs to be urgently addressed.  I referenced Dublin City Council but I know this applies to a number of local authorities.  The absence of this scheme is holding back projects from proceeding.  When will we see such a scheme?  When will it be published?</p></speech>

This time last year he was spending large amounts of public money not just promoting the new national development plan, NDP, but also advertising specific projects in different parts of the country.  We all remember that.  The project about which he talked most was the national children's hospital.  He said many times that the NDP was fully costed and timetabled.  As he was forced to admit last month and as the Joint Committee on Health has heard, there has been what has been described as a catastrophe cost overrun on the children's hospital and on the costs that were provided by the Taoiseach as Minister for Health at that time and in the NDP which he launched only a year ago.  On a series of occasions he has attempted to downplay the impact of the overrun, as Deputy Howlin has said.  The Taoiseach has been suggesting there will be a benign reprofiling of the implications in later years so we should not be too bothered about it, but that is not sustainable.  It suggests he is desperate not to admit the impact of what has happened on the many projects he has launched.  We need to consider the impact of the &euro;1 billion extra that will be required.  The Taoiseach said it would be &euro;650 million, but my understanding is that the Cabinet apparently signed off on a figure of &euro;1.7 billion prior to Christmas.</p></speech>

It can be divided into two amounts, &euro;1.4 billion and &euro;300 million, but that is &euro;1.7 billion in total. Why will this overspend and the dramatic increase in construction inflation about which we have been told in terms of the hospital not happen with other healthcare projects and NDP projects across the board?  Presumably the &euro;61 million we were told is needed for fire safety in the children's hospital will apply pro rata to all other healthcare projects.</p>  <p>  The issue is whether the Taoiseach is willing to be honest with the public and publish the exact impact on the NDP of both this overspend and the increase in costs which will apply to all other projects across the NDP.  He spent hours last year defending his marketing unit on the basis of the need for the public to know what the Government was planning.  If these plans change and if there has been an impact on them, surely the public deserve to know.  It seems that on one project alone the NDP is way out of kilter in contrast to what was originally suggested would be the cost.  I have always described many of the projects in the NDP as a bit fanciful.  I know of one hospital that was included because the Minister rang up and asked people to put a proposal together because if they did not get it into the NDP it would not be considered.  The Taoiseach can take a pick of ten, 15 or 20 years for that project to be realised.  That is the kind of stuff that is going on.</p></speech>

Can he confirm it will fulfil the exact same role as the national energy and climate action plan, which we are compelled to agree with the European Commission before the end of this year under new EU governance climate legislation? It is important we have clarity and that this proposed plan is not the same plan.  The plan to which we are required to commit under European planning is the key one.  Given that we know we have to reduce our emissions in the non-emissions trading sector by at least 100 million tonnes cumulatively in the next decade, and we know now, after the fact, that the national development plan will deliver at best only a third of that reduction, does the Taoiseach agree we will have to change the national development plan if we are to meet that national climate target we are mandated to meet under European legislation?  We will be fined extensively if we do not reach this target and it would deliver major other benefits if we promote public transport, better insulated houses and so on?  Is the Taoiseach's action plan for climate disruption the same as the European national energy climate action plan we are required to implement?  Will he revise the national development plan to help us meet the goals to which we have already agreed?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has gone on and on about a social mix in housing but the failure to raise the income thresholds for social housing makes a nonsense of social mix because nurses, council workers and people who are on low-to-average earnings are being whacked off the social housing list.  That completely eliminates any notion of social mix and at the same time no affordable housing scheme has been delivered so no council can move ahead, in reality, with an affordable housing scheme.</p>  <p>  I want to ask questions about the national children's hospital.  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about his party's fiscal prudence and said that Fine Gael prides itself on its financial management as against the irresponsible populous representatives he accuses us of being.  How did he manage to mismanage an infrastructural project of this importance and this scale, such that we have a 300% increase in the costs from the original tender?  Did anybody bother to look at the rotten record of BAM, which got it and was &euro;120 million lower than the nearest other bid.  That should have raised alarm bells.  It built car parks in Holland that collapsed.  It had to make settlements with Cambridgeshire County Council over massive overruns on road projects.  It built the Ballyfermot Leisure Centre on which there was a significant overrun and it had a five-year long battle with the council about who would pick up the tab for the overrun. </p><p>There were also significant overruns in the Port of Cork.  Did anybody bother looking into Mr. Costello's record on a project board?  He was involved with significant overruns when working for Sisk in Poland and these nearly led the company to collapse.  Is it any wonder he stated that there was no problem with BAM's tender because he had a record of it?</p></speech>

People are scandalised by it and how the figures have moved in this extraordinary way.  Does the Taoiseach have an upper limit regarding what the hospital is going to cost?  Hospitals are often broadly priced in the context of the cost per room.  Some years ago, it may have been &euro;1 million per room.  Allowing for inflation, if we increased that by 100% to &euro;2 million per room, we would have a cost of approximately &euro;800 million, which is consistent with figures from around the world.  Has the Taoiseach, as head of the Executive, instigated any inquiries?  There is no doubt that this is a disaster for the country.  We all want to see the hospital built.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach, who is my constituency colleague, knows, I made it clear that I favoured a greenfield site for the hospital somewhere along the M50, with easy access that would not give rise to the costs associated with the site that was eventually chosen by the then Minister for Health.  That is all in the past.  We now have a project in respect of which the costs increase daily.  Has the Taoiseach washed his hands of the matter?  He was Minister for Health so he is intimately familiar with it.  Has he placed an upper limit on what will be the cost?  Has he compared it with the cost of other hospitals for children across the globe?  Has he decided to conduct a proper investigation into what has happened to hardworking people's taxes and with the diversion of money from desperately-needed projects in order to meet these highly inflated costs?</p></speech>

I do not have a timeline for a decision from the Minister but they are under review and we acknowledge that as incomes rise, more people become ineligible for social housing, which is happening at a time when house prices are rising faster than incomes.  That may be a change but when incomes rise at a lower rate than house prices, it makes sense to increase the thresholds.  I agree on that.  We do not have the new thresholds yet.</p></speech>

The work is under way.  A significant part of it is supply.  I am sure everyone would agree that our objective is not to get more people on to the social housing list but to provide individuals with social housing so that they come off that list.  Approximately 20% of our total housing stock should be public or social housing.  It is currently only 10% or thereabouts.  From here on, we need to ensure that 20%-----</p></speech>

Some 600,000 people own their houses.  Another 300,000 have mortgages.  This means that 900,000 homes are either owned outright or mortgaged.  At least 20% of new homes need to be social or public housing units.  We do not have the exact figures yet but we think between 18,000 and 20,000 new homes were built in Ireland last year.  That is more than in any year this decade.  Approximately 4,500 of those were built by local authorities or approved housing bodies.  That does not include acquisitions and leasing, which would bring it to a much higher level.  It is over 20%.  I do not know when we last had 20% of all new homes being built by public bodies but that is where matters stand.  It will take a number of years to catch up.</p>  <p>  The capital budget for this year is &euro;7 billion, 25% more than last year.  We will need to re-profile &euro;100 million of that.  This has not been done yet but we think it will be achieved by deferrals of weeks or months and will not require the outright cancellation of any projects.  Savings may arise for reasons outside our control, such as other projects being deferred, not as a result of any Government decision but because of planning issues, judicial reviews and so on.  I appreciate that it is causing anxiety and that many people feel the projects they are interested in are being delayed as a consequence of overruns relating to the national children's hospital.  That is not the case and we will try to clarify that as soon as possible.  I hope that today's decision by Cabinet to go ahead with the N4 to Sligo and the Castlebaldwin to Collooney route is evidence that we are going ahead with these projects and not suspending them.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any new public private partnerships, PPPs.  I anticipate that the M20 will be a PPP.  PPPs worked well for previous road projects but there are not any that I am aware of.  The amount approved by Cabinet for the children's hospital was &euro;1.446 billion but that is not the full Exchequer contribution.  That contribution is &euro;1.343 billion, which is slightly lower.  The reason for that is that the car park and retail elements are included in the figure but will be commercially run.

I have quite a detailed answer that I could read into the record of the House but I will just respond directly to the question.</p>  <p>  These are challenging times for Anglo-Irish relations.  The good relationships that have been built up, particularly over the past 20 years, need to be used now to find sensible ways forward for the sake of Northern Ireland in finding a way to create a context by which devolved government can function again and be re-established.  To do this, we are using the elements of the Good Friday Agreement that are relevant not only for east-west relations but also for interaction on North-South co-operation.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have had a number of meetings of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which have been good.  Through this forum we will have another meeting in a couple of months which will confirm new relationship structures between Britain and Ireland for a post-Brexit environment.  We will also plan for at least an annual meeting of both governments led by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister but involving many other Ministers as well.  The kind of structural relationship that France and Germany or Spain and Portugal have, for example, is one we want to see in the future to build on other structures that exist through the Good Friday Agreement.  We must recognise, however, that Ministers will unfortunately not meet one another regularly in Brussels or Luxembourg and work together on EU projects in the future in the way that they have done over the past 45 years or so.</p>  <p>  The personal relationships are good.  My relationships with key partners such as Karen Bradley, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, or David Lidington, who is effectively the equivalent of a deputy Prime Minister in the UK, are good and we speak regularly.  I will meet Ms Bradley again this week to discuss Northern Ireland.  It is important to say that while decisions being made this evening in Westminster, of course, impact on Ireland and Irish people on this island, North and South, the personal relationships between the British and Irish Governments remain strong, and they need to be so to find a way through a difficult Brexit process.</p></speech>

I refer to the common travel area and all that flows from it regarding cross-Border matters and the rights of citizens on both sides of the Border.  The T&aacute;naiste alluded to the fact that as members of the European Union, we had an opportunity to work with the UK on various projects and we became allies.  This laid the foundation for the building of the peace process at a crucial point in time.  It is fair to say, though - and my party leader has pointed this out previously - that the Government took the eye off the ball regarding Ireland-UK relations and exposed us when it came to Brexit.  Has the T&aacute;naiste considered any new structures?  Could he give us a little more detail in this regard?  My party has suggested a model similar to the Nordic Council of Ministers in terms of structures for dialogue between the governments in a post-Brexit scenario.  The Minister alluded to the fact that a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting is due in the coming months.  Should it not take place as soon as possible?  Since it last met in November, what actions, if any, have flowed from it?  I recognise that Brexit is all-consuming at present but I ask the T&aacute;naiste to deal with those questions.</p></speech>

The British-Irish relationship in recent years has been strong and positive and has allowed us to find a way forward on some complicated issues linked to Brexit in the context of the negotiations that took place.  These resulted in a sensible, pragmatic and legally sound way of dealing with the complication of the Border question in the context of an insurance mechanism that became known as the backstop and of an Irish protocol, to which the British Government signed up fully as part of the withdrawal agreement, protecting the common travel area.  The follow-up bilateral discussions about that common travel area in terms of legislation that will need to be passed in Westminster and in the D&aacute;il are testament to how close the relationship is between Britain and Ireland.  This is despite the fact that the British Parliament has not yet ratified the agreements to which its own government signed up a number of months ago and the fact that, unfortunately, the need for the reassurance mechanism that it is for so many people has not been the focus of the debate on the backstop in Westminster.  Instead, it has been painted as something that it is not.  This is unfortunate but not a reflection of the relationships between the two governments.</p></speech>

He said the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister would meet annually.  Can he give us more detail as to what the Government envisages will be the new relationship rather than the two heads meeting once a year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900023#V01700"><p>That is a fair question.  It is envisaged that the meeting would be much more than a summit between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  They happen every now and again anyway.  Instead, we would have agreement on an annual meeting between the governments, to include not only the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach but probably six or seven other Ministers on both sides in order that there would be a build-up and a proper preparation period for that meeting each year.  We would look at areas on which Britain and Ireland need to co-operate, not just Northern Ireland, which is, of course, important, but also economic development, tourism, development aid policy, security issues and many other areas on which, as two neighbouring islands, we need to work together.  There is an appetite on both sides to formalise a proposal that has been discussed and agreed in principle.  It will need sign-off at prime ministerial level in the UK and by the Taoiseach here.  We are talking about a meeting, probably during the summer months, that would last a day or so and involve a series of different sectoral discussions led by Ministers but also with the gravitas of having both the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister in attendance.</p></speech>

I hope that has nothing to do with Deputy Cullinane.</p>  <p>  Considering recent developments and the comments of the Taoiseach and the European Commissioner regarding a hard border in Ireland, this question was tabled to ascertain what mechanisms are being put in place to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900024#W00300"><p>The Government has said consistently that we will not accept a hard border between the two jurisdictions on this island.  The EU and UK both accept that avoiding a hard border is essential.  I also know that is the position of the great majority of Members in this House.</p><p>Throughout the negotiations, it has been a priority to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to ensure that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland under any circumstances.  Only the withdrawal agreement, with its backstop provisions, provides the essential legal guarantee that we looked for.  However, if the withdrawal agreement does not enter into force, Ireland will have legal responsibilities, and an economic interest, in terms of ensuring the protection of the Single Market and customs union.  The UK will have its own responsibilities, including with regard to the WTO.</p><p>As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, Ireland and the UK have solemn and binding obligations to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  As such, if the UK leaves without an agreement in place and the European Union and Ireland are on one side and the UK is on the other, we will all have to work intensively together to ensure that we deliver on our shared goal of avoiding the return of a hard border.  We are absolutely committed to doing that, even in those difficult circumstances.</p><p>The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is also fully committed to this objective and he provided further reassurances on this in a telephone call to the Taoiseach on 24 January.  This position is fully shared by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and our fellow EU 27 member states.  As the Commission spokesperson stated on 23 January:</p><blockquote>The EU is determined to do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect peace in Northern Ireland.  The EU is fully behind Ireland and has expressed, on numerous occasions, full solidarity with Ireland.  That has not changed.</blockquote><p>We have a way of doing this; it is called &quot;the backstop&quot;.  It was designed around British red lines and with Britain.  It was not an offer given to Britain.  The debates we hear often in Britain now seem to suggest the UK had nothing to do with this and that it was somehow offered to it.  This was a solution Britain bought into, through its Government, and endorsed.</p></speech>

He then went on to clarify the statement, saying that he was talking about British troops.  That is of little comfort and we are going backwards instead of forwards.</p>  <p>  Part of the challenge we have as an opposition party, and what does not help us and our understanding of this is that the Government has, to date, refused to clarify what measures it will put in place to ensure there is no hardening of the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Minister said again that the Government will not accept a hard border.  Are there measures the Government can pursue to avoid a hard border?  Such measures would have the full support of the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in's difficulty is that it wants to support positive measures but it does not know what positive measures the Government is putting forward, although I realise negotiations are ongoing.  That is part of the difficulty we have.</p>  <p>  Ireland will not accept a hard border, and the Minister said the EU will not accept one either, but part of the difficulty we face is that if there is no agreement, there will be a hard border.  The EU will want to protect its borders.  It will be about compliance, standards, country of origin and so on.  What are we proposing or putting on the table in the event of a no-deal Brexit and a hard border?</p></speech>

They revolve around regulatory alignment in areas that are specific and are required to prevent the need for Border infrastructure.  That is how the backstop works.  It is essentially the fall-back position to which the British Government repeatedly committed, if it could not find other solutions through a future relationship discussion or through bespoke solutions offered to Ireland.  The fall-back position would be regulatory alignment in the areas necessary to prevent Border infrastructure and to protect an all-island economy which is also very much part of protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  Borders are not mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement but the absence of physical Border infrastructure has been such a strong reinforcement to the creation of normality, commerce and peace, that it is self-evident.</p>  <p>  The Government's view is that, deal or no deal, there is an obligation on the British and Irish Governments to work together, and on the EU to support that process, and to find a way of avoiding Border infrastructure through regulatory alignment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900024#W00600"><p>My question related to a no-deal scenario where the backstop will not apply.  The Irish Government either defies the EU or the Good Friday Agreement.  There are already structures there which apply to relationships with Britain.  The difficulty has been that, in many cases, the British Government, and particularly the Prime Minister, has not tied into those structures.</p>  <p>  There was a poll on "Claire Byrne Live" on RT&Eacute; last night that showed 80% of people in the South would vote for a united Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  That solution would mean no border and we would still be within the EU.  There would be positivity around that.  The Government needs to speed up preparations for a Border poll which, if successful, would eliminate the Border.  The Minister is on the record as saying that is not the way forward but it is a legitimate way to move forward.  It is in the Good Friday Agreement.  There is potential there to move forward with this poll.  Would the Minister accept that in the event of no agreement and a hard border, this is a way to move things forward?</p></speech>

Even in that scenario, there is an obligation on the British Government to work with Ireland and the EU.  We cannot do this bilaterally.  It has to involve the EU because this involves protecting the EU's customs union and Single Market.  We cannot have a back door without checks.  We have to ensure that we find a legally sound and sensible mechanism which prevents the need for physical Border infrastructure whether there is a deal or not.  The only credible way to do that is through regulatory alignment, North and South, on the island of Ireland.</p><p>There will be a big obligation on the British Government to follow through on the commitments it signed up to in the withdrawal agreement, on which it is not now following through, but also on the commitments it made in December 2017 in the political declaration it made to people on this island.</p><p>The Irish Government is concerned about everybody in Northern Ireland, nationalist and unionist, who is stressed and concerned about what the future holds.  We have to find a way forward that can protect the <i>status quo</i>as best we can.  Having a constitutional debate on the future of Ireland right now, even bearing in mind the legitimate concerns of nationalists and unionists, makes the overall debate much more complicated.</p></speech>

As she knows, we both have a lot of work to do in this regard, as has every party in this House in terms of working together to  ensure Ireland is as prepared as it can be for a no-deal Brexit should it happen.</p>  <p>  Our work across Government has identified key issues arising in each Brexit scenario, including, in particular, a central case scenario and a no-deal scenario.  The central case scenario assumes the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as a transition period and a future relationship between the EU and the UK based on a free trade agreement.</p><p> Since July 2018, the Government has made a number of key decisions on Brexit preparedness including on staffing, ICT and infrastructure at ports and airports.  At its meeting on 11 December, the Government agreed that, while work on Brexit preparedness for the central-case scenario should continue, in light of ongoing political uncertainties and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, greater immediate priority must now be given to preparations for a no-deal Brexit.  Following this, the Government published its Brexit contingency plan on 19 December 2018, which set out detailed sectoral analyses - 20 different sectors were examined - and approaches to mitigating the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  Ireland's action plan is consistent with, and complementary to, the approach being taken at EU 27 level to prepare for the UK's withdrawal.  On 15 January, further discussions at Cabinet took this work forward in the important areas of transport connectivity and medicines, with memos brought to Government by the Ministers, Deputy Ross and Deputy Harris.</p> <p> A number of the actions identified in a no-deal scenario will still be required even in a central-case scenario but with a longer timeframe for implementation.  While ratification of the withdrawal agreement is still the Government's preferred outcome, last week the Government published the general scheme of the proposed primary legislative measures required in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  We published the heads of the omnibus Bill, which has 17 parts.  We will also introduce 28 secondary statutory instruments to protect Irish citizens at home and in the UK.</p></speech>

My party and I have always co-operated to ensure the best outcome for Ireland.  We have been critical of the Government's preparedness.  With regard to the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, 40% of which was supposed to be ring-fenced for the agrifood sector, just one in five eligible loans for that sector have been approved, a measly &euro;3.8 million or just 1% of the total &euro;300 million.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, still has not published her analysis of the impact of Brexit on reciprocal arrangements and social insurance schemes.  Why has it not been published?  </p>  <p>  We still have no solutions as to how we will cope with delays at Dover.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the heads of Bill that have been published, why, when other countries such as France and Germany have published legislation, have we only been given the heads of a Bill and not a full Bill?  Given we could provide feedback on it, would it not be prudent and in the country's interest to publish the full Bill?  While the T&aacute;naiste says preparations have been stepped up, there is evidence to suggest the contrary.  </p></speech>

That has been very clear since we began discussing this issue at the start of January.  Let us not try to create problems or crises where they do not exist.  We have enough challenges to deal with in Brexit without trying to create new ones.  We agreed - I hope, anyway - how the House might co-operate to get emergency legislation through if we need to.  That set of legislation is more comprehensive than any other country has been planning for.  My understanding is the legislation the French Parliament was considering was to give essentially emergency powers to a Minister to be able to act in an emergency.  We have gone way beyond that.  We have effectively produced 17 heads of Bill from nine Departments.  We will publish a full Bill on 22 February and we will ready to go with a schedule to get it through this House if we need to get it done and put in place.</p></speech>

My position has remained unchanged.</p>  <p>  In terms of our own preparations, can the T&aacute;naiste clarify the Taoiseach's comments in Davos about Army personnel on the Border?  Can the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether anybody spoke to the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces before those comments were made?  The questions being asked are reasonable.  To suggest there is full agreement on the strategy is not fair or an accurate reflection of what has been said..  We have met regularly but I have always said I felt it was very late in the day to publish a full Bill on 22 February given other member states published their legislation a long time ago.  We are the most affected member state.  </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has not addressed the criticisms regarding the take-up of Brexit supports, which are low.  Just 3% of Enterprise Ireland firms have taken up the Be Prepared grant.  According to AIB, in quarter 3 last year, only 5% of SMEs had a Brexit plan.  They are fair criticisms and the T&aacute;naiste has not answered the questions.  The answers have not been provided.</p></speech>

None of them has the common travel area arrangements we are putting in place.  The reason we did not sign confirmation of memorandums of understanding and common travel area arrangements in December was we did not want to be seen to be sorting out Irish citizens while we were still negotiating as a collective.  The Deputy knows that.  We have discussed it.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the co-operation of all parties in the House on this issue.  It is not party-political.  It is not a Government versus Opposition arrangement in terms of some of the emergency stuff we may have to do together.  There are clear reasons the earliest we could have published the detail of detailed legislation of the scale we are proposing is 22 February.  Most people who have been following this understand that.</p>  <p>  With regard to what the Taoiseach said in Davos, which is a fair question, if one listens to the interview, he was asked to describe what a hard border would look like and he described it.  It essentially reminded people of what things were like more than two decades ago.  </p></speech>

Both the Irish and British Governments have committed to the maintenance of the common travel area and the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing reciprocal arrangement in any circumstances.</p><p>I updated the Government on the common travel area at its meeting on 15 January 2019.  Considerable progress has been achieved bilaterally in discussions with the UK over the past year involving several Departments in what has been a whole-of-Government exercise.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s shared aim with the UK throughout has been to ensure the necessary arrangements are made in both countries so the common travel area can continue to function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.  The bilateral work undertaken reaffirms the existing common travel area arrangements between Ireland and the UK and recognises the shared commitment of both to protect the associated reciprocal rights and privileges as a legitimate and fundamental public policy.  It reaffirms the status that Irish and British citizens enjoy in each other's state, including the associated reciprocal rights and privileges covering free movement, the right to reside, the right to work without special permission as well as access to healthcare, social security, education at all levels and the right to vote in local and national parliamentary elections on the same basis as citizens of the other jurisdiction.</p><p>Neither Irish citizens in the UK nor British citizens in Ireland are required to take any action to protect their status and rights associated with the common travel area.  After the UK leaves the EU, both Irish citizens in the UK and British citizens in Ireland will continue to enjoy these rights.  Both the Irish and British Governments have committed to undertake all the work necessary, including through legislative provision, to ensure that the common travel area rights and privileges are protected.  Bilateral arrangements as appropriate to each area of the common travel area will be concluded in due course and at the appropriate time.  Some of that means legislation, both primary and secondary, but most of it is policy co-ordination.</p></speech>

It has never been codified in law, so the specific entitlements have never been set out and, therefore, could never be tested.  It is a cause of concern that we will now have to do that for the first time.  It is a reassurance that it will be a support for people, but it might have implications.  For example, Dagmar Schiek, professor of European law at Queen's University, has asked fundamental questions about the rights of the spouses of Irish nationals, etc.  These are things we need to set out.  It is no longer an agreement; this will be a formal document that can be tested in the courts.</p>  <p>  We need to see it and test it to ensure that, as the T&aacute;naiste has said, it reaffirms all existing rights and entitlements.  Will it be a document that can expand into the future to accommodate additional rights that might accrue to Irish citizens in the way that in the past the common travel area broadened over the decades?</p></speech>

There was a choice to be made here as to whether we would put in place a formal legal treaty on the common travel area on a bilateral basis between Britain and Ireland or whether we would do it through this memorandum of understanding, which would have some legislative element to it.  I understand we chose the memorandum of understanding mechanism to have the flexibility to deal with the kinds of potential issues the Deputy has raised.  I am not suggesting they relate to spouses.  As a result of the fact that the common travel area was in some ways quite a loose arrangement, we did not have a single item of legislation which addressed it in total; it went across multiple items of legislation.  It built up as an understanding between the two countries over decades.</p></speech>

It was at least a recognition of each other's citizenship in our countries.  When we joined the European Union, the Single Market and the customs union, much of that formality was never needed because it was overtaken by EU membership.  The absence of the UK's EU membership obviously exposes some of that, which is why the memorandum of understanding is needed.  There has been much discussion on the detail of that, including discussion with the EU, in order to ensure people are satisfied with it.  When we are ready to publish that, we will share it with Opposition parties straight away.  However, it is not in a condition to be published just yet.</p></speech>

It was unfortunate that last week the Polish Foreign Minister decided to publicly to make the statement he did.  I think he was trying to be helpful, but I do not think what he said was helpful.  He came to Dublin in December.  He had just come from London.  At the time, as a way of trying to break the deadlock, he raised this idea that we should consider applying a time limit to the backstop.  I informed him I did not think it would work and that Ireland could not accept it because once a backstop has a time limit, it is no longer a backstop unless there is a clear plan after the agreed period that prevents border infrastructure.  He accepted my view in December, but last week he made the proposal again.</p>  <p>  No other Foreign Minister to whom I have spoken or met has suggested anything similar.  In fact, quite the opposite happened after he spoke.  There was a line-up of EU Foreign Ministers essentially who backed Ireland's position.  The Polish Government also did so and distanced itself from its Foreign Minister's suggestions.</p></speech>

We need that solidarity, particularly at this critical time.  It is important that the other member states remain firmly behind Ireland and its position.</p>  <p>  The amendment tabled by Tory MPs today in the British House of Commons seeking to change the backstop and seeking alternative solutions is of great concern.  It is even worse to see the British Prime Minister backing that amendment but not stating what might be that alternative solution.  Obviously if there is an alternative solution that does exactly what the backstop does and is better, we will be all ears.  However, as yet we have not seen that alternative solution.  After her team negotiated the current backstop, it is deeply regrettable to see the British Prime Minister now seek to abandon the backstop or undermine it significantly and state today that she intends to go back to Brussels to reopen the withdrawal agreement.  What is the Government's response to that?</p></speech>

We will need to assess where we stand after those votes.  This is a ratification process or it is supposed to be.  Unfortunately, there are attempts by some - we do not know if it will get a majority - to reopen the negotiations as opposed to concluding the ratification process.  For us, that is not helpful.  We need to wait and see what the British Parliament votes for or does not vote for this evening before we can make an informed response to that.</p></speech>

The EU deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, said that the UK had significant input into shaping the backstop and it was its preference for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union rather than having a specific arrangement for Northern Ireland.  It is deeply challenging when those who negotiated the backstop are now seeking to undermine it and amend it in some way without evening proposing what that amendment might be.</p>  <p>  Ms Weyand also clearly stated that there is no negotiation between the EU and the UK, and that the negotiation is finished.  However, for some reason this seems to have fallen on deaf ears in the UK.  The British are still very much beating the drum that the negotiation can be reopened, that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated in some way and that the backstop can be altered or that conditions could be attached or in some way time limited.  I would be deeply concerned if the Graham Brady amendment were to be supported and voted through.  The Irish Government is still very much behind that agreement and we would love to see it passed.  However, if that amendment is passed, it would leave the withdrawal agreement as negotiated in a very precarious position.</p><p>From our perspective, the onus is now on the Irish Government to outline what happens next, in the event that the position of the UK Government is that it wants to reopen the issue of the backstop.  Where do we go from here?</p></speech>

We will know later on today and will hopefully have a clearer picture of what the majority in the British Parliament is seeking.  We have an idea of what the majority does not want but we do not yet know what a majority is willing to support.  Seven or eight amendments will be taken in Westminster this evening.  Let us wait and see.  This is a debate for the British Parliament to manage but obviously the Government and the Prime Minister have a big input into it.  We must wait to see the combined effect of the votes this evening before responding.</p></speech>

In addition to the hazards of war, many have difficulties in accessing food and healthcare due to insecurity and poor humanitarian access.  Millions of others are unable to pay for food and medical care even when it is available due to the collapse of the economy under the strains of conflict.  This crisis in Yemen is a matter of grave concern and a solution is urgently required.  </p>  <p>  The United Nations plays an absolutely critical role in working towards a political solution to this conflict.  Ireland and the EU regard the appointment of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in March 2018 as a very positive move.  Mr. Griffiths has worked tirelessly to bring the parties together, with EU support.  At the very end of 2018, his efforts bore some fruit with the holding of talks in Stockholm between the Yemeni parties.  This meeting was the first time in two and a half years that both the Government of Yemen and the Houthi leaders came together to promote the interests of the Yemeni people.  However, this is only the beginning of what may prove to be a long and painstaking process.  It is expected that the next round of talks will take place in the region.  Their success will be dependent on progress made since December and in that regard implementation of the agreements reached in Stockholm will be crucial.   In December agreement was reached on the basis for a ceasefire and troop redeployment in the port city of Hudaydah, the key point of entry in Yemen for the majority of food, medicine and aid.  The ceasefire is fragile and both sides have accused the other of breaches but notwithstanding that, it is holding for the most part.  </p>  <p>  What is needed now is time to allow the agreements to be implemented and space to allow the UN sponsored talks to continue.  However, that does not mean that we sit back and do nothing.  The UN Secretary General has urged the international community to sustain pressure on both parties as they work together to implement the Stockholm agreement.  Careful diplomacy is required to ensure we achieve the best end result for the people of Yemen.</p>  <p>  We discussed the situation in Yemen at the EU Foreign Affairs Council last week.  The UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without it, including reaching out to Iran.  However, as my Swedish colleague confirmed to me, what was agreed at Stockholm is fragile and needs EU support to move forward.  Therefore, despite these hopeful steps, we should be under no illusion as to the gravity of the situation.  After almost four years of conflict, the humanitarian situation on the ground remains dire, with a devastated economy and an almost complete collapse in basic public services exacerbating the crisis. </p>  <p>  The UN has a crucial role to play in co-ordinating the delivery of assistance.  The UN reports that the gravity of the humanitarian situation in Yemen is exacerbated by the underlying poverty of the country.  Even when there is food in shops, people are often unable to afford it.  Humanitarian access is also a critical issue and access across Yemen deteriorated significantly in 2018, both in Government and Houthi-controlled areas.  Security issues, bureaucratic impediments and delays to humanitarian movements continue to interfere with humanitarian responses.</p>  <p>  In terms of humanitarian funding, Ireland has provided almost &euro;17.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015.  This includes a contribution of &euro;5 million to the UN Yemen humanitarian fund in 2018, which provides assistance in areas such as education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health.  We plan to make a similar &euro;5 million contribution to the humanitarian fund in 2019.  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s direct assistance in 2018 was channelled through the UN humanitarian fund for Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland and Saudi Arabia have a significant economic relationship but our trade partnership does not prevent us from raising human rights concerns through the most appropriate and effective channels.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy has always been based, above all, on the resolution of conflict by dialogue.  In many cases, continuing our trading relationships and building on our close ties allows us greater access to key interlocutors who can be influential on foreign policy decisions.</p>  <p>  On the question of an arms embargo, I am aware that some EU member states which have arms industries have decided to halt arms exports for the present to countries involved in the conflict in Yemen.  A decision at EU level for a full arms embargo on any country would require the agreement of all EU member states but there is currently no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia or any member of the coalition.  However, all EU member states have signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty.  This treaty exists to ensure that arms sales do not fuel conflicts and to prevent arms from falling into the hands of non-state actors or terrorists.  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of that treaty. </p>  <p>  I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern on this issue.  The scale of need on the ground cannot be overstated.  While Ireland is contributing what we can to the humanitarian effort, we must continue to push for a lasting political solution that will address the conflict at the heart of this extraordinary human suffering.</p></speech>

The Minister's response which refers to poor humanitarian access and the collapse of the economy due to conflict ignores the fact that these are not accidental by-products.  Famine is not a side effect but a deliberate tactic by Saudi Arabia.  This is an orchestrated situation.  We know, from evidence given, that Yemen's geography is such that to destroy its farmland is something that one must go out of one's way to do.  It does not happen by accident.  The fact that hundreds of Yemeni fishing boats have been shot to pieces by machine gun fire from Saudi helicopters is not a coincidence.  It has to be organised.  The blockade of Hudaydah was calculated and organised because it is the only port in Yemen capable of bringing in food supplies from abroad through the overseas humanitarian aid programme.  The aid programme was deliberately obstructed by the Saudi bombardment in the area.</p>  <p>  It is time to do a lot more than just utter stern words and talk about negotiations.  Much more is needed when this deliberate tactic is leading and contributing to people's deaths.</p></speech>

Much of the focus of the briefing we received at the meeting in Brussels with Martin Griffiths was on the port of Hudaydah in terms of, first, ensuring there was not a massacre there and, second, ensuring that the port could facilitate delivery of aid, medicines and so on.  I assure the Deputy the issues in regard to Yemen have been the source of intense discussion at EU level, repeatedly, and interaction with the key UN person involved in trying to ensure that a ceasefire sticks this time.  Sweden has played a proactive and helpful role in that and will continue to try to do so.  In this instance, Ireland is most effective being part of a collective voice from the European Union rather than demanding to do things on its own.  I do not think that would work.</p></speech>

Mr. Saleh was implementing neoliberal policies and the people were resisting them.  He was thrown out and replaced by Mr. Hadi, who, when he ran out of rope, ran away.  The war started in 2015.  There is zero justification for the Saudi UAE bombing of Yemen, with the support of eight countries, many of which sit at the table with the T&aacute;naiste.  This is ludicrous.</p>  <p>  On the arms issue, an end-user certificate system exists, which the Saudis and the UAE were supposed to sign up to but are abusing left, right and centre.  The guns, arms and munitions being sold to the Saudis in UAE are ending up in all kinds of groups in Yemen.  They are on both sides of the conflict at this stage.  The Saudis are using al-Qaeda and ISIS to fight the people of Yemen and they are arming them illegally, with no repercussions.  Why is Europe not addressing the breach of international law around their use of the weapons that the US, UK, France and others are giving them?  Nothing is being done about this.  The more guns that go into Yemen, the worse the situation becomes.  The only ones losing are the ordinary people of Yemen.  It is mindless.</p></speech>

Any country that signed up to the arms trade treaty of 2014 has a legal obligation to ensure that if it is selling arms they do not end up in the hands of non-state actors, of which there are many in Yemen.  That is an enforcement issue.  Ultimately, we need to focus on the core issue, which is how we stop the conflict, the bombing and the targeting of people and, most important, how we ensure that the ceasefire that exists, which is fragile, lasts such that a political dialogue can be built over time.  In the meantime, we are focussed on getting supplies of aid and medicines safely to into communities that desperately need them and ensuring that the millions of euros of support aid committed by countries such as Ireland gets to where it needs to.  We can talk about how we got here and what should and should not have happened, on which I know the Deputy has strong views, but in the here and now, we have a ceasefire that is fragile, an agreement that comes out of Stockholm, and we need to try to make it stick.</p></speech>

European countries sometimes take a separate stand.  For example, prior to the latest slow walk to a coup in Venezuela, the Spanish Minister was backing Mr. Maduro and giving him a chance to work things out.  In the past few days, the French and the Germans declared that if there are no elections within ten days, they will support Juan Guaid&oacute;, which is nonsense.  There were elections last year in Venezuela, which because the opposition was not in a position to win, it decided to boycott.  Before the votes were counted, countries in the EU were saying that the elections were legitimate.  There is no logic to it.  I find it heartbreaking that Ireland will not publicly support somebody who has been elected.  He may not be brilliant but he was elected.  Let us leave this to the people of Venezuela and not interfere.  It seems Ireland is going to join the other countries in this regard; likewise, in Yemen.  How can we continue to trade with Saudi Arabia in light of the sanctions or boycotts we have in place with other countries?  How do we justify this?  The Israelis are shooting at will through a fence and the Saudis are starving people to death and we think it is okay to impose sanctions on other countries and not these countries?  Will the T&aacute;naiste explain that?</p></speech>

The problem is that Ireland and the EU have not been effective.  For example, last year, the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning the starvation of civilians in war time and particularly on behalf of the Yemeni civilians but they are still starving.  That is the point.  They are starving as a result of deliberate, orchestrated tactics by Saudi Arabia, which have occurred with only a verbal reprimand.  The EU - and Ireland in particular because last time I checked we were a sovereign nation that has the right to make policy itself - should make a stand against the trade and sale of our beef and baby formula to war criminals who use their might to ensure that ordinary civilians die in other countries.  This would be far more effective because the tactics we have used up to now sadly have not worked.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that such missions are an opportunity to sell Ireland abroad.  Traditionally, these missions have been to countries with which we trade significantly.</p></speech>

He is the person from whom I take our lead in terms of what we do and say.  We have had a number of engagements with him at an EU level.  The focus was very much on Stockholm for the end of last year to try to bring the parties together, to try to get a basis for a ceasefire and to try to ensure that we avoided what many regarded as a likelihood slaughter in the port of Hudaydah.  We are trying to make progress on that.  This is where the focus should be in reaching a political solution.</p><p> On the questions raised by Deputy Niall Collins, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is going to Cuba and to Mexico after that.  The truth is one does not cut out countries from which one has a different political perspective in terms of diplomatic missions.  Cuba is changing.  The relationship between Cuba and Ireland is improving.  That does not mean we agree with the political approach in Cuba on every issue.  We do not.  It is a legitimate exercise and we will visit 56 countries in total, if one takes all the ministerial visits.  There will be a big emphasis on the EU for obvious reasons around Brexit and solidarity.</p> <p> We are also increasing our presence in Latin America and South America.  We are two opening to embassies this year, one in Santiago and one in Bogota.  We have a growing trade relationship with Mexico and have had good engagement with the new government.  We need to visit a broad perspective of countries and that is the context of Cuba being on the list.</p></speech>

This was despite the fact the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in December 2016, ruled that Western Sahara is a separate and distinct territory that cannot be included in EU-Moroccan agreements unless the people of Western Sahara give consent to this.  They have not consented to this.  Can the Minister outline why the EU supports this deal extending to Western Sahara and why we are ignoring the rule of the CJEU?</p></reply>

This agreement was the subject of a legal challenge at EU level and in December 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the EU-Morocco Association Agreement and the liberalisation agreement between the EU and Morocco did not apply to Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Council authorised the European Commission to open negotiations with a view to providing a legal basis to grant preferences to products originating in Western Sahara.  Last year, EU member states agreed to sign the proposed new agreement and the European Parliament gave its consent earlier this month.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently emphasised that any amendment to the existing agricultural agreement with Morocco must be consistent with the December 2016 judgment of the CJEU.  My Department has received assurances from the European Council legal service that the new agreement fully respects both international law and the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the proposed amended agreement is understood to be purely provisional, pending the resolution of the dispute through the UN, and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.  The agreement is entirely without prejudice to the position of the EU on the question of sovereignty over Western Sahara.  In other words, there is nothing in the terms of the proposed agreement or its protocol which would imply EU recognition of Morocco&rsquo;s sovereignty or sovereign rights over Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU recognise the United Nation&rsquo;s classification of Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory.  We fully support the ongoing UN efforts to assist the parties in reaching a lasting political resolution to the dispute in Western Sahara.  The personal envoy of the UN Secretary General for Western Sahara, Horst K&ouml;hler, has conducted extensive stakeholder consultations in recent months.  These consultations resulted in a round table meeting on Western Sahara in Geneva in December last with representatives from Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria and Mauritania.  I welcome this meeting and I hope that it will lead to the renewal of the negotiations process.  This is the only path towards a sustainable resolution of the conflict which is mutually acceptable and provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p></speech>

In fact, the UN-recognised representative of the Saharawis is the Polisario Front.  Not only has it not given its consent but it has indicated that it will take a fresh case to the CJEU to try to block this deal.  The CJEU ruling was clear.  It said the EU would violate EU law if it included the territory of Western Sahara into a trade agreement with Morocco without the prior consent of the people of Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  Instead of asking the Saharawis for acceptance or prior consent, the European Commission undertook a consultation process as to how it wanted an EU-Morocco agreement to benefit the populations.  My concern, and that of others, is that it would benefit illegal Moroccan settlers and not the indigenous Saharawis.  Some 94 Saharawis groups have condemned the EU for its negotiations with Morocco and this fake consultation.  There was no discussion.  The rapporteur of the consultation report, Ms Patricia Lalonde, MEP, had to resign her position before this report came to the floor of the European Parliament.  It was found that she was sitting on the board of a Moroccan lobby group.  There was no consultation or discussion with the European Parliament.  Does the Minister accept we are sending the wrong message in relation to this deal?</p></speech>

This consultation process concluded that a majority favoured amending the EU-Morocco Association Agreement to extend its tariff preferences to products from Western Sahara, primarily due to the expected benefits in terms of the economic development of the region.  It is true to say, as the Deputy said, that the Polisario Front did not wish to take part in the consultation process and together with a number of NGOs expressed negative views on the proposal to amend the agreement.  I understand the criticisms were primarily motivated by concerns that the tariff preferences would maintain the <i>status quo</i>in Western Sahara which they consider to be under Moroccan occupation.</p></speech>

Considering Ireland's historical position in regard to Western Sahara and the illegal occupation by Morocco, it is a sad day that we are supporting this.  I find it astonishing that we seem to completely ignore how this disagreement violates the EU's own rules and the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  On the one hand, we say we support these rules but on the other, we seem to be moving ahead on this.  It does not add up.  The people of Western Sahara have not given their consent to this deal but it would appear to be moving ahead despite that lack of consent.  The primacy of trade over human rights and the development of the people in this region is completely wrong.</p></speech>

It is true to say that Polisario Front did not involve itself in that consultation for the reasons the Deputy outlined.  That is why I say the proposed amended agreement is understood to be purely provisional pending a resolution of the dispute through the UN.  We are looking for a resolution to this dispute.  We support the UN's position on Western Sahara.  In the meantime, there was a consultation on trading arrangements that involved Western Sahara, so there are conflicting priorities and views here.  I do not believe it is quite as simple as the Deputy makes out.</p></speech>

This is a priority for the Government given its importance for Irish exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the Single Market, particularly with regard to agrifood products.  This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.</p><p>Retaining the effective use of the landbridge post Brexit has been discussed at both political and official level with the UK and the EU.  As a result of these contacts, the importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised through the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft withdrawal agreement.  This reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU member state or another country, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>To this end, I welcome the EU's agreement that the UK may join the common transit convention upon its departure from the EU and that a number of the formal steps to allow this to happen have been completed.  The UK&rsquo;s accession to the common transit convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU member states via the UK landbridge.  Work is also progressing with the European Commission and affected member states with regard to the Union's internal transit procedures and infrastructural solutions at EU ports to facilitate transit post Brexit.</p></speech>

Two thirds of our exports to the Continent, comprising 3 million tonnes or &euro;100 billion worth of trade in 150,000 trucks per year, go over the landbridge.  The UK exit from the EU will obviously complicate that.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, the UK has signed up to the common transit convention but it is my understanding that agrifood products and live animal products are not covered under the latter.  The T&aacute;naiste might clarify whether that is the case.  He might also clarify what will be the role of non-Irish citizens driving trucks.  For example, if a Romanian or a Polish national is driving an Irish truck, will he or she still be covered under the common transit convention in order to access the UK landbridge?  Will he also address the congestion that may be faced by trucks at Dover, as I understand this has still not been resolved?  Will he confirm whether he has raised the ownership of Rosslare Europort with his counterpart in the UK?</p></speech>

In simple terms, the common transit convention effectively means that if one seals a container in Dublin and it is going to France, Belgium or the Netherlands, it should be able to be transported across the British landbridge and back into the Single Market without being checked.  While it may have to be scanned while passing through, the goods should not have to be checked.  That is what we are trying to achieve in order that Irish trucks will not be treated as coming from a third country outside the EU and re-entering the Single Market.  That is what should be facilitated.  Of course, it is not as straightforward as that because if the connectivity between the south coast of England and the EU Single Market through France in particular, but also the Netherlands, is not as seamless as it is today, then Irish trucks will get stuck in that traffic and they will certainly not be facilitated to skip the queue easily.  We have spoken to our French counterparts about trying to differentiate between goods that originate in the UK and those that originate in the Single Market in Ireland and then come back into the Single Market to ensure that Irish trucks, where possible, do not get stuck in the same parking and inspection systems as British trucks.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste only touched on one of them.  I will repeat the other three.  Does the common transit convention apply to agrifood products, fish products and live animals?  What is the position of non-Irish drivers driving trucks through the UK landbridge under the common travel convention?  Rosslare Europort was established under the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company by UK statutory instrument in 1898 and is effectively still controlled by the UK Government.  Has the T&aacute;naiste raised the ownership of that?  I have asked this several times as a parliamentary question in written form.</p></speech>

Rosslare Europort is owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, established in 1898 under a UK statutory instrument.  Its future is effectively controlled by the UK Government, which could dissolve that company in the morning if it wanted to.  It might like the idea of having a port still in the EU after Brexit.  Has that been raised?  I have asked this question numerous times in written form and it is probably an official from the Department who has been answering it.  This is an important issue and I would like a reply in respect of it.</p></speech>

Therefore, even moving within the Single Market as it is today, some checks are required, and that is unlikely to change in the future in terms of disease management.  I would hope there will be veterinary agreements in place between the EU and the UK in the future which would keep those checks to a minimum.  However, the container traffic travelling on the back of trucks should be able to be sealed and not have to be reopened and checked between Ireland, as part of the EU Single Market, when travelling across the UK as a landbridge and then back into the Single Market again.</p></speech>

Does this not concern Ireland and the EU?  Where is the talk of sanctions?  I listened to what the T&aacute;naiste stated in the context of these matters being before the courts.  That approach is interesting in view of the fact we are celebrating Ireland's independence, when many of the Irish leaders were in prison.  The people who are in jail believe in democracy and are non-violent but the Spanish response has been repression and the closing down of debate and the media.  The use of violence has come from the state, not from those who are jail.  I accept that it is before the courts but Ireland and the EU need to do more in this regard.  Yes, we are concerned about what is happening in Poland and Hungary, but we should also be concerned about what is happening in Spain.</p></speech>

However, I am interested in hearing about the numerous policy areas the Bill will cover in preparation for the event of Brexit.  I also wish to hear the Minister's view on whether the legislation will prepare us for every eventuality, given the uncertainty in Westminster today and no doubt in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There are nine Departments involved in contributing to the legislation, including the Department of the Taoiseach.  Essentially, there will be 17 pieces of legislation in one omnibus Bill.  We hope to publish the Bill on 22 February.  The legal draftspeople are working overtime to try to get it done.  We have given them the heads of the Bills from each of the nine Departments.  What this is about is legislating for a worst case scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, without proper contingency planning and without a transition period, which is what everybody wants to create the time and space to be able to put permanent solutions in place.  In that scenario we must protect our own citizens in a practical way.</p>  <p>  We must make sure that trains can continue to travel between Dublin and Belfast under a new environment because they will be travelling out of the EU into a third country and back in again.  We must ensure that British students can continue to come to Irish universities in the way that they do today and that Irish students can continue to go to British universities and get the kind of financial supports that they get today.  We must continue to ensure that children in Belfast who are being brought to Dublin for specialist paediatric care can continue to do that in a way that is catered for in law, and that in the same way the many patients from Donegal who go across the Border into Altnagelvin hospital will get the same kind of treatments.  We must ensure that people in Ireland who get pensions that are paid for by the British Government, and people who get pensions in the UK that are paid for by the Government continue to be able to hold onto their incomes in a way that is seamless after 29 March.  There are lots of practical areas to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Secondary legislation is also required to deal with issues such as the recognition of a British driver's licence in Ireland.  Those are all things we take for granted when we share a Union together, when we share a Single Market, and when we all operate to the same rules base and the same series of directives.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs I am concerned about such issues as intercountry adoption and education.  Those areas are of great interest not just to the committee but to the general public.  There are concerns over the time the Government has set out for the passing of this legislation.  The intention is to get it through the House in two weeks.  I accept the necessity to plan in advance but I am concerned over the likelihood of full co-operation by all Members of the House in order to expedite the passage of the Bill.  The Bill then has to go through the Seanad, which is an entirely different matter.  It would be worthwhile to arrange for a debate on this matter on or about the 22 February or at least to have statements involving the Minister and other Ministers on the progress of this matter.</p></speech>

We have asked the Business Committee to agree that we would waive pre-legislative scrutiny for this legislation.  In return, I am very anxious to meet the Chairs of all the relevant committees in the areas that relate to the omnibus Bill.  If necessary, we will facilitate sending officials into the committees, if Members so wish, to give full explanations and to tease out what is being proposed.  We can do that in advance of the Bill being published because we know what the heads are.  We can do a lot of the groundwork before 22 February so that everybody understands what is in the Bill.  Much of it is straightforward but there are some more complex areas where questions will arise and Members may wish to table amendments, which we will consider.  I will make myself and officials available to committee chairs and, if necessary, we can offer that the people who put the legislation together can address the committees, but what I do not want is to send the Bill to seven or eight different committees when it is published because I do not think we could complete it in the timeline that is needed.</p></speech>

There is nothing in the draft Bill that relates to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  That is not to say it will not affect children, especially in terms of intercountry adoption, the potential for interruption to education streams and also in healthcare.  I would be interested to hear if there is a specific part of the legislation that will cover matters relating to the Department or Children and Youth Affairs or whether it will just relate to the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health.

We have paid particular attention to the questions of administrative detention, treatment of minors and the increasing use of prosecutions to suppress legitimate protest.  Ireland also provides funding to the Palestinian NGO, Addameer, which monitors and works on prisoner issues.  We have also raised some of these issues internationally, including at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Of course, my officials do not, and cannot, follow up every allegation of mistreatment received.  The incident referred to was a large-scale search of the prison for contraband material.  Little is known about it in detail, although I am aware of allegations of mistreatment.  I know that Deputies have seen the same material, which was circulated by the Palestinian mission. </p>  <p>  It has been reported that Israeli authorities have consciously decided to introduce a tougher regime in the prisons in recent weeks, including restricted conditions for prisoners and ending the separation of prisoners from opposing factions.  I have no basis as yet to comment on this or on the specific allegations referred to by the Deputy.  Prison searches and other measures are not unknown in other jurisdictions.  However, I have not seen any security or practical rationale for such a change in policy, or any reference to similar changes being applied to Israelis who are imprisoned.  Issues to do with prisoners are always sensitive for both Israelis and Palestinians, and for obvious reasons they have the potential to have a wider political impact outside the prisons.  </p>  <p>  I am also acutely conscious that similar and indeed worse criticisms could be levelled at prison conditions in many Middle Eastern countries.  However, it is obvious that Palestinians imprisoned by Israel should have the same conditions and protections as Israel considers proper for its own citizens in detention.</p></reply>

It is important that this issue be flagged.  The prison in question is the Ofer Prison.  It is one of the most notorious prisons in the occupied West Bank.  There are 1,200 Palestinian prisoners there at the moment who have been incarcerated without trial.  There are also 180 child detainees in the prison.  As the T&aacute;naiste referred to, more than 150 prisoners were injured last week, some with rubber bullets.  At the moment a hunger strike is taking place in response to the actions of a special forces unit called the Metzada unit.  The unit is a quite brutal force of the Israeli Prison Service.  The T&aacute;naiste should signal to his counterpart in Israel that human rights abuses by the Israeli authorities should not be acceptable under any terms.  I would appreciate if the Minister could convey that.</p></speech>

We debate it regularly here and I take questions on it regularly.  We do raise human rights concerns about conditions in prisons, particularly for minors.  I have raised it both in Israel and in other fora, and I will continue to do that.  I do not have the full details on this case so I must be careful not to make statements I cannot fully back up.  The broader question of conditions in prisons, which impacts on the broader political environment, is something we follow closely.</p></speech>

To put it simply, the Government needs to abandon this misguided plan.  I will give the Minister of State a very simple example.  Tony is a cancer patient and a constituent of mine.  He is a pensioner with a medical card.  He spends all of his small income on keeping his house warm and feeding himself.  His medication is covered by his medical card, but food supplements and vitamins recommended by his doctor for his health are not included under that scheme.  He has had radical surgery and to keep his body functioning, he needs a range of vitamins and food supplements because his body cannot absorb certain vitamins.  Currently, these cost him &euro;70 a month.  He cannot afford that.  If the new VAT level is imposed, that will go up to &euro;86.  That will mean he will not be able to afford them at all.  Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable that somebody who is ill and is suffering from cancer, whose doctor has recommended these vitamins and food supplements as absolutely essential keep his body functioning, should have to pay at all, or see any increases in what he pays?</p><p>He should abandon this, and these products should be covered by the medical card.</p></speech>

This move will have a profound effect on those who take vitamins as part of a health programme.  It will also disproportionately affect older people.  It will also have a profound effect on the many health food shops which will struggle to open because of this proposed hike.  A number of people who take supplements and vitamins as part of their health regime contacted our office over the weekend.  They stated that if this proposed VAT hike is implemented they will not be able to sustain their need for supplements and vitamins on their income.  That is not their fault.  The condition has chosen them, but that measure will disproportionately affect them.</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister of State has discretion as to whether to implement this hike.  There is major public opinion on this issue to the effect that if he implements this, it would be akin to putting VAT on children's shoes in the 1980s, and we saw how that ended up in terms of a Fine Gael Government.  He should have a serious rethink about it.  There is precedent.  In 2014, there was a proposal to put VAT on herbal tea and the Minister at the time abandoned it.  The Minister can do the same.</p></speech>

However, there is a Revenue concession which allows a zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small and the concession meant that vitamins, minerals and fish oil supplements were treated the same as food for VAT purposes.</p>  <p>  Since the 1970s, there has been significant growth in the number and complexity of food supplement products on the market, most of which are not covered by the zero rate concession such as supplements containing botanicals and bioactive substances.  While these new products apply at the standard rate of VAT, the growing variety of products on the market led to diverging views between Revenue and the industry over which food supplement should be at the zero rate versus the 23%.</p>  <p>  Revenue issued ebriefs in 2011 and 2013 in an effort to clarify that only basic vitamins, minerals and fish oil would qualify for the zero rate but disagreement on the applicable VAT rate and queries on specific products continued.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the current concession has become problematic because of the efforts by some in the industry to exploit the concession to extend the zero rating beyond the scope permitted by Revenue.  Some businesses have challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products, giving rise to concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  The issue was raised during the debates on the recent Finance Bill.  Deputies and Senators looked for clarity for industry on the VAT treatment of food supplements and sought the retention of the zero rate for certain categories of food supplements.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed that he would ask his officials to address the matter in the context of the next Tax Strategy Group and stated that he would not interfere in any decision made by Revenue on the matter in the interim.  </p>  <p>  Revenue published new guidance on 27 December concerning the rate of VAT that applies to food supplements, announcing its intention to apply the 23% VAT rate to most food supplements with effect from 1 March 2019.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Association, will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  It is possible to retain these products at the zero rate because they qualify as oral medicines, which are charged to VAT at the zero rate in Ireland under an historical derogation to EU VAT law.</p>  <p>  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of industry in regard to this matter.  That is why, independent of Revenue's decisions on interpretation, the Minister agreed to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State get off the script for a minute?  I asked him a question about Tony, who is suffering from cancer.  Currently, he is paying &euro;32.95 a month for a probiotic; &euro;10 for thiamin; &euro;10 for magnesium; and &euro;20 for Vivioptal.  Recommended by his doctor, he needs these products for his health and he is paying &euro;70 a month for them.  He should not be paying that at all.  If this VAT change goes ahead, he will be paying &euro;86.  He cannot afford that.</p>  <p>What is the Minister of State's answer to that?  Does he believe Tony, who is ill, or other vulnerable elderly and sick people who need these products to maintain their health, should be paying for them?  I believe they should be covered by the medical card.  Does he think it is in any way acceptable that the price of those products will increase and make them unaffordable?  These are products doctors are recommending in many cases for the maintenance of people's health.</p></speech>

Currently, if I buy fast food, the VAT on the fast food is 13.5%.  However, if I want to buy a bottle of cod liver oil after 1 March, if the Minister of State gets his way there will be 23% VAT on it.  That does not make sense.</p>  <p>  The Minister can gauge opinion in this House, but sometimes it is a bubble.  However, a petition on this matter online has been signed by 25,000 people.  It is asking that a stop be put on the proposed VAT hike.  I am sure that figure will grow over time.</p>  <p>  The Minister has four weeks to think about it.  He can use his discretion - it has been done before - because this measure does not make any sense.  It will have a disproportionate effect on millions of people who use vitamins.  I ask him to take guidance from our comments and review this decision.</p></speech>

They are independent of the Department of Finance, and the Deputy knows that well.  The Revenue has decided to bring clarity to the matter.  What the Minister committed to doing, which was more than fair and reasonable, was to have a proper analysis done by the Tax Strategy Group in respect of the zero rating or the rating of VAT at 23%.  That is what he said he would do and, having sat down and gone through the analysis with the officials, that is what we will do.  That was agreed at the time of the last budget.  The Deputy was in the committee meeting and if he chose to accept the Minister's word at that stage, he should accept it here and now.</p></speech>

I will not comment on an individual case on the floor of the D&aacute;il as I do not believe it is appropriate.  However, from my perspective and the perspective of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the food and supplements sector will get a fair hearing from the Department of Finance.

The fact that strike is happening is an indication of the crises that exist in the health service, of which the nurses are at the front line, and a scenario whereby their wages are inadequate.</p><p>They endure pay inequality and they cannot survive considering the cost of living increases, particular in respect of housing.  That strike looks as if it will go ahead.</p> <p> It is also only one week since we had a day-long strike of 500 paramedics in the National Ambulance Service, NAS.  I was on the picket line last Tuesday with those workers, as were many of my colleagues.  I can report back to the Government that the strike had great public support.  A lot of people were beeping indicating their support for the strike.  I can report back that the paramedics who are organised in SIPTU refused to cross the picket line and the strike was incredibly successful.  If the Government does not know, I can tell it that the paramedics gave reports of the kind of difficult working conditions that they face.  They are also underpaid and they are at the very front line of an under-resourced health service and dealing with people at the first point of contact in difficult circumstances.  They have very difficult jobs.</p> <p> Some 98% of them voted for strike action in this instance for a simple reason.  They are part of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, which is a branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  The HSE refuses to engage with the union of those 500 workers, who make up a significant proportion of ambulance workers.  It refuses to engage with the union of choice of these workers.  It is outrageous that a public sector employer would refuse to engage and it gives a green light to private sector employers to engage in the short of union busting we have seen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-29a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900034#GG00200"><p>At the end of the week an announcement will be made by NASRA, which is a branch of the PNA, on the future days of action it will be taking and that will include a two-day continuous strike.  Without the Government wishing to give itself more grief on the question of the health service, this dispute could be ended simply and without costing anyone a penny, except for the paramedics and ambulance drivers themselves because then they could properly pay their union dues.</p>  <p>  The HSE deducted union dues from members of NASRA for seven years.  NASRA has between 500 and 600 members out of a total of 1,300 paramedics.  Approximately 50% of the membership of the paramedic services and the NAS are members of NASRA and, for seven years, the HSE formally recognised them by deducting their fees and then last year it stopped taking deductions at source from any new members who joined NASRA.  The Minister of State knows exactly what I am referring to, being a long in the tooth trade unionist like myself.  Then in August it ceased all NASRA deductions.  The HSE has provoked and manipulated the situation and it has goaded these workers into a dispute because it is refusing to deal with them.  The HSE suspended four of its members in Cork last week who refused to work for a continuous 20 hours because they said it would have been contrary to their health and safety.  Those members have since been reinstated.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State as somebody who has fought for trade union rights for as long as he has, that it is not his decision, the Minister's, the HSE's or my decision who represents the paramedics, which union they join and when they walk into a meeting, and who they take with them to act on their behalf as members of a trade union.  It is their decision and their right.  In a liberal Government that talks a lot about choice and moving forward and all the rest of it, the very least it could do is give these workers a right to be recognised and join the trade union of their choice, not the Minister of State's choice nor mine.  All that the Minister and the HSE are doing is causing more havoc in the health service by refusing them that right.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  Industrial action was taken on Tuesday, 22 January, between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. by NASRA, a branch of the PNA.</p>  <p>  The PNA held a meeting of its executive on Friday last, 25 January, to determine its course of action.  Media reports are stating that NASRA members intend to go on two more strikes on consecutive days, the dates of which are yet to be announced.  I understand that the NAS has yet to receive formal notification of these strikes.</p>  <p>  NASRA represents approximately 350 front-line ambulance personnel out of a total NAS workforce of 1,800.</p></speech>

The HSE was advised that full emergency cover would be provided during the action.  This meant that all emergency calls would be responded to.  In addition, the NAS put robust contingency arrangements in place to provide additional emergency cover.  The Defence Forces were also on standby, if required.  The intention was to minimise any disruption and to ensure that patient safety was not compromised.  The service responded to more than 600 calls by 5 p.m.  These included a number of hospital transfers, more than 70 intermediate care calls and two helicopter call-outs.  There were 12 calls involving Army personnel.  The situation was closely monitored by NAS management until 8 p.m.  The service confirmed that there was no negative impact on its ability to provide patient care and service delivery.  This was due to the implementation of its contingency plan.</p>  <p>  The PNA states that its industrial action is in connection with the following: a dispute over the automated deduction of union subscriptions from member's pay - the HSE is refusing to facilitate payroll deductions at source of union subscriptions to NASRA, as it does not recognise NASRA; and refusal by the HSE to engage in negotiations with the PNA or to recognise the PNA as union representatives when representing its ambulance personnel members.</p>  <p>   It is important to again state the factual position on this dispute.  NASRA, which is affiliated with the PNA, is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  The PNA also does not have negotiating rights on behalf of ambulance personnel.  The legal position is clear.  The HSE and the NAS have no obligation to recognise NASRA or the PNA for ambulance personnel.  The PNA, which is a non-Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, affiliated union, has negotiating rights for nurses working in the psychiatry and intellectual disability sectors.  The main union recognised by the HSE for ambulance front-line grades is SIPTU.  F&oacute;rsa and UNITE also represent ambulance grades.  The HSE deducts subscriptions at source for ambulance staff who are members of SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and UNITE.  This is consistent with the fact that these are the unions recognised as representing ambulance grades.  The HSE does not carry out deductions for subscriptions to NASRA, as it is not recognised.  Facilitating deductions at source is not a legal right, rather it is a concession granted to recognised unions.  As far as the Government is concerned, there are sufficient unions available to ambulance staff and it does not intend to recognise this group.  Of course, individuals have a right to membership of any trade union.  However, they do not have a right that such membership is facilitated or recognised by their employer.</p></speech>

He said: "As far as the Government is concerned, there are sufficient unions already available to ambulance staff."  As my colleague, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we do not care what the Government thinks about which unions workers should be in.  The workers decided that their membership of SIPTU was not sufficient and they set up NASRA.  That is their right.  It is not 350 but 500 of them who are in NASRA and it is outrageous that a public sector employer would not negotiate or deal with the union of choice of its workers.  It is absolutely scandalous and what message does it send to employers such as Lloyds Bank, Tesco, etc.?  It sends a message that the Government will actively encourage the kind of union busting, derecognition tactics that are ongoing.  It is scandalous and anyone who would call him or herself a trade unionist and would participate in a Government that would stand over such a line is making a big mistake.  The HSE is making a big mistake.  It is opening up and it will be faced with two different fronts where it is taking on the nurses on the one hand while, on the other, NASRA would be absolutely correct to take further action.</p></speech>
