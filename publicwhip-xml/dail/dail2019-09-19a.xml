I wish Patricia Philbin, CEO, and all her team the very best of luck with all that.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes for Galway 2020.  Last night's launch was a great success.  I am sure it is a taste of things to come.</p>  <p>  The overall spending allocations for my Department for 2020 will be announced as part of budget Estimates 2020, which is due to be published on Tuesday, 8 October.  As budgetary negotiations are ongoing I am not in a position to comment in detail on my Department's 2020 budget allocation.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently announced that the budget will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.  Against that background, my Department will, within the resources available in 2020, continue to place emphasis on core functions and services, including measures to maintain the momentum created across the arts and culture sphere by initiatives funded by, or through, my Department, consistent with the Taoiseach's commitment to double the funding to the sector by 2025.  This allows my Department to build on the increased funding received in the 2019 budget, which was 10% in respect of the Arts Council, 11% in respect of Screen Ireland, 19% in respect of Creative Ireland and more than &euro;2 million in additional funding secured for our national cultural institutions which welcome more than 3.5 million visitors annually.  We will also continue to conserve and manage our heritage as a support to economic renewal and sustainable employment, in compliance with legal obligations, and to conserve and restore biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland to focus on the environment.  Measures will also further advance the statutory demand-led language planning process and ensure continued access to our islands.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to promote North-South co-operation, particularly in the context of An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland.  We will also continue to focus on Project Ireland 2040, which gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage for our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.  This recognition is underpinned by the commitment from Government to invest almost &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, language and heritage over the ten-year implementation of the national development plan.  Project Ireland 2040 provides for an investment of &euro;460 million in the national cultural institutions, &euro;265 million for a culture and creativity investment programme, &euro;285 million in our natural and built heritage and &euro;178 million to support and protect the Irish language, Gaeltacht communities and communities on our offshore islands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00700"><p>With Brexit coming down the tracks, I appreciate that it is incumbent on all of us to be prudent but artists are a huge asset to us nationally and should be treasured.  We should also put our money where our mouths are and invest in artists.  Budget 2018 was a dismal budget for the arts sector but budget 2019 represented a significant improvement on that.  There was, however, one major issue, which was the disconnect between the increase in funding for capital expenditure, which was a 39% increase, and the increase in current expenditure, which was a mere 6%.  At the time, I raised the point that the Government policy on arts and culture was focused on capital projects with little investment for the artists and their work.  Will the Minister assure the House that budget 2020 will at least put the artist at the centre of its budget demands?</p>  <p>  Has the Minister sought to develop any policy, funding or employment framework that would help to improve artists' pay and conditions, including access to and support of benefits?  There is little point in having our galleries and stages without the artists or actors to exhibit or perform.  In January the Theatre Forum review of artists' pay and conditions was published.  While not surprising, the findings were nonetheless depressing.  I believe that the opportunity and time has come to ensure our artists at least have an opportunity to have a sustainable income.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00800"><p>The Deputy referred to a 6% increase in current expenditure but it was actually 7%, from &euro;248.659 million to &euro;265.159 million.  The Deputy also mentioned a 39% increase in capital expenditure but it was actually a 36% increase.  It went from &euro;54.3 million to &euro;73.8 million.  There was a significant increase there.  The gross Vote allocation for 2019 was just under &euro;339 million, which is an increase of 12% on the 2018 Estimate.  Of this allocation, &euro;73.8 million was capital funds and &euro;265.1 million was current expenditure.</p>  <p>  On the artists, it is fair to say that there was a significant difference between 2018 and 2019, which the Deputy acknowledged in her question.  We increased funding to the Arts Council by 10%, from &euro;68 million to &euro;75 million.  The Arts Council is ultimately tasked with looking after the artists on the ground.  We have also had many other significant projects this year such as the Per Cent for Art scheme and the extension of the package for social welfare.  The Government is committed to helping the artists.  I will do everything I can to secure as much as I can for the artists in this budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900004#B00100"><p>The review carried out by Theatre Forum found that 30% of performing artists earn less than the national minimum wage of &euro;9.55 per hour that applied in 2018 due, in part, to the fact that 83% of performing artists are paid a flat fee regardless of the hours they work.  While it has been the accepted that that is the nature of their work, it is unacceptable that we would expect artists who operate in one of the most important industries for which we laud ourselves in terms of how it can be used to promote Ireland globally to work for &euro;9.55 per hour, which is less than the current minimum wage.</p><p>Budget 2019 provided an increase in funding to the Arts Council of &euro;7 million more than the amount provided in budget 2018.  The current level of funding, at &euro;75 million, still lags significantly behind the 2008 level of &euro;82 million.  For the Government to fund the arts at the European norm, it would have to allocate in the region of five times that amount.  This same adjustment would have to be made to all public arts schemes to ensure that the support reached European norms.  This is what we should be aiming for.</p><p>The article by Olivia Kelly in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times, </i>which suggests that people are to be banned from selling their work on Merrion Square next summer, is distressing for artists.  These individuals are trying to make a living, the exact topic we are discussing now, and they have been selling their work on Merrion Square for the past 35 years.  According to Ms Elizabeth Prendergast, artist and secretary of Merrion Square Artists Association, this decision will be catastrophic for artists who, as I have already noted, are trying to earn a living.</p></speech>

Taking budget 2019 into account, there has been a 37% increase in arts funding since 2011.  Unlike the unsustainable spending of Fianna F&aacute;il when in government, including in respect of the arts, current funding is sustainable and is based on the sound management of public finances by Fine Gael-led Governments since 2012.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's comments regarding artists, as I mentioned earlier and as she acknowledged in her initial remarks, the Arts Council received a significant increase in funding last year.  I will do my best in my negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to secure a further increase this year, bearing in mind the parameters and difficulties of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I also mentioned earlier that there had been a significant increase in funding for Screen Ireland.  The Deputy mentioned Galway 2020.  We provided &euro;6 million in funding for it.  We have also provided funding for the national cultural institutions and Creative Ireland.  The Government and I will continue to do everything possible to support arts and culture.</p></speech>

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I echo what Deputy Niamh Smyth said about an Gaillimh ar&eacute;ir.  I congratulate craobh Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann i gCathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, the Cahir branch of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and M&iacute;che&aacute;l and Mary Harty on hosting a wonderful traditional music festival is Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh last weekend.  It is through festivals like this that our culture, music, song and dance are nurtured.  It is very important that we support those and I compliment M&iacute;che&aacute;l and Mary Harty on their tremendous work on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  There is palpable anger and frustration in rural communities at the way the Minister just drove a coach and four through the regulations that were debated here for more than a year, passed by this House and the Seanad and signed into law by the President.  This July, the Minister decided to scrap those rules, which allow for hedge cutting in the interest of health and safety and things like that, instead of initiating legislation which was passed here in 2018.</p></reply>

I also give my thanks to Mary and M&iacute;che&aacute;l Harty.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the provisions under section 7 of the Heritage Act 2018 allow for the making of regulations relating to burning and cutting hedgerows.  Section 7(1) of the Heritage Act 2018 provides that, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I may make regulations to allow the burning of vegetation during certain periods in the month of March and in such parts of the country as specified in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  I made a decision last February not to make regulations to extend the season for the burning of vegetation into March 2019.  This decision was taken as there would have been no basis for me to do so given the fact that the relatively dry weather during the six-month period when the burning of vegetation could have been undertaken under the law, that is, September to February, inclusive, would not have precluded landowners from burning vegetation.  The existing provisions on burning in the Wildlife Acts therefore remained in force for March 2019.</p>  <p>  Regarding hedgerows, subsection 7(2) of the Heritage Act 2018 includes the power to make regulations to allow the cutting of roadside hedges during the month of August subject to conditions.  In July I announced that I would not be proceeding with the making of such regulations this year.  My decision recognised the increasing threats to biodiversity nationally and globally and follows a number of Government initiatives to protect and nurture Ireland's flora and fauna.</p>  <p>  There was extensive public debate and engagement by my Department and myself on this matter including during the national biodiversity conference in Dublin earlier this year, which I hosted together with the Irish forum on natural capital.  Arising from this conference, the Seeds for Nature initiative, which comprised a range of initiatives for nature and biodiversity, was launched.  In addition, there was a wide public consultation on the Heritage Ireland 2030 plan, debates in the D&aacute;il on biodiversity loss and the extensive engagement across Government on climate action, including on the part of my Department.  The report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action made a number of references to the importance of hedgerows.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding my decision not to make regulations to allow hedge cutting in August, I should point out that it is possible in accordance with the provisions of the Heritage Act 2018 and the Roads Act 1993 to cut roadside hedges in circumstances where road safety issues arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900006#D00500"><p>I said in July that there would be significant anger and frustration within rural communities when the Department confirmed, in response to a parliamentary question I submitted, that proposed regulations permitting the commencement of certain provisions of the Heritage Act 2018 are to be scrapped.  The reply confirmed that plans to allow for hedgerow cutting during the month of August have now been abandoned in support of moves to protect nature and biodiversity.  This is anti-democratic.  It is a dangerous and ill-conceived concession from the Minister and the Government, which is proving yet again to be totally clueless about the reality of living in rural Ireland.  Farmers and contractors are excellent custodians of the hedgerow and of nature.  We are not out there slaughtering the ditches.  We are acting in the interests of the health and safety of people trying to walk, to cycle or to enter or exit fields.  Bushes grow out into the middle of the road.  Tourists stop at road signs to try to clear them.  I refer to signs indicating very interesting places on our heritage trails.  It is farcical.  We debated this matter for nearly two years, meeting all groups and stakeholders, and passed a Bill which the President then signed into law.  Thereafter, the Minister acted at the behest of a small number of groups.  Those groups do good work as well, but we need balance here.  What is the point of having this Chamber and the Oireachtas to which we are elected if they are going to be undermined by conferences and groups campaigning on various issues?  We all know about climate change, but farmers and rural people are very caring of biodiversity and of hedgerow flora and fauna.  This is ridiculous regulation.  It is fine in Dublin city where there are roads with signs, but in the country some b&oacute;ithr&iacute;ns have been closed.  One cannot walk up the middle of them because of the briars that hang down.  These farcical regulations mean we are not allowed to cut them back in the interests of health and safety.  The health and safety of the birds and bees is more important than the safety of human beings.  That is where I draw a line.  I will not accept what is happening.</p></speech>

This is not remotely antidemocratic.  There were very good reasons that I did not extend the regulations this year.  Hedgerows provide a very important wildlife habitat.  As already stated, they provide food, shelter, corridors of movement and nesting and hibernation sites for many of our native fauna.  I also refer to the national biodiversity conference, the Seeds for Nature initiative and the very stark pronouncement on the <i>status quo</i>made by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which published its assessment on the state of the world's biodiversity and ecosystems in March this year.</p><p>The Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland gave its take on my recent announcement on hedge cutting.  In a short statement, it indicated that it was very pleased that I had retained the regulations to allow for roadside hedges to be cut for reasons of road safety.  As I have pointed out, things like overgrown hedges and fallen trees can sometimes narrow carriageways and force traffic into an oncoming flow.  Hedges can be cut for that reason.  If briars and overhanging branches are forcing pedestrians and cyclists from the road margins, the hedges can be cut.  Overgrown hedges blocking or impeding egress from farm holdings and fields can be cut.  Hedges concealing entrances or signage installed for road safety or direction can be cut.  Hedges concealing culverts or sharp bends can be cut.</p></speech>

Contractors and farmers are afraid to cut them because they will be photographed with mobile phones and reported.  It is nonsense.  There are signs covered everywhere I go in my county.  I refer to signs which indicate the way to particular places, speed limits and that there are dangerous bends ahead.  Access to and egress from fields forces the implements on the fronts of tractors out into the middle of the road.  It is highly dangerous.  It just shows that the Minister is out of touch and does not understand the reality of rural Ireland.  I invite her to visit any part of Tipperary.  I will show her countless signs, including those indicating national monuments, which are covered up.  It is farcical.  The county council is strapped for cash and uses a great excuse - it is not allowed to cut them.  Health and safety or road safety can go to hell.  That is the reality on the ground.  The hedges are not being cut.  They were always cut by county councils, but that is not being done now.  There are accidents and people get scratched and scraped.  We encourage cyclists, but people could not cycle on these roads without some kind of protective gear.  One would need a helmet to go up and down some roads.  That is the reality.  The Minister should know.  She visits Tipperary the odd time.  She has some relatives there.  It is no different to any other county.  This is patent nonsense.  It is literally usurping the power of this House to make legislation, which it did.  What is the point of debating here and consulting all the stakeholders?  We were at it for a year and a half and the Minister just decided to draw a red line through it and forget about it.  In my view, that is a subversion of democracy any day of the week.</p></speech>

Among the findings in the report I mentioned earlier is that the decline in the numbers of bees, butterflies and other insects has largely resulted from the effects of monoculture and the drive to ever-higher levels of productivity, characterised by loss or neglect of hedgerows, farmland edges and scrub.</p><p>It has also led to the deliberate removal of habitats, such as hedgerows and wetlands, and there has been some criticism of agricultural policy which does not support diverse hedgerows.  If I had been in a position to extend the regulations, I would have done so.  For all the reasons I have outlined, however, I was not in a position to do so and I stand by that decision.  It would not have been the right thing to do in these circumstances.</p></speech>

She experienced the great excitement in the area when she attended a recent public meeting hosted by the Monasterevin Blueway group.  Other public meetings in Rathangan and Athy were attended by officials from Waterways Ireland, including Mr. John Boyle.  These were very well attended and great interest was shown by everybody.  I have raised this matter with the Minister previously but my focus today is on the role of her Department and Waterways Ireland in rolling out this project to make it a reality.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900008#F00100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together. </p>  <p>  The Barrow blueway is a planned upgrade to provide a multi-use shared leisure route connecting Lowtown in County Kildare to St. Mullins in County Carlow, a distance of 115 km of off-road, flat, accessible, public space.  Waterways Ireland is now moving forward with plans to develop the Barrow Canal towpath as a 46 km blueway from Lowtown to Horse Bridge in Athy.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council in partnership with Laois County Council and Waterways Ireland, with the support of my Department, made an application under the rural regeneration and development fund for funding for this development and the outcome of that process will be known before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has undertaken an economic appraisal of the development of the towpath, which concluded ultimately that benefit to the local economy of the development would be &euro;2.5 million per annum from tourism and recreational spend, with a payback period of less than five years.  The project to enhance the Barrow towpath will create approximately 90 jobs during the construction phase and create an estimated 130 direct and indirect jobs in the tourism, recreational and hospitality sectors in the area.</p>  <p>  The blueway will link and connect many communities along the 46 km route.  In developing the blueway it is hoped to engage effectively with those local communities and thus provide a sense of civic pride in areas that might otherwise by overlooked by visitors.</p>  <p> Waterways Ireland has considerable experience in developing blueways throughout the inland navigations, including the Shannon navigation in 2014, which attracts more than 100,000 visitors to the region, and generates an estimated &euro;4 million per annum for the local economy.  Waterways Ireland will actively work with other bodies in the region to progress the development of the initiative in Kildare and Laois.  It will provide assistance to the local authorities in sourcing appropriate funding for the project and will be centrally involved in the construction phase if funding is obtained.  It is this strong partnership approach among public sector bodies and the private, community and voluntary sectors that will ensure that ultimately the Barrow blueway will be developed, promoted and maintained for the benefit of the entire Barrow community.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to speak at a public meeting on 29 August about the Barrow blueway organised by Deputy Heydon in Monasterevin community centre.  I congratulate him on it.  There was a very good turnout.  In particular, we spoke about the significance for counties Kildare and Laois.  Some of the other officials, as well as councillors from Kildare and Laois, Mr. John Boyle of Waterways Ireland, Mr. Joe Boland of Kildare County Council and the local tidy towns group have done a lot of good work.  The Monasterevin blueway group has been integral to much of the progress made thus far.</p>  <p>  To provide background on the development of previous blueways by Waterways Ireland, the Shannon blueway attracts more than 100,000 visitors to the region and generates an estimated &euro;4 million every year.  Thanks to the collaborative approach by Waterways Ireland and Kildare and Laois local authorities, and the support of the local community, an opportunity has finally arisen for the development of the Barrow blueway.  The blueway should be an experience and perhaps the word does not fully capture what is on offer in such a project.  It is about much more than the water and water-based pursuits.  It offers opportunities for walkers and cyclists on the adjacent paths, connecting communities and enhancing the tourism potential of an area by showing off some of its incredible natural amenities.  It is also about preserving and protecting an artificial ecosystem with diverse species and an important water supply.  It is, and will be, a hook, and this was discussed at length at the meeting, to get people to stay an extra night in the area.  Ultimately, this is what it is all about so that people will stay over and invest in the local economy.  To be realistic, this is a three-year project and, as with all projects, a funding package needs to be put together.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role she and the Department have played, along with Waterways Ireland, in making the crucial decision over the summer.  I raised the issue with the Minister prior to the summer recess.  We had lost out on planning permission to the element of the proposed blueway south of Athy.  At the time, the proposed blueway was 115 km.  It was a brave decision and the right decision to proceed with the 46 km for which we now have planning permission.  The people in Carlow who objected to this originally will, in time, look at us with great envy and wish they had this.  I hope that in time the challenges with regard to the full route can be met.</p>  <p>  The point made by the Minister about funding is very valid and I understand an application has been made to the rural regeneration and development fund.  I hope the Department is working closely with the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Minister, Deputy Ring, to put the best case forward.  Waterways Ireland has made a very detailed submission.  We will do everything to try to bring through the funding.</p>  <p>  What role does F&aacute;ilte Ireland have in funding?  Will it play a role in marketing afterwards?  We know the huge potential Kildare has to bring in tourists.  A large number of tourists travel through Kildare at present and our challenge is to get them to slow down and stay.  Many of them drive to areas beyond Kildare.  In 2017, the Waterford greenway had more than 250,000 visitors, with an average spend of &euro;29.50 per day or &euro;110 per person who stayed overnight in the area.  This is what we want to achieve in Kildare.  We want people to slow down, stay and spend time in the area and, obviously, leave more money behind them in the process.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development has a key role to play, as do other State agencies and Departments that can fund the blueway once it is constructed.  I hope we receive the grant from the Department of Rural and Community Development.  How will ongoing maintenance be funded?  What role will the local authority have in this regard?</p></speech>

This will be of great benefit to the area.  In future it would be good to see if we can roll out the full blueway but at least we have this element of it.  Planning permission for the remainder of the route from Athy to St. Mullins was refused mainly on the grounds of the impact it would have on the special area of conservation.  Waterways Ireland now wishes to develop the 46 km stretch in collaboration with Kildare and Laois local authorities.  The estimated cost of developing the 46 km route from Lowtown to Athy is &euro;6.8 million.  Earlier this year, Kildare County Council, in partnership with Laois County Council and Waterways Ireland, made an application under the rural regeneration and development fund.  We await the outcome of this process in the autumn.  It is this strong partnership approach among the public sector parties and the private, community and voluntary sectors that will ensure that ultimately the project will be developed, promoted and maintained for the benefit of the entire region.</p>  <p>  With regard to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as I said, the public meeting is an opportunity to explore what funding may come from it.  It is certainly something that should be investigated.</p></speech>

Another point she heard raised at the meeting organised by the Monasterevin blueway group, one that was also raised at the meeting we held afterwards in Athy at which there was an equally impressive crowd and energy, as was the case at gatherings in Rathangan previously, were concerns from local landowners.  These are challenges that must be worked through with the development of every blueway and greenway that traverses private land.  Points were made on drainage issues and roads and local bridges that might need maintenance.  Mr John Boyle of Waterways Ireland went into detail on navigation of the channel.  Engagement on ongoing maintenance will be very important after we obtain the funding and construction starts.  We will need a proper mechanism for engagement.  Will the Minister outline how this will work?  Will it be the responsibility of Waterways Ireland or the local authority?  Who will be the go-to person for people who might have concerns or to bring the issues that we will need to thrash out as it is being developed?  There is huge goodwill in Kildare and that is not to be underestimated in any way.  Therefore, it is all the more important that when local residents or landowners raise a concern they have an opportunity to be heard.  Local landowners know the local challenges better than anybody else and we want to ensure every potential problem that crops up along the way for our tourists, visitors and locals can be addressed in a collaborative way without causing upset.</p><p>A good engagement process throughout is really important.  Does Waterways Ireland or the local authority have lead responsibility for that?</p></speech>

Waterways Ireland is ultimately guided by a three-year aquatic weed management plan.  It is informed by operational needs and best international practice.  The plan considers both the protected and invasive aquatic weed species and pays due cognisance to the need for biosecurity during all aquatic weed control operations in order to minimise the spread of invasive alien species, which is important when talking about dredging and ensuring the canals are clear.</p>  <p>  Aquatic vegetation growing in the navigation channels is not removed by dredging but is controlled by weed harvester, a weed-cutting boat, during the growing season which is May to October as resources permit and it is currently ongoing.  We are aware of all these matters.  I know that some of the Members who attended on the evening discussed ensuring that the boats can go through the canal.  There is no point in having a canal unless it is properly maintained and looked after.  Waterways Ireland does as much as it can.  We want to be able to ensure that people can canoe and kayak, and enjoy a quality experience on our canals.  Waterways Ireland is always conscious of that with all its canals.</p>  <p>  There will be challenges in ensuring any kind of quality experience.  Waterways Ireland has worked in partnership with Sport Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other bodies to ensure that.</p></speech>

In 2018, a total of 1,606 venues across the island of Ireland participated in Culture Night, with an attendance of 420,000.  Nationally, events are run in partnership with local authorities.  Events were also held throughout Northern Ireland and overseas.  In 2018, Sligo hosted 38 events in 19 venues and welcomed 2,435 visitors.</p><p>Culture Night 2019 will take place on Friday, 20 September from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m.  Details of events in every area are available on .  It is anticipated that attendance figures will increase this year.  This year Sligo has been allocated funding of &euro;4,500 to assist with the cost of events.  This funding is provided on a matched funding basis through the local authority.</p><p>I know that Sligo has always been a place with a vibrant, active and devoted cultural community.  Some of the innovative events in the Sligo programme for 2019 include Art House Open Studio, Sligo Global Kitchen at the Model and Culture Comhr&aacute; at the Hawk's Well Theatre.</p><p>My Department has also allocated a further &euro;183,005 to projects in the Sligo area through my Department's Creative Ireland programme in 2018 and 2019, including &quot;His Deep Gaze&quot; and for activities in Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g.</p><p>The cultural scene is bubbling and bursting with new ideas and pioneering practices, and is winning the world over.  It calls on people across Ireland not to miss out and get out and support our culture creators, big and small, across the country on Friday.  Around every corner there will be something to explore from awesome animation and stunning light projections to rattling reading and pulsating performances, exhilarating exhibitions and resounding concerts.</p></speech>

I also welcome the funding given to the Model and to the Hawk's Well Theatre over recent years.  The Minister mentioned the events taking place.  I compliment everybody associated with Sligo County Council on their effort and commitment in recent years.  It is encouraging that the numbers have been increasing and we expect this trend to continue on Friday night.  The Minister has given considerable funding to the creative arts.  The funding of &euro;4,500 for Friday is badly needed by the local authority because matching funds can be difficult at times.  It is vital that people come out on Friday night, not just in Sligo but throughout the country.  It is encouraging to see the number of people coming out.  I ask that the Department consider funding for all these events again in the future.</p></speech>

The allocation of &euro;4,500 this year is the same as the amount allocated last year.  I have no doubt it will be put to good use on Friday night.  While in Sligo in March, I visited the Hawk's Well Theatre, which has received capital grants from the Department.  The Hawk's Well Theatre is a 340-seat theatre which hosts a diverse programme of arts and entertainment, including professional and amateur drama, a wide range of music from traditional and jazz to opera, dance, pantomime, children's theatre and comedy.</p>  <p>  On 19 May I attended the national Famine commemoration in Sligo town.  I also visited the Model, home of the Niland collection, which features one of the largest public holdings of works by Jack Butler Yeats.  It also features a broad range of traditional and contemporary works by artists, including Norah McGuinness, Dorothy Cross, Alice Maher, Clodagh Emoe, Eamon O'Kane, Se&aacute;n McSweeney, Estella Solomons and Paul Henry among others.</p>  <p>  I also attended the launch of Project Ireland 2040 at the Institute of Technology Sligo on 15 February 2018, when we announced the details of almost &euro;1.2 billion in capital spending plans for my Department.</p></speech>

The Minister is right in what she said about the Hawk's Well Theatre.  That money was very well received.  Work is about to begin on a major development in the theatre.  Wonderful works are being done at the Model.  Great credit is due to the staff at the Model and the Hawk's Well Theatre as well as to the people supporting those fine facilities in Sligo town.  The Minister has been to the Model on a number of occasions and she also went to the Hawk's Well Theatre to announce additional funding.  She will have seen the enthusiasm in both those facilities which is replicated in many others.  Sligo County Council has a number of events in the programme for Friday night.  The Minister has always been very supportive on her visits to Sligo and the announcements made in respect of the two major projects at the Hawk's Well Theatre and the Model.</p></speech>

At the Hawk's Well Theatre this Friday, Rafeef Ziadah and Sorcha Fox will perform &quot;Sendiana&quot;, which is about exile and terror.  I expect it to be really powerful.  Sligo Global Kitchen at the Model will bring communities together to enjoy a global food experience.  The Yeats Society in Sligo will host &quot;Sisters, Sisters, Sisters&quot; by storyteller Imelda Ryan Jones.  People will be able to tour the Sligo Masonic Hall and learn about the Masonic order.</p><p>I also mention the small-scale local festivals and funding schemes for summer schools.</p><p>In 2019 the Sligo Feis Cheoil received &euro;2,000, the Yeats International Summer School received &euro;5,000 and the Enniscrone and District Community received &euro;1,500 for the Black Pig Festival in 2018.<br/><br/>I will continue to support Sligo in any way I can.  I hope that all the Members present enjoy Culture Night. </p></speech>

The Wildlife Act 2018 affords protection to a range of habitats and species and provides for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect biodiversity is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department.  These regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union and give a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each member state.  The main instruments provided for are the designation of special protection areas, SPA, aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds and special areas of conservation, SAC, aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats.</p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's national biodiversity action plan.  The most recent plan, Ireland's third, was published in October 2017 and contains a range of actions to protect and conserve biodiversity, including measures to restore and conserve habitats and protect vulnerable species.</p>  <p>  The NPWS, working together with national experts and colleagues in Northern Ireland, produces regional red lists for the island of Ireland.  Red lists are published on an irregular basis as datasets and the necessary national expertise for taxonomic groups become available.</p>  <p>  In addition, threat response plans are being prepared by NPWS as part of Ireland's response to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in case C-183/05 and the requirement to establish a system of strict protection for species listed in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  These plans provide detailed information on range, distribution and habitat.  They also focus on the particular threats facing each species and identify the measures required to address these threats, as well as identifying who is responsible for implementing them and providing a timeframe for delivery.</p>  <p>  The NPWS will continue to monitor and assess the status of vulnerable species in Ireland and takes into consideration any appropriate responses possible within their remit and the resources available to the Department, including specific schemes to address particular threatened species.</p></speech>

People tell me regularly that the corncrake is nearly a thing of the past.  It is vitally important that the Department, the officials and the Minister do everything that can be done, particularly to enhance or increase the special areas of conservation to help protect the various birds and animals that could be extent in a few years.  They are threatened unless we now take action.  The Minister has outlined that and I appeal to her on my behalf and that of my colleague to do whatever is possible to ensure they are protected.</p></speech>

The population of corncrakes in Ireland has been monitored annually since 1993 but it is critically low, with an estimated 83% decline between 1978 and 2018 with only 153 calling males remaining.  The breeding range population declined by 86% between 1972 and 2018.  Since 2005 the population has remained stable and there are nine special areas of protection which have been designated for the protection of breeding corncrake populations in Ireland with an estimated 70 calling males, approximately 45% of the total national population.  There are many positive outcomes and conservation measures we are undertaking for the corncrake.  They include the provision of early cover dominated by broadleaved herbaceous species such as the iris or nettle, the suitable corncrake friendly mowing machine with late cutting, a friendly mowing pattern and late cover provision by leaving some field strips unmown until September, maintaining early cover strands through to the season&rsquo;s end and field operations reduced or removed from late April and general access to meadows kept to a minimum from May to August.</p></speech>

However, I understand that the National Museum of Ireland is at the initial stages of planning a major new history of Ireland gallery which will eventually cover the period from 1600 to the present day, which will be located at the Museum of Decorative Arts and History at Collins Barracks.</p>  <p>  The galleries will offer visitors an opportunity to explore the key events in Irish history leading up to and including the momentous events of the period 1912 to 1923.  They will also provide a compelling, accurate and interactive account of the basic tides of Irish history since 1600.  They will deal as much with the social, economic and cultural changes that affected everyday life, as with the political and military events that dominate most popular understanding.  It is the museum's intention that the first phase of these permanent exhibition galleries will open in 2022 at the Museum of Decorative Arts and History, Collins Barracks and will cover the period of 1900&ndash;2022 to coincide with the conclusion of the commemorations around the decade of centenaries and the foundation of the Irish State.</p>  <p>  This major new exhibition will be considered in the context of the ongoing development of the Decade of Centenaries Commemoration Programme.  In the meantime the Museum will also be working on other aspects of the overall exhibition covering the period 1600 to 1900.</p>  <p>  The question of funding for this exhibition will be considered when the Museum has drawn up detailed plans as part of the overall funding arrangements for both the Museum itself and the Decade of Centenaries Commemoration Programme.  I look forward to working with the Museum in relation to this programme.</p>  <p>  The National Museum is at the initial stages of planning a major new history of Ireland gallery.  I think that will be of interest to the Deputy.  The museum has held several exhibitions which also explore various aspect of this period, including Soldiers and Chiefs - the Irish at War at Home and Abroad which traces Ireland's military history from 1550 into the twenty-first century.  There was also one entitled Proclaiming a Republic: The 1916 Rising which explores the background to the Rising.</p></speech>

I am also aware that 22 years ago it moved much of its collection to Collins Barracks.</p><p>I have a particular interest because my father worked in the National Museum for more than 30 years.  At the time of the move to Collins Barracks, we were told the site would allow for a large expansion in the exhibition space in order that the museum could display much of what was in its vaults in collections that had been unseen by the public for many years.  Some 22 years later, the space used within Collins Barracks remains limited.  The large undertaking the museum has proposed will require money to open more gallery space and showcase much of the Irish history that is not fully explored and interpreted in the existing exhibitions.</p> <p> I accept that the Minister is not directly involved in dictating the content of exhibitions.  When the museum comes looking, as it will have to because it has been starved of funding for many years, I hope the Government will not be found wanting in ensuring there is no delay in putting on the exhibition they have outlined.</p></speech>

I will negotiate with the Minister for Finance in respect of my budget for culture this year and how it will be of value to the National Museum of Ireland.  As we know, under Project Ireland 2040 significant funding will be invested in the museum.  We do not as yet know from the National Museum of Ireland what the detailed plans or costings are for the exhibition, although I believe that it hopes some funding will be available.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Museum of Ireland has a master development plan and has published a 15-year master vision statement, which may be pertinent to his question, for the period 2018 to 2032 that sets out plans for the transformation of the museum into an institution of international standing.  Physical developments throughout the museum site over the next 15 years will be underpinned by three principles: to protect it and provide the best conditions for the care of its collections and access for educational research; to safeguard it and ensure that all the National Museum of Ireland sites are safe and secure for the collections and the public; and to promote accessibility to make the museum's sites, exhibitions and interpretations fully accessible for everyone.  It is envisaged that a separate master plan will be developed for each site, underpinned by the principles.  The Collins Barracks site, which the Deputy mentioned, will be developed as the headquarters and focal point of all the National Museum of Ireland sites.  New galleries will be developed for earth science and world culture, while on-site facilities will be developed to provide improved access to collections.  As I outlined, an extension will be added to the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street, while a link will be provided to the museum of archaeology in Kildare Street.</p></speech>

During the period, particularly until 2016, there was specific funding for legacy programmes.  I encourage the Minister, if possible when it arrives on her desk, to examine the plan for the exhibition at the museum from 1900 to 1922.  At the very least, it should be considered as one of the legacy programmes to be held at the end of the decade of centenaries, which runs from 2012 to 2023.</p></speech>

The National Museum of Ireland, along with all the national cultural institutions, will have a major role to play in how we tell the story and commemorate it properly.  The Department is developing specific proposals for a co-ordinated, cross-governmental commemorative programme for 2020 and indicative plans for the remainder of the decade of centenaries.  The work will continue to be informed and supported by the expert advisory group, with which the Deputy will be familiar, on the centenary commemorations.  It will also be developed in consultation with the all-party consultation group on commemorations.  I hope to be in a position to give further details in respect of the programme in due course.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of the commemorative programme to date, local authorities, our national cultural institutions, trade unions, the media, institutions of learning and custodians of records, together with creative communities, will have a leading role in supporting the national conversation about events during the period and encouraging respectful and authentic engagement, debate and analysis.  There are plans for 2022, in particular, as the Deputy noted.  The first phase of the permanent exhibition galleries will open in 2022 at the museum of decorative arts and history at Collins Barracks and will continue the period 1900 to 1922-----</p></speech>

Under the programme, the Department was allocated almost &euro;1.2 billion for capital expenditure over a ten-year period to 2027.  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, I published Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, 2018-2027, a ten-year plan setting out the detail of the Government's commitment for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage as part of Project Ireland 2040.  A significant focus for my Department over the next ten years will be on enhancing the cultural infrastructure in Dublin city, recognising the challenges our national cultural institutions have experienced over the past decade.  Outside of the national cultural institutions investment programme, and as part of our wider investment in cultural infrastructure under Project Ireland, we also support a wide range of smaller projects in Dublin.  Such projects are designed to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the existing cultural infrastructure and include projects such as the redevelopment of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Responsibility for local cultural spaces rests in the first instance with local authorities, which are charged under section 10 of the Planning and Development Act with adopting a development plan that integrates the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population.  Adoption of the development plan is a reserved function of the local authority.  While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on planning matters, my Department works closely with local authorities to support culture, creativity and heritage activities throughout Ireland, including in Dublin. </p><p>In April 2019, I held a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity after hours as an alternative and complementary option to Ireland's existing rich night-time experience.  My Department has also worked with key partners to develop an approach to support a sustainable and forward-looking infrastructure to facilitate the development of after-hours cultural events.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>It is my intention to establish pilot projects to identify how a night-time culture initiative might work in both urban and rural settings.  To this end, my Department will approach a number of local authorities to establish a group comprising representatives from the relevant local authority, local creative nightlife sector, policing, transport, and artists and creative workers.  The purpose of this group will be to consider and collate what supports and impediments currently have an impact on opportunities for creative and cultural activity at night, in different settings, and what would be required locally to develop, promote and encourage late-night culture.  The groups will also consider the appropriateness of appointing local night-time commissioners.  </p><p>In parallel to the structured research initiative, I intend to establish a national forum comprising my Department, the National Transport Authority, the Arts Council and several other Departments with important roles in developing night-time infrastructure.  The committee will consider matters arising from the operation of the pilot local groups that could require a national policy or legislative response, which would, in turn, be referred to the relevant Department or agency for consideration.</p><p>I also intend to engage with local authorities and arts groups on a mapping exercise of existing venues and civic spaces that may be suitable for night-time cultural events to identify both gaps and opportunities.</p></speech>

They feel that, bit by bit, our cultural capital and identity are being eroded by the loss of such venues to make way for hotels, student accommodation and apartment blocks.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We know the Government has not helped with the housing crisis.  However, I appreciate that ultimately it is the work of the local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister mentioned Project Ireland 2040 and providing investment of &euro;40 million for cultural infrastructure nationwide, with a need to ensure regional balance.  Outside the investment for our national institutions, what money is being spent on cultural spaces for our capital?</p></speech>

With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have allocated an amount up to &euro;3 million in principle to Dublin City Council for capital development works for studio workspaces to match funding provided under the urban regeneration development fund on sites owned by the city council.  This level of investment will greatly benefit the artists in the area and address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin city.  The Deputy acknowledged that this is primarily up to local authorities and councillors, who have a function with respect to artist studios and spaces.  We are working in collaboration and there are discussions on what else we can do to help artists with the space they have to be creative.</p></speech>

We read in this morning's newspapers the details of the attack and the injuries suffered by Mr. Lunney, and they are absolutely appalling.  It is the type of attack we thought had ended on this island.  Mr. Lunney was kidnapped by four masked men, thrown into the boot of a car and driven away from his family home to an isolated spot where he was aggressively and savagely assaulted.  As a consequence he is enduring life-changing injuries.  I am sure everybody will join me in wishing him and his family well during this very difficult time.  I hope everybody in the House joins me in saying there is no room on this island for that kind of attack and for somebody to be treated in that manner.</p>  <p>  It is worrying that there has been a pattern of attacks on both people and property over a number of years that culminated in this attack on Tuesday evening.  Today, the chairman of Quinn Industrial Holdings has stated he is "frustrated and angry" more had not been done to protect Mr. Lunney.  There have been a series of attacks on property and people and there appears to be complacency in dealing with the matter and pursuing those who are responsible.</p>  <p>  What has the Government done in the 48 hours since the attack to ensure extra Garda resources will be made available and that it can co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, so that, once and for all, there can be a strong policing response that will send a message that we will take no nonsense?  What kind of engagement has there been with executives from Quinn Industrial Holdings to assure them that the Government understands the pressure they are under and it will not stand for this kind of behaviour?  Will extra resources be made available?  My colleague, Councillor John Paul Feeley, suggested a specialised unit from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI to root out the problem once and for all.  I know the T&aacute;naiste will join me, as I hope everybody will, in condemning the attack.  It is worrying that a complacency in policing has led to the attack.  Once and for all we must drive out that complacency.</p></speech>

I am glad he has done so because it gives me an opportunity to express support and sympathy for the Lunney family and Mr. Lunney in particular.  This was a shocking incident and many people today are talking about it, as they were yesterday.  A completely innocent person coming home from work had his car rammed before being brutally pulled from the vehicle by a gang of masked men and taken across the Border and beaten in a way that will potentially leave life-changing injuries, both mental and physical.  He was left in a ditch.  It is shocking and the response needs to be very robust from both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it will be.  We cannot allow this kind of brutal intimidation, which is a reminder of the kind of gangland paramilitary-style punishment beatings of the past.  I do not say that lightly.  These are a way of intimidating people for whatever reason who are working in the series of companies that Mr. Lunney works with.</p>  <p>  I hope Deputies will appreciate I am somewhat limited in what I can say about this awful incident, given it is now subject to a significant investigation by both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, I join the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality in condemning in the strongest possible terms the attack that took place.  This was an act of cowards in many ways who have no regard for the rule of law on either side of the Border.  I understand both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducting a major inquiry into the incident and are determined to find those responsible and bring them to justice.</p>  <p>  Let me be clear that no stone will be left unturned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the PSNI and both police services will relentlessly pursue these individuals.  I wish them well in their inquiries and encourage anybody with information on this matter to come forward to the Garda or the PSNI as quickly as possible.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has requested that the Garda Commissioner keep him personally updated on progress in this investigation.  I have had responsibility for relationships with Northern Ireland for the past two years and I can confidently say the relationship between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is probably stronger now than it has ever been.  This is a case on which they will work very closely to try to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  With respect to broader Garda resources, Garda strength in the northern region now stands at approximately 1,500, which is an increase of 150 since the end of 2017.  It is also worth mentioning that there will be an armed support unit in Cavan, and armed support units have now been established by the Garda Commissioner in all regions to provide an armed response capacity on a regional basis to support and supplement the national emergency response team.  There continues to be a Garda focus in the Border counties and this incident is a reminder of why that is necessary.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that this is the culmination of a number of attacks that have gone on for two years, including a previous attack on Mr. Lunney when he had his nose broken.  Another executive had boiling water thrown in his face.  As I said, there seems to be complacency in seeing through the investigations and people are getting away with these attacks.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's indication there will be a massive investigation but the Government must send a signal of confidence to the business and investment communities that this kind of thing will be pursued and people will follow through on the investigations.  It is a challenging area in which to do business, as Deputies Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth have continuously highlighted.  Unless and until somebody is brought before the courts for this wave of attacks, the perception that people are getting away with this will go on.  We must draw a line under this.</p>  <p>  I want the T&aacute;naiste to give an assurance today that every possible resource will be made available and every possible political support will be provided, not just from the Government but from every party inside and outside this Chamber.  This kind of act cannot continue and somebody must face justice for what happened on Tuesday night.</p></speech>

This is not the first instance but it is by far the most serious.</p>  <p>  Both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will attach the highest priority to this case.  There is an obligation on the communities living in the area.  Many people know who carried out these acts and who is behind the brutality, intimidation and total lawlessness of what happened.  Those people need to come forward and help the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigations they will conduct and I strongly encourage them to do that.  This is not what people living in Border counties want or will accept and they need to work with the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to stamp it out and respond to an event that, quite frankly, could have resulted in a man's death.  It was a brutal assault that is going to have a considerable impact on both Mr. Lunney and his family.  It needs a quick response from the policing and judicial sectors.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in condemns the vicious and abhorrent attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, who was just doing his job and has been a part of creating employment for many people in the Border community.  I echo the words of the T&aacute;naiste that there is no justification for anybody to shield or cover those who are behind this attack - and, indeed, many other attacks - on individuals and properties related to Quinn Industrial Holdings.  I encourage those with any information, regardless of how insignificant they think it is, to bring it to the relevant authority.  This needs to be stamped out quickly.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the fact that thousands of school secretaries across the country will go on strike tomorrow and will begin an indefinite work-to-rule action until their modest demands are met.  This follows a breakdown in talks yesterday between their union, F&oacute;rsa, and the Department of Education and Skills.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that the staff are invaluable members of our school communities who often go beyond their job requirements to meet the needs of parents and pupils.  They work on the front line and they are the first port of call for parents and students.  Our schools simply would not function without them.</p>  <p>  Our teachers would agree that these staff are underpaid and undervalued by the Department.  School secretaries have my full support and that of Sinn F&eacute;in in their dispute and claim.</p>  <p>  At the heart of the matter is a dispute that centres on the fact that the majority of school secretaries, just over 3,000 of them, receive as little as &euro;13,000 per year.  They also have irregular and short-term contracts with no pay during summer holidays, school breaks or at Christmas time.  It is beyond doubt that these secretaries receive low pay with little security.</p>  <p>  This is only compounded by the inequality within the system because, on one hand, a few hundred school secretaries are paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills with starting salaries of &euro;24,000 and, on the other hand, 90% of them are not.  Those who are not receive as little as &euro;13,000 per year.</p>  <p>  The importance of these staff will become clear tomorrow when they begin their strike at the start of the school day because their schools cannot function without them.  They are integral to the education system that needs them and, in that way, they are public servants who provide a service to our children and parents.  That cannot be disputed and is why Sinn F&eacute;in believes their claim is justified.  They should be employed as public servants with the same contractual security as their colleagues.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has failed to seriously engage with staff and union representatives in order to resolve this dispute.  The relevant Minister was made aware as far back as May of this year of the pay claim, the job insecurity and the two-tier pay structure but he has dragged his heels in reaching an agreement.  I am sure the Minister will claim that the specific responsibility for the employment, pay and working conditions of these staff rests with the schools through the capitation grants they receive and not with his Department.  Any of us in this House with children of school going age know that the capitation grants that are supposed to cover heating, lighting, insurance and teaching materials simply do not cut it.</p>  <p>  We need real action.  We need for these employees to be valued.  What will this Government do to avert further action and recognise the work and value of school secretaries?</p></speech>

F&oacute;rsa's pay claim is a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement which runs until the end of this year.  The Department's position is that the union's claim will be fully considered once the current costs have been determined.  The Department is conducting a survey of schools which closes tomorrow.  Bearing that in mind, any industrial action is surely premature and unwarranted, not least because the period of the current agreement has not even expired yet.  The current pay agreement committed both parties to engaging with one another in the course of 2019 to consider the nature of an agreement to apply from 1 January next year.</p>  <p>  The Department is not the employer of the staff concerned and does not hold current information on their pay rates and working hours.  A previous survey was conducted ten years ago and the current pay agreement has been implemented in the meantime.  The results illustrate that this matter presents significant issues for the Exchequer with a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per year in funding to allow for the employer pension contributions in State-funded community and voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department of Education and Skills engaged in an arbitration process with the union in 2015.  This resulted in a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13.  This arbitration agreement lasts until the end of this year and was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower paid staff.  For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then-minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015, prior to the arbitration, is now paid &euro;13 per hour which is an increase of 50%.</p>  <p>  Having said all that, my experience is that these issues get resolved by talking.  I encourage F&oacute;rsa to engage with the Department to try to find a way forward that avoids industrial action, including that scheduled for tomorrow, and the disruption that will cause to children, parents and the staff of schools.</p></speech>

They will argue that the departmental cost was submitted to the committee of the Department of Education and Skills in May of this year and the talks that took place this week were not about the substance of the claim but went around the houses on the costs.  There is frustration among the secretaries themselves and 94% of them voted in favour of industrial action and the strike.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that he values the work of these school secretaries and I do not doubt his bona fides.  I do not know the school secretary in the school the T&aacute;naiste drops his kids to.  Some 10% of school secretaries start on a salary of &euro;24,000 and go up to &euro;40,000 but the school secretaries in the school I drop my kids to could be earning as little as &euro;13,000 per year with no payment at all over Christmas and Hallowe'en, among other conditions that do not exist for other public service employees.  That inequality is the core of this issue.  School secretaries do so much and go beyond the call of duty to keep schools together despite the different additional burdens placed on them.</p><p>How can we ask them, if we truly value them, to continue to do that job while their colleagues in other schools are earning twice, if not three times, as much as them?  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that the issue of pay must be dealt with?  Does he believe that school secretaries should be recognised for the public service they provide as public servants?</p></speech>

There was is an ongoing consultation this year with a view to putting new arrangements in place for the start of next year.  I am not directly involved but I understand that a school survey is needed as part of that process in order to ensure that all those involved, particularly the Department of Education and Skills, understand the numbers and the facts.  That survey will conclude tomorrow.  Surely it is premature to trigger industrial action before the survey is complete?  I ask people to show some restraint and to give discussion a chance to produce a result that would be acceptable to both sides rather than resorting to industrial action tomorrow which will cause significant disruption in schools.  The Deputy is correct.  School secretaries are a hugely important part of the school infrastructure, staffing, the safe functioning of schools, looking after children and so on.  Given the nature of what is happening and what is under way, I appeal to F&oacute;rsa to look again at tomorrow's industrial action and to continue the consultation with the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900014#M00300"><p>Last Tuesday, when he took questions in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the Libyan detention centres, forced returns, the Mediterranean and the recent impasse.  His response to me was very strong, namely, that migrants stranded in the Mediterranean need a much better co-ordinated and collective response from the EU instead of the <i>ad hoc</i>, case-by-case management seen to date.  The T&aacute;naiste was critical of the EU being unable to agree collectively on an approach to migration and rescue.  He stated that a new system which will ensure survivors' well-being is being planned and that Ireland will be part of it.  That is very positive.  Other positive aspects are the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, peer reviews from 2014 and the mid-term review from 2016.  I understand that the current review, which will be published next year, will also be positive.  The reviews from 2014 and 2017 highlight Ireland's commitment to the least developed countries and the quality of our programmes there, which are focused on poverty and hunger reduction.  We have an excellent record in providing untied aid and there is a commitment to move beyond the 0.7% threshold.  However, that considerable regard for Ireland is being undermined by aspects of the increasing EU securitisation agenda.  The OECD DAC has concerns that overseas development aid can be used for activities that harm human rights.</p><p>I wish to raise two issues.  First, the European Peace Facility, EPF, which plans to make more efficient the deployment of military missions.  The EPF involves a component to train and equip foreign government military actors in fragile states by, among other things, providing weapons.  It has a potential budget of $10 billion for the next six years.  Compare that with $3.7 billion budget for the preventing conflict instruments of the EU.  There are concerns regarding governance and accountability if there is an oversight role for the European Parliament.  Where does Ireland stand in this regard, particularly in the context of the positives I have just outlined?  I accept that Ireland is trying to reach a coalition with like-minded states but it is obvious that more needs to be done to ensure that there is a publicly accessible list of the eligible equipment for the EPF which would exclude weapons and ammunition, ensure that civilian peace-building alternatives are considered first and to ensure accountability techniques for the potential misuse of military assistance and, of course, the protection of civilians.  There must also be transparency, so that there will be a timely disclosure of all EPF documents such as the proposals for action programmes and that they go to national parliaments and foreign affairs committees.  How can Ireland be the positive voice on humanitarian and human rights issues while at the same time not be as active on the EPF, which has the potential for over-reliance on force as a means to resolve issues?</p></speech>

That does not often happen in this House.  Normally, it is a case of criticism and defence when we discuss these issues, if "defence" is the correct word in this context.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows my views on the EU's responsibility for vulnerable migrants in the Mediterranean particularly in camps in Libya from which many are desperately trying to escape and are at the mercy of people traffickers who are brutal in their methods.  I am both disappointed and frustrated by the lack of the EU's capacity to respond comprehensively to the humanitarian challenge which we all face.  Part of that was driven by an inability to agree disembarkation procedures in terms of locations and so on for various political reasons I do not have time to go into.  I hope that we will be able to find a way forward that can allow EU involvement on a humanitarian search and rescue basis.  Of course, we must ensure that we are not encouraging people trafficking or creating any type of pull factor while at the same time ensuring that we are not knowingly allowing people to drown.  Given the resources that we have the potential to provide to ensure that does not happen.  I am proud to say that Ireland has made a very significant contribution in recent years.  Irish naval vessels have taken approximately 14,000 people from the waters of the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya.  We will continue to work with other EU countries to try to find and agree a more collective approach towards migration and accommodation of migrants and refugees if and when they disembark in the European Union, which is a challenge for Ireland in light of demands on housing, criticisms of direct provision and other challenges.  However, it is something we must do.  We cannot allow EU Mediterranean countries to carry the entire burden or what will happen - it has already happened in Italy - in the forthcoming general election is that people will respond by putting those who engage in hardline thinking on migration issues into office.  We need to work together to ensure that this does not happen and, in that context, we must help Italy with the burden it has shouldered.</p>  <p>  I will return to the EPF facility in response to the Deputy's supplementary question in order to give a more comprehensive answer.  There is a role for the EPF, for training and supporting countries in parts of the world that have been destabilised or torn apart by conflict to build security capacity.  However, Ireland's expertise and role lies in the areas of peacekeeping and the provision of civilian supports in post-conflict situations.  Those are the areas in which we have credibility and that is the emphasis in our contribution to most of these EU debates.</p></speech>

I will introduce another aspect, namely, the EU Trust Fund for Africa.  Much concern has been expressed on that, including by the EU Court of Auditors.  There is concern that the trust fund is spending EU aid money in ways that contradict development and undermine human rights.  Libya is one example.  It is money from the trust fund that is keeping detention centres there, in which conditions are appalling, going.  In the Sudan, EU funds have been used to train Sudanese border police and support the activities of the rapid support force, which is really the Janjaweed.  Ireland was rightly very strong in condemning the killings and rapes in Sudan some months ago but that violence is being carried out by forces whose training was funded by the EU.  The trust fund has also been misused in Eritrea and Niger.  All that has led to there being more deaths among migrants crossing the Sahara than among those seeking to traverse the Mediterranean.  Does Ireland have a legal obligation to contribute to the EU Trust Fund for Africa?</p></speech>

I am not sure of the direct answer to that question and whether that comes out of EU central funds we contribute to or whether it is opt-in funding from a trust fund.  I will check that and come back to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The EU needs to spend money in its neighbourhood to support fragile governments.  In some cases, it needs to support the training of police officers and military personnel.  For example, a number of Irish military personnel have been in Mali on a training mission for a number of years.  We are doing that in partnership with the UK and it is the one such peacekeeping operation we are carrying out in partnership with the UK.  I was there when I was Minister for Defence.  That mission is hugely appreciated and necessary in introducing sophisticated training capacity around demining, civilian protection and so on.  To paint EU funding of security training as a bad thing in all circumstances is wrong.  While we need transparency in how the money is spent and the results of same, we cannot solely focus on civilian engagement.  There also has to be EU support for state actors if they are trying to bring stability to fragile states.</p></speech>

Direct provision is a system for accommodating those who are seeking asylum and it is now 20 years old.  In general terms, it seeks to provide protection for those who are fleeing either political or religious persecution.  It is an outdated system and needs to change.  It was originally introduced in 1999 as a temporary emergency measure.  The system has had some modifications over the years, particularly following the McMahon report of 2016, but essentially the basic system remains. The McMahon report's terms of reference were to look at improving the existing system but it did not look at providing alternative systems for asylum seekers.  It looked at improving the speed at which their applications were processed and that was important for shortening their stays within the system.  However, many stay in direct provision for several years, even after they have been granted refugee status because they have not been integrated into the community and they cannot find independent housing.</p>  <p>  Ireland fulfils its obligations under international law by providing shelter, food, access to healthcare and education.  However, it has been criticised by human rights organisations on the basis that the direct provision system is degrading and dehumanising because it segregates asylum seekers into institutional care and does not integrate them into the community.  The demands on direct provision are increasing again, with more than 6,000 people in the system, including 1,700 children.  They are a vulnerable group of people who have to spend a prolonged period of time within direct provision.  There are 39 direct provision centres and almost every county has a centre.  Due to increased demand, asylum seekers are now placed in temporary emergency accommodation, even outside the direct provision institutions.</p>  <p>  In Clare, we have two centres, in Knockalisheen and Lisdoonvarna, and we are aware of the situation in Oughterard in Galway, which has been controversial over the past week or so.  The choice of a site now follows a familiar pattern.  There is an expression of interest, the locations are assessed, rumours circulate, fear of the unknown dominates discourse, protests opposing the location of a centre are held, tensions run high and people take up entrenched positions.  There is a lack of engagement with the community and a lack of assurances that communities will not be disadvantaged by having a centre close by.  There is a failure to assure that adequate supports will be put in place to provide adequate health, education, social inclusion and transport services.  Fear of the unknown drives anxiety.  Is direct provision a failed model and does the Government have anything to offer to provide new models of care?</p></speech>

There has also been debate about the location of centres.  I appeal to everyone to ensure this debate is thoughtful, respectful and factual, just as the Deputy's contribution was.  Under EU and international law, Ireland, like other countries, is obliged to examine the claim of any person who comes here and claims international protection or asylum under defined grounds, such as a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership of or participation in any particular social group or social activities.  While that claim is being examined, the State is legally obliged to offer accommodation and related services to anyone without means, including all meals, medical care and utilities.  A weekly personal allowance is paid to each person in a centre and exceptional needs are covered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There is no obligation on any asylum seeker to accept the offer of accommodation and no restriction on their freedom of movement throughout the State.</p>  <p>  I understand concerns have been raised by people in Oughterard.  This is the latest such case as other communities have also raised concerns.  Local communities have genuine questions.  Where centres have opened in new locations, the Department has engaged with communities, addressed questions and supported communities in establishing links to new centres.  I know people are unhappy that there are rumours, on the one hand, and a lack of information, on the other hand, in many cases but until the legal process is complete, the Department of Justice and Equality is somewhat restricted in what it can say.  This has caused a lot of problems.</p>  <p>  Direct provision was introduced 20 years ago, as the Deputy said, to deal with a situation where asylum seekers were effectively homeless.  Any credible alternative put forward must be capable of providing immediate access to food, shelter and medical care to vulnerable people, as the direct provision model does.  Since its inception, more than 60,000 people have been helped by the direct provision system.  There are positive relationships between residents and local communities in areas where centres are already open in the State, including through friends of the centre groups, which promote integration between communities.  That being said, direct provision is not ideal but we have to be honest too.  People who advocate simply doing away with direct provision also have an obligation to outline what we should replace it with.  We have a shortage of housing in the areas of social housing, affordable housing and rental accommodation.  We will fix that and I am glad to say that supply in all of those categories is increasing rapidly.  We also have significant increases in the number of people claiming asylum in Ireland and we need to ensure we can protect them and offer them shelter and support.  Although we need to ensure standards across all the direct provision centres are sufficient, consistent and above a certain threshold, for now direct provision is the way to do this.  However, we need to be open to change and to adapting that model to improve it in time.</p></speech>

One of the alternative systems is that, rather than having 120 or 220 people in one building, they would be dispersed throughout a community.  Many of these centres are located in rural Ireland.  One thing rural Ireland has is housing stock.  What it does not have is people.  Those people could be dispersed among communities and there is huge support for asylum seekers when they come to a community.  Lisdoonvarna is a case in point.  It was a controversial site in spring of last year and the community has embraced the asylum seekers who arrived in the town.  Voluntary groups come together to support them but they are still congregated in one location, usually in a hotel or hostel that is no longer used.</p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality needs to look at a new model of dispersing people throughout a community, whereby, rather than allowing them to be congregated, they are integrated into a community.  That is the direction in which the Government should go, which would counter what has happened recently with the protests in Oughterard.  The community there was not informed or given assurances that they would have the necessary supports to look after such a large group of people coming into a relatively small community.  However, if they were dispersed throughout the county or throughout an area, I do not think there would be the same level of opposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900016#O00200"><p>That is a fair point, and the truth is that the Government operates both models.  We have 38 or 39 direct provision centres across 18 counties.  Many other countries do not have that, but instead put nearly all their asylum applicants into one or two very large national centres.  We are trying to ensure integration across the country and that towns, which are sometimes small, have direct provision centres as well.  Irish integration has been quite good, considering the pressures that exist in that area.</p>  <p>  We also accommodate refugees whose asylum status is already settled when they come to Ireland, although it is often done quietly.  They are normally accommodated in private rental accommodation, in long-term leasing arrangements that ensure they are integrated and dispersed among communities.  It is a good model.  However, if we were to assign a percentage of social housing for asylum seekers or refugees, it could create a danger of resentment from people on housing lists.  We need to be careful in how we manage this, but Ireland, by and large, has been quite good at integration, which has been noted in international commentary as well. </p></speech>

The housing crisis is continuing, and giving more discretion to local authorities in how they manage their projects would assist in solving that crisis.  A commitment was given last year that that discretion would be increased and the limit would be increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  That limit can be increased with full transparency and oversight if there is a willingness to give local authorities that power.  I see the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, gearing up to respond.  Does he have any additional response to that which he gave the housing committee yesterday?</p></speech>

What I told his colleague at yesterday's committee meeting was that a commitment was made last year to review the public spending code, in order to see if we could increase the threshold from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  Doing that would require a derogation to the public spending code, which would have to come from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Upon review of what doing that would actually mean, I met with the county and city managers this morning to talk about housing delivery for this year.  We will deliver 10,000 new homes into the social housing stock this year, which is a huge improvement on previous years.  Increasing the threshold might save six to eight weeks on our timelines, but we would also risk delaying projects even longer, and in doing so, the Department would lose oversight of 44% of the capital budget for housing.  That is too much of a risk.  We want to make sure that we are properly overseeing capital spending on behalf of taxpayers.  I said yesterday that it would be reckless to lose oversight of more than 44% of the housing budget, and that is why the plan is currently not proceeding.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of insurance premiums, and the fact that certain sectors in Irish society, particularly the leisure, bouncy castle and paintballing sectors, cannot get insurance anywhere in Ireland or even in Britain, and are now closing down one by one.  Two adventure centres have closed down in Meath, as has a swimming pool in Kildare, a nightclub in Cork, and some bouncy castle operators.  Such businesses are closing down day in, day out, and these are only the ones hitting the headlines.  Companies are closing every single day as a result of hikes in insurance premiums or because no insurance company in Ireland or in Britain is willing to insure them.  The Government needs to get a grip on this, and should meet urgently with Insurance Ireland for some straight, tough talking.</p>  <p>  We cannot allow these jobs to go.  We cannot allow the tourism product that we and these companies have built up over many decades to be wiped out as a result of an industry that is unwilling to quote them, or that will quote them four times what they were quoted last year.  This is a crisis that affects the very fabric of Irish society.  As I said to the Minister at a committee last week, unless this is dealt with it is possible that a child will never experience a bouncy castle on the island of Ireland ever again, because no company in Ireland or in Britain is willing to insure bouncy castle operators.  That is just one example.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and his Government take action on this and hold urgent meetings with Insurance Ireland in order to give some succour to companies at their wits' end?  They know their policies run out in November, December, or January, and when that happens, they will be out of their jobs and their companies will have to fold.</p></speech>

I have met a number of those companies, particularly in relation to child activity centres which cater for children's birthday parties and so on.  In one of those categories within the sector, the only insurance company I am aware of that is quoting at all is based in the UK.  This is an issue.  We had a long discussion about this at a Cabinet subcommittee meeting recently and all I can say for now is that the Government is looking at this closely to see what more can be done.  We are somewhat limited in what is possible without changing the Constitution in some areas, however, there are some things we can do, and I expect the Government will come forward with some new thinking in this are in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

However, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, there are deeper issues within the Defence Forces, including pay allowances and conditions, which require urgent focus.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has agreed in principle to accept the Permanent Defence Forces Representative Organisation, PDFORRA, which is the representative body of active service personnel, as a member.  That is the right decision.  It is something the Labour Party has argued for in government in the past, and we passed a motion supporting this in the previous D&aacute;il.  This would bring Ireland into line with Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Nordic countries, where their armed forces have the right to be involved in their national trade union movement.  This is not a right to strike, and we can deal with that issue if it is a concern.  PDFORRA is not asking for that right, which we can deal with by way of legislation.  This is about putting in place a professional process for the determination not only of core pay, but of all the ancillary issues that normal discussions in a trade union setting provide for, such as contracts and so on.  Will the Government approve the affiliation of PDFORRA to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as has been requested?</p></speech>

There are some real concerns about this, which we should not dodge.  I am a former Minister for Defence, and while we have to ensure appropriate representation for Defence Forces members, we also have to recognise that the Defence Forces, like the Garda in many ways, are in a different category from other public servants.  The State needs to know that it can rely on them in all circumstances.  The Chief of staff has expressed some legitimate concerns about this, so we have to work through them to make sure the decisions made in this area are right for both Defence Forces personnel and the State.</p><p>I expect the Minister of State at the Department of Defence will be able to come forward shortly to give a detailed commentary and decision on this issue.

A decision in this regard was deferred last March.  The T&aacute;naiste will probably not comment on the budget and is not privy to the finer details.  Supplements and vitamins currently attract a zero rate of VAT.  If the 23% rate is applied to them, this will place an unfair financial burden on many people who use them.  The VAT rate on fast food is 13.5% but the Government wants to apply a rate of 23% to vitamins and supplements that are good for us.  This does not make sense.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will comment on the matter.  Will he ask the Minister for Finance not to apply this rate of VAT to vitamins and supplements?</p></speech>

The Department is not intervening, Bus &Eacute;ireann has stood back and parents and children are suffering.  Enniskeane national school is the feeder school for the secondary schools in Bandon.  Up to 20 children attending these schools from the greater Ballineen area have been refused school transport to Bandon, making it a nightmare situation for their parents who have to work each day.  I have made some inquiries and one does not have to be a rocket scientist to solve this problem.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to immediately work with the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, to push through a solution for the families of these children in the Ballineen area.</p></speech>

The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine how best to improve integrated services in the rural bus network for the regions, including school transport.  I was very encouraged to hear that an additional &euro;1 million in funding was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, in mid-August in order to address the issues within the school transport system.  Although very little detail was released, I was hopeful that the Minister would focus on children who had used school transport on a concessionary basis but who have been left without transport this year.  I wrote to the Minister in August to highlight two very problematic school transport issues in my parish in south Kilkenny that require urgent attention.  One of the issues concerns a secondary school and affects 13 children, while the other, which relates to a private school, affects 11 children.  Unfortunately, the situation remains the same for these young families whose children do not have access to school transport despite indications that a solution would be found.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the &euro;1 million has been spent and outline the criteria for the allocation of it?  Will the he indicate if any of the money is left to cover problems such as those I have mentioned in Carlow and Kilkenny?  I have been reliably told that a small amount of money would sort out the concessionary tickets for those children who have been left on the side of the road.  I am told that another &euro;1 million would do it.</p></speech>

What plans are in place to address this debacle?  The school transport system is a debacle.  Across west Cork, some students got tickets who were not allowed on the bus, some students who should have got tickets did not, and we have many cases of students who qualified for tickets and yet their siblings did not.  Some students have places on buses, while their parents are behind those buses driving their siblings to school by car.  The situation is ridiculous.  Plans must be put in place for next year, but I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the situation in Ballineen needs to be resolved in the meantime.</p></speech>

The problem is, however, that there are other people in my constituency who could not avail of these exceptions.  Their applications had failed last year and they did not know they should apply for the exception.  I have discussed this matter quite a lot with Deputies Michael Collins, Murphy O'Mahony and Aylward, and it has been raised previously in the D&aacute;il.  Other areas have had all sorts of problems with school transport but they did not get exceptions this year.  The Government would not have a leg to stand on if this matter were brought to the Ombudsman.  The rules were bent for some, correctly, but while the rules were changed and money was allocated for certain students, this was not done for others.  Those who failed in their applications last year, including some in my constituency, did not get the opportunity to come back this year because they did not know the rules would be changed this year.  The Department is operating on a completely <i>ad hoc</i>basis and the Government would not have a leg to stand on if all the people we represent were to go to the Ombudsman in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the case in west Cork.  Senator Lombard and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, are both working on the same cases probably that the Deputies are working on.  Temporary alleviation measures have been put in place to try to deal with specific problems in different parts of the country.  Clearly, a more comprehensive response is needed for next year.  The Minister and his Department are continuing to try to deal with individual issues and problems in different parts of the country in response to demand.  The Deputies will have to put down a question to the Minister for a more comprehensive response.</p></speech>

If passed, the Bill would introduce graduated speeding penalties.  The law, however, is only as good as the level of enforcement relating to it.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that a private consortium, GoSafe, was awarded a five-year contract, reported to be worth up to &euro;115 million, to operate speed cameras.  GoSafe is facing notice of industrial action by the end of this week in a row about pay and conditions.  Drivers have revealed that they routinely work nine to 11-hour shifts, most of which are spent in their vans without access to toilet facilities or a proper place to eat lunch.  GoSafe has refused to implement a Labour Court recommendation which confirmed that SIPTU representatives have the sole right to negotiate with management on behalf of its members.  Will the Government introduce a legal requirement in public procurement to oblige all contracted private sector contractors to fully engage with trade unions and the industrial relations apparatus of the State?</p></speech>

This is also one of the principal platforms of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I draw the T&aacute;naiste's attention to the situation of doctors from outside Ireland who try to get registration to work as general practitioners here.  Responsibility in that regard lies with the national doctor training programme in conjunction with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  It is my understanding that the latter does not have a problem but that the difficulty and the red tape relating to obtaining registration for doctors coming into Ireland to work are a disincentive for them.  We are fortunate that we have an arrangement with Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand for bringing in their qualified GPs.  As a result of their circumstances, however, doctors from South Africa are the only ones who seem to want to come to work in Ireland.  The Government is well aware that the State is short of at least 500 GPs.  Everything should be done to promote and incentivise to try to attract GPs into the country, particularly from South Africa.  A few weekends ago, the out-of-hours service in Tralee, County Kerry, had no GP for the entire weekend.  People then had to go the accident and emergency department, which is an already stressed service.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please discuss this issue with his colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to try to make it as easy as possible for such doctors, while at all times adhering to the necessary qualifications criteria.</p></speech>

Clearly, not all Departments and Government offices share the same confidence as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, that the continued use of the public services card beyond the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is legal.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We need clarity on this issue, particularly as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is still requiring applicants for the new national childcare scheme to have a card.  We understand that the Department is examining alternatives, but as it is stated on its website that a hard copy of the public services card application form will not be available until January, which is a number of months after the scheme goes live, parents need clarity on whether they can submit an application under the new national childcare scheme if they do not have a public services card.  </p> <p> It is clear the T&aacute;naiste does not have faith in the legality of the continued use of the public services card given its removal as a requirement in respect of a passport application.  Will other Departments also withdraw the requirement for a public services card in respect of citizens' access to services?</p></speech>

The Government is at one on this.  We had a long conversation on it and had the legal position outlined to us by the Attorney General.  In his view, and that of the Government, the legislation introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il is good and allows for the public services card to be used across multiple agencies and Departments.  The purpose of the card is to make it easier for citizens to access public services, including in respect of first-time applications for a passport.  To address the confusion in the public mind arising from commentary in relation to the public services card, we have introduced a facility to enable persons who do not have a public services card to obtain a passport.  We will not preclude people from getting a passport if they do not have a public services card but we have streamlined a process using the public services card which is the best way to get a passport quickly and the most reliable way in terms of the security and identity requirements.  If there are exceptional circumstances, we will accommodate them.  There is no great mystery about this.  It does not in any way undermine the Government's position on this issue, which is rock solid and, if legally tested, will be strongly defended.</p></speech>

It was recently highlighted that 44% of general practitioner, GP, clinics are full, with rural areas being worst hit.  In County Laois, 100% of GPs have stated that they cannot take on new patients and in County Offaly only 20% of GPs are in a position to take on new patients.  The lack of GPs has reached crisis point in some regions.  I have been contacted by many concerned constituents in Laois and Offaly on this issue.  What actions will the Government and the Minister for Health collectively take to resolve this crisis, which is particularly pertinent and obvious in rural areas?</p>  <p>  Also, will a stakeholder forum be convened in an attempt to resolve this ongoing crisis, which is worsening by the day?</p></speech>

I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, via the Department of Defence, is sending a naval vessel to New York and, perhaps, other cities to engage with UN officials.  What is the purpose of this operation?  For example, is it to wine and dine officials or will serious business be conducted?  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware this is happening against the backdrop of docked naval vessels and difficulties around meeting service level agreements and the considerable costs being incurred by his Department in regard to securing a seat on the UN Security Council, which issue has been raised many times by my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins.  In light of the aforementioned difficulties and the current recruitment and retention crisis, will the T&aacute;naiste explain the purpose of the deployment of this naval vessel?</p></speech>

It is important to say that the role of the Naval Service is not solely one of fisheries protection or intercepting drugs and so on.  While both operations are an important part of what it does, it has a broader remit, as seen in the Mediterranean Sea and will be seen next week when it will play an ambassadorial role not only in terms of the UN Security Council campaign - it is only one element of what the service is doing - but in reaching out to the Irish diaspora in large cities on the east coast.  This is not new.  Naval vessels have been sent abroad with a diplomatic role many times in the past.  I appeal to people not to try to make this into something that it is not.</p>  <p>  We are also trying to recruit people into the Naval Service.  People need to see the broad spectrum of roles and responsibilities that Naval Service personnel play, which will be very evident abroad next week.</p></speech>

In May, in conjunction with the local and European elections, the people of Limerick voted in a plebiscite to accept the principle and concept of a directly elected mayor.  I raised the following issue with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, last July by way of parliamentary question.  What is the status of the legislation for the roll-out of the directly elected mayor?  The Minister indicated to me in a written reply last July that he proposed to establish an implementation committee in early September.  What is the status of that committee and what is the proposed membership of same?  I believe its membership should be as broad as possible to include as many voices in Limerick as possible in light of the huge civil society campaign and buy-in to the principle of a directly elected mayor, which I support.  It is great for democracy.  In the context of the discussion we had earlier on promoting oversight of our local authorities, this will be a very positive oversight mechanism.</p>  <p>  The principle of a directly elected mayor has been knocking around in the now Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for nearly 15 years.  I would welcome an update on the status of the legislation for the Limerick directly elected mayor and the implementation committee.  Also, is it still the Minister's intention to hold the election for the position in May or June 2021, as indicated to me previously?</p></speech>

This was a fantastic decision made by the people of Limerick.  To give credit where credit is due, Deputy Niall Collins did a great job, working with other parties and people, to get it over the line.  It is a pity other members of his party did not take a similar view in places like Cork.  However, that has been decided now.</p>  <p>  I met the outgoing council manager in Limerick to talk through what needs to be done in terms of implementation.  I also attended a public meeting organised by Senator Maria Byrne to discuss some of the issues that still need to be resolved.  We are in the process of putting together the implementation group.  Some people have been identified and approached.  As stated by the Deputy, it is important there is a wide spectrum of representation, including people who have experience of being in local government working on the corporate side but also in terms of accessing services.  All of these matters need to be addressed in the implementation group.</p>  <p>  In terms of the timelines and legislation, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, will be the lead in taking the legislation through the relevant processes.  We believe we can get this done.  On the timeline, it is important the legislation for the first directly elected mayor of Limerick is in place for the next local elections to ensure that election can take place in tandem with the local elections.  We will have an announcement on the implementation group very shortly.</p></speech>

In County Louth, the N52 Ardee bypass was earmarked for funding by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Local communities, which have grown in recent years and will be seriously and adversely impacted by the realignment project, have called for the original scheme to be modified.  Following on from considerable campaigning with Louth County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I welcome that a technical review of the scheme and the junction arrangements linked to the N52 bypass has been agreed.  The review is to allow the project team time to consider the issues fully, which include a national heritage area and the growth of the local community.</p><p>However, we have been told that the funding for this may be redirected to other projects, which would be a grievous mistake.  This funding should be legally guaranteed.  Ardee needs this bypass.  It has been in the pipeline for more than 13 years so will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment or ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to give a commitment that money set aside will be ring fenced until the review is completed?  We are talking about 13 years.  If the money is not there, it will be put back for another five to ten years.</p></speech>

In the past 12 months, the number of electric vehicles has doubled.  The function of the ESB's ecars programme, which was introduced in 2010, is to hasten the introduction of 1 million electric vehicles and to move transport away from the dirt, poison and pollution of hydrocarbon fuels to lovely green-fuelled transportation as quickly as possible.  Since 2010, the Government has apparently given &euro;37 million to the ESB to install these electric charge points.  We have 1,200 charge points, some of which are standard and some of which are quick.  If I divide &euro;37 million by 1,200, it means that each one of these charge points will cost &euro;30,000.  There is no way anyone can expect to pay &euro;30,000 for an electric charge point.  It is just a pole with an ESB connection.</p>  <p>  We are looking for value for money.  I was lucky enough to get the loan of an electric car last weekend that I drove around Dublin.  It was fantastic but I had a problem finding a charge point and a quick one to get me back home to Dundalk instead of sitting in a car park in Dublin for nine hours.  I have spoken to many owners of these electric cars.  The problem they face is that they have a 50-50 chance of finding a charge point and 50-50 chance of finding one where they need it.  I am 100% behind electric cars but we must put a plan in place.  Charging &euro;30,000 for one charge point is not value for money.</p></speech>

The technology permits that and that technology will continue to improve.  However, there is a problem regarding having sufficient numbers of charge points and sufficient numbers of fast charge points, particularly for people driving on motorways.  The situation is improving and I think the Deputy will see a significant increase in the pace of roll-out of charge points across the country in the coming years.</p></speech>

This Bill will put in place the necessary legislative underpinning to allow Ireland ratify this historic treaty.</p>  <p>  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the outcome of a two-year process led by states and civil society concerned by the increasing risks and catastrophic consequences of a nuclear weapons explosion as well as by the lack of progress made by the nuclear weapons states on the disarmament provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT.  The treaty was opened for signature at the United Nations in New York on 20 September 2017.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland on the first day it opened for signature.  As of today, the treaty has received 70 signatures, including 26 ratifications.  The TPNW requires 50 ratifications to enter into force.  I hope that the passage of this legislation will allow Ireland to be among those early ratifiers.</p>  <p>  Ireland is closely associated with this treaty.  Ireland took a leading role in the process that led to the adoption of the TPNW and was a member the core group of states made up of Ireland, Austria, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa which brought forward the resolution giving the UN conference its negotiating mandate.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I am very proud of the contribution made by Ireland in this regard.  The contribution of this treaty to global peace and security was recognised most prominently through the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 to the International Campaign against Nuclear Weapons, ICAN, an umbrella civil society advocacy group which has long been a close partner for Ireland.  ICAN spent more than a decade advocating for a humanitarian perspective to be considered regarding nuclear weapons and that aspiration was finally realised with the TPNW.  I am further pleased that the specific work of the Irish delegation and our core group partner countries was recognised by the 2018 Arms Control Person of the Year Award for our work in leading the TPNW negotiations.<br/><br/>This new treaty provides for states to fulfil their disarmament obligations under the non-proliferation treaty, Article VI, and affirm their commitment to achieving a world free from nuclear weapons.  The TPNW plugs a legal gap by prohibiting the last form of weapon of mass destruction which had not yet been explicitly outlawed.  Deputies from across the House share my deep concern about the immense human suffering and environmental degradation which would arise from the detonation of a nuclear weapon, whether by accident, miscalculation or design, anywhere on the planet.  The only guarantee of protections from nuclear weapons use is their complete elimination.  The ratification of the TPNW is an important step towards the realisation of this important objective.<br/><br/>The issue of nuclear disarmament is one which has traditionally enjoyed support from across the political spectrum in Ireland, and I would like to remind Deputies of the deep-rooted legacy of engagement Ireland has had on nuclear disarmament.  Nuclear disarmament became a priority foreign policy objective shortly after we joined the United Nations more than 60 years ago.  Ireland played a leading role in the origins of the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament regime, namely, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, which entered into force in 1970.  In 1958, the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Frank Aiken, introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the UN.  These Irish resolutions ultimately led to the adoption of the NPT in 1968.  I would like to recall the words spoken by the then Minister, Frank Aiken, at the 22nd UN General Assembly first committee meeting on 6 May 1968, which adopted the NPT.  His words are as relevant to this treaty, and at this time, as they were then.  He stated that the NPT, for all states large and small, was, he believed, an infinitely more effective shield against a nuclear holocaust, than the most costly armoury of offensive and defensive equipment. <br/><br/>The same commitment to multilateralism that drove Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s informed the Irish approach to the historic TPNW negotiations in 2017.  The outcome of the TPNW negotiations goes to the very heart of our belief in a rules-based international world order.  We live in challenging times, when many of the agreements we have worked hard to collectively reach are unravelling or are being undermined.  The Doomsday Clock, updated each year since 1947 by the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, is now at two minutes to midnight.  That is the closest it has ever been to apocalypse.  The prospect of a new arms race is very real.  There has been a worrying decrease in the taboo around the threat of the use of these weapons of mass destruction.  There is also vast investment in so-called &quot;modernisation&quot;, with talk of more strategic, targeted and usable nuclear weapons and increased reliance on these weapons in security doctrines.  Of deep concern, and one of the most dangerous ideas in the current discourse, is the notion that any nuclear weapon could ever be used again, even in some sort of controlled way.  This idea is completely unacceptable.  As the most powerful and most indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction ever invented, nuclear weapons should have no place in the security doctrine of any state and their very existence threatens us all.<br/><br/>I do not need to recall for anyone the horror visited upon the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who suffered the devastating effects of the only occasions when nuclear weapons have been used in war.  Furthermore, people - often marginalised or vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples - and the planet continue to suffer today the enduring aftermaths of thousands of nuclear tests that occurred in the second half of the 20th century.  Knowing what we know now about the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear explosion and the sheer impossibility of any adequate humanitarian response, we must reject the very notion that they can ever be used again under any circumstances.  Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev had the insight to agree, even at the height of the Cold War, that &quot;a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought'.  It was true then, and it remains true and even more relevant now.<br/><br/>In a context of global mistrust and a deeply challenging security environment, it is ever more necessary to call on enduring principles.  Ireland believes that multilateralism is the key to solving the global challenges we face.  We will hold firm in our belief that the equilibrium of the world order cannot be held in place, and is not currently held in place, by either threat or fear.  It is quite the reverse.  A permanent peace can only ever be attained through respect for the rule of law based on justice.  We are consistently told by large states with nuclear weapons that nuclear disarmament is a challenge for them.  It is an equally important responsibility under the NPT, now re-enforced under the TPNW, however, for small states with no nuclear weapons and this is a responsibility Ireland will continue to discharge in full.<br/><br/>The significance of the TPNW is that the first time the core objective of the prohibition of nuclear weapons will be clearly and unambiguously prohibited.  This will address the current legal gap.  Together with our partners, we will use every opportunity to reiterate that these weapons are inhumane, indiscriminate and beyond any possible legal use.  Our focus will be on the weapon and not on the actor.  As former the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, puts it, &quot;there are no right hands for these wrong weapons&quot;.  For as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are all under existential threat.<br/><br/>The TPNW is very much the child of the multilateralism approach.  It was built on a framework developed over 50 years and in particular the non-proliferation treaty.  The NPT remains the cornerstone of the multilateral nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  It is composed of three pillars: nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Its overriding purpose was to work towards complete nuclear disarmament by capping the number of nuclear weapons states and introducing a legally-binding obligation on those states to disarm.  The drafters of the NPT knew that this document would need to be built on over time and over the last 50 years the international community has built a variety of supporting frameworks and regimes around the treaty to bolster its provisions.  These supporting frameworks are already in place for the non-proliferation pillar through multiple export control regimes and for the peaceful uses pillar, mainly in the form of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.  The NPT also led to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and the global norm against nuclear testing.<br/><br/>Despite all these notable milestones, however, there is one pillar where progress on the implementation of the NPT has fallen short.  That is the nuclear disarmament pillar.  Unlike the other pillars, there are very few supporting regimes for the disarmament provisions.  Attempts to strengthen the disarmament provisions have traditionally been fiercely resisted, in particular by the nuclear weapons states.  For example, commitments made in the NPT action plans from 2000 and 2010 remain unfulfilled and their status called into question.  Some 22 years after being opened for signature the CTBT has yet to enter into force.<br/><br/>We are, unfortunately, now living at time when progress on nuclear disarmament is urgently needed.  While the nuclear weapons states have formally accepted their disarmament obligations, they continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals at the same time.  Even more worryingly, the norm against the threat of the use of nuclear weapons has been seriously eroded in recent times.  Consideration even seems to be given by some states in the international community for the use of nuclear weapons other than as a deterrent.  In this regard, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons gives the NPT some much-needed impetus on disarmament.  It is the first new legal multilateral instrument on nuclear disarmament to be adopted in more than 20 years.  It is a success story.  That is not only because of its ground-breaking content but also because of what it entails in moving toward the fulfilment of the NPT's disarmament provisions.</p><p>It gives back agency to non-nuclear weapon states such as Ireland with respect to nuclear disarmament and it addresses the urgent need to make progress.</p> <p> The treaty establishes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on nuclear weapons activities.  These include undertakings not to develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use weapons.  The TPNW also prohibits the stationing, installation or deployment of nuclear weapons on national territory.  In addition to these core prohibitions that implement the disarmament pillar of the NPT, the TPNW makes its own contributions to the multilateral disarmament regime through a number of ground-breaking provisions.  The treaty obliges states parties to assist survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use in areas under their jurisdiction, and to undertake necessary environmental remediation in areas under their control.</p> <p> The treaty is the first international legal instrument to recognise the disproportionate impact on the health of women and girls of ionising radiation from nuclear weapons use.  The treaty also promotes the equal participation in the treaty's work by women and men and includes a provision on disarmament education.  Ireland was a strong advocate for these provisions during the treaty negotiations, in line with our consistent support for gender mainstreaming in disarmament negotiations and policies.  Ireland's engagement with the treaty negotiations also reflected our principled position on humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, respect for human rights and the promotion of civil society voices.</p> <p> I am happy to acknowledge that the TPNW is reflective of the breadth of participation in the negotiations.  States large and small from all parts of the world were able to participate.  Civil society and academia were very valuable contributors.  Most importantly, the drafting process benefited from hearing crucial testimony from survivors of nuclear weapons testing and use.  The result of these views and experiences is an inclusive and innovative treaty, which acknowledges that we all have a stake in achieving nuclear disarmament.</p> <p> The treaty is not without its detractors.  While a large majority of UN member states voted in its favour, the nuclear weapons states and many of their military allies chose not to participate in the negotiations.  This was regrettable and Ireland consistently called on them to join the negotiations and participate in good faith.  Ireland does not agree with their view that nuclear disarmament must wait until an ideal security environment is reached.  Rather, the opposite is true; the retention of nuclear weapons, and, in particular, the threat of a renewed arms race is itself a driver of insecurity and risk, while nuclear disarmament is an enabler of an improved security environment.</p> <p> Despite this opposition from some quarters, the TPNW represents the best hope in decades for multilateral progress on nuclear disarmament, an issue more pressing than ever.  The TPNW provides a framework for disarmament, and by stigmatising and delegitimising nuclear weapons it may strengthen calls for disarmament in those countries that possess nuclear weapons.  I am also aware of national debates being undertaken in some other neutral states and I hope Ireland can provide leadership and influence through our own ratification.</p> <p> As well as including some innovative elements, the core of the treaty follows the model of other similar weapons prohibitions.  With this in mind, the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 is likewise modelled on similar Irish legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure Ireland will be in a position to meet all its obligations as a state party to the treaty.  The requirement for states to adopt national measures to implement the treaty is set out in Article 5.1 and Article 5.2 of the TPNW.  The Bill represents Ireland's national measures under the treaty and was developed in consultation with other Departments.</p> <p> Section 1 of the Bill defines certain terms for the purposes of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 create the offences.  Section 2 creates criminal offences for specified nuclear weapon activities.  It makes it an offence for a person to develop, produce, manufacture, acquire, possess, transfer or receive the transfer of a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device.  It also makes it an offence to station, install or deploy a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device, or to use or threaten to use them.  In addition, section 2 provides that a person who assists, encourages or induces the commission of an offence shall also be guilty of an offence and that a person who seeks or receives assistance to commit an offence shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p> Section 3 provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of acts committed outside the Slate in specified circumstances.  These circumstances include the commission of an offence on board an Irish ship, on board an aircraft registered in the State, or where the person is member of the Defence Forces.  Section 4 provides for penalties for the commission of offences under sections 2 and 3.  A person who is found guilty of an offence will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine, imprisonment for life or such a lesser term as the court may determine, or both.  Section 5 applies the rule against double jeopardy and is a standard clause.  Section 6 clarifies offences as they relate to bodies corporate.  Section 7 sets out the short title of the Bill and contains a commencement clause.</p> <p> Ireland's ratification of the treaty would be consistent with our long-standing foreign policy priority on nuclear disarmament and our position as a key proponent of multilateral nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Achieving a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons is a long-standing priority of the Irish people, who take pride in our historic role and who ask us to continue to live up to our great legacy in this field.  I ask all Members of the House to support the Bill in the best interests of disarmament, global security and humanity.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities relating to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long history in working towards the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons and Fianna F&aacute;il is proud of our country's efforts in this regard.  In 1958, led by the then Minister, Frank Aiken, Ireland introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the UN, which eventually led to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, which has become the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament.  The NPT is the most widely recognised agreement relating to nuclear disarmament and arms control among 189 states parties.  Since then, Ireland has continued to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons, recognising the security, humanitarian and gendered threat that they pose.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, nuclear weapons continue to pose a serious threat to society and the environment.  The recent decision of the United States administration to terminate the long-standing Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and the Administration's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal last year are a cause of grave concern.  In addition, Iran's subsequent breaching of the nuclear deal and limits on uranium stockpiles underscores increased tension between nuclear possessing states and the need for ongoing efforts to ban nuclear weapons.</p>  <p>  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the first multilateral treaty relating to nuclear disarmament to have been negotiated in 20 years and is one that Fianna F&aacute;il wholeheartedly supports.  Global disarmament is one of the UN's oldest goals.  The first resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in January 1946 called for control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes and the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons.</p>  <p>  In the 1950s, Frank Aiken, a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for External Affairs, led the charge at international level to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.  His efforts helped to bring about the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.  It grants the five nuclear-weapon states recognised by the NPT, namely, China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, the exclusive right to possess nuclear arsenals but simultaneously obliges them to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament.  Moreover, signatories commit to work on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.  Unfortunately, the aim of global nuclear disarmament, first declared in 1946 and reiterated since, has not been achieved.  Even though global stocks of nuclear weapons are at their lowest level in more than 50 years, there are still an estimated 15,400 nuclear weapons worldwide.</p><p>The overall number of nuclear weapons worldwide has decreased from a peak of 70,000 in the mid-1980s.  However, all states with nuclear weapons are currently investing vast sums in modernising their nuclear arsenals and delivery systems, raising fears of a new arms race.  Renata Dwan, the director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, indicated in May that all states with nuclear weapons have modernisation programmes under way and that the risk of nuclear weapons being used is at its highest since the Second World War.  This is deeply concerning and there needs to be a concerted effort to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose.</p> <p> Deteriorating relationships between states that possess nuclear weapons, coupled with dangerous new capabilities and technologies is a cause of grave concern and must be addressed.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to seeking a safer world and the promotion of international stability.  To this end, we are committed to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  We would encourage nuclear armed states to reduce their arsenal and to simultaneously increase predictability and mutual confidence between armed states in order to reduce risk.  Fianna F&aacute;il also calls for greater transparency from states on the nuclear weapons they possess and the concrete measures they have taken in the field of nuclear disarmament.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes Ireland's efforts to highlight the gendered nature of the impacts of nuclear weapons.  Ireland has pushed for this to be seriously considered and has highlighted evidence that while the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons would cause massive death and injury to all, the evidence is clear that, over the longer term, of those who are exposed to ionising radiation from such a detonation, women and girls have a far higher risk of developing cancer than men or boys.  Ireland's efforts to give this humanitarian aspect of nuclear weapons is to be commended and one that Fianna F&aacute;il supports.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il supports the CTBT, which was adopted at the UN General Assembly in 1996.  While all EU member states have ratified the CTBT and are abiding by the obligations it lays down, we are concerned that the treaty is not yet in force.  We urge all states that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT without any preconditions or further delay.  The states that have not yet ratified the treaty are China, Egypt, Israel, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Iran and the United States.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il supports Ireland's membership of the New Agenda Coalition, a cross-regional group of states committed to promoting progress on nuclear disarmament.  Ireland played a central role in the coalition's formation in 1998 and remains committed to its objectives alongside fellow members Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa.  Ireland is also a member of the Conference on Disarmament and in August to September 2013 acted as president of the conference.</p> <p> We are happy to support the swift passage of the Bill.</p></speech>

I imagine that it will receive the unanimous support of this House and the Seanad.  The Bill will enable Ireland to become a state party to the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and will give effect to the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities relating to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.  As I said as Gaeilge, this is welcome and something every country should agree to.</p>  <p>  Nuclear weapons threaten the very existence of the human race and life on this planet.  People have become mobilised in recent times over concern for the very existence of life on the planet because of climate change.  The use of nuclear weapons in one day could bring that about much quicker than many people have contemplated for many years.   The effects of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are forgotten by some, hopefully not most.  Some people have a conspiracy theory about it.  In some ways, new generations have not fully seen the effects.  Those effects should be brought home to every schoolchild and every part of society.  Once a year, the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament holds a commemoration for those who died because of the use of nuclear weapons.  People need to be reminded of the full scale of devastation that nuclear weapons can bring about.  We need to create a world free from nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  Ireland must be a global leader in demilitarisation and disarmament, as it has been in the past.  In this debate we should commemorate and remember all the victims and survivors of nuclear weapons.  Two nuclear weapons have been used in war.  They were the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US military in 1945.  These two bombs killed 120,000 civilians and flattened both cities.  They have had a devastating effect on many generations since.  The bombs were deployed to kill as many civilians as possible.  This was a war crime and its effects are still felt today.</p><p>It should never have happened and the deployment of nuclear weapons should have ended there.  Regrettably the opposite happened.  Throughout the Cold War we saw a massive proliferation of nuclear weapons.  This was and remains an existential threat to humanity.  Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations.  This has created huge environmental damage which we do not fully appreciate or understand.  Maybe future generations will be able to calculate the full effect of that damage.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that in 2017 there were approximately 14,465 nuclear weapons in the world, 14,465 Hiroshimas.  Think of all those weapons going off at one time.  That is what a nuclear war would entail.  They all need to be destroyed and put beyond use.</p> <p> The cornerstone of international efforts to begin nuclear disarmament is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, known as the NPT.  This divided countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states.  The NPT provides for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons for countries without nuclear weapons and creates obligations on countries with nuclear weapons to negotiate an agreement leading to complete verifiable nuclear disarmament.  Ireland has been at the forefront of developments in relation to nuclear disarmament and it was one of the first signatories of the NPT.  This is worthy of remembrance and a proud moment in Irish history.</p> <p> However, the NPT also has significant weaknesses.  It allowed the USA, Britain, Russia, France, and China to keep their nuclear arsenals and cemented them as legitimate nuclear weapons holders.  No country should legitimately or legally be allowed to stock, develop or use nuclear weapons.  The NPT also failed to stop India, Pakistan, South Africa, Israel and North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.  South Africa thankfully destroyed its nuclear weapons arsenal when the apartheid regime was coming to an end.  Others should follow its lead.  Additionally, the NPT has been used and abused for political means.  Two nuclear states, the USA which has signed it, and Israel, which has not signed it and continues to lie and deny its nuclear weapons programme, forcibly stopped Iran's attempts to develop nuclear technology for civilian purposes, which is its right under international law.  Essentially Iran, a signatory of the NPT, was stopped from developing nuclear technology for civilian purposes by countries that have nuclear weapons and those who have refused to sign the NPT.</p> <p> The years of sanctions on Iran, despite it opening up its nuclear technology and nuclear sites to international investigation, has done significant damage to the NPT among countries which have signed and abided by it.  This is especially the case with the hypocrisy from Israel, the only nuclear armed state in the Middle East.  A deal was correctly done in 2015 to lift sanctions and allow Iran its right to develop nuclear technology for civilian purposes but the Trump Administration recklessly tore up this progressive and positive agreement under pressure from the Israeli Government.</p> <p> To date 70 countries have signed the new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and 26 states have ratified or acceded to it.  I hope Ireland will be the twenty-seventh because I cannot see anybody in these Houses objecting to it.  In order to come into effect, signature and ratification by at least 50 countries is required.  When he is wrapping up can the Minister of State say how many countries are going through the process now so that we will have some idea when we have ratified and acceded to it that there are another 23 who would quickly come in too and it would take full effect, having been ratified by 50?</p> <p> I welcome the fact that this Treaty provides for extensive prohibitions relating to the development, testing, producing, manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, stockpiling, transferring or receiving control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  The preamble of the Treaty sets out some of the general principles and policies.  It specifically acknowledges the disproportionate impact of nuclear weapons on women and girls.  This is very welcome and it builds on the increasing focus on how women and girls are disproportionately affect by conflict and the historic UN Security Council Resolution 1325.</p> <p> Article 1 of the treaty sets out a comprehensive list of prohibited activities in respect of nuclear weapons.  This includes prohibitions on activities relating to the development, production, use or threat of use, testing, transfer and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.  Article 4 sets out the disarmament requirements of nuclear weapon possessing States.</p> <p> I also want to draw attention to Article 6 which concerns victim assistance and environmental remediation.  Article 6(1) provides that state parties must provide victim assistance to individuals under their jurisdiction who have been affected by nuclear weapons use or testing.  Such assistance should include age and gender sensitive assistance and provide for the social and economic inclusion of victims.  Article 6(2) requires state parties to take remediation measures in respect of areas within their jurisdiction which have been contaminated by activities relating to nuclear weapons testing or use.  This is important considering the huge human suffering and environmental damage that the use and testing of nuclear weapons has created.</p> <p> Those articles are key to the environmental rehabilitation of the islands or nation states that have allowed the testing or that have been forced or bullied into that by the US in particular but also by China and Britain among other countries.  They are also key to an acknowledgement of and financial support for the victims and whole communities who have suffered the consequences, some of whom were moved off the islands to allow for destruction by these weapons.  Unlike the NPT, for nuclear armed states joining this treaty, they will have a time-bound framework for negotiations leading to the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme.</p> <p>  The treaty is therefore a well-written and important one in the fight for nuclear disarmament, but it has yet to get the international buy-in that it deserves and needs.  We hope that it will well exceed the minimum buy-in required.  It continues to be strongly opposed by countries that possess nuclear weapons.  Not only do they oppose the treaty, but they are modernising their nuclear arsenals and many Cold War bilateral treaties between the USA and Russia have been rubbished or are severely under threat.  The slow pace of developments within the NPT framework in relation to nuclear disarmament shows just how important this treaty is.</p> <p> In response to the treaty three of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the USA, Britain, and France, released a joint press statement in which they argue against this treaty and nuclear disarmament.  They said that in their opinion this treaty does not contribute to the development of international law.  That statement is contrary to the development of international law.  Unsurprisingly, all three of them have significant nuclear arsenals.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the UN system when all five permanent members of the UN Security Council have huge amounts of nuclear weapons.</p> <p> In conclusion, I again state my support for this treaty, for Ireland becoming a signatory and for this Bill to give effect to the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  While the treaty is not binding on states which are not a party to it and we have a long race to run until we reach full global nuclear disarmament, this treaty remains an important step in achieving nuclear disarmament.</p><p>In parallel with support for the treaty, the Government should stop its erosion of Irish neutrality and oppose the further militarisation of the EU.  It is not good enough to oppose nuclear weapons while we remain part of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, aligning ourselves to countries that have snubbed their noses at the achievement of nuclear disarmament.  We need to look into our own souls to see what steps we can take to prevent the further militarisation of Europe.  We cannot on the one hand chastise countries in Europe that stockpile and develop nuclear weapons while on the other hand join EU battle groups with those same countries and silently move towards creating a standing EU army with the very countries that hold dearly to the weapons of mass destruction that are nuclear weapons.</p></speech>

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, or the nuclear weapon ban treaty, is the first legally binding international agreement comprehensively to prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of leading towards their total elimination.</p><p>The treaty can work in parallel with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has acted as a bulwark against mass nuclear weapon proliferation for nearly 50 years.  The latter treaty, however, is showing its age, and we need further impetus towards non-proliferation and, ultimately, full nuclear disarmament.  The hearing of the Bill is timely, given President Trump&rsquo;s recent decision to withdraw the US from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which has raised fears of a new arms race.  Previously faint memories of Cold War tensions return to our minds, in a new and increasingly volatile international picture.  The threat of nuclear conflict seems to be increasing as instability becomes the <i>de facto</i>nature of global security.  There is now a real and ever present danger of nuclear escalation, as exemplified by the recent Kashmir crisis between two of the world&rsquo;s largest nuclear powers, namely, India and Pakistan.  Likewise, ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East are a constant cause of concern, not only for the surrounding regions but for the entire world due to the potentially devastating consequences of a nuclear conflict.</p><p>In this context, Ireland&rsquo;s continued leadership in the prohibition of nuclear weapons is necessary and welcomed by the Labour Party.  Ireland is viewed internationally as a distinguished and credible advocate for nuclear disarmament and a supporter of non-proliferation.  During the Cold War, Ireland was a progressive voice in the international sphere for disarmament.  While superpowers stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals, and other states retained nuclear weapon programmes or continued to develop secret ones, Ireland worked in the multilateral forum of the United Nations to rid the world of this scourge.</p><p>Ireland has consistently punched above its weight on the nuclear issue.  Through Frank Aiken&rsquo;s Irish resolutions in the 1950s and 1960s, the formation of the New Agenda Coalition in 1998, to the skilled diplomacy of the Irish delegation that led to a reaffirmation of the Middle East resolution at the 2010 NPT review conference, Ireland has played a positive role.  It is an area where Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation remains strong and credible, and is proof that a small but independent, principled and neutral country can significantly advance the cause of humanity.  Ireland needs to remain a strong voice for international nuclear disarmament and a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation.  This means we must not only criticise rogue states for pursuing nuclear weapon programmes but we should ask difficult questions of our allies that drag their heels on nuclear disarmament.  In particular, I note the opposition of NATO members, which include the US and most of our EU partners, which have unwisely opposed the treaty.  Again, this highlights the necessity for Irish neutrality, which the Government has sought to undermine at every opportunity.</p><p>The State should never allow itself to be put in a position where it is pressurised, by way of membership of an intergovernmental military alliance, whether NATO or PESCO, to oppose nuclear proliferation.  We must also remain a strong advocate for rigorous inspection programmes of states that pursue nuclear power.  If a state has a peaceful nuclear programme, it needs to allow full-scale International Atomic Energy Agency inspections.  There should be no exceptions.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to condemn those countries that continue to oppose the treaty and once again to reassert our position of disarmament and non-proliferation.</p></speech>

As vice chairperson of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have had the opportunity to attend some of the Common Defence and Security Policy meetings in Europe.  There is no doubt that defence is a growing concern because of the increased worries or threats that certain countries face, and whether they are perceived or actual is another matter.  The Baltic countries, for example, fear their big neighbour wanting to take back what was once under their control.  Georgia has fears over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while there are fears for Ukraine and its difficulties.  There is conflict in many other parts of the world, such as in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and countries in Africa, while there are tensions with Iran and with North Korea.  Within that volatile mix there is the danger of certain countries having nuclear weapons.  I acknowledge that it is a clich&eacute; but it seems that more and more often attack is seen as the best form of defence.  It is a worrying time.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the majority of us seem to agree on the need for a world free from nuclear weapons.  In January 2019, Senator Norris and I endorsed the Basel Appeal on Disarmament and Sustainable Security, which was an open letter to world leaders in the US, Russia, China, the UK, France, as well as to parliamentary committees and the Secretary General of NATO.  In the letter, we quoted from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which highlighted the failure of world leaders to deal with the looming threat of nuclear war and the increasingly high risk of a nuclear exchange, whether by accident, miscalculation, conflict escalation or intent.  The letter welcomed the adoption by the UN of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons but expressed concern about the deteriorating security environment in Europe and internationally because of the erosion of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the US withdrawing from the joint comprehensive plan of action, the further development and modernisation of nuclear weapons, and what the letter's authors called provocative war games and nuclear threat postures.  The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was the historic agreement between the US and the Soviet Union, has unravelled.  The letter called on the Russian Duma and the US Congress to refuse to authorise or allocate funding for developing or deploying weapons that might violate the treaty.  There was also a call on NATO to reaffirm its opposition to any deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe.  The New START treaty, about which there are concerns that it may be undermined by current conflicts, is set to expire in February 2021 and there is a need to expand it further into the 2020s.</p>  <p>  There is always a danger of nuclear weapons being used by accident or miscalculation, which makes all the more urgent the need for countries, especially the US and Russia, and NATO to reaffirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be launched.  They must resile from their high operational readiness to use nuclear weapons.  There is a famous quote from Albert Einstein: "I know not what weapons World War III will be fought with, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."  There were two World Wars in the previous century, followed by a Cold War and an Iron Curtain, and there were many wars of ethnicity and civilisation throughout the world.</p><p>On the other side was the hope that came from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p> <p> Everybody can agree there is a fear that a conflict could escalate into a nuclear war but there are a number of ironies.  One is the attitude of the United States towards nuclear disarmament.  The United States argues that nations it sees as "rogue states" should be stopped at all costs from gaining a nuclear threat.  Nevertheless, the only sovereign state to use atomic weapons has been the United States, with devastating consequences that are still being felt today.  Another irony concerns arms in general.  I am always struck by how NATO countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany sometimes come out in support of nuclear prohibition yet they have an arms industry that sells arms to regimes that are causing conflicts today.  Yemen is the example that immediately springs to mind.  The need for nuclear prohibition is about stopping the threat of wholesale destruction but the bombing and maiming of people with smaller munitions over years is somehow not seen as the same wholesale destruction.  We need a detailed debate around arms sales in general as there is much hypocrisy at play within geopolitics.</p> <p> The Bill is welcome and I hope it is supported.  As a non-aligned and mainly neutral country - although there are concerns about our status in that regard - Ireland should have a stronger voice in the wider debate around arms and the sale of arms to countries with little regard for international law and human suffering in particular.  The western media will always channel the nuclear prohibition debate between bogeyman states like North Korea and Iran, portraying them as unstable and unpredictable and which should never therefore be capable of using nuclear weapons or enriching uranium.  There is nothing about the track record of countries with established nuclear capability.  Israel, for example, disregards international law by continuing to build settlements.  We can also look at what has been happening in India and Pakistan, as well as in the United States.  A leaked memo from some months ago indicates the United States was thinking of invading Venezuela some time ago.</p> <p> The goal of nuclear weapons prohibition is to stop states obtaining nuclear capabilities but there is just as much need to debate the states that already have nuclear capabilities and what they could do.  Going back to 1968, for example, fewer than 20 countries negotiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  It is recognised that five countries - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - had already acquired nuclear arsenals at the time.  Those five countries committed to the process of nuclear disarmament and other countries accepted obligations not to acquire or try to acquire nuclear weapons or programmes.  The treaty came into legal force in 1970, with approximately 60 members joining.  However, in order to encourage non-nuclear countries to sign the 1968 treaty, it actively promoted the use of nuclear technologies for what were called "peaceful" purposes.  Many countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Iran, pursued nuclear programmes with help from nuclear-armed states like the United Kingdom.  When they wanted to try to copy the five countries with nuclear weapons in developing their own weapons, the treaty was used to pressure them.</p> <p> In 2003, North Korea became the first country to withdraw from the treaty.  We know the United States deployed nuclear weapons in and around South Korea until the 1990s and it still stations thousands of troops and weaponry there.  Unfortunately, North Koreans are now being taught that having their own nuclear deterrent is the only way to defend themselves against the United States, which possesses the world's most powerful nuclear arsenal.  The debate is riddled with hypocrisy.</p> <p> There is not enough in the Bill and we also need an action plan for the comprehensive phasing out of nuclear weapons in order to reduce nuclear stockpiles, cancel nuclear weapons modernisation programmes and cut nuclear weapons budgets.  This must be done through dialogue and engagement with all states in order to eliminate all nuclear weapons.  The global militarisation index for 2017 indicates that $1.74 trillion was spent on weapons and military equipment.  The European Union spends $260 billion yearly on its military operations.  That does not include nuclear spending but I saw one figure indicating that $1 trillion will be spent in modernising the nuclear arsenals of nine countries over the next ten years.  We could think about what that nuclear budget could do to end poverty and hunger, protect our climate and achieve sustainable development goals.</p> <p> Deputy Pringle's Bill to divest from fossil fuels has passed through the Oireachtas and we need to do the same and divest from companies involved with nuclear weapons.  Three countries in Europe have done this already and there are 26 companies involved with the production of nuclear weapons.  Ireland has already excluded three of these and it is worthwhile looking further into such action.  There is a role for smaller countries like Ireland because we have a very strong reputation when it comes to humanitarian issues and human rights.  We can be a strong voice here also.  A nuclear war can never happen and the best way to avoid it is to have a position where no nuclear weapons are held by anyone.</p></speech>

I thank all Members who contributed to this afternoon's Second Stage debate.  I am pleased that a world free from nuclear weapons is a shared objective by all Members of this House and I thank those who have also praised Ireland's role in leading the negotiations of the TPNW with the core group of states.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned in earlier remarks, the significance of the TPNW lies in the fact that for the first time the core objective of the prohibition of nuclear weapons will be clearly and unambiguously stated in an international treaty addressing that current legal gap.  The TPNW contains a comprehensive set of prohibitions on nuclear weapons activities, including undertakings not to develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.  These provisions represent in themselves an important milestone on the path towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as do the provisions of the treaty prohibiting the stationing, installation or deployment of nuclear weapons on national territory.</p>  <p>  In addition to the comprehensive prohibitions in the treaty, the TPNW makes its own contributions to the multilateral disarmament framework through a number of groundbreaking provisions that I cited in my opening remarks.  The treaty takes a holistic approach, looking at the actual and potential real world effects of nuclear weapons and, in doing so, it shifts the discourse from a security lens to a humanitarian lens, challenging us to think about the enormity of the threat posed by these weapons.  By stigmatising and prohibiting nuclear weapons, it makes a statement that these weapons are simply no longer acceptable.  It centralises the impact on victims and provides assistance for survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use.  It also addresses the fact that ionising radiation is even more harmful to women than men and it promotes the equal participation of women and men in disarmament fora.  The treaty recognises the alarming impact of nuclear weapons testing and use on our already fragile planet and it provides for environmental remediation measures.</p>  <p>  These new provisions reflect a greater appreciation of the elevated risk and the catastrophic consequences that would result from a nuclear weapons detonation.  Whereas the TPNW is supported by the majority of countries, it is opposed by all nuclear weapons states and their military allies, including NATO members.  That is not surprising, given the arsenals of nuclear weapons that these states hold.  These countries argue that the fact that they have nuclear weapons deters other states from attacking them but Ireland does not subscribe to the nuclear deterrence theory, rather believing that the existence of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to human security and the future of the planet, as outlined so eloquently by other Members this afternoon.</p>  <p>  The argument put forward by opponents of the treaty is that it undermines the existing legal frameworks provided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.  From our perspective, the negotiating mandate for the conference that adopted the TPNW set out clearly that the new legal instrument to be adopted was to be complementary to and reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Ireland's approach to the negotiations was very much guided by this aspect of the mandate and we are satisfied that the TPNW achieves the same very well.  The non-proliferation treaty always envisaged a separate legal instrument to provide for nuclear disarmament and the TPNW is therefore the first step in implementing the nuclear disarmament provisions of the former.</p> <p> The interaction of the TPNW with the existing disarmament and non-proliferation architecture was a primary concern of many states during the negotiations.  I am confident that the TPNW has adequately addressed these issues by complementing and enhancing existing arrangements while not creating parallel or competing structures.</p> <p> A number of like-minded states which are also not part of military alliances have already signed and ratified the TPNW, for example, Austria and New Zealand.  However, there are some like-minded states which have not signed for now and national debates are taking place in many of these jurisdictions.  We expect up to five further ratifications at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York next week and up to six further signatures.  To date, 122 UN member states have shown support for the TPNW.</p> <p> Despite the criticisms and the reluctance by some states to sign or ratify the treaty, the TPNW is an important milestone.  Not only does it represent significant progress but it also reinvigorates the non-proliferation treaty at a time when this is badly needed.  It gives back the impetus to non-nuclear, small states like Ireland to seize the initiative and move forward the nuclear disarmament agenda once more.  It is incumbent on us to do so because not only is nuclear disarmament a signature aspect of our foreign policy, a nuclear weapons-free world is also in the best interests of humanity.</p> <p> It is clear that issues of nuclear disarmament sometimes require us to take a position that is not universally shared or popular.  I am proud that this principled approach, based on integrity and consistency, is a hallmark of Ireland's disarmament policy stretching back decades.  Ireland has never shied away from its advocacy for nuclear disarmament and the continued existence of nuclear weapons is a challenge to global security, an affront to our planet and abhorrent to our people.  The ethical, humanitarian and now legal imperatives for disarmament are overwhelming.</p> <p> The Government is anxious to carry forward the excellent work that is already being done by being in a position to ratify the TPNW by the end of this year and the enactment of the present Bill facilitates this and will clearly demonstrate Ireland's commitment to promoting the earliest possible entry into force of the TPNW.  I look forward to the progress of the Bill to Committee Stage and thank all the Members for their contributions this afternoon.  We look forward to proceedings on the Bill being concluded in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

That Act recognises the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his or her own family.</p><p>We welcome the progress made with the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Minister's acknowledgement that the current system for the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is flawed and needs to be changed.  Through this process of change, it is crucial that the best interests of a child are at the heart of any decision-making affecting him or her and that the best possible advocacy is provided for every child who is in need of representation because these children's lives will be affected by the decisions made in the courts.</p><p>The guardian <i>ad litem</i>system as it currently operates is not fit for purpose.  It is completely unregulated, there is no oversight or accountability and the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not defined in legislation.  The appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i>in court proceedings is at the discretion of the judge, meaning that access to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is inconsistent across the State.  The provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service cost the State approximately &euro;46.1 million over the three-year period from 2014 to 2016.  That is a considerable amount which cannot be quantified in terms of value for money as there is no clear payment structure in place.  I have no personal issue or difficulty with money being spent on the provision of services that benefit children but this system has got to change.  We must be able to quantify that value for money.  A regulated system can operate on a much more cost-effective basis as evidenced by similar services in other jurisdictions such as those provided by Children's Hearings Scotland.</p><p>We need a better service for the most vulnerable children in our society while being able to quantify costs.  A huge amount of money is being wasted while, at the same time, an inconsistent and relatively <i>ad hoc</i>service is provided to our most vulnerable children.  My biggest issue with and concern about the system relates to its unfortunate inconsistency.</p><p>There is much that needs to change in family law in this State and the manner in which we treat children in the courts.  There are numerous points I would like to make on how positive changes could happen but, for the purpose of this debate, I will confine my comments to the relevant sections of the Bill that I feel need to be revisited and urgently addressed.  I am not a fan of making technical speeches but there are times when they are needed.</p><p>Section 35B(2) has the effect that children whose cases are before the High Court and who are going to be placed in special care will always be appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  This is the correct approach and we welcome the fact that this is standard practice.  However, children whose cases are before the District Court regarding applications to place them in care - whether with relatives, in non-relative foster care or in residential units - are not automatically entitled to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That places affected children at a serious disadvantage and may be unconstitutional.  All children in childcare cases should automatically be appointed guardians <i>ad litem</i>to ensure their wishes and feelings are heard in these important proceedings.  The latest figures from the child care law reporting project indicate that guardians <i>ad litem</i>are presently appointed in 53% of cases.  That means that children do not have that type of representation in 47% of cases.  We are therefore seeking to amend section 35B(3) on this basis.</p><p>The child involved should be a party to proceedings in order to ensure that he or she has equality within those proceedings.  This would be in line with practice that currently exists in Northern Ireland and England.  The child's voice must be heard whatever the circumstances and as much as possible, while protecting his or her emotional and psychological well-being.</p><p>As the Bill is currently drafted, children may or may not be appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Subsequently, the child's guardian <i>ad litem</i>may or may not be able to engage a solicitor as outlined in section 35D(2).  Therefore, legal representation is not a guaranteed right for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  This presents a situation where all parties are guaranteed legal advice except for the child who is at the centre of the case and who the case is essentially about.  Of all parties involved, it is therefore the child who has the least representation.  The child is at a serious disadvantage in proceedings as one can be assured that the Child and Family Agency will have legal representation, as will the parents if they wish to instruct a solicitor.  The child, on the other hand, has a number of hurdles to overcome in order to have a guardian or legal representation.  It is surely the vulnerable and innocent child at the centre of the case who should have the most representation, above everyone else, and who should be prioritised.  At a minimum, the child should be treated equally.  A number of children's rights solicitors have been contacted me to voice their concerns on that point and on the possibility of litigation in the future if this issue is not addressed.</p><p>In instances where parents choose not to engage in the court process, or are incapable of doing so, as is often the case, there may be no one to hold the Child and Family Agency to account and ensure that the child's wishes are being taken into account.  The latter is another reason to believe that guardians <i>ad litem</i>should have the right to legal representation on behalf of the children for whom they are advocating.  This aspect definitely needs to be revisited.</p><p>Section 35G is ambiguous on whether guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be entitled to all information regarding the case they are in charge of.  This may compromise their ability to advocate fully and effectively for the child.<br/><br/>Section 35H should be strengthened to allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be retained in the case of an order being discharged.  The Bill is ambiguous on this.  As a consequence of the high turnover of social workers, the guardian is frequently the only professional who is consistently involved in the case and who is the constant in a child's life throughout proceedings.  We seek assurances around allowing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be retained in the case of an order being discharged.<br/><br/>We understand the Bill attempts to limit the guardians' ability to call and cross-examine witnesses.  This compromises their ability to advocate fully and most effectively for the child.<br/><br/>In the event that the child is not a party to the proceedings, there is a legitimate argument that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be a party to the proceedings.<br/><br/>If the sections highlighted are amended, this has the potential to be a Bill that could improve the protection of children.  However, as it stands, the Bill would have a retrograde impact and would, in fact, weaken advocacy on behalf of, and protection of, the most vulnerable children.  I emphasise the recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs which strongly recommended that there should be no involvement of Tusla in the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  This is essential for absolute impartiality.  I appeal to the Minister and all Deputies in this regard.  There cannot be any overlap between this independent service and Tusla.  I sincerely hope the Minister and her officials are open to taking on board our concerns and will consider our amendments in order that we can work together to improve and strengthen this much-needed Bill.  Working out where the difficulties lie has always been my approach and that of my party.  The Bill has potential for good but we must address these issues which had been raised not only by Sinn F&eacute;in but also solicitors working in the area of children's rights who deal with these matters daily and know exactly what they speak of.  Perhaps the Minister will meet some of tho relevant groups or solicitors to discuss their concerns.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill for discussion.  This legislation, at its core, aims to reform the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system in a manner which benefits insofar as possible children and young people as possible and ensures the best interests of each child is always the foremost consideration in proceedings.</p><p>I particularly welcome the inclusion of section 5 which, taking into consideration a child's age and maturity, not only ensures that a child's views are heard, but that the court must figure out how best to facilitate that child being accommodated in giving their views.  It is always of the utmost importance that a child's voice is heard in each case.  This applies both in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and all other aspects of policy which impact children and young people.  We must recognise the voice of children and young people throughout Ireland, and we must listen to what they have to say.  We in this House are elected to represent our constituents and we must recognise that children and young people are also our constituents, even if they are at not at an age where they have the right to vote.</p><p>I am pleased that, when examining the functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>appointed for children, the viewpoint of the child is treated as a matter of paramount importance in that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has a responsibility to ascertain the views of the child and give them due consideration when making recommendations to the court.  Furthermore, they are also required to keep the child informed of their recommendations and the outcomes of court proceedings, where appropriate.</p><p>I listened carefully to Deputy Funchion who rightly pointed out the concerns of some in the sector, some of which was brought to the committee&rsquo;s attention in recent weeks and months.  Some aspects of the Bill as drafted are appropriate, whereas others deserve discussion on Committee Stage.  The Minister has always given due consideration to amendments to legislation before the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, as committee members appreciate, and I am sure she will do so again in this case.  Some years ago, when the Minister, who was then a Senator, and I were members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, we discussed the issue of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  I welcome that this Bill takes on board recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which were made as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  One such recommendation is that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service should not be subject to a procurement process.  When it comes to protecting our children and young people, we should not be focused on cost saving or any similar consideration.</p><p>It is important to address the issue of who can be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I understand the Bill provides the Minister with the authority to make regulations regarding the levels of experience and qualifications required to act as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  We must ensure that anyone acting in such a position acts on a strong basis from which he or she can best represent and advocate for the child or young person.  I understand that it is proposed that individuals, in order to be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, must hold qualifications in either psychiatry, psychology, social care or social work and have a minimum of five years' experience.  This is most appropriate.  Over the years, particularly during my time as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, regulations were implemented in various areas and some practitioners, who may have been well-meaning, experienced individuals, did not have qualifications.  This presented a difficulty.  The bottom line is that a person must be qualified to act in the post.  Although experience is an essential component of a person&rsquo;s qualification, he or she must have training in the relevant sphere in order to provide the best possible service to a child or young person.  We should ensure, as we have done in the past, that these requirements are absolute.  I would appreciate a commitment from the Minister to ensure such a significant threshold is put in place before someone can be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for a child or young person.</p><p>It is positive that the legislation before us is clear on the circumstances relating to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for a child or young person by the courts and ensures that several factors are taken into account.  On this basis, the District Court must have regard to the best interests of the child; the age and maturity of the child; the nature of the issues in dispute in the proceedings; any report on any matter which may affect the welfare of the child; where a child or young person wishes to express his or her views and whether the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would assist the expression by that child or young person of their views in the proceedings; and any views regarding such an order expressed by the child and the parties to the proceedings or any other person to whom the proceedings relate.  I listened carefully to Deputy Funchion on the requirement for guardians <i>ad litem</i>during District Court proceedings.  This arose during pre-legislative scrutiny and it is something which I ask the Minister to review at the next appropriate Stage should there be an amendment tabled to the legislation. </p><p>It is also positive that, where the court decides against appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it should give reasons for its decision, and in cases where it is satisfied that a child or young person can form and articulate his or her views in the proceedings, it should find and facilitate a means for that child or young person to do so.  Notwithstanding my comments, it should be automatic for someone to be appointed to act as guardian <i>ad litem</i>unless there is a very good reason for not doing so.  The child or advocate should not have to fight for one to be appointed.</p><p>I have placed particular emphasis on the elements of the Bill directly related to ensuring a child's or young person's views are heard in any proceedings.  I cannot overstate the importance of this.  Children and young people, who are among the most vulnerable persons in the system, must be heard and we, as legislators, must work to advocate for them in this House.  The Bill certainly puts the best interests of our children and young people at the forefront of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and reflects the spirit of the children's rights referendum of 2012.</p><p>I commend the Minister and her Department on the work they have done in bringing this Bill forward.  I also wish to recognise the work of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs in informing the Department's work on the Bill.  I look forward to it progressing through the Houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900029#EE00100"><p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate yesterday and today.  Everyone spoke in favour of the Bill in principle and there was a broad welcome for it, which I appreciate.  I also appreciate the good, solid and robust work of the committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Farrell, on the pre-legislative scrutiny.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, we took on two of the most significant recommendations from the committee.  They were not the only recommendations but one of the matters Deputy Farrell referred to in his contribution was that as we put the guardian <i>ad litem </i>on a statutory basis, it should not be subject to procurement and that is not the case.  That was a big decision to make but the committee was correct in recommending that and so we have proposals for same.</p><p>Deputy Funchion spoke about the cost issue, of which I am conscious, and we tried to take that into account in the Department in the construction of the Bill in its current form, although we clearly state that cost is a key component in concerns that will drive the reform.  However, it is not the only concern and there are more comprehensive concerns and overall ambitions for an office that will be initiated by the Department to oversee this as a new set of processes and regulation that are part of that wider reform.</p><p>I will make one or two more general points about the Bill before directly responding to some of the helpful questions and suggestions raised by Deputies yesterday and today, which will assist us as we move to Committee Stage.  Several Deputies identified some of the arenas they will be bringing amendments forward in and some concerns they have.  More generally, the Bill brings the Child Care Act 1991 into line with the provisions of the thirty-first amendment to the Constitution.  Deputy Farrell ended his contribution by saying how important that was.  In particular, one of the first Parts was Part 2 of the Bill where in section 24(1) it states that: &quot;In any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of a child, including proceedings before the High Court under Part IVA in relation to special care, the court shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.&rdquo;  That kind of phrase is repeated throughout the context of our concern in creating the Bill and also within the Bill itself.</p><p>The provision strengthens the child's rights, which is the most important factor in the determination of the proceedings.  To ensure the children and young people are always at the heart of proceedings, the Bill provides for a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in all childcare proceedings before the District Court but this provision also allows for appropriate judicial discretion.  A couple of issues were raised around this.  Yesterday, Deputy Sherlock referred us to section 35B(3) of the Bill.  He quoted from the Bill, which states: &quot;In proceedings under Part IV, IVB or VI the District Court, of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings, shall consider whether to direct that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>be appointed for a child.&quot;  Deputy Sherlock asked whether that was clear enough and whether we should state explicitly that the judge ought to do this.  He raised the question of whether the child has an absolute entitlement to a guardian <i>ad litem </i>or if there is a presumption in favour of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>As Deputies are aware, the Bill lays out that there is a presumption in favour, as distinct from whether it should be an entitlement, which was raised in Deputy Funchion's questions around a possible amendment.  Deputy Farrell also referred to that.  As it stands, there is a presumption in favour, as distinct from an entitlement, which we believe to be important because it may be the case that it is not always the best decision to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem </i>if, for example, a child wishes to have a direct engagement with a judge or if a child or young person wants to speak in a less mediated fashion.  That should be left open as a possibility.  Having said that, if, having gone through all the matters the judge needs to consider in the appointment and the presumption in favour of appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, he or she decides not to do so, the judge must give reasons for that and must identify how the views of the child will be heard.  Although it is true to say there are other mechanisms in other jurisdictions that provide ways of facilitating the views and the best interests of the child to be expressed, in our jurisdiction the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is the way we do that.  As it stands, the Bill strikes the right balance to leave it open if it is more in the interests of the child not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem </i>if the child so wishes but ultimately the judge has to go through a full process because there is a presumption in favour of appointing one.  As has been said, we can take that up more directly when we come to Committee Stage.</p><p>The Bill also seeks to maintain a balance between the different sets of concerns raised by Deputies Rabbitte and Sherlock yesterday.  On the one hand there is the need to ensure the child and young person is at the centre of the proceedings - that is not lost sight of - and on the other hand there is the requirement to ensure that the role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>does not inadvertently lead to more adversarial or protracted proceedings.  The child should be kept at the centre but with a guardian <i>ad litem </i>being there, that facilitates the best possible way of moving through the system to enable what is best for the child.</p><p>On some of the comments yesterday, it is not accurate to say the current section 26 makes any provision for a guardian <i>ad litem </i>to be made a party.  Accordingly, the Bill does not downgrade the status of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Instead, the Bill is seeking to make guardians <i>ad litem </i>available to more children and to children across the country on a systematic and equitable basis.  That is in light of some comments from Deputy Funchion as well.  The Bill is currently constructed so that it is more appropriate for a child to be made party as distinct from a guardian <i>ad litem </i>being made party.  In the Bill, as it is constructed, if that happens, the child or young person can keep a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, whereas currently he or she would not be able to do that.  It is more appropriate that the Bill works more in the best interests of the child.  It is about the child taking that interest in being made a party rather than the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which brings a different and an independent perspective.</p><p>The guardian <i>ad litem </i>has a special and unusual status in the Bill.  Under the provisions of the Bill, guardians <i>ad litem </i>are required to provide a report to the court but to correct a point that was made yesterday, it is not correct to say that the Bill limits them to providing one report.  Section 35E(2) states: &quot;A guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointed for a child shall &ndash; (c) inform the court of any additional matters, relevant to the best interests of the child, coming to his to her knowledge as a result of the performance by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>of his or her functions.&quot;  It is not limited, therefore, to just one report from the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Another progressive aspect of the Bill is that this provision also recognises that in drawn-out proceedings, a child&rsquo;s views may change and a guardian <i>ad litem </i>may need to come back to the court with an update on the child&rsquo;s views on any other matter that is of relevance to the proceedings.</p><p>The question of an automatic entitlement to legal representation was raised by Deputy Funchion.</p><p>As the Bill is drafted, we do not believe an automatic entitlement to legal representation is necessary because it could potentially make cases more adversarial and they may take longer as a result.  However, the office to be established will have a legal services unit, so they will always have access to legal advice and representation when needed.  Under the Bill, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>also has a duty to inform the child or young person at the centre of proceedings of the recommendations in his or her report, and of the outcome of the proceedings.  The intention is that the guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be involved throughout the proceedings.<br/><br/>There is a clear consensus among stakeholders, Deputies and committee members that reform is needed as the current system is costly, unregulated and provides no oversight of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  I reiterate, because it was one of the committee's primary recommendations, that under the Bill a new national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service will be established within the executive office of my Department and Tusla will have no involvement with it.  We have been working to plan for the implementation and bringing into operation of that executive office as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  The decision to establish a guardian <i>ad litem </i>executive office within my Department was taken by the Government.<br/><br/>My officials continue to be open to working with experts in order to hear further views, including those of committee members.  We look forward to moving to Committee Stage, and it was helpful in this debate to hear, first, the general welcome of the principle behind the Bill and, second, that Deputies were so clear in identifying areas about which they have questions or in respect of which they may be tabling amendments in order that we can think further about them.  I have tried to outline some of the reasons we did what we did, but as always we are open to having a debate and seeing whether there are possibilities or a need for change.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900030#FF00600"><p>I welcome this debate on climate change, which is coming at an appropriate time as thousands of young people in Ireland will mobilise tomorrow in order to raise awareness and demand climate action.  The influence young people are having on this debate, in building momentum among older generations to take seriously the scale of the challenge, cannot be underestimated.  They are a constant reminder to those in power that governments must lead this change.  There has been a lack of commitment in the past in Ireland. Although we committed to a 20% reduction in emissions, we have failed to achieve that target.  It is absolutely appropriate that we be called out on that failure.  Younger generations are pointing the finger at our generation and telling us that we will be the first generation to pass the world on in a worse state than in which we found it, and that is a heavy responsibility which we need to seriously address.</p>  <p>  This debate is also appropriate in that the UN will be hosting a series of events relating to the climate agenda this weekend.  The first of those will be a youth engagement and public mobilisation session on Saturday, at which Ireland will be a listener, and where young people will have the opportunity to set out their concerns and expectations in great detail.  This allows a serious debate to occur not only at a local level within our communities but at an international level, so that the UN, which is at the heart of multilateral efforts to work together to confront the climate challenge, will hear directly from young people as to their expectations.  On Monday, the UN Secretary General will hold a climate action summit.  As Deputies will know, this has long been signalled as a time when we need to step up our ambitions, as many new scientific reports note the narrowing window of opportunity for action and the need to significantly scale up our ambitions.  Ireland is part of a coalition within the European Union which wants to commit to net zero carbon emissions for the European Union by 2050.  I welcome the very high-level expression of commitment from the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, with whom I have worked in the past.  I have absolute conviction that when she sets out her agenda for the Commission's work, at the core of which will be climate action and just transition, she will deliver on that ambition.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, this UN conference will be the first opportunity for me to present the strategic approach Ireland has taken in addressing the shortfalls that have clearly occurred in our own climate strategy.  We have much to tell people in that the way we have gone about this shows we have the capacity to mobilise the necessary change.  The Citizens' Assembly has provided leadership on this issue and clearly pointed the way forward, as it has done when addressing previous major changes in Irish society as well.  The all-party Oireachtas committee put huge care and effort into conducting hearings around the scale of the challenge, how we shape that challenge, and how to govern in order to ensure policies for delivering targets are implemented.  The work of that committee, which was chaired by my colleague Deputy Hildegarde Naughton and involved every party and Deputies of no affiliation, was a remarkable piece of work, and it culminated in a unanimous declaration here in the Chamber of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  That is a significant foundation on which to build a climate plan, and that is what I have sought to do.</p>  <p>  As Deputies know, shortly after that declaration I published the Government's climate action plan, which adopts the approach outlined by the Oireachtas committee.  We are moving to a whole new approach to governance, with climate budgets and independent recommendations to the Government of what those budgets should be coming from a much-strengthened climate action council.  There will be far greater levels of accountability for individual Ministers on the delivery on climate budgets within their sectors, and far greater accountability to the Oireachtas here as well.  Just as Departments are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, they will in future be accountable to an equally important - if not more important - climate action committee.</p>  <p>  The plan we have set out is ambitious.  Some people will say it is not ambitious enough, while others will say it is too ambitious.  To give Deputies some notion of the scale of the plan, it is important to outline some of the things we envisage happening, because they represent both change and opportunity.  For example, the amount of renewable energy on our grid will increase to five times what it is today.</p><p>The level of retrofitting activity on our homes will be ten times what it is today. The number of electric vehicles will increase from 4% of purchasers today to 100% by 2030.  The number of heat pumps that are installed will be 20 times what it is today.  The number of trees planted will be double what it is today, representing 250 million additional trees planted over the next decade.  The number of people commuting and travelling by public transport or cycling will be 500,000 more per day.  The amount of non-recyclable plastic will go from 66% today to zero by 2030.  The number of sustainable energy communities will rise to 1,500, which is five times what it is today.</p> <p> This is a very ambitious plan in many ways but it is absolutely essential.  I am very conscious, however, that this requires big changes in the way we think about many things.  People will have to change their concept of what types of infrastructure should be part of a society that is committed to decarbonisation.  We will have to change the habits of a lifetime in many ways.  We will have to accommodate 1 million extra people in this country but do it in such a way that is compact, sustainable and connected.  We will have to mobilise very large amounts of private capital to deliver this.  I believe it is a serious test of politics.</p> <p> The plan is built on four very simple principles.  One is the essential nature of Government leadership.  This means the Government taking responsibility for living within strict carbon budgets, driving the changes that are necessary in our society, being open and accountable for that and ensuring that every public body adopts a mandate for climate action.</p> <p> The second principle is effective policies.  We have to pursue policies that impose the least burden but the most opportunity to Irish people, while delivering the essential targets we have to achieve.  It is very important that our homes, enterprises and farms can be resilient and sustainable and will prosper in a changed world.  This requires significant change.</p> <p> Also embedded is the principle of fairness and recognising that we need to support those who are most exposed to change.  We have seen this in very sharp terms with regard to Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  We also need to support those least equipped to manage those changes, especially those who might be at risk of fuel poverty.  We have to make sure that every element of society is making a fair contribution. This is what we call just transition and it has to be at the heart of the plan.</p> <p> The final principle on which the plan is built is one of citizens' empowerment.  This means that engagement and feedback, especially with the younger generation, are embedded in the plan.  We need to find novel ways to help people shape their own communities and also empower communities and individuals to change the way they address this issue.</p> <p> These four principles are entirely interlocked.  We have to achieve in all areas together.  It is a challenge to the way we do politics and public administration and a test of our structures.  I am looking forward to working with colleagues in the Oireachtas to make a reality for our people the work that the all-party Oireachtas committee took on and which we have embedded in the climate action plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900031#GG00200"><p>I very much welcome that the climate emergency has been immediately put back on the agenda of this House in the first week of resumption of the D&aacute;il.  It is only right that we have the opportunity to address the need for urgent actions, given the range of important climate events that are taking place in the coming weeks and disturbing news announcements that occurred over the recess.  In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, released a new special report, hot on the heels of the previous year's report, which shows the devastating effect of the climate emergency on land and food systems.  Also last month, the National Parks and Wildlife Service highlighted that 85% of Irish habitats are in an "unfavourable" condition.  The situation is deteriorating.  We also need to be clear that developing countries are suffering the worst impacts.  Compounding decades and centuries of economic injustice, we are now layering climate injustice on top of the global south.  Ireland must finally take collective responsibility for its polluting emissions.</p>  <p>  Thanks to the Citizens' Assembly and the work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, the Government has at least started to take the issue seriously with its new climate plan.  The reality, however, is that at this late stage, slow, incremental progress is not enough.  This is an emergency.  It is particularly disturbing that Fine Gael is failing to live up to the deadlines set out in the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas committee, which appear to have been dismissed and do not even feature in the Government's climate plan, despite Fine Gael expressly committing to them in the committee in March.</p>  <p>  On the plus side, outside this Chamber, the mandate for greater climate ambition is clearer than ever.  Last week, we learned from a new Eurobarometer poll that 95% of Irish people consider climate change to be a serious issue, with similar levels of support for greater action on renewables and energy efficiency and other climate related objectives.  Another sign of hope is tomorrow's schools strike for climate, which also links with events in New York and elsewhere over the coming week.  Schoolchildren in my constituency will be out and I will join them in Maynooth, Celbridge, Naas and elsewhere.  My daughter was on the strikes outside her school.  Across the country and the world, these strikes will only gather in momentum with each passing week.  I salute all of those involved at the picket lines, as it were.</p>  <p>  How is the Government going respond right now?  I am not referring to reviews or potential measures proposed in a few years' time but the here and now.  My fear is that, as happened in March when attention was focused on the previous wave of school strikes, the Government may patronise young people.  It may congratulate them on their engagement, tell them the Government will listen and talk up how they can respond by turning off lights, buying paper straws.</p>  <p>  There will also be much focus on the youth assembly that will take place in the D&aacute;il in November.  This is a significant and welcome move.  The youth assembly will focus public attention and young people will be able to present their ideas to officials.  I sincerely hope they get a good hearing.  It will be an important day for the D&aacute;il and the young people involved.  We cannot allows this to be the only concrete measure taken in these Houses in the coming months.  Members are well aware that Ireland's emissions are continuing to rise and our 2030 targets are at risk and will not be reduced by town hall promotional events.</p>  <p>  Almost a year ago to the day, I raised with the Taoiseach a particular concern about provisioning for potential fines for missing our climate emissions targets again.  The Taoiseach glibly dismissed my concern by telling me we would not make provision in 2019 but would do so in the following budgetary year.  This is symptomatic of the Government's attitude, or at least it has been in the recent past.  It is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Government will make pledges at the UN Climate Action Summit next week to support youth and public participation.  Let us be honest, however; the problem has not been a lack of participation by young people or a lack of communication.  The problem has been that the Government knowingly neglected Ireland's climate responsibilities for the best part of the past decade.  I watched with amusement and enjoyment Greta Thunberg's testimony at the hearings in the US yesterday, including her deft dismissal of some whataboutery.  One of the Senators hearing the evidence in Congress threw out the usual canards and "What ifs?" when he referred to China and everybody else causing pollution.  I watched as Greta, with great dexterity, batted these aside by arguing that the US should get its own house in order first and worry about everybody else later.  The others, she said, could take care of themselves and the US could show example.  I fully agree with that view.  It is back to the old expression of looking after the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves.  Somebody else's inaction is no excuse for someone else not to act.  We have to mind our own house and we can do that.  We in this Chamber have a responsibility to do all we can to make that happen.  One of the most important points Greta Thunberg made was the need for science to be heard.  Will the Minister respond to the science and will the Government make any substantive commitments at the climate action summit next week to reduce emissions? The current approach of announcements, reviews and business as usual is not enough.  It is not a response to the climate, biodiversity and global warming crises.</p>  <p>  The UN summit is also an opportunity for the Government to chart a new course and respond substantively to young people's calls for real action to tackle this emergency.  The Government should commit to supporting the European Commission's proposal that the EU increase its 2030 targets to an emissions reduction of at least 55%.  While it is welcome that the Government has supported an EU commitment to climate neutrality by 2050, the Government must commit to enacting the necessary legislation to introduce this target at national level, with attendant accountability checks.  I urge that this be done before the next election.  Let us get it done now.  Why wait?</p>  <p>  On air quality, when it comes to measures that would reduce emissions and improve public health, particularly for younger generations, we need look no further than the area of air pollution, which results in more than 1,000 deaths in Ireland each year.</p><p>The Government has similarly put legal risks ahead of young people's health and failed to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  We still do not have a clear air strategy and the number of asthma cases continues to increase.  I ask the Minister to clarify what steps he is taking this month, inclusive of his stated work with the Attorney General, to ban smoky coal and put this strategy in place in order that we will begin to see improvements in air quality this year.  </p> <p> I mentioned biodiversity.  A Fianna F&aacute;il motion which enjoyed cross-party support and was agreed earlier this summer saw this House declare a climate and biodiversity emergency.  I do not wish to wade into the beef crisis and farming issues except to say that the proliferation of well spaces and increased biodiversity must be one of the solutions to this issue.  In this regard, I suggest that it may be worth exploring a REP scheme similar to that which existed in the past, whereby farmers were encouraged and financially incentivised to take environmentally sustainable initiatives on the land with support and advice from the relevant agencies.  </p> <p> On agriculture and the Mercosur deal, Government, inclusive of State bodies, must be a leader on climate change and must seek to empower and assist businesses and individuals.  What we have seen thus far is a Government that follows.  In July, Fianna F&aacute;il, together with other parties and organisations, called on the Government to rethink its approach to Mercosur in light of the disastrous affects of deforestation, the climate change affects of the transportation of commodities from pastures and grazing lands in South America across the globe into Europe, not only in terms of the associated air miles but the rule that we should only consume food that comes from within five miles of our own plates, and the devastating affects on the rainforest, which have doubled down since the fires in the Amazon rainforest.  The Government dismissed this advice but when European leaders and others raised similar issues, the Taoiseach finally listened and agreed to consider them in the context of the Mercosur deal.</p> <p> On the retrofitting fiasco, I am sure every Member of this House received representations in relation to this scheme under which homeowners were encouraged to apply for a grant to retrofit their houses.  When a backlog of applications built up, the scheme fell apart and funding was withdrawn.  Thankfully, it has been restored.  However, the fiasco undermined confidence in the Government's approach to this scheme and many other issues.  We have also witnessed a fiasco in regard to the school transport scheme and the increased number of children seeking eligibility under the scheme, to which the response of Government and the Department has been to pare back the scheme using an accountant's rule to reduce the number of children travelling on school buses.  In the middle of a climate emergency, we should be broadening the scheme and providing more places so that parents will be encouraged to avail of it rather than drive their children to school.  The Government should not be using an accountant's rule to pare back the scheme.  That makes no sense.   </p> <p> In regard to public transport, representing the commuter constituency of Kildare North, I have seen first-hand the Government's inaction in terms of the increasing number of people clamouring to get on to trains and into car parks at railway stations.  We learned recently that the next fleet of rail carriages is due in five years.  Having raised this issue in the House consistently with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and having been told that new carriages would be provided soon, we now learn it will be five years before we get them.  If the Government was serious about public transport and climate change, these carriages would have been ordered when it took office and would be due for delivery for now, but that did not happen.  </p> <p> As matters stand, the Government is in the dock in the Four Courts in regard to its inaction on climate change.  Its mitigation plan is being put through the shredder by a team of counsel.  The outcome may have been announced during my contribution.  The fact that the climate groups could put a stateable case to the High Court, taking the Government to court for a lack of action on climate change, speaks volumes about its approach.  I hope we will see a difference in that approach.  I look forward to the remainder of this debate and, I hope, to actions rather than words.  We are at an emergency stage and we need much more than lip service.  Fianna F&aacute;il will not be found wanting in terms of putting its shoulders to the wheel.  The Government is in the driving seat and it needs to get on board and make it happen.</p></speech>

This week, thankfully, a spotlight will be again shone on the issue of climate action and change.  The protest is being led by schoolchildren.  Millions of people around the world will, in my view, come out to support the logic of uniting behind the science.  All of those who come out will call on leaders in this State and people in this Chamber to deliver an urgent and dramatic increase in action.  People want to see real changes.  Many of the changes that are necessary are very exciting and are, I think, the very essence of policies that parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in and left progressive parties have been advocating for a longer number of years, namely, investment in public services and transport and making sure that the State is in the driving seat in regard to dealing with these issues.  The private sector will not be in the driving seat when it comes to making sure that people's homes are to the highest standards, that the homes that people need are built, that we make a fair and just transition to a zero carbon economy and that we have more aggressive afforestation to act as a carbon sink.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned a just transition.  I do not believe that Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il will deliver a just transition - quite the opposite.  In terms of what is necessary for a just transition, it will be about State investment in public services.  It is important that we listen to the voices of young people who are our future voting citizens.  In my view, they have every reason to inform Government about the direction of policymaking.  We need to see this in the context of social justice and fairness underpinning the environmental changes needed.  As with all structural change the pathway, is as important as the destination.  Climate change cannot be tackled with the same methods and the same thinking that created the problem in the first instance.  We know that bad policy positions and bad policy direction have pushed public spending towards costly and unsuccessful measures, which have a negative impact on society and the economy.  Numerous failures worldwide have emerged where political and economic decision-making was lacking foresight, including, for example, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's climate action plan, which uses a marginal abatement cost curve to help identify the most cost-effective pathway to reducing emissions.  That is a disaster waiting to happen because climate change cannot be tackled through accountancy.  Mathematical equations will not save us.  </p>  <p>  Fine Gael and, I would argue, Fianna F&aacute;il, believe that this will be sorted by market forces, the same market forces that have resulted in creeping privatisation of public services, left many people in substandard housing that does not have the same type of high energy ratings as the homes that wealthier people can afford and caused the cessation of bus services in rural areas.  The Expressway services in many parts of the State ceased because they were not economically viable.  If the Government proposes to underpin its response on market forces and market logic rather than social, economic and environmental need, it will not solve the problems and it will not bring about the structural changes which are necessary.  These changes also will not come about through leaflets and advertisement campaigns, of the type which followed the Minister's launch of the plan.  In terms of the Government's record since then, it published its climate action plan at the same time as it was carving up the Irish Sea into speculative boxes for fossil fuel extraction and agreeing a beef deal with Brazil which will hasten the demise of the Amazon rainforest. </p>  <p>  The Minister's flagship policy of electric cars for everybody has already fallen flat on its face.  According to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is pie in the sky thinking and cannot be done.  The retrofit scheme which the Government put in place also fell apart.  Let us be honest; it was a retrofit scheme that was aimed at people who had money to invest in deep retrofitting.  It was not as a starting point a retrofit scheme for older people who are most in need or a scheme targeted at public housing, which is where we should start.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>What we need to do is make sure that the planning laws and building regulations ensure that every house built in the future has the highest energy rating.  All of the Minister's strategies I have seen so far have been severely wanting and will not tackle the core issue, which is structural and behavioural in nature and desperately requires social justice.  </p> <p> One issue that divided members of the committee was carbon tax.  I am not against carbon taxes in principle.  We already have them and we all pay them but the questions are whether we should increase carbon taxes, what impact they will have and who will be most affected by them.  The Minister mentioned the just transition.  It would be an injustice to people in vulnerable circumstances if carbon tax were increased on heating oil.  It would also be an injustice if extra costs were imposed on transport and people could not afford to buy electric cars or could not use alternatives which, in most cases, are not available.  I do not see how that approach would be fair.  I have heard supporters of increases in carbon taxes say that we can ring-fence income from the tax for more climate change mitigation measures and give money back but I am not convinced that this will happen.</p> <p> The Minister's starting point must be to provide alternatives in the first instance.  He must then measure those against the track record of the two parties that have led this State since its foundation.  What is their track record on investing in public transport?  I have spoken to people who are concerned about some of the Minister's measures.  They have told me that they live in rural areas and do not have public transport.  Many people outside Dublin, even those who live in cities, do not have the type of public transport that is necessary.  As a result, they cannot make the transition we want them to make.  Many people do not have the money to carry out the type of deep retrofitting that is necessary or make other necessary changes.  People are worried and they will be concerned about increases in taxes that they believe will not be fair.  </p> <p> We are not on our own and we must work in unison with our European partners.  We must think internationally when it comes to climate change as well.  We must be strong leaders in meeting our emissions targets and other climate change targets.  We have not been strong leaders and are falling way behind.  We have not met any of the targets we have set.  We can point the finger of blame, as we should, at the US Administration, which has turned its face against climate action.  The President of that country is a climate change denier.  We can be angry and upset about that and point the finger but if we are not meeting our targets and are not leaders ourselves, we do not have the moral and political authority to lecture anybody else.  Nobody on the left or outside the two main parties negotiated the many trade deals, including the most recent one which is in serious conflict with the objectives of achieving environmental protection and climate justice.  The Minister cannot give a speech like the one he gave and say we need to do more, take the lead and make sure we meet our targets and then potentially sign this country up to the Mercosur trade deal, which we know is having a significant impact on the Amazon.  Before the D&aacute;il returned, Members saw the Amazon rainforest burning over the summer months.  This has occurred for many different reasons but, again, it is because industrialisation and profit come first in Brazil and the country's right-wing government is not putting the protection of the environment first.  The driver behind these fires is the effort to create more land for agriculture.  The EU and Ireland are encouraging and enabling that by signing up to a deal that is built around that objective.  Let us not have a level of denial about what we are all doing here and what is necessary.  </p> <p> I am very positive and energised about what about what we need to do because I believe in investment in public transport and that people should have the best homes.  I believe the State has a responsibility to make sure it does what it needs to do, including more afforestation, ensuring building regulations are strong and increasing investment in renewable energies.  That is what we need to do.  We do not need more taxes, an unjust transition and gimmicks such as some of those we have seen in the Minister's plan.  We need real, tangible and practical solutions that will work and deliver the necessary change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900033#JJ00200"><p>I do not doubt for a minute that the Minister is sincere in what he seeks to do in terms of leading this agenda.  However, as a member of the Joint Committee on Action and one of the people who contributed to producing the 42 recommendations that were broadly agreed by its members on a cross-party basis, I am fearful that a tension is emerging between the radical nature of some of the recommendations we made and where the Government sits in terms of its implementation plan.  I am fearful that there is a gap between the climate action plan actions and the joint committee, which is a committee of this House consisting of representatives of all parties and none, and that a tension is emerging between the two.  The committee's report reflected the report of the Citizens' Assembly, which was radical in its actions but based on common sense and easily attainable targets.  I worry, however, that those targets will not be reached.  I hope the Minister continues to engage with the committee about how its recommendations, coupled with the Government's set of recommendations in the climate action plan, can be brought about.</p>  <p>  In chapter 1 of the committee's report, we spoke about the need for a new national framework where new climate change legislation would be enacted in the Oireachtas in 2019 and about how, with regard to new governance structure, action on climate action should be considered a priority activity across all of Government.  We also recommended the establishment of a new climate action council to supersede the Climate Change Advisory Council and the establishment of a standing committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister spoke to those issues but the committee set targets.  I understand that there may be differences of emphasis between what the Government will do and what we have recommended but targets need to be achieved.  I fear that we are pushing actions out in this country to 2020, 2021 and 2022 and that, as every quarter goes by, we miss opportunities for real action.  I appreciate that the Minister has attended town hall meetings, including one in Limerick where he announced that some of the actions in the climate action plan that would be undertaken included a new micro-generation scheme, a transition towards 1 million electric vehicles and a nationwide programme of home retrofitting.  I have no doubt that these objectives will be achieved but I fear that they will not be achieved in a timely fashion or even in the manner set out in the targets driven by the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We have very clear targets relating to ensuring the five-yearly carbon budgets.  This would all be included in the legislation that was to be agreed in 2019.  We also set targets by which the renewable share of electricity generation would reach at least 70% by 2030 and the statutory obligation on public bodies would be strengthened to require that they perform their functions in a manner consistent with the 2050 target.  We need these targets to be set out in very clear legislative terms because the actions that are so vital will flow from this.</p>  <p>  Transport is one of the key thematic areas on which we need action.</p><p>In the context of the target of 1 million electric vehicles by 2030, if one looks at consumer behaviour and analyses of where people stand regarding the switch towards such vehicles in 2019, one finds that there are not enough charging points.  The totemic image which emerged over the summer, purporting to show the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport charging his vehicle at a point that had not gone live, was most detrimental.  It did nothing to create the perception that the Government is doing anything in real terms to meet targets or install charging points throughout the country.  That is the first aspect.</p> <p> There are targets calling for a move from internal combustion engines to fully electric vehicles by 2030.  Consumers are looking at the price points for these vehicles.  They may be willing to make that transition, but the price points are still too high.  Range anxiety is still a massive issue because there are too few charging points.  The kernel of this issue is behavioural change.  If we are to hit targets by 2030 and 2050 and if climate action is to mean anything, then this all has to be about behavioural change.  It is fair to say that no rational person will move from vehicle that runs on petrol or diesel if the price point for an electric vehicle is too high - beyond the means of most people in this country - or if there are not enough charging points.  That is why I must go back to the point I made at the outset about the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  Those targets are tangible and real.  They must drive behaviour across the Civil Service, among all the stakeholders and across Government to ensure we hit those targets in a meaningful way.</p> <p> I hear the messages from the younger generation about where we need to go on climate action.  There is a massive demand for behavioural change and radicalism in Government.  Younger people do not necessarily look at this as a governmental task.  They are looking to all politicians in this House to act together in a non-partisan way in order to drive the change that is needed.  The Minister referred to community ownership of electricity and driving the grid with community-based projects.  I am concerned that we could be here this time next year without having made solid progress towards the democratisation of the production of energy, which would facilitate rural communities in particular to become involved in projects supplying electricity to the grid.  We need action on that and we need it now.  I am fearful that if it is left too much to the committees, we will not see the radical action that is necessary in a timely fashion.</p> <p> I am glad that there is a Bill due before the House later that deals with just transition.  The number of emails I have received calling on us to support this legislation has been phenomenal.  There is a mood among our citizens now.  They want to see workers and stakeholders coming together to ensure that people in carbon-intensive industries can transition into net zero-carbon industries.  Again, I am fearful that we will allow another three quarters or a full year to go by before we do anything tangible to set up a national infrastructure with teeth that can drive that behaviour.  Instead of talking within this little bubble, we must engage with the stakeholders who will drive that just transition to take carbon out of this economy and our society.</p> <p> I want to be supportive of what the Minister and the Government are doing.  However, I am fearful that the targets set in the Oireachtas committee report are already being missed.  We are heading towards the end of 2019.  Among those 42 recommendations were clear targets to be met by the end of this year.  I am fearful that there will be too much slippage.  We need radical action and clear targets so that people can get behind those targets and drive them on.</p></speech>

Millions of school students around the world will go on strike.  They will not be alone.  Workers and trade unions will take action too.  In Dublin, those who can will gather at 12 noon at the Custom House.  This movement is essential.  It will have to grow even further after tomorrow.  It will have to bring even more onto the streets and involve mass civil disobedience, like Extinction Rebellion's plan for Rebellion Week 2 in October.  Most importantly, it will have to involve global strike action by workers to hit the capitalist class in its profits.  This is essential because we are in a fight for survival.  The consequences of the environmental destruction that is happening are not in the dim and distant future; they are happening right now.  We are in the midst of the sixth great extinction event.  The species extinction rate has increased a thousand times against background rates typical throughout our planet's history.  In a world that is 4&deg;C warmer, which is what we are heading for, 50% of the global population will frequently experience unusual heatwaves by 2040.  By 2070, 500 million people will experience humid heatwaves that will kill even healthy individuals in the shade within six hours.  The problem is not that this catastrophic change awaits us in the coming decades, but that if we do not take action and turn things around within the coming decade it is inevitable.  It is locked in because of the amount of carbon, methane, etc., that will be in the atmosphere.</p><p>Yesterday, Greta Thunberg yesterday told the US Congress &quot;I don't want you to listen to me.  I want you to listen to the scientists&quot;.  What are the scientists saying?  The IPCC has stated that we must immediately institute rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.  Climate scientist Kevin Anderson states:</p><blockquote>... when you really look at the numbers behind the report, look at the numbers the science comes out with, then we&rsquo;re talking about a complete revolution in our energy system.  And that is going to beg very fundamental questions about how we run our economies.</blockquote><p>Those are the questions that this Government and capitalist governments around the world refuse to ask, never mind answer.  It is why the Minister comes in and pats the Government on the back for the action it is taking, even though it is completely inadequate.  We are heading towards this disaster with our eyes wide open.  The reason is that the capitalist profit system is a barrier to the change that we need.  The 100 companies responsible for 71% of emissions are a barrier.  They are the ones who support the establishment parties across the globe.  Oil is the lifeblood of the fossil capitalism we have today.  Market capitalisation of the private oil and gas producers is over $3,000 trillion.  They are enormously powerful and they will resist anything which interferes with their profits.  That is why we need this movement.  That is why we need radical action and workers' action and that is why that movement has to be armed with an anticapitalist and eco-socialist programme which puts forward a vision to transform our society and our economy in the way that we need and tackles the question of environmental and social justice.</p><p>At the heart of that is decommodifying basic needs.  I refer to free, expanded and quality public transport, public provision of low-carbon housing and public ownership and control of the key sections of our economy so that we can plan for a rapid and just transition to a zero-carbon economy by 2030.  We also need decarbonisation of the economy through electrification, massive public investment in renewable energy and a transition to sustainable agriculture.  Sometimes it is said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.  Put bluntly, to avoid the end of the world as we know it, the movement needs to imagine the end of capitalism and that movement needs to make it happen.  The demonstrations tomorrow will show how it can be done.</p></speech>

The young people carry banners and placards on their demonstrations calling for system change and not climate change.  It is clear who is running the system which is threatening the planet.  It is not the working class people or the middle class people that the Minister's Government intends to target with increases in carbon tax.  It is the profiteers who are the big polluters and the polluters who are the big profiteers.  The system we need to change is capitalism.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow, millions of young people worldwide will join the global climate strike.  I salute them.  They have achieved more in one year of campaigning than all of the right-wing governments across the world have achieved in decades.  They will be joined tomorrow by trade unionists and workers.  This movement must grow, it will become more radical and I wish it every success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900035#LL00300"><p>I will not repeat the horrific descriptions we have just heard from around the Chamber about what is happening.  I want to raise a number of things, however.  I emphasise the importance of tomorrow.  I am delighted that the Dublin Council of Trade Unions is supporting the march and calling on its members to join it and also that many communities will be mobilising alongside the students.  Indeed, across the world strike action will be taken by longshore workers in San Francisco and dockers in Australia.  They will be striking for two hours.  That is a powerful message to our governments to do something.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I have been crossing paths quite a bit over the obstruction by his Government of the Climate Emergency Measures Bill 2018.  We disagree entirely on a number of issues and in particular on the question of gas as a clean transition fuel.  I want to raise the alarm concerning this issue for everybody in the country.  Within the next week or two, the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste will be going to Europe to represent Ireland and endorse the projects of common interest being put before the European Union.  One of those projects of common interest that we are about to endorse is a deal struck between Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker to locate at least 13 shale gas sites across the European Union.  Three of them might be coming to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In case people are not familiar with the description "shale gas", the term we use is liquefied natural gas, LNG.  The Minister will know that liquefied natural gas is the very same as fracked gas.  The only difference is that it is coming from North America, the location from where most shale gas is transported around the world.  The impact of shale gas is environmentally shocking.  Shale gas does not yield as much CO2 as other types of gas or oil.  It does, however, give off a huge amount of methane and methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide.  Its global warming potential is absolutely massive.  It has an impact for more than 20 years that is 787 times greater than CO2.  We can see from the latest peer-reviewed science, however, that one third of all shale gas across the globe comes from North America.  It is contributing to a huge rise in emissions.  Interestingly, however, if we reduce methane production and emissions the climate responds much more rapidly than to a reduction in CO2.</p>  <p>  Here is the issue for the Minister.  Will he and his Government refuse to sign up to the projects of common interest which include shale gas being transported from North America to the shores of the European Union on the scale proposed?  Will he do something meaningful for the tens of thousands of school students, workers and community activists who will throng the streets tomorrow and again and again after that?  From 8 October, Extinction Rebellion actions will take place for a whole week across this city as well as Cork and Galway.  Will the Minister send out a signal to show those people that he is serious about tackling climate change?  Will he show them that he is not a laggard but a leader by ensuring that Ireland will refuse to sign up to the European Union deal done with Trump?  That is the next big step we could take.  The Minister and his Government have blocked the Climate Emergency Measures Bill 2018.  He has been listening to lobbyists, whether from China, ExxonMobil or our own locally-grown fossil fuel industry.  He has blocked the Bill undemocratically and he continues to do so.  We will still be shouting at him tomorrow to keep it in the ground and allow that Climate Emergency Measures Bill 2018 to pass.  The next most important thing he can do, however, is to refuse to buy into these projects of common interest.</p>  <p>  As we speak, I have a motion circulating around all of the Deputies in this House asking them to sign the motion and call on the Minister and his Government not to buy into fracked gas from North America.  How hypocritical can Fine Gael be?  We ban fracking in our country but we import fracked gas from North America on a huge scale.  That gas will sit in large methane emissions dumps that are really going to ratchet up the climate chaos we saw during the summer.  I refer to the tragedies we saw everywhere from the Bahamas to Mozambique.  The people in this world who suffer the most are not those causing the pollution.  The people of the world who suffer the least, the 1%, are the real polluters.  We can stand in their way, if the Minister will take a brave step and refuse to sign into that project.</p></speech>

Some three and a half years ago, I made a speech during the first of our debates on climate change.  I said then that the debate was no longer about whether our emissions were having an impact.  That debate is over.  The question is now about the severity of our impact and what window of opportunity we have.  I made that contribution in May 2016.  I was commenting in the context of the Rio Conventions, which were, theoretically, a turning point.  It was no turning point because since 1992 our emissions have gone up.  We are looking at the window of opportunity now being much narrower.</p>  <p>  This nation, this D&aacute;il and all of humanity is running out of time.  Climate action and climate justice must underpin every step taken by the Government and it must be an immediate priority.  It will be too late otherwise and the Minister knows that.  I will not use my words now.  I will quote the words of people far more learned and experienced than I.  The United Nations Secretary General stated that "preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives and for our lives".  The intergovernmental panel on climate change, IPPC, gave its starkest warning ever almost a year ago to the day.  The new head of the European Commission, not known for her radical nature, told us that the European Commission has recognised that global and domestic EU interests demand increased ambition in our targets.  The Habitats report told us about the enormous rate of extinction happening among our habitats and different species.  The annual review of our own Climate Change Advisory Council, again not known for its radical nature, published in July, found that Ireland will not come close to meeting its international emission reduction targets by 2020.  The review stated that we need a significant and sustained rate of emissions reduction.  I do not have time to go into the five key findings.  I can say, however, that the Minister's reaction to me saying we do not have a copy of his speech is not acceptable.  We need a speech from the Minister and the Government setting out a recognition of the enormity of what is facing the country.</p><p>We have pushed the Government to take action and it was the children on the street who really pushed us.  I appreciate the Minister is holding up a report to show me.  I have seen many reports.  I have seen a mitigation plan, a framework, an action plan and legislation, while all the time our emissions are going in the wrong direction.  We are narrowing our debate to speaking about a carbon tax as opposed to how we will engage with our communities, which wish to engage with us.  They, more than us, and most of all the young people, realise how important it is.</p> <p> We are part of the EU, which is looking at further militarisation.  Environmental destruction, increased greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and climate chaos are all an inescapable part of modern warfare.  Modern warfare is part of the US agenda, up to which the EU is tying.  We cannot look at these matters in isolation.  Waving a plan at me does not deal with the enormity and severity of what we are facing.</p> <p> I am going home this evening and I cannot wait.  I will attend a meeting on the lack of cycling infrastructure.  Imagine that in the 21st century in Galway city, we are speaking about the most basic cycling infrastructure.  We are still going ahead with more roads, despite the fact that 23,000 people signed a petition to ask the Government to look at a feasibility study for public transport and light rail.  It is not happening.  It is a city in which development is being led by developers all over again.  The Minister's colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, agreed with me on two occasions and told me it was unusual.  He agreed it was developer led with no master plan integrated with climate change.  Climate change must lead everything we are doing.  We also see further prospecting licences in Connemara.  I understand this has stopped simply because of the level of protest.  The Government's policy is to open the door to people to come in and extract more minerals and fossil fuels when we know we cannot do this.</p></speech>

It starts at the Custom House at 12 noon.  It is part of a worldwide movement to keep pressure on governments to change the way they implement climate change strategies.</p>  <p>  In explaining the dialectical nature of the process of development of society, Karl Marx said a thing arrives first as a possibility with the freedom to do something and then becomes its opposite, as a necessity to do something.  We have reached that point.  We do not just have the possibility of changing the way we live and the type of society and economy we have, it is now an absolute necessity to do so.  Climate change is most certainly real and the solutions must also be real.  Tinkering about will not halt this catastrophe.  We need a radical reorganisation of society on a world scale and we should be quite clear about what this means.</p>  <p>  Much commentary on climate change focuses on what individuals and households need to do and, of course, there are measures that individual households can take to help reduce carbon emissions.  However, this is only a small part of the problem.  The majority of energy use and carbon emissions come from industrial activity, the extraction of fossil fuels and the manufacture and distribution of goods.  We need to eliminate fossil fuels as an energy source in terms of transport and the generation of electricity.  I add my support to those calls for the Taoiseach, who will attend the UN summit on climate action next week, to tell the banks, particularly the Irish banks, to stop investing in fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  Rapid transition to renewables is an obvious requirement.  This must go hand-in-hand with retraining workers in that area.  There must be a programme for the just transition as outlined in the Bill before the House this evening.  I certainly will support it.  Last Monday week, there was an interesting piece in a Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, blog on an International Labour Organization survey that shows a clear link between union density and climate change.  Unionised companies are forced to pay greater attention to health and safety issues and the environment.  This is why it is very important that the unions are taking part in the demonstrations tomorrow to show their support for this.  They know they are part of the process of change.</p>  <p>  Many scientists now argue that to make the transition possible we need to reduce energy use.  This is referred to as degrowth.  This is a move away from GDP growth as the only measure of progress.  It has been correctly pointed out that the overwhelming majority of increased income goes to a very small majority at the top.  Despite significant GDP, real wages in the US are at the level of the 1970s, which is almost 50 years ago.  We have consistent rising rates of poverty and inequality levels similar to the 1920s.</p>  <p>  One way to reduce energy is to eliminate planned obsolescence.  In the production of consumer goods if a fridge, washing machine or mobile phone were designed to last at least twice as long as now we would produce less.  We would also reduce the energy used in the transportation of goods.  We could also revert to making goods that are easily and cheaply repaired instead of throwing them away.  A couple of weeks ago, my oven broke down.  It was about eight years old.  I was told the parts cannot be found any more and that I would have to buy new one.  It is ridiculous.  Things are being made to force people to buy more.  We could ban single-use plastics.  We could move to free public transport to reduce car use and cut back on their manufacture.</p>  <p>  A big question is whether these measures would cost jobs.  Would degrowth mean a recession with high unemployment, more austerity and even higher poverty rates?  Not if we take the economy on a world scale out of the hands of the 1% and use it for the benefit of the 99%.  The legal working week could be reduced to 30 hours over four days, sharing out the work and achieving full employment.  A shorter working week does not mean less pay.  We could have a weekly living wage.  This is a vision for a new fair and just society where we would share out the existing wealth, work less for better pay, have good public services, live longer, healthier and happier lives and stop the blatant privatisation of our services in the interests of the market and the markets extracting resources in the Third World.  Many people would probably call this socialism and correctly so.  It is the only way to avoid the impending disaster of climate change.  If this is the case we must change drastically our way of thinking and of running our economies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900036#MM00300"><p>I thank the Minister for taking the debate.  I want to speak on several aspects of climate change, namely, renewable energy and the future diversification of farming.  We need to reduce our dependence on coal and peat.  We are 13% higher in producing energy from those two sources than the average EU country and we need to catch up rapidly to avoid penalties for not reaching our emission targets.</p>  <p>  The proposal in the action plan on climate change is to produce 70% renewable energy by 2030.  This will involve solar and wind energy, and wind energy in particular.  Land-based wind is the most common form of wind energy at present but we need to look at the production of offshore wind power.  Moneypoint will cease burning coal by 2025.  In reality, it has ceased burning coal almost exclusively and is held in reserve.  The ESB is reducing the workforce in Moneypoint from 194 to fewer than 100 and negotiations are taking place on redundancies.  We need to use Moneypoint because it is an essential part of the national grid.  Offshore wind is an ideal energy source to be channelled through Moneypoint to the 400 kV lines bringing electricity throughout the country.  I urge the Minister to promote the development of offshore wind energy both in the Irish Sea and off the west coast in particular, where there is an abundance of wind and the opportunity to generate wind energy.  There is also an opportunity to generate wave and tidal energy.  I understand the technology has not reached a level where it can be used but there should be huge investment in the coming years prior to 2025.</p><p>We need major investment in the development of offshore wind, tide and wave energy off the west coast.  That energy should be channelled through Moneypoint, keeping Moneypoint as an integral part of our national grid.</p> <p> We also need to eliminate the use of peat in energy generation by 2028.  That will result in substantial job losses in Moneypoint and in the midlands in the areas surrounding those peat generation stations.  I know that will be referred to in the debate later this evening.  We have met in west Clare and asked that a task force be set up to develop alternative energy sources to be channelled through wind.  That will involve several Departments, the local authority, local representatives, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to come together in a task force to devise an alternative future for Moneypoint.</p> <p> We also need to look at microgeneration.  The future lies in microgeneration, incorporating solar panels on new house builds, and also introducing microgeneration to existing houses so that people can generate energy and feed it into the grid if they produce excess energy.</p> <p> On farming, the climate action plan has a proposal for increased afforestation and wetting of our peatlands so that they become carbon sinks to capture carbon.  We need diversification away from livestock and perhaps a reduction in the national herd.  I believe that CAP 2020 will promote sustainable farming, diversification in farming, promoting carbon sinks and changing farming practices, reducing use of fertiliser and spreading of slurry.  This will require farmers to change their focus, move away from exclusively dealing in livestock and adopt a future way of working which involves diversification.</p> <p> In that regard, I draw the House's attention to two initiatives in the Burren.  The first is the Burren life project which has been promoted and developed by Brendan Dunford.  It is an extremely effective ecological way of farming.  The other is a recently formed entity, the Burren Ecotourism Network, to develop sustainable tourism, which is led by Jarleth O'Dwyer.</p> <p> The Burren life project is a unique project which allows farmers to farm in a conservation-friendly way.  It supports biodiversity and maintains the built and natural environment within the Burren.  It is a sustainable agricultural management programme within the Burren.  It places farmers at the centre of the conservation agenda, which is critical.  Over 200 farmers in the Burren are involved in the Burren life project covering an area of 15,000 ha.  Within that area there is a significant repository of unique habitat - archaeological habitat and also the flora and fauna that are unique to the Burren.  This allows the Burren to deliver a tourism product that is extremely beneficial to the community.</p> <p> I am sure the Minister is familiar with the Burren; certainly his brother is familiar with it because he uses the winterage in the Burren to look after his livestock there.  It is a unique farming system where the cattle are out all year round, but paradoxically the cattle are driven to the high Burren in the winter where they can feed on the natural grasslands in the limestone fields and the limestone habitat of the Burren.  They are then brought down to the lower Burren in the summer for finishing.  There has been the development of a specific nutritional feed to finish those cattle in the spring.  It is a unique, traditional way of farming that has gone on for over 1,000 years but it was lost in the 1970s when CAP came in and there was a push towards intensified farming, which tended to destroy the natural habitat in the Burren.  That has been redressed by the Burren life project led by Brendan Dunford.  Each farm is given a management plan and once farmers have fulfilled the tasks within the management plan they get extra supports to develop their farm to maintain the structure of the Burren, to maintain the walls in the Burren and to cut back on the scrub in the Burren, which allows biodiversity to occur.  It has led to a 61% reduction in silage and allows farmers to bring water up to the high Burren where there is no water because of the limestone pavement.</p> <p> There is a management structure which is sustainable.  It also allows a very high-quality product to be produced.  It allows farmers to increase their livestock by up to 50%.  Many of these are small farmers who may be moving from five cattle to eight cattle or ten cattle to 15 cattle.  It allows them to increase their income and improve their livelihood.</p> <p> This project has attracted international attention.  The management system behind the project can be transposed into managing olive farms in Spain to bring back traditional farming across Europe in whatever sphere.  It is a very important project and it allows for biodiversity.  Farming in the future, not only in the Burren but elsewhere, will need to look at diversification away from the traditional high-intensity farming that we have today and diversifying into other forms of farming to maintain our environment and to meet our climate-change targets.</p></speech>

Fixing the issues that are caused by climate change in their entirety - damage to our environment as well as global inequalities and societal injustices - will require an overhaul of how we do everything, including how we move, how we eat, how we live, and how we care for each other and the planet.  Fixing these issues in their entirety will give us the opportunity to create a fairer, more equal, more sustainable society and global economy.</p>  <p>  I have spoken numerous times on climate change in this Chamber, as have many of the Deputies here.  Many times we have called for measures, including radical legislation, which are opposed or blocked by Government.  Despite the Government&rsquo;s indication it will now move to ban single-use plastics in the coming years, welcome though it is, this is only on foot of the European Union requiring it.  If we were to be a leader on this issue, the Government would have supported the Waste Reduction Bill when we introduced it two years ago.  It would be supporting Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith&rsquo;s Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill, instead of blocking it at every turn.</p>  <p>  The Government has published an all-of-Government climate action plan.  It identified the targets we need to achieve but was not willing to commit to the significant system change required to truly tackle the climate crisis.  The Government's approach lacks ambition and it is not showing leadership.  It is focused on cost rather than opportunity and we need that opportunity.  Things as they stand are broken.  They are broken for farmers; they are broken for our biodiversity; they are broken for rural areas; and they are broken for our young people.  The verdict in the climate crisis case this afternoon shows the courts were not willing to interfere due to the separation of powers, but there was a clear recognition of the right to a healthy environment.  That is why we need to change radically how we do things.  We need to have that radical ambition when it comes to climate action.  We need to invest in real public transport in all areas, urban and rural.</p><p> In Switzerland, the canton of Graub&uuml;nden has a population density somewhere between those of Kerry and Mayo and yet it has hourly bus and rail services that are linked to the national grid.  It is all doable if the Government is willing to actually commit to helping rural Ireland move towards a greener future.  It cannot do it alone, and right now Government is abandoning it.  We need active travel measures, walking and cycling infrastructure.  Changing all of our petrol or diesel cars for electric vehicles will not deal with the congestion issues that are gridlocking our cities.  In any event, seeking to have 1 million electric vehicles by 2030 is a complete fantasy.  The Government is missing the point.  We need to give commuters an alternative to the car and our children need to be able to walk and cycle safely to school.  We need to have the option of taking a train or a bus and it should be regular.  The lack of investment in public transport is the problem.  We need to make our homes warmer and the Government needs to really kick start the enormous retrofitting project countrywide and start with our social housing stock.  We need to invest in local renewabIes instead of sending all of our money to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for oil, which, as we saw this week, is always going to be volatile in terms of price and supply.  Let us make sure we keep that money here, in our communities.</p> <p> Fine Gael has spent eight years trucking along the same route while inequality has just grown and grown.  If we want to build a fairer, greener Ireland, we need to overhaul the system.  The upcoming budget needs to show a strong intention to change these systems.  The Government cannot continue to nudge itself a little bit forward in the right direction, we need to see an intention in the budget that ambitious system change is what Ireland is doing.  This will also require a change to the national development plan, which currently is not fit for purpose.  It needs a substantial overhaul, to focus on other modes of travel.</p> <p> Tomorrow, students and other people throughout the country will go on strike, calling on the Government to take real climate action.  This has happened before.  The climate strikes in March and May were truly inspirational and it was incredible to stand there with my children, aged 12, 11 and eight, who were screaming outside the gates of Leinster House seeking that leadership from the Government to secure their future with all the other youth of Ireland.  There are inspirational young people who stand up for climate action every Friday outside Leinster House.  The Dundrum Climate Vigil Group comes together every Friday to demand that real climate action be taken by this Government.  Striking for climate action is not infuriating, it is liberating.  The young people who are standing up for their own future - for themselves - know that the system has to be rebuilt.  They are calling on all of us to get behind them so we can do it.  I will be there tomorrow with young people from around the country.  I encourage all Members of this House to join the youth of Ireland and I encourage the Government to heed the youth.  As we begin this new D&aacute;il term, we need to commit to real, radical change, in the full knowledge that that is the only way to secure our future and create an Ireland that is fair and just, and that can be passed down and secured for the next generation.</p></speech>

It is opportune that the debate is taking place on the eve of what is likely to be the biggest global climate mobilisation ever led by school strikers tomorrow.  Millions of people around the world will come together to unite behind the science and call on leaders everywhere to deliver an urgent and dramatic increase in action.  In Ireland, these strikes will take place throughout the country and in my town, Clonmel, there will be an event at the Main Guard at 1 p.m. tomorrow.  I encourage anybody who can do so to turn out in support of that action.  It is also opportune because it comes in advance of next Monday's meeting of the UN Climate Action Summit which has been called by the Secretary General ahead of the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in 2020 in recognition of the dangerous disconnect between current emissions reduction pledges and what is needed to deliver on the Paris Accords.  The Secretary General stated, &quot;Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives and for our lives.&quot;</p><p>A year ago, the IPCC published its starkest warning yet on the risks and impacts of overshooting a temperature rise of 1.5&deg;C.  We remain on course for a warming of more than 3&deg;C and that will have catastrophic implications for society and the environment.  The IPCC has also warned us that we have to cut our emissions in half within the next ten years if we are to stand a chance of limiting warming to 1.5&deg;C.  As a rich nation with a high rate of <i>per capita</i>emissions, Ireland should be doing more by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions well before the target date of 2050.  It is important to recognise that wealthy countries like Ireland with high emission rates have yet to experience the persistent reality and devastating impact of climate change.  The poorest countries and people and the most vulnerable people who are being affected yet they have contributed least to the problem.</p><p>Ireland needs to recognise the urgency and increase the national ambition on this issue.  It is important to remember that 100 large companies are responsible for 71% of emissions and it certainly is not and will not be acceptable to put the burden of dealing with climate change on the backs of ordinary people.  The companies responsible for producing huge emissions should be targeted and made to pay.</p></speech>

I will start with Deputy Lawless.  He criticised Government for what he described as reviews.  The last thing the climate action plan should be described as is a review.  This is the first time we have had a plan.  We have set up an implementation group centrally within the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have adopted targets and committed to a climate Bill, the heads of which will be discussed by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment during this session.  We have 183 action points in that plan and each of them is timelined.  People will be given a chance to evaluate how we are doing, not only in terms of climate emissions but also in delivering the actions.  No doubt we will not hit all the targets because they are ambitious.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cullinane is not here but he stated that by measuring the lifetime cost of different potential technologies, we were relying on market forces.  That is not the case.  Using evaluation of how much different technologies cost and how they impact on the climate is independent of what measures we introduce to affect them, be they incentives or regulations.  I am not sure what he was driving at there.  I was a bit confused by his contribution because he emphasised the urgency of the action but he wanted to defer any action until a lot of other issues were resolved for example until Brazil had resolved its problems.  We do not have the luxury of deferring action.  We have to take action now and sequence it as best we can.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> Deputy Sherlock stated the Joint Committee on Climate Action wanted the climate Bill to be enacted in 2019.  I am seeking to deliver the heads of the Bill to the committee to enable pre-legislative scrutiny this year.  He raised the question of whether we can deliver more quickly on the targets.  If we can, that is great, but at least we have set out clear timelines.  People in each public body are now accountable for delivering them, although I do not suggest we will meet them all.  He suggested that no rational person would invest in an electric vehicle without sufficient chargers being available but this year more than 8,000 people are expected to buy either plug-in hybrid vehicles or battery electric vehicles.  By the end of the year, we will have rolled out 2,500 private chargers and we have committed to providing 1,600 public chargers.  We are committing, therefore, to delivering on the measures.</p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy stated we should listen to scientists and I fully agree with him in that regard.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, on the other hand, took issue with the scientists who tell us gas will be a clean transition fuel and that we need to recognise we will require gas in the transition phase.  I did not hear one suggestion from either Deputy as to what initiatives they are in favour of to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide, other than getting rid of capitalism-----</p></speech>

They still have that position and will probably continue to have it in the years to come.</p>  <p>  Deputy Harty made a thoughtful intervention in indicating where there are true opportunities.  There is no doubt we have ten times the area offshore that we have of land capacity and there is a genuine opportunity for us to deliver in that sector, as is called out in the climate plan.  We recognise we have to change legislative provisions and have outlined timelines for the changes to try to open the opportunity.  In time, albeit probably not in the first auction, we will have to consider the requirement to have a dedicated pot for offshore wind energy to get the industry moving.  The Deputy also recognised the important role of microgeneration, which is very important because it allows communities to become more self-sustaining and is a practical way of engaging people.</p>  <p>  I apologise that I do not have time to address the other contributions.</p></speech>

Yesterday morning it was chilling to hear of the barbaric attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, a decent family man who has contributed greatly to the economic development of the Cavan-Fermanagh area, the much wider Border region and further afield.  It was a violent and sinister attack on a good man, whom I have known well for more than 20 years.</p>  <p>  Kidnapping and abducting an individual has no place in society.  It is most reprehensible and I condemn in the strongest possible terms the deplorable act.  Those of us who grew up in a Border community and have had the privilege of representing a large Border constituency believed that the era of kidnapping innocent people, throwing them in the boot of a vehicle, driving them to an isolated place and inflicting serious injuries was long past and that such thuggery, violence, attacks on persons and general lawlessness will not be tolerated in our area of County Cavan and the neighbouring area of County Fermanagh.  I appeal to anybody who has any information about the attack or the previous serious incidents to speak to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  The thugs, who are obviously dangerous criminals, must be brought to justice without delay.</p>  <p>  It is the latest in a series of attacks on members of Quinn Industrial Holdings, all decent men playing an important and positive role in the local community and economy.  I am particularly concerned that no arrests have been made to date on either side of the Border.  It is a campaign of intimidation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI must work closely together on a daily basis to ensure that it ends immediately and bring those responsible to justice.  The thugs who carried out the deplorable attack on Kevin Lunney must be caught and brought to justice as a matter of urgency.  There is a serious moral obligation on anyone who has any information on the incidents to pass it on to the authorities either in our jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland.  People in my community of Cavan-Monaghan and in the neighbouring community of County Fermanagh are outraged at the attack on Kevin and condemn strongly the other sinister attacks on his colleagues and the damage to property.</p>  <p>  The latest attack is very worrying in light of the many other violent incidents of recent years.  I wish Kevin Lunney a speedy recovery from the horrific injuries inflicted on him.  I think of him and all his family, his friends and colleagues, during what must be a frightening time.  I reiterate that the reprehensible thugs must be brought to justice and feel the full force of the law, whether here or in Northern Ireland.  As I noted, it was chilling to hear the reports yesterday morning of Kevin's abduction.  Reading the newspapers today was even more terrifying in view of the injuries inflicted on an innocent, decent, good man who has contributed handsomely to the development of our country.</p></speech>

People on both sides of the Border were appalled when news of the vicious attack on the Fermanagh-Cavan border emerged in recent days.  The Deputy, along with all other Deputies, will understand that the incident is now the subject matter of a significant investigation by the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for me to engage in detailed discussions at this stage, although I clearly and unequivocally condemn the utterly disgraceful attack that took place on Mr. Lunney.  It was a reprehensible and cowardly act by barbarous thugs who have no regard for human decency or the rule of law on either side of the Border.  I assure the Deputy and the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI will leave no stone unturned in seeking to identify and bring to justice those responsible for the sinister and reprehensible act.  I take the opportunity to wish Mr. Lunney and his family well as they begin the process of recovery from the horrific and traumatic incident.</p>  <p>  Over the past 24 or 30 hours I have spoken to a number of people in the community.  I agree with the Deputy there is widespread revulsion at what has taken place in his constituency.  The Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris, addressed the matter briefly yesterday at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and I have been in contact with him directly. </p><p>I have asked him to keep me fully informed on the progress in this important investigation.  I appeal to anybody who may have information on this terrible incident to please contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Police Service of Northern Ireland as soon as possible in order to assist their inquiries and investigation.  I ask Deputy Brendan Smith to use his influence in his constituency to spread that message, and I know he will do so.  Garda&iacute; may also be contacted by using the Garda confidential line at 1800 666111.</p> <p> I am aware that the question of Garda resourcing has been raised.  Yesterday, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner, who is responsible for the deployment of Garda personnel and resources, confirmed there has been a major uplift in capability in the Cavan and Monaghan division.  The northern region, like other parts of the country, continues to benefit from increased Garda recruitment.  As of 31 August this year, there were 372 garda&iacute; assigned to the Cavan and Monaghan division, supported by 43 Garda staff and eight members of the Garda Reserve.  Over the past three years and due to Government funding for ongoing recruitment, Garda strength in the northern region has increased to approximately 1,500, which is an increase of 150 since the end of 2017.  These garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 150 Garda staff in the region, compared with 116 staff at the end of 2016, meaning there has been an increase of almost 30% in Garda staff in the northern region over the past three years.  This means additional garda&iacute; can be and are being redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties in the region where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p> <p> I acknowledge the importance of the new operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced recently by the Garda Commissioner, as this will see more garda&iacute; on the ground protecting and supporting communities.  I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter and I join him in appealing for anybody with any information on this heinous crime to come forward to the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

During numerous debates in this House on legislation from the Minister's Department and during Question Time, we have discussed the unique policing demands of a border region.  We do not know if those criminals were from our jurisdiction or North of the Border.  I do not know at any rate.  Wherever they are from, they must be brought to justice.  Mr. Kevin Lunney is a senior executive in a company that provides 830 jobs in the Cavan and Fermanagh area.  It is a very considerable level of employment.  He and his colleagues must be assured that they can be safe going to work and people must feel safe in their communities.  Recently, the High Court in Belfast was told of many incidents, including attacks on Mr. Lunney and his colleagues, as well as the property of the company.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister can address satisfactorily the concerns that have been expressed by the chairman of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  He states it is "inexplicable that not a single arrest has been made north or south of the Border despite dozens of incidents".  I know a large number of the 830 people who work in those companies.  They are decent and honourable people who do an honest day of work.  They want to be assured that no threats will be made to enterprises or colleagues going about their daily work.</p>  <p>  I know An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with limited resourcing - that is, unfortunately, always the way - is working assiduously in the Border region to deal with criminality, whether it arises from people in our jurisdiction or those outside it.  I repeat that there must be a conscious decision made when resources are being allocated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there are unique policing demands on a border Garda division.  Please ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the relevant personnel, equipment and resources to root out this criminality and deal with these thugs.</p>  <p>  These thugs have no support in the communities that I am privileged to represent in this House.  I come from that immediate area.  I know where Mr. Lunney was abducted in Kinawley and where he was dropped off in Cornafean in Cavan.  I know the area very well.  I speak for those communities and they will not tolerate that behaviour.  They are absolutely appalled by what has happened to a decent man.</p></speech>

Fortunately, we have never seen such a positive relationship between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I am confident that this close co-operation will enable both to continue to combat the threat posed by criminals who seek to exploit the policing challenges posed by the Border.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the concerns that many communities close to the Border have about recent criminal-related events and the impact of Brexit.  There is no question about the lethal terrorist intent of paramilitary groups and the persistent threat they present, as well as the cross-Border efforts of mobile organised crime groups responsible for multiple incidents, including burglary.  This is the wider context for the increase in Garda resourcing in the area that I referred to earlier.  It is also the context of the Garda Commissioner's operational decision to establish another armed support unit in Cavan.  The Garda Commissioner has now established armed support units in all Garda regions to provide an armed response capacity on a regional basis to support and supplement the national emergency response unit.  In the northern region, armed support units are based in Ballyshannon and Dundalk, and arrangements are now in train to provide for the establishment of a unit in Cavan.</p>  <p>  I know everybody in the House appreciates the very serious impact that a crime like this can have on both a victim, his family and the wider community, as outlined by Deputy Brendan Smith.  I take this opportunity to wish Mr. Lunney all the best in his recovery and I assure those who live in the Border region, including Deputy Brendan Smith and his constituents, that their safety is being given the highest priority by the State in this regard.</p></speech>

He issued a press release welcoming it.  I do not know if the Minister can hear me but I ask him to listen to me as I cannot think of anything more important in my constituency.  This is very important for Ardee.  The Government has increased its investment in Ardee and the town will grow from a population of 5,000 now to more than 8,000 over the next number of years.  Planning permission has been given for hundreds of houses and the town is chockablock, held to ransom every day by hundreds of heavy goods vehicles coming through, which affects the health of the people, delays business and prevents normal commerce and social interaction.</p>  <p>  What has happened?  It has taken 20 years for a Minister to be successful at the Cabinet table in announcing funding for the Ardee bypass and I welcome the work done by the current Minister.  We need his help and support now.  Never has Ardee and County Louth needed a Minister more than at this moment.  The decision made by the Minister with the Cabinet to make this road "a strategic investment priority" has been overturned by a bureaucrat in Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  He has taken upon himself a decision to stop this road and put the plan into cold storage without reference to the Minister, his Department or the chief executive of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Yesterday, I heard a rumour that the Ardee bypass plan was being put into cold storage and I got the facts indicating that at the very minimum it would be 2020 before the road plan could proceed.  According to TII, "the design of this road is safe and compliant in every respect."</p><p>It meets all the requirements and would have been built before now but the money was not there until the Minister, effectively and efficiently, got it for us.  It must go ahead and there must be no delay or procrastination.  </p> <p> Some people had real and serious issues at two important intersections.  Those were discussed with Louth County Council and the council commissioned this report of which the Minister's Department no doubt has a copy.  It is a response to the submissions of the people from Mullanstown and Coole.  One of the key reasons for not proceeding with this road was, according to the bureaucrat in question, because of the increased commitment to meeting the needs of vulnerable road users coupled with an increase in walking and cycling, creating different desirable outcomes to be achieved by the design.  That raises the question as to exactly how many people cycle and walk on these junctions.  This report is very clear on that point.  There is a weekly average of 13 two-way pedestrians and 15 two-way cyclists on the junction at Townparks Road and, on the Mullanstown Road, there is a weekly average of 11 two-way pedestrians and 15 two-way cyclists.  The sums do not add up at all.</p> <p> There is an agenda somewhere in Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to take this &euro;34 million away from Ardee and spend it somewhere else and TII confirmed that is what will happen if the Minister does not overrule TII on this matter.  This money will not be spent in Ardee.  We heard what the Green Party said about this road yesterday and, if there is a general election, this project may never proceed at all.  It is important that the Minister uses his power to get the funding for the road and delivers it.</p></speech>

I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority for local and regional roads, or for TII in conjunction with the local authorities concerned for national roads.</p>  <p>  That is not to suggest that the Deputy is wrong to raise the matter here; I am just telling him the procedures that are exercised when there are individual decisions of this sort to be made and where the power lies.</p>  <p>  The project scheme in question consists of 4.5 km of single carriageway providing a western bypass of the town of Ardee.  The proposed scheme will be a type 2 single carriageway and comprise six road junctions, including a proposed roundabout on the N2, and two river bridge structures.  The benefits of the scheme include the bypass of Ardee, road improvements for the town, reduced journey times and traffic and enhanced access to the north west region. </p>  <p>  As recently relayed to the relevant Oireachtas committee by TIl, Louth County Council, in January 2018, provided the preliminary overall plan for the project to various stakeholders, including residents.  As a result of the information provided, residents from the Mullanstown-Coole community convened public meetings in April 2018.  At those meetings, concerns were expressed about the impacts that the scheme might have on local traffic movements.  Of particular concern was the closure of the Townspark Road west of the new bypass and the closure of the Mullanstown Road east of the new bypass, on the Ardee town side, and the consequences of these closures.</p>  <p>  While the design of the scheme was completed in 2004, there have been significant changes since then, such as the construction of a number of additional houses, the growth in membership of, and activity around, sports clubs.  These changes and increases in walking and cycling activities create different desirable outcomes to be achieved by the design.  In September 2018, Louth County Council identified a number of options for possible changes to the junctions on the scheme.  All the options require an amendment of the planning permission and additional land if they are to be progressed.</p>  <p>  On 29 August, Louth County Council sought the approval of TII to commence the tender competition for the construction of the 2004 design that complies with the planning permission and fits within the acquired land.  Local residents had indicated support for this progression to construction on condition that there was a commitment from TII and Louth County Council that subsequent amendments to the junctions would be subject of a new planning procedure.  Following the consultation with residents and the concerns raised by them, TII decided not to grant approval for the 2004 design and instead requested Louth County Council to undertake a review.</p>  <p>  The scheme is now under review.  TII has advised that it is anticipated that the review will delay the project by a period of 12 to 18 months.  However, this review has the potential to incorporate significant benefits as it is intended to address many of the concerns of residents and to improve on the previous plan devised back in 2004, some 15 years ago.  Louth County Council has suggested that a non-statutory public consultation process be undertaken.  This will provide the opportunity for all stakeholders to have an input.</p>  <p>  Louth County Council's first priority will be the preparation for, and organisation of, the public consultation events.  It is anticipated that these events will be open to the public towards the end of this year or early next year.  The most appropriate technical option will then be progressed to a part 8 planning process.</p>  <p>  If planning approval is secured and additional land is required, a compulsory purchase order will then be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In parallel, the works already commenced on the ground will be concluded and Louth County Council will engage with relevant service providers to ensure that the necessary diversions have been progressed.  The business case will be updated and submitted for review and, subject to all the necessary approvals being received, including Government approval, Louth County Council then will aim to go to tender with the revised scheme.</p></speech>

The Minister's certainty that the proposal will go ahead would be one thing if he knew he was going to be in government for the next five years but policy changes are coming for our national road network and that is a different thing altogether.  Ardee cannot afford to take that risk.  It cannot afford to wait because it has waited for 20 years.</p>  <p>  The Minister has provided the money.  TII is saying that no one wants to delay this project but it does want to delay it despite having stated that the design is safe and compliant.  The money is there and there is absolutely no reason for this project not to proceed.  The Minister has much experience in this House and the Seanad and he knows damn well what is going on here.  Somebody has an eye on this &euro;34 million and intends to take it from Ardee and put it elsewhere.  The people of Ardee will not allow that to happen and the Minister must intervene to ensure that it does not.</p>  <p>  An economic and social case can be made for the project.  Is the Minister telling me that strategic investment priorities decided by him and the Government can be overturned without reference to him, without his even getting a note or knowing about it?  Is that what is going on?  That is not a version of the Minister that I like or that the people expect.</p>  <p>  TII made reference to sporting clubs as part of its decision to review the scheme and that is unfair and unacceptable.  It undermines the support those clubs have given to the bypass.  I have already identified the issues about pedestrians and the very small number of them that we are talking about.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding those concerns, there is an existing road network adjoining the proposed motorway.  Louth County Council should improve and widen those roads, and improve the access to them, if those things are issues.  If the Minister and TII decide to delay this project, it will mean that this project, which now costs &euro;34 million, will probably cost in the region of &euro;40 million or more in the future, if it is to be built at all.  Spending &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million now to improve the road network around the proposed bypass would meet the requirements.</p>  <p>  I call on the people who have objected and have made their cases to TII to withdraw those objections and decide to allow construction of the road to go ahead.  I will certainly commit, as a local politician, to assist in organising for money to be spent on the adjoining roads.</p><p>If in the future other things can happen, they will happen then.  However, if it does not go ahead now it will never happen.  There are people at work in this House who will make sure that it will not.  That would be appalling and a disgrace.  Ardee must come first.  The money is there.  </p> <p> The Minister is the key person in this.  I am seeking a meeting with him through his private office to discuss other issues which arise.  I ask him to stand up and be the Minister we want him to be.  He provided the funds, he put it on top of his press release.  He must not let it go to the bottom of the pile. </p></speech>

I recognise the difficulties in which he finds himself and his frustration at the delay.  I should reiterate that it is not my job to interfere in individual matters of this sort or individual decisions.  My job is to set policy which I have done.  The Deputy is correct in saying that I very strongly welcomed this project when it was announced and I still welcome the fact that it will go ahead.  I would be very distressed if I thought for one moment that there was any sinister or untoward motive by anyone in delaying this project.  According to the information I have, TII has taken the pulse of local residents.  The design of this project goes back to 2004.  They have taken the wishes of local residents into account, including the presence of sports clubs which have been set up and the changes that have taken place.  They have not abandoned the project and I would be very surprised had they done so.  What they have said is that because of the length of time which elapsed it is necessary to review some of its conditions and so it will do that.  That is in response to residents who have made some very good points.  Regrettably, the result will be a 12 to 18 month delay.  There is absolutely no intention of which I know that this project will be abandoned but they have decided it would be wise to take into account developments over the last 15 years which seems reasonable, if very frustrating.</p>  <p>  I will certainly meet the Deputy privately on this and will convey the views of that meeting and his remarks this afternoon to TII.</p></speech>

She did a fantastic job on bringing together the thinking of our discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and unions including SIPTU and Mandate, as well as local communities who have been engaged in really difficult transitions, to get it right.  I also thank the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers for its support which has been very helpful in drafting this Bill.  It is a really precise, well drafted piece of legislation.</p>  <p> It is a 2018 Bill.  We have been thinking about how we can get a just transition in the radical system change that we need, of which Deputy Catherine Martin spoke earlier, for quite some time.  It was very progressive that during 2019 the Joint Committee on Climate Action also considered this subject and spent some time considering what we must do.  There are various ideas such as creating a just transition task force.  Real concern was rightly expressed at the committee on the specific case of the midlands.  The midlands authority's local employment sub-committees are actively engaged in this.  However, the specific architecture which we wish to establish in State services through this Bill is essential and will fit in with some of the other actions that are taking place.  It establishes a commission which would bring specialist expertise to bear in difficult transition issues.  A variety come to mind.  I wish this legislation was already in force as in the absence of this architecture, Bord na M&oacute;na workers and the midlands are left without this expertise and mechanisms to work out how we move from the extraction of peat towards the creation of a whole new economy in the midlands.  There is a similar issue in Moneypoint of how we can make sure that the communities around Kilrush, Kilkee and south Clare can transition away from the burning of coal to a whole new economy which to my mind is open before us in the development of offshore wind and other opportunities which we would like to see developed.  </p>  <p>   This is not only a matter for workers, trade unions and employers because local communities are also caught.  Take the question of how we manage afforestation in counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon where people rightly feel that the current model does not take communities into account.  Yesterday, I gave the example of what would happen if we achieve the Government's electric vehicles objectives.  That has great implications for the motor car industry.  Those cars have a fraction of the number of moving parts and require a fraction of the maintenance of combustion engines.  How will we start to retrain our mechanics for that transition in advance so that the change is made smoothly?  We need to do so in the midlands especially.  Yesterday, my Green Party colleague, Councillor Pippa Hackett, said very rightly that we need to avoid what happened in other towns, villages and other areas, such as south Wales where the mining industry was closed down but there was no regard for the local community, leaving deprived towns and areas.   That must be avoided.  This Bill sets up a detailed specific mechanism to achieve this objective.  It sets up a board that would be appointed on a principle which I introduced in my own time as Minister, namely, that the Oireachtas would engage in appointing some members of the board making it broadly representative.  It would not be specific in that there would be an obligation to have a representative from one institution or another, but that this House and the joint committee would be trusted to assist the Government in having a truly representative board.  It gives the powers to that commission to prescribe companies.  We would immediately make Bord na M&oacute;na a prescribed body.  Rather than the current situation where there is no systemic approach to the transition in place for Bord na M&oacute;na's workers and the midlands communities, the Bill would prescribe Bord na M&oacute;na and require it, as a prescribed body, to engage in the development, with the commission, of a just transition plan and look at all the areas we must consider.  How do we deal with workers who may be coming to the end of their time in the company?  How does one retrain and provide education for other opportunities?  I am tearing my hair out because a company with the skills and engineering and energy capability of Bord na M&oacute;na should be centre stage in the massive expansion that we require in areas such as retrofitting, renewable power and projects which they could take on but are not taking on at this time.</p>  <p>  The Bill allows for just transition plans which are plotted out with the input of all stakeholders into how it is written.  When written, it allows for a review procedure of its implementation, whether it needs to be revised and what has been learned to date.  If there is a dispute in its implementation, there is a mediation system to address this.</p><p>We should do what we do well in this country, namely we must work in the manner of a social partnership to bring all the different actors and players in to look at how it is working, to adapt and to make sure it is delivering for the people of the midlands, Clare, Sligo and Leitrim.  We must do so for every other change that will come as well because the scale of the change we need to make is so great.</p> <p> There are other pieces of architecture for which the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, might be used as a vehicle.  That may have to happen in the interim because in the absence of this type of legislative or institutional architecture, the WRC is one forum in which we might be able to tease some of these issues out.  This legislation allows for a flexible institution within the State, not a huge additional quango or body.  It is designed and set out under legislation to be able to bring in specialist advisers.  For going up to Leitrim, for example, it would be bringing in the best foresters and the best people involved in community development to look at the best way of acting.  Then, as it switches its focus onto a plan for Moneypoint, it would be able to bring in experts to ask what the prospects for offshore wind there really are.  It seems to me that it has a huge opportunity.  The development of offshore wind needs locations with deepwater ports with a jetty, which Moneypoint has.  It requires large platform areas where the turbines and other engineering needs could be laid out, which Moneypoint has.  It needs a grid connection to transfer the power, which Moneypoint has.</p> <p> Under this just transition commission, we would be able, to take the example of Moneypoint, to bring in the grid experts, the offshore turbine experts and the international people who work in this space to see how we could do it.  To think in real detail, we could then ask what the role of the ESB will be, what the role of the workers will be and what are the benefits and the downsides for the local community and we could make sure everyone is heard.  This is something that we can and will be good at in this State in carrying out the transition when we work collectively.  As a small country, people can be pulled in and we have a long-standing tradition of working in that collaborative way.  It is the way to go.</p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, when she was making a statement on climate change earlier, rightly said that we have had a terrible record in this D&aacute;il of the Opposition producing precise and effective legislation, be it in the area of waste reduction or in ending offshore oil and gas exploration - I could go on - whereby the Government has stymied it in every instance with the use of a money order or other mechanisms in order not to allow legislation coming from the Opposition to become law.  I hope this will be the start of a different and a better approach.  I hope there will be a recognition from Government that this Bill is a piece of the architecture that fits in critically within the all-of-Government climate action plan.</p> <p> I have just come from the High Court and I listened carefully to the judgment on the climate Ireland case.  I know a lot of people involved in that case are probably disappointed, thinking they failed to get the necessary order to restrain or pull up the Government for its lack of ambition.  The message I got walking away from the court was that the judge was making the point that because of the separation of powers he could not intervene, but I came away thinking that it is up us now as legislators.  The judge specifically said it was the Legislature as well as the Executive that have the responsibility to show ambition.  We are going on climate strike tomorrow and the basic message is that the science must be listened to.  The science will require us to make a dramatic leap of additional ambition.  That will effect change in our society.  We need to make sure it is change for the better.  This Bill can help us do that in an organised and systemic way.  We can and will be good at this and that is why I hope all parties in the House will support it today, as it moves to Committee Stage and to enactment.  I yield to my colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p></speech>

Climate change is the greatest threat we face and our response to it must be swift and far-reaching.  It must also be socially just.  There are no jobs on a dead planet, but there are green jobs in a new green economy.  This Bill is designed to ensure that workers and communities have a real opportunity to shape our transition away from fossil fuels and ensure that all Government decisions on climate change take workers' employment into consideration and create decent, high value jobs as a function of their implementation.  No one can be left behind.</p>  <p>  Some 1,700 workers are directly employed in the peat extraction industry, while a further 2,500 are employed in support roles.  There have already been job losses in the sector in recent years and the Government's response to protecting the futures of these communities has been wholly inadequate.  There are similar warning signs in the oil and gas industry and this issue will only become more apparent as time goes by.  We know that these industries are unsustainable, so there is no excuse not to act now to provide a safety net for those who work in them.  We cannot simply leave these workers behind and create a post fossil fuel rust belt in the midlands.  Workers who have lost jobs in fossil fuel industries should be able to redeploy to new sectors and it is incumbent upon the Government to provide retraining and opportunities to facilitate this.  Providing for that changeover is at the heart of the Green Party's Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  The national just transition commission that this Bill seeks to create provides a range of measures to address this.  It will bring together communities, workers, ecological experts and government to provide for dialogue and mediation in finding meaningful solutions for the communities affected by a wind-down in our fossil fuel industry.  It will also play a crucial advisory role to the Government and other State agencies in providing them with the expertise they need to maximise the employment opportunities of a low-carbon future.</p>  <p>  By taking action and planning for a just transition now, we will reap the dividends of a new green economy tomorrow.  If we have the vision to grasp the benefits of a decarbonised economy, we stand to benefit from job creation in climate-smart agriculture, in the smart-grid sector and in expanded solar photovoltaic and wind energy.  With this Bill, we will have the opportunity to create a fairer economy while protecting our planet.</p>  <p>  Before I conclude, I would like to express my sincere thanks and m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas to Sin&eacute;ad Mercier for her Trojan work in drafting this Bill.  She has been a tireless advocate for the principles of a Just Transition and this Bill is a testament to her commitment to workers' rights and climate justice.  I hope the Members of this House will support our Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018 and stand with us in defending workers and creating a more equitable green economy in the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900043#TT00500"><p>The position in the climate action plan we have produced is that we recognise there are clear obligations on Government to lead, there is a need to have effective policies designed, there needs to be fairness in the transition and there needs to be citizen empowerment.  Those are the four pillars on which the plan is built.  They are interlocking and they are not to be siloed off into different areas.  Each is central to the work of the implementation group that is working from the Department of the Taoiseach with my Department, which is working right across Government to align the actions of all Government Ministries and bodies to support the climate action challenge.</p>  <p>  Just transition must inform a wide range of policies that are operated by public bodies.  For example, we will have a debate about the climate pricing issue and people will want to know where just transition comes into that.  We will want to talk about strategies for retrofitting and just transition will rightly be part of that, as has already been indicated.  We will want to look at the design of rural, urban and climate change funds and the type of calls and how they should be used to support initiatives and just transition challenges.  We will want just transition to inform the work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the education and training boards and the institutes of technology as they seek to develop opportunities.  We will want to inform our work within the European Union as it looks at coal and peat platforms and how that can be supported.</p><p>Every element of government is at the heart of the just transition agenda and it goes to the core of the Government's obligation to lead on climate action.  I have some misgivings about the scale of work the Bill envisages for this unelected body, as it flies in the face of the sort of accountability Deputies will demand of the Government and Ministers, in order to account for how we are going to deliver just transition in respect of the different challenges that come our way.  A sense of Government responsibility is at the heart of that.</p> <p> That said, I recognise that the design of just transition must involve a wide range of input and dialogue.  That was brought home to me as I sought to grapple with the issues arising in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I have met with the board and the workers' directors, as well as with public representatives, including some of the Deputies here, the regional transition team that has been set up in the midlands, the regional enterprise and skills teams, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and EU coal and peat platforms, which are all valuable participants.  I recognise that in designing a response to both this challenge and others, I need to draw together a cross-Government response.  That is why, when we went to the Government after the announcement of the planning decision and challenge that made it established policy to seek a graduated exit from peat, the Government's very first decision was to form a cross-Government group which is being chaired from within the Department of the Taoiseach, in order that we can tap into a wider range of policy and skill areas to inform the sort of response we design.</p> <p> It is important that just transition is seen as being at the heart of climate action policy, not as something that is hived out to an independent commission.  There should be an expectation that the Government, in leading the climate action plan, will be taking responsibility for it.  However, that does not mean the Government should not be held accountable, and just as we have recognised that the Climate Change Advisory Council's role needs to be strengthened in order to be more decisive in setting the framework within which the Government works, we also recognise that the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, a body I have worked with over many years which has representation across the social partnership interests, has an important role in helping to evaluate and identify the challenges the Government needs to meet.  Within the climate action plan we have assigned that specific role to the NESC in order that it would be able to look at the transition needs of different cohorts and draw on international experience, but also examine the work we are doing in an appraising and critical way.  It is important that we seek to develop and deliver best practice in just transition just as we seek to deliver best practice in addressing the wider challenges of climate action.</p> <p> I recognise the need for us to collectively debate and shape just transition within the Oireachtas, and to interact as we always do in committees in analysing how well we are responding to different opportunities; how we are shaping those opportunities; whether the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, or other bodies are stepping up to the requirements; whether the regional enterprise strategy is adequate to the challenges in particular regions, and so on.  That is important, but my concern about this Bill is that it goes way beyond what was envisaged by the Oireachtas joint committee, in that it has created a commission of quite extraordinary powers.  The proposed commission would have the power to designate any body, be it public or private, regardless of its size, as coming under the obligations of this commission, and it would impose an onerous process on it without any clear regard as to the feasibility of that identity being able to deliver on those obligations, let alone remain in business while this process is developing.</p> <p> The Bill will also create new dispute resolution mechanisms which will be parallel to experienced institutions such as the Workplace Relations Commission.  I have concerns about the elaborate design that has been put into this Bill, which in many ways is seeking to give powers that most of us would regard as ultimately being the Government's responsibility to a commission.  If issues were to arise, such as those in Moneypoint or Bord na M&oacute;na, people would want not to write to some commission; they would want us to be in here in the House debating the adequacy of the response, and looking at whether we can do new things, such as wider bog restoration, retrofitting in the midlands, or other initiatives that are needed in the midlands to drive forward our regional enterprise strategy and seize the opportunities of a low-carbon economy.  Those issues go to the heart of government.  Different Ministers should be taking responsibility for issues within a coherent climate action plan in order to deliver the sort of response we need for just transition.  If we take that away and do not make it an integral part of what I and other Ministers have to do, and do not make ourselves accountable to the Oireachtas, we will fall short, and people will feel just transition has been shoved out into this body and is not going to the heart of what we in government need to do.</p> <p> I understand the thinking behind this Bill and it is important that we bring it before a committee in order to analyse and evaluate the needs and structures we need to deliver.  That is worthwhile.  However, in developing the structures of the climate action plan and its capacity to work across the Government, and by putting in place actions that are monitored and delivered in a coherent way from the centre of government, I hope we can be in a position to deliver a just transition, which everyone now recognises goes to the very heart of a successful climate action plan.</p> <p> Some people say town hall meetings are not always the best way of engaging with people but I have held many town hall meetings and have met many people who are anxious, concerned, and who recognise that they need to do something.  Tomorrow's climate strike will reinforce that need.  Many people are confused and they need to be empowered and engaged with, and finding better ways of engaging with those people is also very much at the heart of government.  The climate action plan contains some good initiatives around green schools, expanding sustainable energy communities, and new forms of dialogue at local level to engage people much like the Citizens' Assembly did at national level.  Many of these policy instruments are valuable, but I believe they need to be at the heart of the plan, and citizens' engagement, just transition, Government leadership, and the choice of best practice policy initiatives need to be pillars of the plan as well.  I understand peoples' concerns, which I am sure will be expressed here, because these issues challenge us and managing a just transition in the face of these challenges will be a test of the Government.  We have to design policy instruments that are more attuned to the ability and leverage the Government needs to apply, and to the accountability we need to have in this House.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>That is my sense of this and I look forward to the engagements in the committee to tease out how we manage this in an effective way.</p> <p> I am aware that some Deputies will be concerned about the passage of the Bill.  I assure the House that no issue is getting more attention from me than this challenge, especially in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na and the midlands region.  This is a very serious issue and we are giving it serious attention as we seek to ensure, to the best of our ability, that we protect workers who have been very loyal and committed over a long period.  We also recognise that the wider region, beyond the workers who are directly affected, is challenged by this situation.  We need to evolve policies that recognise both sets of challenges.  We will continue to work hard to develop those responses.</p></speech>

We are committed to protecting workers and communities as we decarbonise the economy.  A climate crisis is unfolding and the State must decarbonise in a way that is not only sustainable but also fair, equitable and deliverable for the communities which stand to be most affected.</p><p>Before discussing the Bill, I will address the context on the ground.  Fianna F&aacute;il is extremely concerned by the announcements by the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na of major job losses at the Moneypoint coal plant and peat-fired plants.  The recent An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision regarding the operations of the west Offaly power station is also putting more jobs at risk.  This summer saw the closure of the Lough Ree power station and subsequent layoffs at the Mount Dillon Bord na M&oacute;na works in Lanesborough.  These businesses have been central to rural communities for many generations.  We met the workers of the Mount Dillon plant during the summer and experienced the sheer frustration and sense of being let down by companies of the State and the Government.  The Government's response to these developments has been appalling.  We need a proactive, inclusive and equitable approach that prioritises social justice and the welfare of all affected employees, families and towns.  Permitting an unjust transition and ignoring the real concerns of workers and communities risk undermining public trust and impeding climate action.  The choice facing us is to stay passive and allow the transition to happen to workers and communities or to actively shape this transition together, prioritising social justice and the welfare of all the workers and communities involved.</p><p>The Minister spoke about citizens' empowerment.  I will place on record what the Longford and Roscommon county councils are doing in bringing together a collaboration group, which has five members from Lanesborough and five members from Ballyleague.  They are taking a proactive approach to addressing this issue by treating Lanesborough and surrounding areas within a 30-minute commute as an employment hub.  The group will meet on Saturday in a stakeholder brainstorming consultation.  As well as members from the local community, the group includes influential business people from far away who have ties to the area and captains of industry in the wider area will attend.  It will meet IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland early next Monday to report its deliberations, findings, recommendations and suggestions.  The Minister spoke of citizens' empowerment and community engagement.  Here is a group of people working for the betterment of its community and we need to respond to that.  An official should be designated to liaise with it and help it in its deliberations.</p><p>We cannot merely have a managed transition.  We need one that is equitable and takes account of the obligations on the State, the responsibilities of employers and the need to protect the most vulnerable.  The European Commission has stated:</p><blockquote>Ensuring a socially fair transition is crucial to ensure a politically feasible transition.  This will be challenging, but nowhere as challenging as facing the economic and social consequences of failing to act.</blockquote><p>We also have to avoid any approach that creates a false dichotomy between protecting communities, on the one hand, and necessary climate action, on the other.</p><p>The Bill contains several positive elements, most notably the creation of a new body to bring all stakeholders together, mediate and ensure clear plans are produced that would support workers and the wider community.  The integration of fundamental principles, such as the principles of climate justice and conservation of biodiversity, into the decision-making of such a body is also very welcome.  I recognise that this is a complex area given that we already have a crisis, especially in the midlands.  The new body would potentially have to work with several different State actors.  I also appreciate that the Bill was developed prior to the deliberations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action and ahead of the proposals agreed in the committee's landmark report.  My colleagues will be aware that the committee also recommended the creation of a task force with similar functions to the commission envisaged in the Bill, including carrying out early assessments of social and employment aspects, providing training for workers, examining social protection needs and delivering local economic diversification plans.  In the report of the joint committee it was a particular priority of Fianna F&aacute;il that a new national task force would have an independent steering committee and chairman.  It was also agreed that it would be structured to allow it to make optimal use of existing structures, draw on expertise and enable investment to be effectively targeted.  The issue of membership and appointments is an area deserving particular attention, which should be teased out on Committee Stage.  Other amendments may be necessary to align the Bill with the committee's earlier recommendations, including how a new body would overlap with a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council.</p><p>Ideally, we should not need this legislation.  The Government could and should establish such a body today.  We are discussing this Bill because of knowing neglect and an absence of joined-up thinking.</p><p>As I said, the Oireachtas committee stated in March that a task force must be established for the midlands as a priority.  The Government's climate plan, which was released in June, downgraded this proposal to the establishment of a just transition review group located in the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  The Government has also pointed to the existing midlands regional enterprise forum.  The workers do not need further research.  We need Government leadership.  Workers deserve immediate supports and long-term investment in the region.  The Government's dismissive, disorganised response has undermined public trust.</p><p>I welcome that Bord na M&oacute;na previously recognised the need to end peat extraction and burning and that the company is taking major steps to diversify its business.  We need greater consultation, however, and engagement with workers long in advance of decisions on redundancies and investment.  This applies not only to Bord na M&oacute;na and peat but also to the ESB and other fossil fuel industries, including operations at Moneypoint.</p><p>An effective just transition strategy requires local and bottom-up participation by everybody affected.  There are very clear legal obligations on the State to facilitate public participation in decision-making.  These must be closely followed.  Fianna F&aacute;il is clear that communities must not be left on their own to manage the impacts and I welcome that the Bill seeks to address this.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that EU funding also should be deployed to respond to those job losses.  The Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action was informed of best practice examples, including in Spain where agreement was reached on a significant investment package for affected communities, alongside the phasing out of coal mines. The Government's climate action fund did not prioritise the midlands despite Bord na M&oacute;na's long-known phase-out plans.  The Government needs to be focused on long-term investment and not merely support for short-term projects or once-off events.  It also needs to consider the use of revenue generated from carbon taxation for training and investment, with a particular focus on poorer households.</p> <p> When we take a long-term perspective to investment and employment, there are real opportunities for the midlands.  The State can make good use of the extensive engineering and logistical skills of Bord na M&oacute;na and its workers for the long-term benefit.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB have the opportunity to launch new activities through the development of renewable and energy efficiency projects.  </p> <p> The Oireachtas committee report also highlighted the urgent need for the Government to embark upon a major retrofitting programme, which the Minister acknowledged in his contribution.  The Government decision to scrap the deep retrofit scheme, however, was not providing good leadership.  I acknowledge that Government acted swiftly to the backlash to that decision and reversed it, but it showed poor leadership to the country at large.</p> <p> The need for a transformed and fully decarbonised economy is not in doubt.  A just transition is a fundamental part of this process but it will not be achieved by quick fixes after decisions have already been taken.  Rather, it requires proper assessment of the social justice implications of policies and decisions and for protective measures to be put in place in the first instance.  This is urgently necessary for communities in the midlands.  This Bill provides a useful opportunity to address Government failings and I look forward to returning to the issue during the next Stages in order that further improvements can be made.</p></speech>

The Minister is indeed confused because what he said I said is not what I said.  I said that the Government is not taking the action.  This Government has failed to make the proper investments in public transport or to put in place proper strategies on afforestation and public housing to ensure we have good homes for people, as well as a fair and just transition and a move to a zero carbon society.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not holding back progress.  The Minister needs to listen to the Members of this House who have put forward numerous Bills and motions regarding investment in the alternatives, which is what this should be about.  This is where the debate needs to be, not on false flags and promises that cannot be delivered.  I gave the example earlier of the 1 million electric cars, which I do not believe, genuinely, can be delivered in the timeframe set out by the Minister.  In any event, I would prefer the investment to be in public transport.  We need to be looking to real solutions, not ones that might suit the Government's agenda.</p>  <p>  As for this Bill, a just transition provides decent jobs, social protection and security to workers, as well as communities most affected by the transition, to a sustainable economy.  It ensures that all climate policies are socially and rurally proofed.  No workers or communities can be left behind in the move away from peat production to more sustainable forms of energy generation.  This is of prime importance for the midlands and Moneypoint in County Clare.  To ensure a just transition for peat workers, we need to establish a national just transition task force based on dialogue with trade unions and other stakeholders.  This task force should negotiate a fair deal for fossil fuel workers and their communities and should ensure an orderly exit from coal and peat as soon as possible.  We cannot hold back the changes that are necessary in these areas.  We have to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels.  We have to examine the alternatives, such as wind and solar and the other renewable energies in which we need to invest.  The people who work in these areas need to be part of that transition.  This Bill provides a structure for that process and is a healthy development, one that should get full support across the House.</p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy is right that the Government attaches a money message to a Bill when it does not have the courage to say it is not supporting it.  The Minister should set out his opposition to the Bill in a clear way.  I do not believe some of his arguments, such as the suggestion that the Bill has the opposite effect of not bringing about transparency and that it is politicians and the Minister himself who should be held to account.  Some of the arguments he put forward against the Bill are spurious and without foundation.  This Bill provides an opportunity to develop a clear, coherent just transition template that can be applied in other sectors and regions as part of the wider transition process.  This requires a whole-of-Government approach, with key energy production semi-States such as the ESB, playing a central role.  Given the urgency of the situation, it is vital that this work begins immediately with the establishment of the just transition forum for the midlands.  This forum needs to be tasked with developing the appropriate measures within a specific timeframe to ensure that neither the workforce nor the local communities are left disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s current recommendation is to establish a review group positioned within the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  This is not good enough.  We need a full task force that brings together all stakeholders.  Communities in the midlands region are already affected by the move away from peat production for energy.  The idea of just transition first emerged in the 1970s, when it was proposed that people whose jobs were threatened by nuclear disarmament should be compensated for the loss.  In the 1990s, the argument was broadened to refer to workers in environmentally damaging jobs whose employment is affected by new policies aimed at reducing pollution.  Today, the definition of a just transition was widened again to bring in the communities in which those workers live.  Unfortunately, the Government is trying to drop the word "just" from the concept.  It has started to talk about the transition to low-carbon as though this is something that can happen through changes in consumer choices.  In a point to which the Minister took exception, I mentioned earlier that the Government puts market solutions front and centre, rather than State investment and the State taking a leading role, being the driving force in bringing about the just transition that is necessary and bringing the communities with us.  We will not make a transition, just or otherwise, unless we bring people with us.  That is the point I was making earlier in regard to carbon tax increases.  We can have different opinions and I respect that there are sincerely-held views on that issue but we can all accept that notwithstanding increases in carbon taxes, in some respects there are no alternatives in place for people to make the transition which is necessary.  That is what we need to do.  There is nothing stopping us investing in public transport or in retrofitting people's homes.  In my view, this should start with older people and public housing and should build outwards from there.  We should not be putting in place schemes for deep retrofitting for those people who might have money to spend.  Rather, we should supporting people across society and doing so in a fair and just way.</p>  <p>  There is nothing stopping us from building good quality public housing.  It is the Government that did not build the houses which are necessary.  </p><p>That is what I mean when I use the word "hypocrisy".  There are people in Dublin and elsewhere who do not have homes in which to live.  There are people renting apartments that are substandard.  We have heard of three or four people living in small and tight apartments that are certainly not environmentally sustainable and have very low energy ratings.  Some people have talked about the return of tenements in certain parts of Dublin.  Rather than continuing to allow that, which is what the Government has done, how about building the good-quality public housing about which many of us have spoken?</p> <p> We need a truly ambitious afforestation programme.  This is something that can be done.  We can bring rural communities with us.  Such a programme would truly make a difference because, as we know, planting forests in a sustainable way creates natural habitats for biodiversity and forests act as carbon sinks.  Through aggressive and ambitious afforestation, we can become carbon-neutral more quickly.</p> <p> Retrofitting housing stock would help.  The only people who are stopping the Minister doing any of this are the Minister himself, his colleagues in government and those in Fianna F&aacute;il who support him, not us.</p> <p> I referred to public transport in the earlier debate.  Public transport is central to the concept of a just transition.  Unless we invest in public transport, people will not have the alternatives they need.  Emails obtained through a freedom of information request reveal differences of opinion between the Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport about the potential of the Government to reach its target of 1 million electric cars.  Everybody in this Chamber and anybody who has an ounce of sense knows that this cannot be delivered.  If the Minister talked to the people who sell the cars, they would tell him that this cannot be done even if we wanted to do it.  It is not going to happen even if everybody wants to do it.  That is why the Government needs to refocus and reshape its policy and look at what the real alternative is, which is public transport first and foremost.</p> <p> It must also be underpinned by proper spatial planning.  If we want to build regions outside Dublin to act as a counterbalance to growth in the capital, we need to focus on regional cities such as Galway, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, all of which need integrated transport hubs.  There are parts of Waterford city in which people do not use public transport because it is not as accessible as it should be.  This is madness given the necessity of reaching our emissions targets and climate justice goals.  The brake is not being applied on this side of the House.  The brake on reaching our targets and doing what we need to do in terms of a just transition, unfortunately, is being applied by the Government and, in part, Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

As a representative of a county in the midlands, I am only too aware of the challenges posed by a failure to progress adequately the process of a just transition to a decarbonised economy.  I am also aware of the frustration of my constituents in west Offaly where the future of the power station there is still uncertain and where clarity is needed.  I forwarded a parliamentary question to the Minister earlier this week and I hope I can go back to the people of west Offaly with answers because there is a sense that communities are being left in the dark and that there is not enough clarity or engagement with communities, particularly in the midlands.  This needs to be improved.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Ministers for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and for Business, Enterprise and Innovation many matters which need to be addressed.  Both of their Departments have a vital role to play in the roll-out to 2020 of the regional enterprise plan for the midlands.  In May, I was critical of the Government's delay in accessing a significant amount of EU funding to assist job creation and investment for the midlands region, particularly in light of the </p>  <p>ongoing impact of job losses at Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is of serious concern to me.  Most of the constituents I meet raise this issue with me so it is a matter of serious concern and we need answers and pragmatic solutions.  I made it clear to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation that initiatives such as the midlands enterprise plan are welcome and important but I also told her on the floor of the D&aacute;il that there appeared to be a lack of joined-up thinking on the part of various Departments when it comes to addressing problems in the midlands.  I specifically asked her to explain why there was no mention of the European Commission's coal regions in transition platform in the midlands regional enterprise plan.  This platform was launched in early 2017, a full year before Bord na M&oacute;na made its announcement regarding the 430 job losses.  The reason for its existence is to promote funding and structural investment in areas exactly like the midlands that have traditionally relied on carbon-intensive industries.  Yet at that time, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation informed me that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment only wrote to the European Commission asking for funding support a couple of months ago.  We have lost valuable years in which jobs could have been created, particularly as the coal platform is already delivering tailor-made assistance to 13 pilot regions in seven member states.  We also know that regions in Greece, Slovakia, Poland, Czechia and Germany have benefited from its support.  This is to say nothing of the fact that in Silesia, which was the EU's largest coal region, &euro;120 million has been ring-fenced to provide support to projects in the area of urban infrastructure and clean air and to prepare former mining sites for investment.  This is exactly the type of funding that the Government should have been applying for on behalf of the midlands in 2017 in order to give us time to plan.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that having the pursued the matter further, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question that at the most recent meeting of the platform on 15 and 16 July, the European Commission announced that the midlands region has now been included in the platform.  I welcome this development.  As understand it, membership of the platform enables the midlands region to avail of the support of a dedicated country team comprising Commission experts to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation.  The team will also assist in identifying appropriate EU funding opportunities for the midlands.  The meetings of the platform also enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas between carbon-intensive regions.  While no new EU funds have been set up under this initiative, the European Parliament has proposed a &euro;5 billion budget line in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the period 2021 to 2027, which is being negotiated, to support the just transition.  I welcome this but counties such as Offaly and Laois must have immediate access to the funds that become available, particularly in light of the increasing threats to employment that we have seen very recently at Bord na M&oacute;na.  These threats are being taken seriously.  People are very concerned.  What is happening will have a detrimental effect on communities and on the local economies in those communities.</p>  <p>  What I would also like to hear from the Minister is a solid commitment that the funding provided under the platform initiative will be ring-fenced for the midlands region and that it will not be allocated in respect of a range of other strategies that may be of value but will do little to develop job creation in the midland counties, which need an urgent focus.  We are lagging behind the rest of the State in many ways.  We have the second lowest rate of income in the State.  We need a firm commitment.</p>  <p>  While I accept that this is an issue of national concern, Offaly and Laois are the counties most directly impacted upon by decarbonisation in light of the historical legacy and their dependence on organisations like Bord na M&oacute;na for employment.  It is all well and good to have a grand vision of a decarbonised society and to tell people that there is a plan and a strategy to compensate for the inevitable disruption that this process will bring but families, workers and communities cannot live on sentiment, however noble.</p><p>They need to see a clear and dedicated pathway toward employment stability.  I also call for a task force to be set up for the midlands region.  This would be a pragmatic solution.  If all stakeholders were involved, particularly unions representing workers, the outcome would be fair for everybody and nobody would be left behind.  That is the core of what a just transition is.  These families and workers are owed that, given the scale of the challenges that areas like the midlands are going to face.  I conclude by saying that I support the principle of a just transition.  The world and the employment realities in it have changed.  I believe we can adapt, maintaining a balance with the past in the process of a just transition which is fair and built on common sense and pragmatism.  The three things I would like to see with any transition are common sense, pragmatism and fairness. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900048#YY00200"><p>I welcome the fact that this discussion on a just transition is taking place.  I thank the Green Party for tabling this legislation to facilitate it.  It is important that any discussion about a just transition is based on reality.  The failure to recognise the basic reality of the climate issues and their impact on the ground, and to constructively engage with communities, has in large part undermined our ability to drive the change needed to bring about the transition and meet our climate targets.  There has been a serious failure on the part of those advocating for climate action to come up with innovative solutions that reflect the unique challenges Ireland faces.  There is a responsibility not just to highlight the problems but to come up with real and practical solutions that can be applied in communities throughout this country.</p>  <p>  More often than not, advocates have tabled ideas that are simply copied and pasted from other jurisdictions, solutions which fail to reflect the reality on the ground in Ireland.  This has led to the alienation of whole sectors of society and communities throughout this country.  As Minister, I established the climate action fund to incentivise innovation in Ireland that would produce solutions that address the Irish challenges, rather than simply copying and pasting on the basis that what is done in some other part of the world can apply here. </p>  <p>  One very practical example concerns carbon tax and transportation.  It is important that any model does not disproportionately hit those living in rural or regional parts of the country, who are so reliant on diesel and who were encouraged through Government incentives to take up this fuel.  As an alternative, the current review of the national car test operator is an opportunity for the Government to revise the testing regime to provide an emissions profile for each individual vehicle.  This would treat those living in rural areas and driving longer distances more fairly, as their vehicles would have lower emissions profiles than a similar vehicle driving on congested city streets.  Such a measure would encourage the retrofitting of diesel vehicles, including retrofitting to alternative fuels, and would support the conversion of the fleet to hybrid and electric vehicles.  Most motorists would see the direct benefit in their rate of motor tax based on the actual emissions profile of their vehicle.  On the other hand, this measure would not disproportionately hit the haulage or agricultural sectors, which are so reliant on diesel as a fuel.  It would also act as a very effective congestion charge as vehicles driving on congested streets or at times of heavy traffic would have a much higher emissions profile and thus pay a higher motor tax.  Will we see that happen?  That is the type of thing we need to look at, addressing global issues in local and practical terms. </p>  <p>  We also need to look at IDA Ireland's perverse policy of forcing more jobs into the city of Dublin.  This leads to further demands for construction of offices and housing instead of utilising the infrastructure in our regions, which has already been developed and paid for by the taxpayer.  That includes the need to provide high-speed broadband investment to every single townland and community in this country, spreading economic growth across the regions and not just compounding the problem we have already seen in the city of Dublin. </p>  <p>  I now turn to a local issue which many colleagues have raised, namely, Bord na M&oacute;na.  This has an impact not just in the midlands region as designated by Government, but also in Roscommon and east Galway, where Bord na M&oacute;na staff are directly employed in harvesting peat.  We have seen an abject failure by environmentalists to acknowledge the reason Bord na M&oacute;na was established in the first place, namely, to create jobs in a part of the country which was an unemployment black spot.  That applies equally today.  Many of those working in this region are forced to travel long distances to access employment in the congested cities on our coast, such as those construction jobs in Dublin.  We need to create employment in the region which supports the existing skill set of staff and small farmers.  Co-firing of biomass is key to that.  That is why it is imperative that the ESB submits a new application to Bord na M&oacute;na for the Shannonbridge power station that is based on co-firing.</p>  <p>  Second, we must put in place a new economy so that the next generation and the generation after that can be employed locally.  There is a failure to acknowledge that this is not just about the people employed in Bord na M&oacute;na today.  It is about their children and the children who come after that.  They do not have opportunities for employment in our region at the moment.  I offer the example of County Roscommon.  It has the highest rate of third level graduate education in the country and yet it has one of the lowest levels of graduate employment in the country because the jobs are not there.  We are haemorrhaging those jobs to the cities, which is compounding the congestion and climate problems there.  </p>  <p>  We need to facilitate a just transition away from peat production to long-term sustainable jobs in our region.  We need to tap into the huge potential of communities in every single parish in counties Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and east Galway.  To do that, we need to have a just transition fund.  As I have already formally put to the Minister, we need to ring-fence 5% of the climate action fund, the rural regeneration and development fund and the urban regeneration and development fund to provide alternative job opportunities for the employees of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB and the communities that are dependent on those jobs.  That will allow us to leverage funding from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank for the region.  </p>  <p>  The decommissioning of cutaway bogs is also an important part of any rehabilitation of the bogs.  This work could commence tomorrow morning and provide sustainable jobs for seasonal staff and Bord na M&oacute;na staff who have been laid off.  There is a very serious threat to next year's seasonal employment.  A substantial number of staff, particularly in Mountdillon, have not been able to avail of seasonal employment this summer.</p><p>Work could start tomorrow morning on the removal of plastic and rail lines, an examination of existing stockpiles of peat and an investigation of the silt and settlement ponds and that would provide employment for seasonal staff. </p> <p> It is also important that we see full implementation of the Government decision, taken in 2017, to establish a new semi-State entity called Bord na M&oacute;na Bioenergy.  It was established by the Government and tasked with setting up an entire biomass industry, from contract growing by farmers to harvesting and processing, all the way through to contract delivery.  It was initially envisaged as supplying the three power stations and subsequently meeting renewable heat demand.  If that company had been operational, I do not believe the planning application at Shannonbridge would have been rejected.  </p> <p> We need to start implementing Project Ireland 2040.  I refer to establishing the national wetland park in the north midlands.  That work needs to be prioritised because it presents major opportunities for employment creation in ecotourism, as well as recreational employment.  It has to include the development of the Cloontuskert works in County Roscommon which are owned by Bord na M&oacute;na as an interpretive centre.  There must also be development of the Ballinasloe parkland project.  It would examine how we could develop cutaway bogs in the vicinity of Ballinasloe and also tell the story of bog rehabilitation.  It is located right beside the Dublin-Galway motorway and easily accessible.  It could be a major tourist attraction in the area.</p></speech>

As my colleagues said, we support its thrust and acknowledge that it builds on the commitment given by the all-party committee.  We will seek to play our part, as will many others, in debate, change and alteration in order that, by agreement, we can arrive at a conclusion and move forward to address the issues.   Everyone here realises what is necessary to ensure the planet, the country, the economy and the environment work as one to the benefit of all, rather than to the detriment of anyone.</p>  <p>  I was surprised to hear the Minister say he would allow the Bill to pass on this Stage but that he might proceed with a money message at the relevant crossroads.  He might perhaps supersede it by hypothecation of carbon tax revenue and having legislation in place to ensure it will meet the demands of a commission.  Since the announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the acceleration of its decarbonisation plan, I have, to put it mildly, been disappointed on two fronts by Fine Gael's and the Government's response and reaction.  I was disappointed by the announcement.  Despite the mood music and the right sentiments being expressed, as is often the case, the rhetoric was not matched by the actions needed.  I was also disappointed, to say the least, by the Government's failure to insist on entities such as the ESB pursuing Government policy and moving forward by last Thursday with a request for an appeal or judicial review of the decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That decision flies in the face of Government policy to co-fuel biomass and peat in power plants and transition towards moving away from peat.  We all acknowledged and accepted the part we had to play in ensuring that changeover happened in a timely fashion.  However, the time afforded would have allowed possible alternatives to be found.  There might also have been options, instead of the economy being thrown off the cliff, as is now possibly the case.</p>  <p>  I remember speaking during Leaders' Questions in October in the days immediately after the announcement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision.  I sought the establishment of a transition forum and commission.  I also sought verification that Ireland had applied to the Coal Regions in Transition Initiative fund and information on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF.  I also requested the ring-fencing of funding from carbon tax revenue, which stands at &euro;400 million to date.  The T&aacute;naiste answered and stated both he and the Government would work with others to ensure they could plan for a fair deal and manage it in a way which would not undermine income or regions.  We have not, however, seen a relevant forum being set up.  We have seen, in County Offaly for example, a transition team made up of stakeholders and State bodies, the job of which would have been to respond.  I saw it as a member of the forum.  Adequate Government funds have not been targeted to deal with the situation.  That should have been the case, instead of drawing from existing funds through the wide range of options mentioned by the Minister.  Those option are available to the country as a whole.</p>  <p>  Regarding the recent Shannonbridge decision, it is Government policy to co-fuel.  It was contained in all of the relevant documentation submitted by all of the relevant Departments to the European Union.  An Taisce's contention that there should be an immediate cessation was upheld by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There were issues with transportation and so forth.  Those issues could, however, have been addressed as a condition of a commission favourably and to the satisfaction of those raising concerns.  During our discussions in the immediate aftermath of the decision the Minister visited Tullamore and met representatives from the region.  It was incumbent on him to ensure the ESB would seek a judicial review of the decision.  I would have thought that in the democratic process we have grown to love and appreciate that the Government set policy and others followed it, rather than An Taisce setting policy and the Government and An Bord Plean&aacute;la following it.  That appears to be what has happened.  </p>  <p>  To me and all those I represent, the knock-on effects of the decision are all too plain to see.  I am especially mindful of Lanesborough and Edenderry power stations.  The decision will mean almost the immediate closure of these two stations.  It will also mean the immediate cessation of harvesting associated with supplying peat to the stations.  The workers, communities, counties and regions are being thrown off a cliff.  That is happening, instead of the fulfilment of the commitment given to us last year that the power stations would be phased out over a period of seven or eight years and that a transition forum with adequate funding would be put in place in the meantime to deal with the fallout from the closures.   The localities, communities, counties and regions bought into that commitment.  To be now thrown off the cliff flies in the face of the commitment given.  </p>  <p>  A body such as the one proposed would fund, reward and assist local authorities and local transition forums in the various counties.  I am mindful of the special status of my county which has 1,000 of the remaining 1,500 or 1,600 members of the workforce in Bord na M&oacute;na, notwithstanding the efforts, commitment, willingness and appreciation of other counties to participate.  Others have mentioned the role Bord na M&oacute;na has played in their counties, communities and economies.  Any such body would seek to reward and encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.  It would also look at the options for alternatives, not only in the energy sphere but in other spheres of employment also  I am conscious too of the Minister's recent visit to the new battery power plant that will support renewables and wind energy generation.  It was opened last week by an indigenous company in Tullamore, Lumcloon Energy, which has partnered with backers in Korea at no cost to the State.  If we put independent private investment in place, that innovation and success can be the prototype for exportation to other economies in the future.  That is the innovation and alternative form of employment within the energy sector that can succeed.</p><p>To get back to the carbon tax funding and any increase there may be, any legislation to ring-fence those funds would have to contain three strands.  It would have to be poverty proofed, it would have to include initiatives, programmes, grants and rewards and it would have to include relevant and efficient products and renewables to assist those we represent to provide alternative renewables and methods to assist the climate action plan mentioned by the Minister.  It would have at its core a targeted fund allocated to those regions most affected by the transition, particularly given that the pace of transition is no longer the eight or nine years envisaged at this time last year.</p> <p> In the 1940s, the Government of the day gave the remit to create jobs in the midlands region to Bord na M&oacute;na which, in the 1980s, had a workforce of approximately 8,000.  With the best will in the world, Bord na M&oacute;na can no longer meet that remit, notwithstanding its efforts such as trials in the growth of herbs and cannabis and looking at using the land for energy parks.  I hope and expect those lands and properties and the industrial plant will be there for others to invest in and that these forums and the commission will bring forward ideas and initiatives to benefit the communities and regions.  It could lead to energy parks that would reward communities, including through their profits.  This is the type of innovation we now pass over to the Government.</p> <p> The remit is back with the Government.  Bord na M&oacute;na can no longer meet the commitment it made and the remit it was given in the 1940s.  It is for local authorities to build on the success of Bord na M&oacute;na and provide the package comprising Lough Boora, greenways, Clonmacnoise and all the midlands has to offer.  It is about all of the stakeholders working together with availability of the right funding, innovation and representation, as is prescribed, to allow communities bring us forward in a way that recognises the needs associated with climate change and the contribution made by the State and its bodies to areas such as those I represent.</p> <p> The State is now in a position to recommit to them in a different and new way but equally in a way that can reward those communities and allow the people in them the opportunity to succeed, provide jobs and remain in the counties they love with the lifestyle they love.  This can be done with the right will and effort.  The Minister should make no mistake about it.  In the absence of this being done in the short few months available to him it will be an election issue.  Support is growing for the type of commitments contained in the Bill and the sentiments expressed in our policy, which is at variance with that of the Minister.  This has been obvious and plain to see since last October.</p></speech>

I rise to support the Bill.  The Labour Party unambiguously supports the Bill and we welcome it.  We believe that given the level of correspondence we have received on the issue and the level of engagement we have had on it, particularly with the trade union movement, the Bill is timely and worthy of our support.</p><p>I respectfully take issue with the Minister's opening remarks.  It appears his intention is to curtail the Bill with the provision of a money message.  We feel this is a disappointing departure.  It runs contrary to the spirit of the legislation and the views and recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  There is a very clear and unambiguous determination in the committee's report that a just transition taskforce would be established.  While the Bill does not <i>per se</i>call for a just transition taskforce it does call for a just transition commission.</p><p>The Minister seeks to use the auspices of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, as the mechanism by which many of the issues contained the Bill would be articulated.  We see no reason the Minister could not continue to use the NESC as a valuable resource for the Government and ensure a policy direction that is consistent between all of the stakeholders.</p><p>The point is that the Government is not the sole stakeholder or owner of this agenda any more.  Just like our colleagues in the UK House of Commons, we must recognise there is a shift of emphasis towards the Members of the House and towards the sovereignty of Parliament relative to the powers of the Executive.  I am a little bit worried that the Minister in his statement seeks to undermine the legislation.  By my interpretation, he has expressed an opinion that the power of the Government would be usurped by the enactment of such legislation.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but this is certainly my impression.  We do need coherence on the recommendation of the joint committee on the very specific task of establishing a just transition taskforce in 2019 and the intention of the Bill, which is the establishment of the commission.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we can iron out some of these potential differences.  The Bill has the potential to give voice to the Minister's opinion or intention on the use of the NESC as a tool in a complementary way to ensure we can drive the agenda of a low carbon or carbon zero economy and society.</p><p>As I have said, I have received much correspondence in respect of this issue.  The Labour Party made the establishment of the just transition taskforce a red line issue during the course of our deliberations in the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We wanted to ensure there would be no watering down of this proposal by those on the Government side.  We wanted to ensure we would give voice to those stakeholders in civil society who feel strongly that they have a voice that is equal to that of the Government and that the voice of the Citizens' Assembly would be heard in terms of the implementation of Government policy.</p><p>We have no hesitation in supporting the Bill.  We will seek to amend and strengthen it.  By our reading, the Bill sets out a very clear set of functions in section 5 but we are just a little bit fearful that some of the functions may not be robust enough to ensure the idea of a just transition is firmly fixed in policy provision.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We argue for policy coherence between the Government and the Oireachtas with an equal role between the two.  Where a legislative proposal is robust and worthy of enactment, it should be supported.  We have no hesitation in supporting this legislation.  We look forward to working with our colleagues in the Green Party to ensure that the people we seek to represent on this issue whose voices have made themselves heard since the publication of this Bill and during the Citizens' Assembly are accurately and robustly reflected in the legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900051#BBB00300"><p>I will try to do it in five minutes.</p>  <p>  With the most politeness I can muster, I have to say that the Minister has a brass neck.  The response in the previous debate we had was to say to us, "Sure, you have no concrete proposals.  You just want to get rid of capitalism.  You've been banging on about that forever.  You want socialism; of course, you do."  He would say that, ignoring all the concrete proposals we made in our various speeches, such as free public transport, investment in low-carbon public housing, public investment in renewable energy and the transition to sustainable agriculture.  The Minister then went on to do what has become the Government's traditional trick of agreeing to let the Bill on the just transition pass on Second Stage so it cannot be held to account for voting against it and then just let it sit there and not proceed while using the undemocratic veto the Government has of the money message.</p>  <p>  That is precisely what the Government did when we introduced a concrete proposal passed by the D&aacute;il to prevent further fossil fuel exploration.  It claims we do not have concrete proposals.  We do, and they have been passed by the House, but the Government is blocking them undemocratically.</p>  <p>  I support the Bill.  The concept of a just transition is key.  The bottom line of a just transition is that no worker or small farmer should lose out as a result of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy.  That means no loss of wages or jobs and no loss of income for small farmers.  That requires an important role for the State to ensure that anybody whose current job no longer exists after such a transition is guaranteed alternative quality employment.</p>  <p>  A series of graphs published in 2004 became famous in the 2000s.  They outline in a very graphic way what was known as the great acceleration, the most rapid and pervasive stage in the human-environment relationship.  They are in a range of issues, such as CO2, surface temperature, tropical forest loss, methane, ocean acidification, etc.  They all basically show a hockey stick-shaped graph from 1945, shooting upwards as industrial fossil fuel capitalism post the Second World War took off and began to affect the environment in a substantial way.  That is also the period that is increasingly accepted as the beginning of the Anthropocene, the geological age where human activity has had the dominant impact on the climate and our environment.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the same authors of those great acceleration graphs did an update which showed that the process was accelerating even further.  They also did an equity element of the graph which showed that not everybody in the world is contributing to the destruction of our planet.  The very richest are contributing to it and the rest of us, working-class people and poor people, pay the price and suffer the consequences of it.</p>  <p>  That is true on a country-by-country basis and within countries.  The workers at Bord na M&oacute;na, coal miners, and oil and gas workers are not responsible for the crimes of the fossil fuel industry and the destruction of our planet as a result of its action.  They are exploited by those companies and they lose out; in many cases, their health is badly affected.  They are not just victims of those companies.  They are potentially powerful allies in building a movement for the kinds of eco-socialist policies that are necessary to stop us reaching a climate catastrophe very soon.  An alliance of workers, communities, young people, environmental activists, etc., is a very powerful force, an element of which we will see tomorrow on the streets.</p>  <p>  During the summer, I visited the occupation by workers of Harland and Wolff, famously known for building ships.  Ships burn a considerable volume of dirty oil.  The increase in shipping in the world is a significant contributing factor to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Those workers were striking correctly to defend their jobs.  As part of that, they raised the demand for the nationalisation of Harland and Wolff.  They particularly advocated that the skills and machinery they have would be perfectly positioned to play a role in green energy through the construction of wind turbines.  They explained that to us in particular.</p>  <p>  It shows how workers can play a key role in the struggle and how the just transition brings together workers, communities and everybody affected.  It is reminiscent of the Lucas plan from the 1970s in Britain where aerospace workers got together and fleshed out an alternative mode of production, not in the interests of the profits of their bosses but in the interests of society as a whole.</p>  <p>  The same is true for the Bord na M&oacute;na workers whose skills are needed.  We do not need to use them in other damaging production processes, as was suggested earlier.  Instead they are needed above all in shifting to properly green energy.  It has been estimated that at current prices the shift to green energy, particularly wind energy, will require &euro;21 billion in investment.  Going with that would be an enormous number of jobs with resources invested in that.  That needs to be mobilised.  It will not be mobilised by the private sector.  It must be mobilised by the State stepping in.  The ESB should step up.  All those workers should have alternative employment.  There is very necessary socially useful employment and those workers should be brought to the heart of a rapid just transition to a green economy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900051#BBB00500"><p>I think I will come in under that.</p>  <p>  I support the Bill, which has relevance to my constituency.  I was struck by the comment that there are no jobs on a dead planet, which is very evocative.  There is no green economy unless there are rewards for workers and communities that make this happen.  There needs to be support for communities that lose their fossil fuel industries.  This is the basis of fair transition.  I, therefore, fully support the Bill.</p>  <p>  The key is the Title of the Bill.  Those who work in fossil fuel industries should be given opportunities to transition to new jobs via retraining into environmentally sustainable jobs or other careers to sustain their communities.  If one applies this to Moneypoint or to the peat-burning industry in the midlands, companies such as the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na should have a responsibility to support those losing their jobs who wish to be retrained or upskilled to find alternative employment.</p>  <p>  The Bill proposes a national just transition commission, which is important.  In west Clare, we have come together organically over the summer to put together a task force that will redefine the future of Moneypoint.  It involves workers, community activists, local representatives and national representatives.</p><p>The employers unfortunately were not there.  We have called on Government agencies to join the task force.  The local authority and the trade unions are fully behind it.  That is the core of a just transition commission.  Organically we have identified that in west Clare.  The task force is tasked with maximising the potential of Moneypoint which has vast potential, not only to generate power but its deep sea port could be developed into a fantastic resource for transit of cargo to and from Europe.  The site needs to be developed into a facility which will generate energy, offshore wind, tidal or wave energy or a combination of all three.  All are available in abundance on the west coast of Clare.  </p> <p> The Bill also proposes to provide a mediation service to allow communities a forum to discuss and place on a legal basis their chosen transition path.  It is important for that to be done on a legal basis.  It also proposes to develop just transition plans for new alternative jobs, infrastructure to support those jobs and upskilling and not to leave an area where fossil fuels come to an end to be a wasteland.  It also proposes to develop alternative low or no-carbon industries.</p> <p> Moneypoint has to cease burning coal by 2025 and that has already happened.  There are proposals to bring in 104 redundancies out of a total workforce of 198.  Those negotiations are under way.  Unfortunately, there are no alternative jobs in Moneypoint.  This is a loss to the individual who loses his or her job and to the local economy, and reduces the viability of the community.  Communities should not be penalised as we move away from fossil fuel industries.  They need to be supported by maintaining just employment and invigorating them in a fair and sustainable way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900052#CCC00200"><p>I thank the Deputies who participated in the debate.  There is a great deal of consensus in the House to have proper systems of consultation; workers protected; evaluation of new opportunities in the decarbonised economy and enterprise agencies supporting those; development of appropriate skills and reskilling of people who need to be re-skilled; funding set aside to support not just individuals but regions which are affected; and development of the role of the EU, particularly with its coal platform, applied to Ireland's particular problems.  I agree with all of that.</p>  <p>  The only area where I have contention with the Bill is in the way it is proposed to structure this.  Instead of the whole Government developing a strategy to do this, the Bill envisages a commission which will designate individual enterprises and public bodies and ask each one to come up with a separate plan then put that through a wringer of individual agencies consulting on each plan, having objections to a plan, going to mediation through a commission and then perhaps to adjudication by that commission.  That superstructure is not well designed to achieve the consensus approach set out here.  The only reason I mention money messages is that we have to be satisfied that whatever is proposed by the Oireachtas is an effective way of using resources to achieve the objectives.</p>  <p>  By going on to Committee Stage we can tease these things out.  Deputy Cowen put it fairly plainly when he said he regarded the development of a response to just transition as a political responsibility.  He did not say that the person on this commission and the multiple bodies it might designate as prescribed bodies, and the process of each of body evolving plans, is what we want.  He talked about consultation, worker protection, evaluation of opportunities and funds to back change.  That is what we have to try to design together.  I am not being negative about just transition.  It is at the heart of this but the superstructure created by this Bill is not the appropriate one.  The Oireachtas will not want a commission that is not answerable to the House, working in mediation and in a semi-planning process as envisaged here, but coherence across Government, the ability to bring the various agencies of Government together to support the workers and the region, to identify the opportunities and to see that the regional representatives, including the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland, are empowered to deliver the change in the affected regions.  That goes to the heart of governance.  Governments work to serve the needs of citizens.</p>  <p>  I am absolutely convinced this is very well intentioned and that Deputy Eamon Ryan will defend it.  That is the purpose of debate, that is why we come here, to exchange views.  People may say they are surprised at the Minister taking a different view or whatever but that is what we are all here to do, to challenge one another.  That is the consensus, we all want the same thing, a transition that delivers the changes we need to make, demanded by the need for climate action, the science and the generations coming behind us.  We also want to make sure that we protect, insofar as possible, the skills, the commitment and the regions that are impacted.  It is an argument about whether this Bill succeeds in doing what we want to achieve.  That is why we will tease out that issue in committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900052#CCC00300"><p>I could not agree more with the Minister.  Debate is healthy.  It is the lifeblood of this place and the voters decide.  We will put it to the people.  I think I have my poster designed for the upcoming election, which is not that far away.  It will be a quote from the Minister's earlier contribution to the debate when he said, &quot;This goes way beyond what is envisaged.&quot;  It does because we need to start thinking a hell of a lot bigger about what we are doing for the climate.  The Fine Gael mantra that the <i>status quo</i>is good enough is not good enough.  I really relish the chance to come back to the Minister on the specific concerns he has raised, to reassure him that this is absolutely the right structure.  It is a super structure but one that is going to work and be relatively easy to introduce.  The Minister said this asks a company in advance to set out a plan and engage with stakeholders and mediate.  That is exactly what we need.  That is exactly what we do not have at the moment with Bord na M&oacute;na.  As Deputy Harty said, they are trying to do this in Moneypoint but the business is not there.  The <i>status quo</i>under the Fine Gael-led Government is not good enough and needs to change.</p><p>The Minister said we could do this through the Workplace Relations Commission, that we have an existing structure.  The problem is that under the legislation it is set up to specialise in trade union disputes with employers.  It does not have experience or expertise in climate change or in dealing with communities.  Deputy Harty and other speakers said that when we are doing this we need to get the workers, the communities and other businesses in.  We need a community-based stakeholders' response.  As good as the Workplace Relations Commission is, it will not deliver that. </p><p>The Minister, along with others, suggested that NESC should do it.  I have the highest regard for NESC, which has a critical role, and in the climate committee report we outlined that it would have a specific role in this and other areas, but NESC's skill, best capability and best addition in the jigsaw of pieces we need is in strategic policy.  I do not believe that NESC wants to get down and dirty in an individual, local dispute where it would try to work out what the specific response should be because that is not its specialty.<br/><br/>The Minister also mentioned the Climate Change Advisory Council but I know from speaking to its members they were terrified by our climate report because they feared we were throwing too much on them and they know they do not have adequate resources in the existing system.  Moreover, the council wants to maintain the high level strategic view in how we make the transition and does not want to be involved in dispute management resolution.<br/><br/>The Minister also suggested that the Government and his Department could be responsible.  In the Department there are probably approximately 250 officials, perhaps 50 of whom work in the energy section, for example.  The work required will not just be in energy, however.  It will involve transport, agriculture, forestry, housing and a range of areas.  I know that the officials do not have enough time.  They manage all the European legislation, all our legislation and all the policy initiatives and regulation.  They are not well placed to do it.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the Minister seemed to indicate that the House should do it.  While we are well placed to write legislation, hold the Government to account and consider the big policy issues, the House is the last place that would be appropriate.  If one wants to find a resolution to a thorny local issue, one wants to be down the country, wherever that is.  We heard it in the case of the midlands, where there are such conflicting views.  Some people say the answer concerns burning biomass while others say the answer is something else.  It would be almost impossible for us to act in the way the community needs, namely, as a neutral specialist service with real expertise in mediation.  Mediation is not a dirty word.  On page 13 of the programme for Government, it is recognised the State is not working well and one of the reasons outlined is that it does not consult well.  It has to start listening, consulting and engaging.  I am glad the Minister is holding meetings throughout the country but the problem cannot be resolved in a town hall meeting.  One needs to be in the town for months, teasing through some of the specific local issues, which is what the proposed agency will do.<br/><br/>I look forward to the Committee Stage debate, even with the sword of Damocles of no money message hanging over it, to tease the matter out with the Department.  Does the Department really believe it is well placed for doing it, or does the Government really believe that the Department of the Taoiseach should do it?  The latter Department has a critical role.  I am supportive of the all-of-Government action plan approach, the new legislation we have planned and all the measures on which we have agreed.  We also agreed, however, that we need a just transition architecture.<br/><br/>I have slightly different views from my colleagues, such as on whether the body should be called a task force.  To reassure Deputy Sherlock, whose support on the Bill I very much appreciate, along with the support we have received from trade unions and others, on page 17 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action report it is stated the just transition task force will include a specialist mediation service for workers, communities and businesses and that it should make recommendations for action to the Government and the parties.  That is what the Bill will do.  It provides for a specialist mediation service.  We have thought a great deal about the structure outlined.  We have sought advice from the best lawyers and talked to all the interested parties that have a good interest and knowledge about the matter.<br/><br/>To allay one of the concerns the Minister outlined, namely, that the service would be all powerful and would not be democratic, it will be democratic in the sense that it will be appointed in the same way we appoint directors to the board of RT&Eacute; and to the Inland Fisheries Board.  It will be appointed by both the Government and the Oireachtas.  It will be representative, therefore, of the House.  One matter keenly fought with trade unions and others is that the commission's decisions in helping to devise a plan will not issue mandatory instructions.  It is mediation, not compellability, but it will bring transparency, expertise and neutrality.  The Minister stated we are planning an agency that would bring in all the various actors but that is what we need in order to ensure a good transition.<br/><br/>The Bill is technical and specific and is only one piece of the architecture.  The Government opposes it because it does not want to lose control, it could not possibly agree to a Bill coming from the Opposition and it could not possibly support a Bill from the other side of the House, but it would make the Government work better.  It would be useful for the Department to have it rather than everyone running after a problem like that of Bord na M&oacute;na, after the fact.  It would be thinking three or five years ahead about where will be the next Bord na M&oacute;na problem down the line.  It will allow us to set up the systems here and now in advance, instead of the usual reactive response to crises when we turn up too late.  We need to get in early and engage all the parties.  It will not be expensive.  We are not talking about a large organisation but rather small teams of mediators with specialist capability and with the legislative structure to empower them.  Compellability is needed.  I heard tonight that the ESB is not talking to the workers at the Moneypoint plant.  Everyone I speak to in Bord na M&oacute;na has stated the process is not working there either.  If a single person thinks differently about the Bord na M&oacute;na transition issue, I would love to hear about it but the word on the ground is the current system - the <i>status quo </i>- is not working.<br/><br/>The Bill goes beyond what is envisaged because we envisage a massive change to our entire transport, energy, waste and industrial systems.  That is what the climate strikers tomorrow demand.  They say they listen to that Swedish girl and that the science is so clear and true about the scale of the changes required.  We have 430 gigatonnes remaining but we use 41 gigatonnes a year.  In eight years, we will be over the tipping point.  It will be such change and we need to envisage it and how we plan and prepare for it.  The Bill will do that in a just way.  It will bring social and ecological justice together, which is what we need to do.  I look forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>
