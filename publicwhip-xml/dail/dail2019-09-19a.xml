I wish Patricia Philbin, CEO, and all her team the very best of luck with all that.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes for Galway 2020.  Last night's launch was a great success.  I am sure it is a taste of things to come.</p>  <p>  The overall spending allocations for my Department for 2020 will be announced as part of budget Estimates 2020, which is due to be published on Tuesday, 8 October.  As budgetary negotiations are ongoing I am not in a position to comment in detail on my Department's 2020 budget allocation.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently announced that the budget will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.  Against that background, my Department will, within the resources available in 2020, continue to place emphasis on core functions and services, including measures to maintain the momentum created across the arts and culture sphere by initiatives funded by, or through, my Department, consistent with the Taoiseach's commitment to double the funding to the sector by 2025.  This allows my Department to build on the increased funding received in the 2019 budget, which was 10% in respect of the Arts Council, 11% in respect of Screen Ireland, 19% in respect of Creative Ireland and more than &euro;2 million in additional funding secured for our national cultural institutions which welcome more than 3.5 million visitors annually.  We will also continue to conserve and manage our heritage as a support to economic renewal and sustainable employment, in compliance with legal obligations, and to conserve and restore biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland to focus on the environment.  Measures will also further advance the statutory demand-led language planning process and ensure continued access to our islands.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to promote North-South co-operation, particularly in the context of An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland.  We will also continue to focus on Project Ireland 2040, which gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage for our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.  This recognition is underpinned by the commitment from Government to invest almost &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, language and heritage over the ten-year implementation of the national development plan.  Project Ireland 2040 provides for an investment of &euro;460 million in the national cultural institutions, &euro;265 million for a culture and creativity investment programme, &euro;285 million in our natural and built heritage and &euro;178 million to support and protect the Irish language, Gaeltacht communities and communities on our offshore islands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00700"><p>With Brexit coming down the tracks, I appreciate that it is incumbent on all of us to be prudent but artists are a huge asset to us nationally and should be treasured.  We should also put our money where our mouths are and invest in artists.  Budget 2018 was a dismal budget for the arts sector but budget 2019 represented a significant improvement on that.  There was, however, one major issue, which was the disconnect between the increase in funding for capital expenditure, which was a 39% increase, and the increase in current expenditure, which was a mere 6%.  At the time, I raised the point that the Government policy on arts and culture was focused on capital projects with little investment for the artists and their work.  Will the Minister assure the House that budget 2020 will at least put the artist at the centre of its budget demands?</p>  <p>  Has the Minister sought to develop any policy, funding or employment framework that would help to improve artists' pay and conditions, including access to and support of benefits?  There is little point in having our galleries and stages without the artists or actors to exhibit or perform.  In January the Theatre Forum review of artists' pay and conditions was published.  While not surprising, the findings were nonetheless depressing.  I believe that the opportunity and time has come to ensure our artists at least have an opportunity to have a sustainable income.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900003#A00800"><p>The Deputy referred to a 6% increase in current expenditure but it was actually 7%, from &euro;248.659 million to &euro;265.159 million.  The Deputy also mentioned a 39% increase in capital expenditure but it was actually a 36% increase.  It went from &euro;54.3 million to &euro;73.8 million.  There was a significant increase there.  The gross Vote allocation for 2019 was just under &euro;339 million, which is an increase of 12% on the 2018 Estimate.  Of this allocation, &euro;73.8 million was capital funds and &euro;265.1 million was current expenditure.</p>  <p>  On the artists, it is fair to say that there was a significant difference between 2018 and 2019, which the Deputy acknowledged in her question.  We increased funding to the Arts Council by 10%, from &euro;68 million to &euro;75 million.  The Arts Council is ultimately tasked with looking after the artists on the ground.  We have also had many other significant projects this year such as the Per Cent for Art scheme and the extension of the package for social welfare.  The Government is committed to helping the artists.  I will do everything I can to secure as much as I can for the artists in this budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900004#B00100"><p>The review carried out by Theatre Forum found that 30% of performing artists earn less than the national minimum wage of &euro;9.55 per hour that applied in 2018 due, in part, to the fact that 83% of performing artists are paid a flat fee regardless of the hours they work.  While it has been the accepted that that is the nature of their work, it is unacceptable that we would expect artists who operate in one of the most important industries for which we laud ourselves in terms of how it can be used to promote Ireland globally to work for &euro;9.55 per hour, which is less than the current minimum wage.</p><p>Budget 2019 provided an increase in funding to the Arts Council of &euro;7 million more than the amount provided in budget 2018.  The current level of funding, at &euro;75 million, still lags significantly behind the 2008 level of &euro;82 million.  For the Government to fund the arts at the European norm, it would have to allocate in the region of five times that amount.  This same adjustment would have to be made to all public arts schemes to ensure that the support reached European norms.  This is what we should be aiming for.</p><p>The article by Olivia Kelly in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times, </i>which suggests that people are to be banned from selling their work on Merrion Square next summer, is distressing for artists.  These individuals are trying to make a living, the exact topic we are discussing now, and they have been selling their work on Merrion Square for the past 35 years.  According to Ms Elizabeth Prendergast, artist and secretary of Merrion Square Artists Association, this decision will be catastrophic for artists who, as I have already noted, are trying to earn a living.</p></speech>

Taking budget 2019 into account, there has been a 37% increase in arts funding since 2011.  Unlike the unsustainable spending of Fianna F&aacute;il when in government, including in respect of the arts, current funding is sustainable and is based on the sound management of public finances by Fine Gael-led Governments since 2012.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's comments regarding artists, as I mentioned earlier and as she acknowledged in her initial remarks, the Arts Council received a significant increase in funding last year.  I will do my best in my negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to secure a further increase this year, bearing in mind the parameters and difficulties of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I also mentioned earlier that there had been a significant increase in funding for Screen Ireland.  The Deputy mentioned Galway 2020.  We provided &euro;6 million in funding for it.  We have also provided funding for the national cultural institutions and Creative Ireland.  The Government and I will continue to do everything possible to support arts and culture.</p></speech>

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I echo what Deputy Niamh Smyth said about an Gaillimh ar&eacute;ir.  I congratulate craobh Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann i gCathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, the Cahir branch of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and M&iacute;che&aacute;l and Mary Harty on hosting a wonderful traditional music festival is Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh last weekend.  It is through festivals like this that our culture, music, song and dance are nurtured.  It is very important that we support those and I compliment M&iacute;che&aacute;l and Mary Harty on their tremendous work on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  There is palpable anger and frustration in rural communities at the way the Minister just drove a coach and four through the regulations that were debated here for more than a year, passed by this House and the Seanad and signed into law by the President.  This July, the Minister decided to scrap those rules, which allow for hedge cutting in the interest of health and safety and things like that, instead of initiating legislation which was passed here in 2018.</p></reply>

I also give my thanks to Mary and M&iacute;che&aacute;l Harty.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the provisions under section 7 of the Heritage Act 2018 allow for the making of regulations relating to burning and cutting hedgerows.  Section 7(1) of the Heritage Act 2018 provides that, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I may make regulations to allow the burning of vegetation during certain periods in the month of March and in such parts of the country as specified in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  I made a decision last February not to make regulations to extend the season for the burning of vegetation into March 2019.  This decision was taken as there would have been no basis for me to do so given the fact that the relatively dry weather during the six-month period when the burning of vegetation could have been undertaken under the law, that is, September to February, inclusive, would not have precluded landowners from burning vegetation.  The existing provisions on burning in the Wildlife Acts therefore remained in force for March 2019.</p>  <p>  Regarding hedgerows, subsection 7(2) of the Heritage Act 2018 includes the power to make regulations to allow the cutting of roadside hedges during the month of August subject to conditions.  In July I announced that I would not be proceeding with the making of such regulations this year.  My decision recognised the increasing threats to biodiversity nationally and globally and follows a number of Government initiatives to protect and nurture Ireland's flora and fauna.</p>  <p>  There was extensive public debate and engagement by my Department and myself on this matter including during the national biodiversity conference in Dublin earlier this year, which I hosted together with the Irish forum on natural capital.  Arising from this conference, the Seeds for Nature initiative, which comprised a range of initiatives for nature and biodiversity, was launched.  In addition, there was a wide public consultation on the Heritage Ireland 2030 plan, debates in the D&aacute;il on biodiversity loss and the extensive engagement across Government on climate action, including on the part of my Department.  The report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action made a number of references to the importance of hedgerows.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding my decision not to make regulations to allow hedge cutting in August, I should point out that it is possible in accordance with the provisions of the Heritage Act 2018 and the Roads Act 1993 to cut roadside hedges in circumstances where road safety issues arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900006#D00500"><p>I said in July that there would be significant anger and frustration within rural communities when the Department confirmed, in response to a parliamentary question I submitted, that proposed regulations permitting the commencement of certain provisions of the Heritage Act 2018 are to be scrapped.  The reply confirmed that plans to allow for hedgerow cutting during the month of August have now been abandoned in support of moves to protect nature and biodiversity.  This is anti-democratic.  It is a dangerous and ill-conceived concession from the Minister and the Government, which is proving yet again to be totally clueless about the reality of living in rural Ireland.  Farmers and contractors are excellent custodians of the hedgerow and of nature.  We are not out there slaughtering the ditches.  We are acting in the interests of the health and safety of people trying to walk, to cycle or to enter or exit fields.  Bushes grow out into the middle of the road.  Tourists stop at road signs to try to clear them.  I refer to signs indicating very interesting places on our heritage trails.  It is farcical.  We debated this matter for nearly two years, meeting all groups and stakeholders, and passed a Bill which the President then signed into law.  Thereafter, the Minister acted at the behest of a small number of groups.  Those groups do good work as well, but we need balance here.  What is the point of having this Chamber and the Oireachtas to which we are elected if they are going to be undermined by conferences and groups campaigning on various issues?  We all know about climate change, but farmers and rural people are very caring of biodiversity and of hedgerow flora and fauna.  This is ridiculous regulation.  It is fine in Dublin city where there are roads with signs, but in the country some b&oacute;ithr&iacute;ns have been closed.  One cannot walk up the middle of them because of the briars that hang down.  These farcical regulations mean we are not allowed to cut them back in the interests of health and safety.  The health and safety of the birds and bees is more important than the safety of human beings.  That is where I draw a line.  I will not accept what is happening.</p></speech>

This is not remotely antidemocratic.  There were very good reasons that I did not extend the regulations this year.  Hedgerows provide a very important wildlife habitat.  As already stated, they provide food, shelter, corridors of movement and nesting and hibernation sites for many of our native fauna.  I also refer to the national biodiversity conference, the Seeds for Nature initiative and the very stark pronouncement on the <i>status quo</i>made by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which published its assessment on the state of the world's biodiversity and ecosystems in March this year.</p><p>The Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland gave its take on my recent announcement on hedge cutting.  In a short statement, it indicated that it was very pleased that I had retained the regulations to allow for roadside hedges to be cut for reasons of road safety.  As I have pointed out, things like overgrown hedges and fallen trees can sometimes narrow carriageways and force traffic into an oncoming flow.  Hedges can be cut for that reason.  If briars and overhanging branches are forcing pedestrians and cyclists from the road margins, the hedges can be cut.  Overgrown hedges blocking or impeding egress from farm holdings and fields can be cut.  Hedges concealing entrances or signage installed for road safety or direction can be cut.  Hedges concealing culverts or sharp bends can be cut.</p></speech>

Contractors and farmers are afraid to cut them because they will be photographed with mobile phones and reported.  It is nonsense.  There are signs covered everywhere I go in my county.  I refer to signs which indicate the way to particular places, speed limits and that there are dangerous bends ahead.  Access to and egress from fields forces the implements on the fronts of tractors out into the middle of the road.  It is highly dangerous.  It just shows that the Minister is out of touch and does not understand the reality of rural Ireland.  I invite her to visit any part of Tipperary.  I will show her countless signs, including those indicating national monuments, which are covered up.  It is farcical.  The county council is strapped for cash and uses a great excuse - it is not allowed to cut them.  Health and safety or road safety can go to hell.  That is the reality on the ground.  The hedges are not being cut.  They were always cut by county councils, but that is not being done now.  There are accidents and people get scratched and scraped.  We encourage cyclists, but people could not cycle on these roads without some kind of protective gear.  One would need a helmet to go up and down some roads.  That is the reality.  The Minister should know.  She visits Tipperary the odd time.  She has some relatives there.  It is no different to any other county.  This is patent nonsense.  It is literally usurping the power of this House to make legislation, which it did.  What is the point of debating here and consulting all the stakeholders?  We were at it for a year and a half and the Minister just decided to draw a red line through it and forget about it.  In my view, that is a subversion of democracy any day of the week.</p></speech>

Among the findings in the report I mentioned earlier is that the decline in the numbers of bees, butterflies and other insects has largely resulted from the effects of monoculture and the drive to ever-higher levels of productivity, characterised by loss or neglect of hedgerows, farmland edges and scrub.</p><p>It has also led to the deliberate removal of habitats, such as hedgerows and wetlands, and there has been some criticism of agricultural policy which does not support diverse hedgerows.  If I had been in a position to extend the regulations, I would have done so.  For all the reasons I have outlined, however, I was not in a position to do so and I stand by that decision.  It would not have been the right thing to do in these circumstances.</p></speech>

She experienced the great excitement in the area when she attended a recent public meeting hosted by the Monasterevin Blueway group.  Other public meetings in Rathangan and Athy were attended by officials from Waterways Ireland, including Mr. John Boyle.  These were very well attended and great interest was shown by everybody.  I have raised this matter with the Minister previously but my focus today is on the role of her Department and Waterways Ireland in rolling out this project to make it a reality.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900008#F00100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together. </p>  <p>  The Barrow blueway is a planned upgrade to provide a multi-use shared leisure route connecting Lowtown in County Kildare to St. Mullins in County Carlow, a distance of 115 km of off-road, flat, accessible, public space.  Waterways Ireland is now moving forward with plans to develop the Barrow Canal towpath as a 46 km blueway from Lowtown to Horse Bridge in Athy.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council in partnership with Laois County Council and Waterways Ireland, with the support of my Department, made an application under the rural regeneration and development fund for funding for this development and the outcome of that process will be known before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has undertaken an economic appraisal of the development of the towpath, which concluded ultimately that benefit to the local economy of the development would be &euro;2.5 million per annum from tourism and recreational spend, with a payback period of less than five years.  The project to enhance the Barrow towpath will create approximately 90 jobs during the construction phase and create an estimated 130 direct and indirect jobs in the tourism, recreational and hospitality sectors in the area.</p>  <p>  The blueway will link and connect many communities along the 46 km route.  In developing the blueway it is hoped to engage effectively with those local communities and thus provide a sense of civic pride in areas that might otherwise by overlooked by visitors.</p>  <p> Waterways Ireland has considerable experience in developing blueways throughout the inland navigations, including the Shannon navigation in 2014, which attracts more than 100,000 visitors to the region, and generates an estimated &euro;4 million per annum for the local economy.  Waterways Ireland will actively work with other bodies in the region to progress the development of the initiative in Kildare and Laois.  It will provide assistance to the local authorities in sourcing appropriate funding for the project and will be centrally involved in the construction phase if funding is obtained.  It is this strong partnership approach among public sector bodies and the private, community and voluntary sectors that will ensure that ultimately the Barrow blueway will be developed, promoted and maintained for the benefit of the entire Barrow community.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to speak at a public meeting on 29 August about the Barrow blueway organised by Deputy Heydon in Monasterevin community centre.  I congratulate him on it.  There was a very good turnout.  In particular, we spoke about the significance for counties Kildare and Laois.  Some of the other officials, as well as councillors from Kildare and Laois, Mr. John Boyle of Waterways Ireland, Mr. Joe Boland of Kildare County Council and the local tidy towns group have done a lot of good work.  The Monasterevin blueway group has been integral to much of the progress made thus far.</p>  <p>  To provide background on the development of previous blueways by Waterways Ireland, the Shannon blueway attracts more than 100,000 visitors to the region and generates an estimated &euro;4 million every year.  Thanks to the collaborative approach by Waterways Ireland and Kildare and Laois local authorities, and the support of the local community, an opportunity has finally arisen for the development of the Barrow blueway.  The blueway should be an experience and perhaps the word does not fully capture what is on offer in such a project.  It is about much more than the water and water-based pursuits.  It offers opportunities for walkers and cyclists on the adjacent paths, connecting communities and enhancing the tourism potential of an area by showing off some of its incredible natural amenities.  It is also about preserving and protecting an artificial ecosystem with diverse species and an important water supply.  It is, and will be, a hook, and this was discussed at length at the meeting, to get people to stay an extra night in the area.  Ultimately, this is what it is all about so that people will stay over and invest in the local economy.  To be realistic, this is a three-year project and, as with all projects, a funding package needs to be put together.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role she and the Department have played, along with Waterways Ireland, in making the crucial decision over the summer.  I raised the issue with the Minister prior to the summer recess.  We had lost out on planning permission to the element of the proposed blueway south of Athy.  At the time, the proposed blueway was 115 km.  It was a brave decision and the right decision to proceed with the 46 km for which we now have planning permission.  The people in Carlow who objected to this originally will, in time, look at us with great envy and wish they had this.  I hope that in time the challenges with regard to the full route can be met.</p>  <p>  The point made by the Minister about funding is very valid and I understand an application has been made to the rural regeneration and development fund.  I hope the Department is working closely with the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Minister, Deputy Ring, to put the best case forward.  Waterways Ireland has made a very detailed submission.  We will do everything to try to bring through the funding.</p>  <p>  What role does F&aacute;ilte Ireland have in funding?  Will it play a role in marketing afterwards?  We know the huge potential Kildare has to bring in tourists.  A large number of tourists travel through Kildare at present and our challenge is to get them to slow down and stay.  Many of them drive to areas beyond Kildare.  In 2017, the Waterford greenway had more than 250,000 visitors, with an average spend of &euro;29.50 per day or &euro;110 per person who stayed overnight in the area.  This is what we want to achieve in Kildare.  We want people to slow down, stay and spend time in the area and, obviously, leave more money behind them in the process.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development has a key role to play, as do other State agencies and Departments that can fund the blueway once it is constructed.  I hope we receive the grant from the Department of Rural and Community Development.  How will ongoing maintenance be funded?  What role will the local authority have in this regard?</p></speech>

This will be of great benefit to the area.  In future it would be good to see if we can roll out the full blueway but at least we have this element of it.  Planning permission for the remainder of the route from Athy to St. Mullins was refused mainly on the grounds of the impact it would have on the special area of conservation.  Waterways Ireland now wishes to develop the 46 km stretch in collaboration with Kildare and Laois local authorities.  The estimated cost of developing the 46 km route from Lowtown to Athy is &euro;6.8 million.  Earlier this year, Kildare County Council, in partnership with Laois County Council and Waterways Ireland, made an application under the rural regeneration and development fund.  We await the outcome of this process in the autumn.  It is this strong partnership approach among the public sector parties and the private, community and voluntary sectors that will ensure that ultimately the project will be developed, promoted and maintained for the benefit of the entire region.</p>  <p>  With regard to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as I said, the public meeting is an opportunity to explore what funding may come from it.  It is certainly something that should be investigated.</p></speech>

Another point she heard raised at the meeting organised by the Monasterevin blueway group, one that was also raised at the meeting we held afterwards in Athy at which there was an equally impressive crowd and energy, as was the case at gatherings in Rathangan previously, were concerns from local landowners.  These are challenges that must be worked through with the development of every blueway and greenway that traverses private land.  Points were made on drainage issues and roads and local bridges that might need maintenance.  Mr John Boyle of Waterways Ireland went into detail on navigation of the channel.  Engagement on ongoing maintenance will be very important after we obtain the funding and construction starts.  We will need a proper mechanism for engagement.  Will the Minister outline how this will work?  Will it be the responsibility of Waterways Ireland or the local authority?  Who will be the go-to person for people who might have concerns or to bring the issues that we will need to thrash out as it is being developed?  There is huge goodwill in Kildare and that is not to be underestimated in any way.  Therefore, it is all the more important that when local residents or landowners raise a concern they have an opportunity to be heard.  Local landowners know the local challenges better than anybody else and we want to ensure every potential problem that crops up along the way for our tourists, visitors and locals can be addressed in a collaborative way without causing upset.</p><p>A good engagement process throughout is really important.  Does Waterways Ireland or the local authority have lead responsibility for that?</p></speech>

Waterways Ireland is ultimately guided by a three-year aquatic weed management plan.  It is informed by operational needs and best international practice.  The plan considers both the protected and invasive aquatic weed species and pays due cognisance to the need for biosecurity during all aquatic weed control operations in order to minimise the spread of invasive alien species, which is important when talking about dredging and ensuring the canals are clear.</p>  <p>  Aquatic vegetation growing in the navigation channels is not removed by dredging but is controlled by weed harvester, a weed-cutting boat, during the growing season which is May to October as resources permit and it is currently ongoing.  We are aware of all these matters.  I know that some of the Members who attended on the evening discussed ensuring that the boats can go through the canal.  There is no point in having a canal unless it is properly maintained and looked after.  Waterways Ireland does as much as it can.  We want to be able to ensure that people can canoe and kayak, and enjoy a quality experience on our canals.  Waterways Ireland is always conscious of that with all its canals.</p>  <p>  There will be challenges in ensuring any kind of quality experience.  Waterways Ireland has worked in partnership with Sport Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other bodies to ensure that.</p></speech>

In 2018, a total of 1,606 venues across the island of Ireland participated in Culture Night, with an attendance of 420,000.  Nationally, events are run in partnership with local authorities.  Events were also held throughout Northern Ireland and overseas.  In 2018, Sligo hosted 38 events in 19 venues and welcomed 2,435 visitors.</p><p>Culture Night 2019 will take place on Friday, 20 September from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m.  Details of events in every area are available on .  It is anticipated that attendance figures will increase this year.  This year Sligo has been allocated funding of &euro;4,500 to assist with the cost of events.  This funding is provided on a matched funding basis through the local authority.</p><p>I know that Sligo has always been a place with a vibrant, active and devoted cultural community.  Some of the innovative events in the Sligo programme for 2019 include Art House Open Studio, Sligo Global Kitchen at the Model and Culture Comhr&aacute; at the Hawk's Well Theatre.</p><p>My Department has also allocated a further &euro;183,005 to projects in the Sligo area through my Department's Creative Ireland programme in 2018 and 2019, including &quot;His Deep Gaze&quot; and for activities in Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g.</p><p>The cultural scene is bubbling and bursting with new ideas and pioneering practices, and is winning the world over.  It calls on people across Ireland not to miss out and get out and support our culture creators, big and small, across the country on Friday.  Around every corner there will be something to explore from awesome animation and stunning light projections to rattling reading and pulsating performances, exhilarating exhibitions and resounding concerts.</p></speech>

I also welcome the funding given to the Model and to the Hawk's Well Theatre over recent years.  The Minister mentioned the events taking place.  I compliment everybody associated with Sligo County Council on their effort and commitment in recent years.  It is encouraging that the numbers have been increasing and we expect this trend to continue on Friday night.  The Minister has given considerable funding to the creative arts.  The funding of &euro;4,500 for Friday is badly needed by the local authority because matching funds can be difficult at times.  It is vital that people come out on Friday night, not just in Sligo but throughout the country.  It is encouraging to see the number of people coming out.  I ask that the Department consider funding for all these events again in the future.</p></speech>

The allocation of &euro;4,500 this year is the same as the amount allocated last year.  I have no doubt it will be put to good use on Friday night.  While in Sligo in March, I visited the Hawk's Well Theatre, which has received capital grants from the Department.  The Hawk's Well Theatre is a 340-seat theatre which hosts a diverse programme of arts and entertainment, including professional and amateur drama, a wide range of music from traditional and jazz to opera, dance, pantomime, children's theatre and comedy.</p>  <p>  On 19 May I attended the national Famine commemoration in Sligo town.  I also visited the Model, home of the Niland collection, which features one of the largest public holdings of works by Jack Butler Yeats.  It also features a broad range of traditional and contemporary works by artists, including Norah McGuinness, Dorothy Cross, Alice Maher, Clodagh Emoe, Eamon O'Kane, Se&aacute;n McSweeney, Estella Solomons and Paul Henry among others.</p>  <p>  I also attended the launch of Project Ireland 2040 at the Institute of Technology Sligo on 15 February 2018, when we announced the details of almost &euro;1.2 billion in capital spending plans for my Department.</p></speech>

The Minister is right in what she said about the Hawk's Well Theatre.  That money was very well received.  Work is about to begin on a major development in the theatre.  Wonderful works are being done at the Model.  Great credit is due to the staff at the Model and the Hawk's Well Theatre as well as to the people supporting those fine facilities in Sligo town.  The Minister has been to the Model on a number of occasions and she also went to the Hawk's Well Theatre to announce additional funding.  She will have seen the enthusiasm in both those facilities which is replicated in many others.  Sligo County Council has a number of events in the programme for Friday night.  The Minister has always been very supportive on her visits to Sligo and the announcements made in respect of the two major projects at the Hawk's Well Theatre and the Model.</p></speech>

At the Hawk's Well Theatre this Friday, Rafeef Ziadah and Sorcha Fox will perform &quot;Sendiana&quot;, which is about exile and terror.  I expect it to be really powerful.  Sligo Global Kitchen at the Model will bring communities together to enjoy a global food experience.  The Yeats Society in Sligo will host &quot;Sisters, Sisters, Sisters&quot; by storyteller Imelda Ryan Jones.  People will be able to tour the Sligo Masonic Hall and learn about the Masonic order.</p><p>I also mention the small-scale local festivals and funding schemes for summer schools.</p><p>In 2019 the Sligo Feis Cheoil received &euro;2,000, the Yeats International Summer School received &euro;5,000 and the Enniscrone and District Community received &euro;1,500 for the Black Pig Festival in 2018.<br/><br/>I will continue to support Sligo in any way I can.  I hope that all the Members present enjoy Culture Night. </p></speech>

The Wildlife Act 2018 affords protection to a range of habitats and species and provides for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect biodiversity is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department.  These regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union and give a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each member state.  The main instruments provided for are the designation of special protection areas, SPA, aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds and special areas of conservation, SAC, aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats.</p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's national biodiversity action plan.  The most recent plan, Ireland's third, was published in October 2017 and contains a range of actions to protect and conserve biodiversity, including measures to restore and conserve habitats and protect vulnerable species.</p>  <p>  The NPWS, working together with national experts and colleagues in Northern Ireland, produces regional red lists for the island of Ireland.  Red lists are published on an irregular basis as datasets and the necessary national expertise for taxonomic groups become available.</p>  <p>  In addition, threat response plans are being prepared by NPWS as part of Ireland's response to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in case C-183/05 and the requirement to establish a system of strict protection for species listed in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  These plans provide detailed information on range, distribution and habitat.  They also focus on the particular threats facing each species and identify the measures required to address these threats, as well as identifying who is responsible for implementing them and providing a timeframe for delivery.</p>  <p>  The NPWS will continue to monitor and assess the status of vulnerable species in Ireland and takes into consideration any appropriate responses possible within their remit and the resources available to the Department, including specific schemes to address particular threatened species.</p></speech>

People tell me regularly that the corncrake is nearly a thing of the past.  It is vitally important that the Department, the officials and the Minister do everything that can be done, particularly to enhance or increase the special areas of conservation to help protect the various birds and animals that could be extent in a few years.  They are threatened unless we now take action.  The Minister has outlined that and I appeal to her on my behalf and that of my colleague to do whatever is possible to ensure they are protected.</p></speech>

The population of corncrakes in Ireland has been monitored annually since 1993 but it is critically low, with an estimated 83% decline between 1978 and 2018 with only 153 calling males remaining.  The breeding range population declined by 86% between 1972 and 2018.  Since 2005 the population has remained stable and there are nine special areas of protection which have been designated for the protection of breeding corncrake populations in Ireland with an estimated 70 calling males, approximately 45% of the total national population.  There are many positive outcomes and conservation measures we are undertaking for the corncrake.  They include the provision of early cover dominated by broadleaved herbaceous species such as the iris or nettle, the suitable corncrake friendly mowing machine with late cutting, a friendly mowing pattern and late cover provision by leaving some field strips unmown until September, maintaining early cover strands through to the season&rsquo;s end and field operations reduced or removed from late April and general access to meadows kept to a minimum from May to August.</p></speech>

However, I understand that the National Museum of Ireland is at the initial stages of planning a major new history of Ireland gallery which will eventually cover the period from 1600 to the present day, which will be located at the Museum of Decorative Arts and History at Collins Barracks.</p>  <p>  The galleries will offer visitors an opportunity to explore the key events in Irish history leading up to and including the momentous events of the period 1912 to 1923.  They will also provide a compelling, accurate and interactive account of the basic tides of Irish history since 1600.  They will deal as much with the social, economic and cultural changes that affected everyday life, as with the political and military events that dominate most popular understanding.  It is the museum's intention that the first phase of these permanent exhibition galleries will open in 2022 at the Museum of Decorative Arts and History, Collins Barracks and will cover the period of 1900&ndash;2022 to coincide with the conclusion of the commemorations around the decade of centenaries and the foundation of the Irish State.</p>  <p>  This major new exhibition will be considered in the context of the ongoing development of the Decade of Centenaries Commemoration Programme.  In the meantime the Museum will also be working on other aspects of the overall exhibition covering the period 1600 to 1900.</p>  <p>  The question of funding for this exhibition will be considered when the Museum has drawn up detailed plans as part of the overall funding arrangements for both the Museum itself and the Decade of Centenaries Commemoration Programme.  I look forward to working with the Museum in relation to this programme.</p>  <p>  The National Museum is at the initial stages of planning a major new history of Ireland gallery.  I think that will be of interest to the Deputy.  The museum has held several exhibitions which also explore various aspect of this period, including Soldiers and Chiefs - the Irish at War at Home and Abroad which traces Ireland's military history from 1550 into the twenty-first century.  There was also one entitled Proclaiming a Republic: The 1916 Rising which explores the background to the Rising.</p></speech>

I am also aware that 22 years ago it moved much of its collection to Collins Barracks.</p><p>I have a particular interest because my father worked in the National Museum for more than 30 years.  At the time of the move to Collins Barracks, we were told the site would allow for a large expansion in the exhibition space in order that the museum could display much of what was in its vaults in collections that had been unseen by the public for many years.  Some 22 years later, the space used within Collins Barracks remains limited.  The large undertaking the museum has proposed will require money to open more gallery space and showcase much of the Irish history that is not fully explored and interpreted in the existing exhibitions.</p> <p> I accept that the Minister is not directly involved in dictating the content of exhibitions.  When the museum comes looking, as it will have to because it has been starved of funding for many years, I hope the Government will not be found wanting in ensuring there is no delay in putting on the exhibition they have outlined.</p></speech>

I will negotiate with the Minister for Finance in respect of my budget for culture this year and how it will be of value to the National Museum of Ireland.  As we know, under Project Ireland 2040 significant funding will be invested in the museum.  We do not as yet know from the National Museum of Ireland what the detailed plans or costings are for the exhibition, although I believe that it hopes some funding will be available.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Museum of Ireland has a master development plan and has published a 15-year master vision statement, which may be pertinent to his question, for the period 2018 to 2032 that sets out plans for the transformation of the museum into an institution of international standing.  Physical developments throughout the museum site over the next 15 years will be underpinned by three principles: to protect it and provide the best conditions for the care of its collections and access for educational research; to safeguard it and ensure that all the National Museum of Ireland sites are safe and secure for the collections and the public; and to promote accessibility to make the museum's sites, exhibitions and interpretations fully accessible for everyone.  It is envisaged that a separate master plan will be developed for each site, underpinned by the principles.  The Collins Barracks site, which the Deputy mentioned, will be developed as the headquarters and focal point of all the National Museum of Ireland sites.  New galleries will be developed for earth science and world culture, while on-site facilities will be developed to provide improved access to collections.  As I outlined, an extension will be added to the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street, while a link will be provided to the museum of archaeology in Kildare Street.</p></speech>

During the period, particularly until 2016, there was specific funding for legacy programmes.  I encourage the Minister, if possible when it arrives on her desk, to examine the plan for the exhibition at the museum from 1900 to 1922.  At the very least, it should be considered as one of the legacy programmes to be held at the end of the decade of centenaries, which runs from 2012 to 2023.</p></speech>

The National Museum of Ireland, along with all the national cultural institutions, will have a major role to play in how we tell the story and commemorate it properly.  The Department is developing specific proposals for a co-ordinated, cross-governmental commemorative programme for 2020 and indicative plans for the remainder of the decade of centenaries.  The work will continue to be informed and supported by the expert advisory group, with which the Deputy will be familiar, on the centenary commemorations.  It will also be developed in consultation with the all-party consultation group on commemorations.  I hope to be in a position to give further details in respect of the programme in due course.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of the commemorative programme to date, local authorities, our national cultural institutions, trade unions, the media, institutions of learning and custodians of records, together with creative communities, will have a leading role in supporting the national conversation about events during the period and encouraging respectful and authentic engagement, debate and analysis.  There are plans for 2022, in particular, as the Deputy noted.  The first phase of the permanent exhibition galleries will open in 2022 at the museum of decorative arts and history at Collins Barracks and will continue the period 1900 to 1922-----</p></speech>

Under the programme, the Department was allocated almost &euro;1.2 billion for capital expenditure over a ten-year period to 2027.  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, I published Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, 2018-2027, a ten-year plan setting out the detail of the Government's commitment for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage as part of Project Ireland 2040.  A significant focus for my Department over the next ten years will be on enhancing the cultural infrastructure in Dublin city, recognising the challenges our national cultural institutions have experienced over the past decade.  Outside of the national cultural institutions investment programme, and as part of our wider investment in cultural infrastructure under Project Ireland, we also support a wide range of smaller projects in Dublin.  Such projects are designed to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the existing cultural infrastructure and include projects such as the redevelopment of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Responsibility for local cultural spaces rests in the first instance with local authorities, which are charged under section 10 of the Planning and Development Act with adopting a development plan that integrates the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population.  Adoption of the development plan is a reserved function of the local authority.  While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on planning matters, my Department works closely with local authorities to support culture, creativity and heritage activities throughout Ireland, including in Dublin. </p><p>In April 2019, I held a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity after hours as an alternative and complementary option to Ireland's existing rich night-time experience.  My Department has also worked with key partners to develop an approach to support a sustainable and forward-looking infrastructure to facilitate the development of after-hours cultural events.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>It is my intention to establish pilot projects to identify how a night-time culture initiative might work in both urban and rural settings.  To this end, my Department will approach a number of local authorities to establish a group comprising representatives from the relevant local authority, local creative nightlife sector, policing, transport, and artists and creative workers.  The purpose of this group will be to consider and collate what supports and impediments currently have an impact on opportunities for creative and cultural activity at night, in different settings, and what would be required locally to develop, promote and encourage late-night culture.  The groups will also consider the appropriateness of appointing local night-time commissioners.  </p><p>In parallel to the structured research initiative, I intend to establish a national forum comprising my Department, the National Transport Authority, the Arts Council and several other Departments with important roles in developing night-time infrastructure.  The committee will consider matters arising from the operation of the pilot local groups that could require a national policy or legislative response, which would, in turn, be referred to the relevant Department or agency for consideration.</p><p>I also intend to engage with local authorities and arts groups on a mapping exercise of existing venues and civic spaces that may be suitable for night-time cultural events to identify both gaps and opportunities.</p></speech>

They feel that, bit by bit, our cultural capital and identity are being eroded by the loss of such venues to make way for hotels, student accommodation and apartment blocks.</p><p>We know the Government has not helped with the housing crisis.  However, I appreciate that ultimately it is the work of the local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister mentioned Project Ireland 2040 and providing investment of &euro;40 million for cultural infrastructure nationwide, with a need to ensure regional balance.  Outside the investment for our national institutions, what money is being spent on cultural spaces for our capital?</p></speech>

With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have allocated an amount up to &euro;3 million in principle to Dublin City Council for capital development works for studio workspaces to match funding provided under the urban regeneration development fund on sites owned by the city council.  This level of investment will greatly benefit the artists in the area and address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin city.  The Deputy acknowledged that this is primarily up to local authorities and councillors, who have a function with respect to artist studios and spaces.  We are working in collaboration and there are discussions on what else we can do to help artists with the space they have to be creative.</p></speech>

We read in this morning's newspapers the details of the attack and the injuries suffered by Mr. Lunney, and they are absolutely appalling.  It is the type of attack we thought had ended on this island.  Mr. Lunney was kidnapped by four masked men, thrown into the boot of a car and driven away from his family home to an isolated spot where he was aggressively and savagely assaulted.  As a consequence he is enduring life-changing injuries.  I am sure everybody will join me in wishing him and his family well during this very difficult time.  I hope everybody in the House joins me in saying there is no room on this island for that kind of attack and for somebody to be treated in that manner.</p>  <p>  It is worrying that there has been a pattern of attacks on both people and property over a number of years that culminated in this attack on Tuesday evening.  Today, the chairman of Quinn Industrial Holdings has stated he is "frustrated and angry" more had not been done to protect Mr. Lunney.  There have been a series of attacks on property and people and there appears to be complacency in dealing with the matter and pursuing those who are responsible.</p>  <p>  What has the Government done in the 48 hours since the attack to ensure extra Garda resources will be made available and that it can co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, so that, once and for all, there can be a strong policing response that will send a message that we will take no nonsense?  What kind of engagement has there been with executives from Quinn Industrial Holdings to assure them that the Government understands the pressure they are under and it will not stand for this kind of behaviour?  Will extra resources be made available?  My colleague, Councillor John Paul Feeley, suggested a specialised unit from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI to root out the problem once and for all.  I know the T&aacute;naiste will join me, as I hope everybody will, in condemning the attack.  It is worrying that a complacency in policing has led to the attack.  Once and for all we must drive out that complacency.</p></speech>

I am glad he has done so because it gives me an opportunity to express support and sympathy for the Lunney family and Mr. Lunney in particular.  This was a shocking incident and many people today are talking about it, as they were yesterday.  A completely innocent person coming home from work had his car rammed before being brutally pulled from the vehicle by a gang of masked men and taken across the Border and beaten in a way that will potentially leave life-changing injuries, both mental and physical.  He was left in a ditch.  It is shocking and the response needs to be very robust from both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it will be.  We cannot allow this kind of brutal intimidation, which is a reminder of the kind of gangland paramilitary-style punishment beatings of the past.  I do not say that lightly.  These are a way of intimidating people for whatever reason who are working in the series of companies that Mr. Lunney works with.</p>  <p>  I hope Deputies will appreciate I am somewhat limited in what I can say about this awful incident, given it is now subject to a significant investigation by both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, I join the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality in condemning in the strongest possible terms the attack that took place.  This was an act of cowards in many ways who have no regard for the rule of law on either side of the Border.  I understand both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducting a major inquiry into the incident and are determined to find those responsible and bring them to justice.</p>  <p>  Let me be clear that no stone will be left unturned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the PSNI and both police services will relentlessly pursue these individuals.  I wish them well in their inquiries and encourage anybody with information on this matter to come forward to the Garda or the PSNI as quickly as possible.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has requested that the Garda Commissioner keep him personally updated on progress in this investigation.  I have had responsibility for relationships with Northern Ireland for the past two years and I can confidently say the relationship between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is probably stronger now than it has ever been.  This is a case on which they will work very closely to try to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  With respect to broader Garda resources, Garda strength in the northern region now stands at approximately 1,500, which is an increase of 150 since the end of 2017.  It is also worth mentioning that there will be an armed support unit in Cavan, and armed support units have now been established by the Garda Commissioner in all regions to provide an armed response capacity on a regional basis to support and supplement the national emergency response team.  There continues to be a Garda focus in the Border counties and this incident is a reminder of why that is necessary.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that this is the culmination of a number of attacks that have gone on for two years, including a previous attack on Mr. Lunney when he had his nose broken.  Another executive had boiling water thrown in his face.  As I said, there seems to be complacency in seeing through the investigations and people are getting away with these attacks.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's indication there will be a massive investigation but the Government must send a signal of confidence to the business and investment communities that this kind of thing will be pursued and people will follow through on the investigations.  It is a challenging area in which to do business, as Deputies Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth have continuously highlighted.  Unless and until somebody is brought before the courts for this wave of attacks, the perception that people are getting away with this will go on.  We must draw a line under this.</p>  <p>  I want the T&aacute;naiste to give an assurance today that every possible resource will be made available and every possible political support will be provided, not just from the Government but from every party inside and outside this Chamber.  This kind of act cannot continue and somebody must face justice for what happened on Tuesday night.</p></speech>

This is not the first instance but it is by far the most serious.</p>  <p>  Both the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will attach the highest priority to this case.  There is an obligation on the communities living in the area.  Many people know who carried out these acts and who is behind the brutality, intimidation and total lawlessness of what happened.  Those people need to come forward and help the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigations they will conduct and I strongly encourage them to do that.  This is not what people living in Border counties want or will accept and they need to work with the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to stamp it out and respond to an event that, quite frankly, could have resulted in a man's death.  It was a brutal assault that is going to have a considerable impact on both Mr. Lunney and his family.  It needs a quick response from the policing and judicial sectors.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in condemns the vicious and abhorrent attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, who was just doing his job and has been a part of creating employment for many people in the Border community.  I echo the words of the T&aacute;naiste that there is no justification for anybody to shield or cover those who are behind this attack - and, indeed, many other attacks - on individuals and properties related to Quinn Industrial Holdings.  I encourage those with any information, regardless of how insignificant they think it is, to bring it to the relevant authority.  This needs to be stamped out quickly.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the fact that thousands of school secretaries across the country will go on strike tomorrow and will begin an indefinite work-to-rule action until their modest demands are met.  This follows a breakdown in talks yesterday between their union, F&oacute;rsa, and the Department of Education and Skills.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that the staff are invaluable members of our school communities who often go beyond their job requirements to meet the needs of parents and pupils.  They work on the front line and they are the first port of call for parents and students.  Our schools simply would not function without them.</p>  <p>  Our teachers would agree that these staff are underpaid and undervalued by the Department.  School secretaries have my full support and that of Sinn F&eacute;in in their dispute and claim.</p>  <p>  At the heart of the matter is a dispute that centres on the fact that the majority of school secretaries, just over 3,000 of them, receive as little as &euro;13,000 per year.  They also have irregular and short-term contracts with no pay during summer holidays, school breaks or at Christmas time.  It is beyond doubt that these secretaries receive low pay with little security.</p>  <p>  This is only compounded by the inequality within the system because, on one hand, a few hundred school secretaries are paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills with starting salaries of &euro;24,000 and, on the other hand, 90% of them are not.  Those who are not receive as little as &euro;13,000 per year.</p>  <p>  The importance of these staff will become clear tomorrow when they begin their strike at the start of the school day because their schools cannot function without them.  They are integral to the education system that needs them and, in that way, they are public servants who provide a service to our children and parents.  That cannot be disputed and is why Sinn F&eacute;in believes their claim is justified.  They should be employed as public servants with the same contractual security as their colleagues.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has failed to seriously engage with staff and union representatives in order to resolve this dispute.  The relevant Minister was made aware as far back as May of this year of the pay claim, the job insecurity and the two-tier pay structure but he has dragged his heels in reaching an agreement.  I am sure the Minister will claim that the specific responsibility for the employment, pay and working conditions of these staff rests with the schools through the capitation grants they receive and not with his Department.  Any of us in this House with children of school going age know that the capitation grants that are supposed to cover heating, lighting, insurance and teaching materials simply do not cut it.</p>  <p>  We need real action.  We need for these employees to be valued.  What will this Government do to avert further action and recognise the work and value of school secretaries?</p></speech>

F&oacute;rsa's pay claim is a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement which runs until the end of this year.  The Department's position is that the union's claim will be fully considered once the current costs have been determined.  The Department is conducting a survey of schools which closes tomorrow.  Bearing that in mind, any industrial action is surely premature and unwarranted, not least because the period of the current agreement has not even expired yet.  The current pay agreement committed both parties to engaging with one another in the course of 2019 to consider the nature of an agreement to apply from 1 January next year.</p>  <p>  The Department is not the employer of the staff concerned and does not hold current information on their pay rates and working hours.  A previous survey was conducted ten years ago and the current pay agreement has been implemented in the meantime.  The results illustrate that this matter presents significant issues for the Exchequer with a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per year in funding to allow for the employer pension contributions in State-funded community and voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Department of Education and Skills engaged in an arbitration process with the union in 2015.  This resulted in a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13.  This arbitration agreement lasts until the end of this year and was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower paid staff.  For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then-minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015, prior to the arbitration, is now paid &euro;13 per hour which is an increase of 50%.</p>  <p>  Having said all that, my experience is that these issues get resolved by talking.  I encourage F&oacute;rsa to engage with the Department to try to find a way forward that avoids industrial action, including that scheduled for tomorrow, and the disruption that will cause to children, parents and the staff of schools.</p></speech>

They will argue that the departmental cost was submitted to the committee of the Department of Education and Skills in May of this year and the talks that took place this week were not about the substance of the claim but went around the houses on the costs.  There is frustration among the secretaries themselves and 94% of them voted in favour of industrial action and the strike.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that he values the work of these school secretaries and I do not doubt his bona fides.  I do not know the school secretary in the school the T&aacute;naiste drops his kids to.  Some 10% of school secretaries start on a salary of &euro;24,000 and go up to &euro;40,000 but the school secretaries in the school I drop my kids to could be earning as little as &euro;13,000 per year with no payment at all over Christmas and Hallowe'en, among other conditions that do not exist for other public service employees.  That inequality is the core of this issue.  School secretaries do so much and go beyond the call of duty to keep schools together despite the different additional burdens placed on them.</p><p>How can we ask them, if we truly value them, to continue to do that job while their colleagues in other schools are earning twice, if not three times, as much as them?  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that the issue of pay must be dealt with?  Does he believe that school secretaries should be recognised for the public service they provide as public servants?</p></speech>

There was is an ongoing consultation this year with a view to putting new arrangements in place for the start of next year.  I am not directly involved but I understand that a school survey is needed as part of that process in order to ensure that all those involved, particularly the Department of Education and Skills, understand the numbers and the facts.  That survey will conclude tomorrow.  Surely it is premature to trigger industrial action before the survey is complete?  I ask people to show some restraint and to give discussion a chance to produce a result that would be acceptable to both sides rather than resorting to industrial action tomorrow which will cause significant disruption in schools.  The Deputy is correct.  School secretaries are a hugely important part of the school infrastructure, staffing, the safe functioning of schools, looking after children and so on.  Given the nature of what is happening and what is under way, I appeal to F&oacute;rsa to look again at tomorrow's industrial action and to continue the consultation with the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900014#M00300"><p>Last Tuesday, when he took questions in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the Libyan detention centres, forced returns, the Mediterranean and the recent impasse.  His response to me was very strong, namely, that migrants stranded in the Mediterranean need a much better co-ordinated and collective response from the EU instead of the <i>ad hoc</i>, case-by-case management seen to date.  The T&aacute;naiste was critical of the EU being unable to agree collectively on an approach to migration and rescue.  He stated that a new system which will ensure survivors' well-being is being planned and that Ireland will be part of it.  That is very positive.  Other positive aspects are the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, peer reviews from 2014 and the mid-term review from 2016.  I understand that the current review, which will be published next year, will also be positive.  The reviews from 2014 and 2017 highlight Ireland's commitment to the least developed countries and the quality of our programmes there, which are focused on poverty and hunger reduction.  We have an excellent record in providing untied aid and there is a commitment to move beyond the 0.7% threshold.  However, that considerable regard for Ireland is being undermined by aspects of the increasing EU securitisation agenda.  The OECD DAC has concerns that overseas development aid can be used for activities that harm human rights.</p><p>I wish to raise two issues.  First, the European Peace Facility, EPF, which plans to make more efficient the deployment of military missions.  The EPF involves a component to train and equip foreign government military actors in fragile states by, among other things, providing weapons.  It has a potential budget of $10 billion for the next six years.  Compare that with $3.7 billion budget for the preventing conflict instruments of the EU.  There are concerns regarding governance and accountability if there is an oversight role for the European Parliament.  Where does Ireland stand in this regard, particularly in the context of the positives I have just outlined?  I accept that Ireland is trying to reach a coalition with like-minded states but it is obvious that more needs to be done to ensure that there is a publicly accessible list of the eligible equipment for the EPF which would exclude weapons and ammunition, ensure that civilian peace-building alternatives are considered first and to ensure accountability techniques for the potential misuse of military assistance and, of course, the protection of civilians.  There must also be transparency, so that there will be a timely disclosure of all EPF documents such as the proposals for action programmes and that they go to national parliaments and foreign affairs committees.  How can Ireland be the positive voice on humanitarian and human rights issues while at the same time not be as active on the EPF, which has the potential for over-reliance on force as a means to resolve issues?</p></speech>

That does not often happen in this House.  Normally, it is a case of criticism and defence when we discuss these issues, if "defence" is the correct word in this context.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows my views on the EU's responsibility for vulnerable migrants in the Mediterranean particularly in camps in Libya from which many are desperately trying to escape and are at the mercy of people traffickers who are brutal in their methods.  I am both disappointed and frustrated by the lack of the EU's capacity to respond comprehensively to the humanitarian challenge which we all face.  Part of that was driven by an inability to agree disembarkation procedures in terms of locations and so on for various political reasons I do not have time to go into.  I hope that we will be able to find a way forward that can allow EU involvement on a humanitarian search and rescue basis.  Of course, we must ensure that we are not encouraging people trafficking or creating any type of pull factor while at the same time ensuring that we are not knowingly allowing people to drown.  Given the resources that we have the potential to provide to ensure that does not happen.  I am proud to say that Ireland has made a very significant contribution in recent years.  Irish naval vessels have taken approximately 14,000 people from the waters of the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya.  We will continue to work with other EU countries to try to find and agree a more collective approach towards migration and accommodation of migrants and refugees if and when they disembark in the European Union, which is a challenge for Ireland in light of demands on housing, criticisms of direct provision and other challenges.  However, it is something we must do.  We cannot allow EU Mediterranean countries to carry the entire burden or what will happen - it has already happened in Italy - in the forthcoming general election is that people will respond by putting those who engage in hardline thinking on migration issues into office.  We need to work together to ensure that this does not happen and, in that context, we must help Italy with the burden it has shouldered.</p>  <p>  I will return to the EPF facility in response to the Deputy's supplementary question in order to give a more comprehensive answer.  There is a role for the EPF, for training and supporting countries in parts of the world that have been destabilised or torn apart by conflict to build security capacity.  However, Ireland's expertise and role lies in the areas of peacekeeping and the provision of civilian supports in post-conflict situations.  Those are the areas in which we have credibility and that is the emphasis in our contribution to most of these EU debates.</p></speech>

I will introduce another aspect, namely, the EU Trust Fund for Africa.  Much concern has been expressed on that, including by the EU Court of Auditors.  There is concern that the trust fund is spending EU aid money in ways that contradict development and undermine human rights.  Libya is one example.  It is money from the trust fund that is keeping detention centres there, in which conditions are appalling, going.  In the Sudan, EU funds have been used to train Sudanese border police and support the activities of the rapid support force, which is really the Janjaweed.  Ireland was rightly very strong in condemning the killings and rapes in Sudan some months ago but that violence is being carried out by forces whose training was funded by the EU.  The trust fund has also been misused in Eritrea and Niger.  All that has led to there being more deaths among migrants crossing the Sahara than among those seeking to traverse the Mediterranean.  Does Ireland have a legal obligation to contribute to the EU Trust Fund for Africa?</p></speech>

I am not sure of the direct answer to that question and whether that comes out of EU central funds we contribute to or whether it is opt-in funding from a trust fund.  I will check that and come back to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The EU needs to spend money in its neighbourhood to support fragile governments.  In some cases, it needs to support the training of police officers and military personnel.  For example, a number of Irish military personnel have been in Mali on a training mission for a number of years.  We are doing that in partnership with the UK and it is the one such peacekeeping operation we are carrying out in partnership with the UK.  I was there when I was Minister for Defence.  That mission is hugely appreciated and necessary in introducing sophisticated training capacity around demining, civilian protection and so on.  To paint EU funding of security training as a bad thing in all circumstances is wrong.  While we need transparency in how the money is spent and the results of same, we cannot solely focus on civilian engagement.  There also has to be EU support for state actors if they are trying to bring stability to fragile states.</p></speech>

Direct provision is a system for accommodating those who are seeking asylum and it is now 20 years old.  In general terms, it seeks to provide protection for those who are fleeing either political or religious persecution.  It is an outdated system and needs to change.  It was originally introduced in 1999 as a temporary emergency measure.  The system has had some modifications over the years, particularly following the McMahon report of 2016, but essentially the basic system remains. The McMahon report's terms of reference were to look at improving the existing system but it did not look at providing alternative systems for asylum seekers.  It looked at improving the speed at which their applications were processed and that was important for shortening their stays within the system.  However, many stay in direct provision for several years, even after they have been granted refugee status because they have not been integrated into the community and they cannot find independent housing.</p>  <p>  Ireland fulfils its obligations under international law by providing shelter, food, access to healthcare and education.  However, it has been criticised by human rights organisations on the basis that the direct provision system is degrading and dehumanising because it segregates asylum seekers into institutional care and does not integrate them into the community.  The demands on direct provision are increasing again, with more than 6,000 people in the system, including 1,700 children.  They are a vulnerable group of people who have to spend a prolonged period of time within direct provision.  There are 39 direct provision centres and almost every county has a centre.  Due to increased demand, asylum seekers are now placed in temporary emergency accommodation, even outside the direct provision institutions.</p>  <p>  In Clare, we have two centres, in Knockalisheen and Lisdoonvarna, and we are aware of the situation in Oughterard in Galway, which has been controversial over the past week or so.  The choice of a site now follows a familiar pattern.  There is an expression of interest, the locations are assessed, rumours circulate, fear of the unknown dominates discourse, protests opposing the location of a centre are held, tensions run high and people take up entrenched positions.  There is a lack of engagement with the community and a lack of assurances that communities will not be disadvantaged by having a centre close by.  There is a failure to assure that adequate supports will be put in place to provide adequate health, education, social inclusion and transport services.  Fear of the unknown drives anxiety.  Is direct provision a failed model and does the Government have anything to offer to provide new models of care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900015#N00300"><p>There has been much comment in recent weeks and years about the system of direct provision.  There has also been debate about the location of centres.  I appeal to everyone to ensure this debate is thoughtful, respectful and factual, just as the Deputy's contribution was.  Under EU and international law, Ireland, like other countries, is obliged to examine the claim of any person who comes here and claims international protection or asylum under defined grounds, such as a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership of or participation in any particular social group or social activities.  While that claim is being examined, the State is legally obliged to offer accommodation and related services to anyone without means, including all meals, medical care and utilities.  A weekly personal allowance is paid to each person in a centre and exceptional needs are covered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There is no obligation on any asylum seeker to accept the offer of accommodation and no restriction on their freedom of movement throughout the State.</p>  <p>  I understand concerns have been raised by people in Oughterard.  This is the latest such case as other communities have also raised concerns.  Local communities have genuine questions.  Where centres have opened in new locations, the Department has engaged with communities, addressed questions and supported communities in establishing links to new centres.  I know people are unhappy that there are rumours, on the one hand, and a lack of information, on the other hand, in many cases but until the legal process is complete, the Department of Justice and Equality is somewhat restricted in what it can say.  This has caused a lot of problems.</p>  <p>  Direct provision was introduced 20 years ago, as the Deputy said, to deal with a situation where asylum seekers were effectively homeless.  Any credible alternative put forward must be capable of providing immediate access to food, shelter and medical care to vulnerable people, as the direct provision model does.  Since its inception, more than 60,000 people have been helped by the direct provision system.  There are positive relationships between residents and local communities in areas where centres are already open in the State, including through friends of the centre groups, which promote integration between communities.  That being said, direct provision is not ideal but we have to be honest too.  People who advocate simply doing away with direct provision also have an obligation to outline what we should replace it with.  We have a shortage of housing in the areas of social housing, affordable housing and rental accommodation.  We will fix that and I am glad to say that supply in all of those categories is increasing rapidly.  We also have significant increases in the number of people claiming asylum in Ireland and we need to ensure we can protect them and offer them shelter and support.  Although we need to ensure standards across all the direct provision centres are sufficient, consistent and above a certain threshold, for now direct provision is the way to do this.  However, we need to be open to change and to adapting that model to improve it in time.</p></speech>

One of the alternative systems is that, rather than having 120 or 220 people in one building, they would be dispersed throughout a community.  Many of these centres are located in rural Ireland.  One thing rural Ireland has is housing stock.  What it does not have is people.  Those people could be dispersed among communities and there is huge support for asylum seekers when they come to a community.  Lisdoonvarna is a case in point.  It was a controversial site in spring of last year and the community has embraced the asylum seekers who arrived in the town.  Voluntary groups come together to support them but they are still congregated in one location, usually in a hotel or hostel that is no longer used.</p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality needs to look at a new model of dispersing people throughout a community, whereby, rather than allowing them to be congregated, they are integrated into a community.  That is the direction in which the Government should go, which would counter what has happened recently with the protests in Oughterard.  The community there was not informed or given assurances that they would have the necessary supports to look after such a large group of people coming into a relatively small community.  However, if they were dispersed throughout the county or throughout an area, I do not think there would be the same level of opposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900016#O00200"><p>That is a fair point, and the truth is that the Government operates both models.  We have 38 or 39 direct provision centres across 18 counties.  Many other countries do not have that, but instead put nearly all their asylum applicants into one or two very large national centres.  We are trying to ensure integration across the country and that towns, which are sometimes small, have direct provision centres as well.  Irish integration has been quite good, considering the pressures that exist in that area.</p>  <p>  We also accommodate refugees whose asylum status is already settled when they come to Ireland, although it is often done quietly.  They are normally accommodated in private rental accommodation, in long-term leasing arrangements that ensure they are integrated and dispersed among communities.  It is a good model.  However, if we were to assign a percentage of social housing for asylum seekers or refugees, it could create a danger of resentment from people on housing lists.  We need to be careful in how we manage this, but Ireland, by and large, has been quite good at integration, which has been noted in international commentary as well. </p></speech>

The housing crisis is continuing, and giving more discretion to local authorities in how they manage their projects would assist in solving that crisis.  A commitment was given last year that that discretion would be increased and the limit would be increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  That limit can be increased with full transparency and oversight if there is a willingness to give local authorities that power.  I see the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, gearing up to respond.  Does he have any additional response to that which he gave the housing committee yesterday?</p></speech>

What I told his colleague at yesterday's committee meeting was that a commitment was made last year to review the public spending code, in order to see if we could increase the threshold from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  Doing that would require a derogation to the public spending code, which would have to come from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Upon review of what doing that would actually mean, I met with the county and city managers this morning to talk about housing delivery for this year.  We will deliver 10,000 new homes into the social housing stock this year, which is a huge improvement on previous years.  Increasing the threshold might save six to eight weeks on our timelines, but we would also risk delaying projects even longer, and in doing so, the Department would lose oversight of 44% of the capital budget for housing.  That is too much of a risk.  We want to make sure that we are properly overseeing capital spending on behalf of taxpayers.  I said yesterday that it would be reckless to lose oversight of more than 44% of the housing budget, and that is why the plan is currently not proceeding.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of insurance premiums, and the fact that certain sectors in Irish society, particularly the leisure, bouncy castle and paintballing sectors, cannot get insurance anywhere in Ireland or even in Britain, and are now closing down one by one.  Two adventure centres have closed down in Meath, as has a swimming pool in Kildare, a nightclub in Cork, and some bouncy castle operators.  Such businesses are closing down day in, day out, and these are only the ones hitting the headlines.  Companies are closing every single day as a result of hikes in insurance premiums or because no insurance company in Ireland or in Britain is willing to insure them.  The Government needs to get a grip on this, and should meet urgently with Insurance Ireland for some straight, tough talking.</p>  <p>  We cannot allow these jobs to go.  We cannot allow the tourism product that we and these companies have built up over many decades to be wiped out as a result of an industry that is unwilling to quote them, or that will quote them four times what they were quoted last year.  This is a crisis that affects the very fabric of Irish society.  As I said to the Minister at a committee last week, unless this is dealt with it is possible that a child will never experience a bouncy castle on the island of Ireland ever again, because no company in Ireland or in Britain is willing to insure bouncy castle operators.  That is just one example.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and his Government take action on this and hold urgent meetings with Insurance Ireland in order to give some succour to companies at their wits' end?  They know their policies run out in November, December, or January, and when that happens, they will be out of their jobs and their companies will have to fold.</p></speech>

I have met a number of those companies, particularly in relation to child activity centres which cater for children's birthday parties and so on.  In one of those categories within the sector, the only insurance company I am aware of that is quoting at all is based in the UK.  This is an issue.  We had a long discussion about this at a Cabinet subcommittee meeting recently and all I can say for now is that the Government is looking at this closely to see what more can be done.  We are somewhat limited in what is possible without changing the Constitution in some areas, however, there are some things we can do, and I expect the Government will come forward with some new thinking in this are in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

However, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, there are deeper issues within the Defence Forces, including pay allowances and conditions, which require urgent focus.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has agreed in principle to accept the Permanent Defence Forces Representative Organisation, PDFORRA, which is the representative body of active service personnel, as a member.  That is the right decision.  It is something the Labour Party has argued for in government in the past, and we passed a motion supporting this in the previous D&aacute;il.  This would bring Ireland into line with Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Nordic countries, where their armed forces have the right to be involved in their national trade union movement.  This is not a right to strike, and we can deal with that issue if it is a concern.  PDFORRA is not asking for that right, which we can deal with by way of legislation.  This is about putting in place a professional process for the determination not only of core pay, but of all the ancillary issues that normal discussions in a trade union setting provide for, such as contracts and so on.  Will the Government approve the affiliation of PDFORRA to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as has been requested?</p></speech>

There are some real concerns about this, which we should not dodge.  I am a former Minister for Defence, and while we have to ensure appropriate representation for Defence Forces members, we also have to recognise that the Defence Forces, like the Garda in many ways, are in a different category from other public servants.  The State needs to know that it can rely on them in all circumstances.  The Chief of staff has expressed some legitimate concerns about this, so we have to work through them to make sure the decisions made in this area are right for both Defence Forces personnel and the State.</p><p>I expect the Minister of State at the Department of Defence will be able to come forward shortly to give a detailed commentary and decision on this issue.

A decision in this regard was deferred last March.  The T&aacute;naiste will probably not comment on the budget and is not privy to the finer details.  Supplements and vitamins currently attract a zero rate of VAT.  If the 23% rate is applied to them, this will place an unfair financial burden on many people who use them.  The VAT rate on fast food is 13.5% but the Government wants to apply a rate of 23% to vitamins and supplements that are good for us.  This does not make sense.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will comment on the matter.  Will he ask the Minister for Finance not to apply this rate of VAT to vitamins and supplements?</p></speech>

The Department is not intervening, Bus &Eacute;ireann has stood back and parents and children are suffering.  Enniskeane national school is the feeder school for the secondary schools in Bandon.  Up to 20 children attending these schools from the greater Ballineen area have been refused school transport to Bandon, making it a nightmare situation for their parents who have to work each day.  I have made some inquiries and one does not have to be a rocket scientist to solve this problem.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to immediately work with the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, to push through a solution for the families of these children in the Ballineen area.</p></speech>

The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine how best to improve integrated services in the rural bus network for the regions, including school transport.  I was very encouraged to hear that an additional &euro;1 million in funding was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, in mid-August in order to address the issues within the school transport system.  Although very little detail was released, I was hopeful that the Minister would focus on children who had used school transport on a concessionary basis but who have been left without transport this year.  I wrote to the Minister in August to highlight two very problematic school transport issues in my parish in south Kilkenny that require urgent attention.  One of the issues concerns a secondary school and affects 13 children, while the other, which relates to a private school, affects 11 children.  Unfortunately, the situation remains the same for these young families whose children do not have access to school transport despite indications that a solution would be found.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the &euro;1 million has been spent and outline the criteria for the allocation of it?  Will the he indicate if any of the money is left to cover problems such as those I have mentioned in Carlow and Kilkenny?  I have been reliably told that a small amount of money would sort out the concessionary tickets for those children who have been left on the side of the road.  I am told that another &euro;1 million would do it.</p></speech>

What plans are in place to address this debacle?  The school transport system is a debacle.  Across west Cork, some students got tickets who were not allowed on the bus, some students who should have got tickets did not, and we have many cases of students who qualified for tickets and yet their siblings did not.  Some students have places on buses, while their parents are behind those buses driving their siblings to school by car.  The situation is ridiculous.  Plans must be put in place for next year, but I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the situation in Ballineen needs to be resolved in the meantime.</p></speech>

The problem is, however, that there are other people in my constituency who could not avail of these exceptions.  Their applications had failed last year and they did not know they should apply for the exception.  I have discussed this matter quite a lot with Deputies Michael Collins, Murphy O'Mahony and Aylward, and it has been raised previously in the D&aacute;il.  Other areas have had all sorts of problems with school transport but they did not get exceptions this year.  The Government would not have a leg to stand on if this matter were brought to the Ombudsman.  The rules were bent for some, correctly, but while the rules were changed and money was allocated for certain students, this was not done for others.  Those who failed in their applications last year, including some in my constituency, did not get the opportunity to come back this year because they did not know the rules would be changed this year.  The Department is operating on a completely <i>ad hoc</i>basis and the Government would not have a leg to stand on if all the people we represent were to go to the Ombudsman in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the case in west Cork.  Senator Lombard and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, are both working on the same cases probably that the Deputies are working on.  Temporary alleviation measures have been put in place to try to deal with specific problems in different parts of the country.  Clearly, a more comprehensive response is needed for next year.  The Minister and his Department are continuing to try to deal with individual issues and problems in different parts of the country in response to demand.  The Deputies will have to put down a question to the Minister for a more comprehensive response.</p></speech>

If passed, the Bill would introduce graduated speeding penalties.  The law, however, is only as good as the level of enforcement relating to it.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that a private consortium, GoSafe, was awarded a five-year contract, reported to be worth up to &euro;115 million, to operate speed cameras.  GoSafe is facing notice of industrial action by the end of this week in a row about pay and conditions.  Drivers have revealed that they routinely work nine to 11-hour shifts, most of which are spent in their vans without access to toilet facilities or a proper place to eat lunch.  GoSafe has refused to implement a Labour Court recommendation which confirmed that SIPTU representatives have the sole right to negotiate with management on behalf of its members.  Will the Government introduce a legal requirement in public procurement to oblige all contracted private sector contractors to fully engage with trade unions and the industrial relations apparatus of the State?</p></speech>

This is also one of the principal platforms of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I draw the T&aacute;naiste's attention to the situation of doctors from outside Ireland who try to get registration to work as general practitioners here.  Responsibility in that regard lies with the national doctor training programme in conjunction with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  It is my understanding that the latter does not have a problem but that the difficulty and the red tape relating to obtaining registration for doctors coming into Ireland to work are a disincentive for them.  We are fortunate that we have an arrangement with Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand for bringing in their qualified GPs.  As a result of their circumstances, however, doctors from South Africa are the only ones who seem to want to come to work in Ireland.  The Government is well aware that the State is short of at least 500 GPs.  Everything should be done to promote and incentivise to try to attract GPs into the country, particularly from South Africa.  A few weekends ago, the out-of-hours service in Tralee, County Kerry, had no GP for the entire weekend.  People then had to go the accident and emergency department, which is an already stressed service.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please discuss this issue with his colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to try to make it as easy as possible for such doctors, while at all times adhering to the necessary qualifications criteria.</p></speech>

Clearly, not all Departments and Government offices share the same confidence as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, that the continued use of the public services card beyond the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is legal.</p><p>We need clarity on this issue, particularly as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is still requiring applicants for the new national childcare scheme to have a card.  We understand that the Department is examining alternatives, but as it is stated on its website that a hard copy of the public services card application form will not be available until January, which is a number of months after the scheme goes live, parents need clarity on whether they can submit an application under the new national childcare scheme if they do not have a public services card.  </p> <p> It is clear the T&aacute;naiste does not have faith in the legality of the continued use of the public services card given its removal as a requirement in respect of a passport application.  Will other Departments also withdraw the requirement for a public services card in respect of citizens' access to services?</p></speech>

The Government is at one on this.  We had a long conversation on it and had the legal position outlined to us by the Attorney General.  In his view, and that of the Government, the legislation introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il is good and allows for the public services card to be used across multiple agencies and Departments.  The purpose of the card is to make it easier for citizens to access public services, including in respect of first-time applications for a passport.  To address the confusion in the public mind arising from commentary in relation to the public services card, we have introduced a facility to enable persons who do not have a public services card to obtain a passport.  We will not preclude people from getting a passport if they do not have a public services card but we have streamlined a process using the public services card which is the best way to get a passport quickly and the most reliable way in terms of the security and identity requirements.  If there are exceptional circumstances, we will accommodate them.  There is no great mystery about this.  It does not in any way undermine the Government's position on this issue, which is rock solid and, if legally tested, will be strongly defended.</p></speech>

It was recently highlighted that 44% of general practitioner, GP, clinics are full, with rural areas being worst hit.  In County Laois, 100% of GPs have stated that they cannot take on new patients and in County Offaly only 20% of GPs are in a position to take on new patients.  The lack of GPs has reached crisis point in some regions.  I have been contacted by many concerned constituents in Laois and Offaly on this issue.  What actions will the Government and the Minister for Health collectively take to resolve this crisis, which is particularly pertinent and obvious in rural areas?</p>  <p>  Also, will a stakeholder forum be convened in an attempt to resolve this ongoing crisis, which is worsening by the day?</p></speech>

I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, via the Department of Defence, is sending a naval vessel to New York and, perhaps, other cities to engage with UN officials.  What is the purpose of this operation?  For example, is it to wine and dine officials or will serious business be conducted?  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware this is happening against the backdrop of docked naval vessels and difficulties around meeting service level agreements and the considerable costs being incurred by his Department in regard to securing a seat on the UN Security Council, which issue has been raised many times by my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins.  In light of the aforementioned difficulties and the current recruitment and retention crisis, will the T&aacute;naiste explain the purpose of the deployment of this naval vessel?</p></speech>

It is important to say that the role of the Naval Service is not solely one of fisheries protection or intercepting drugs and so on.  While both operations are an important part of what it does, it has a broader remit, as seen in the Mediterranean Sea and will be seen next week when it will play an ambassadorial role not only in terms of the UN Security Council campaign - it is only one element of what the service is doing - but in reaching out to the Irish diaspora in large cities on the east coast.  This is not new.  Naval vessels have been sent abroad with a diplomatic role many times in the past.  I appeal to people not to try to make this into something that it is not.</p>  <p>  We are also trying to recruit people into the Naval Service.  People need to see the broad spectrum of roles and responsibilities that Naval Service personnel play, which will be very evident abroad next week.</p></speech>

In May, in conjunction with the local and European elections, the people of Limerick voted in a plebiscite to accept the principle and concept of a directly elected mayor.  I raised the following issue with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, last July by way of parliamentary question.  What is the status of the legislation for the roll-out of the directly elected mayor?  The Minister indicated to me in a written reply last July that he proposed to establish an implementation committee in early September.  What is the status of that committee and what is the proposed membership of same?  I believe its membership should be as broad as possible to include as many voices in Limerick as possible in light of the huge civil society campaign and buy-in to the principle of a directly elected mayor, which I support.  It is great for democracy.  In the context of the discussion we had earlier on promoting oversight of our local authorities, this will be a very positive oversight mechanism.</p>  <p>  The principle of a directly elected mayor has been knocking around in the now Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for nearly 15 years.  I would welcome an update on the status of the legislation for the Limerick directly elected mayor and the implementation committee.  Also, is it still the Minister's intention to hold the election for the position in May or June 2021, as indicated to me previously?</p></speech>

This was a fantastic decision made by the people of Limerick.  To give credit where credit is due, Deputy Niall Collins did a great job, working with other parties and people, to get it over the line.  It is a pity other members of his party did not take a similar view in places like Cork.  However, that has been decided now.</p>  <p>  I met the outgoing council manager in Limerick to talk through what needs to be done in terms of implementation.  I also attended a public meeting organised by Senator Maria Byrne to discuss some of the issues that still need to be resolved.  We are in the process of putting together the implementation group.  Some people have been identified and approached.  As stated by the Deputy, it is important there is a wide spectrum of representation, including people who have experience of being in local government working on the corporate side but also in terms of accessing services.  All of these matters need to be addressed in the implementation group.</p>  <p>  In terms of the timelines and legislation, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, will be the lead in taking the legislation through the relevant processes.  We believe we can get this done.  On the timeline, it is important the legislation for the first directly elected mayor of Limerick is in place for the next local elections to ensure that election can take place in tandem with the local elections.  We will have an announcement on the implementation group very shortly.</p></speech>

In County Louth, the N52 Ardee bypass was earmarked for funding by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Local communities, which have grown in recent years and will be seriously and adversely impacted by the realignment project, have called for the original scheme to be modified.  Following on from considerable campaigning with Louth County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I welcome that a technical review of the scheme and the junction arrangements linked to the N52 bypass has been agreed.  The review is to allow the project team time to consider the issues fully, which include a national heritage area and the growth of the local community.</p><p>However, we have been told that the funding for this may be redirected to other projects, which would be a grievous mistake.  This funding should be legally guaranteed.  Ardee needs this bypass.  It has been in the pipeline for more than 13 years so will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment or ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to give a commitment that money set aside will be ring fenced until the review is completed?  We are talking about 13 years.  If the money is not there, it will be put back for another five to ten years.</p></speech>

In the past 12 months, the number of electric vehicles has doubled.  The function of the ESB's ecars programme, which was introduced in 2010, is to hasten the introduction of 1 million electric vehicles and to move transport away from the dirt, poison and pollution of hydrocarbon fuels to lovely green-fuelled transportation as quickly as possible.  Since 2010, the Government has apparently given &euro;37 million to the ESB to install these electric charge points.  We have 1,200 charge points, some of which are standard and some of which are quick.  If I divide &euro;37 million by 1,200, it means that each one of these charge points will cost &euro;30,000.  There is no way anyone can expect to pay &euro;30,000 for an electric charge point.  It is just a pole with an ESB connection.</p>  <p>  We are looking for value for money.  I was lucky enough to get the loan of an electric car last weekend that I drove around Dublin.  It was fantastic but I had a problem finding a charge point and a quick one to get me back home to Dundalk instead of sitting in a car park in Dublin for nine hours.  I have spoken to many owners of these electric cars.  The problem they face is that they have a 50-50 chance of finding a charge point and 50-50 chance of finding one where they need it.  I am 100% behind electric cars but we must put a plan in place.  Charging &euro;30,000 for one charge point is not value for money.</p></speech>

The technology permits that and that technology will continue to improve.  However, there is a problem regarding having sufficient numbers of charge points and sufficient numbers of fast charge points, particularly for people driving on motorways.  The situation is improving and I think the Deputy will see a significant increase in the pace of roll-out of charge points across the country in the coming years.</p></speech>

This Bill will put in place the necessary legislative underpinning to allow Ireland ratify this historic treaty.</p>  <p>  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the outcome of a two-year process led by states and civil society concerned by the increasing risks and catastrophic consequences of a nuclear weapons explosion as well as by the lack of progress made by the nuclear weapons states on the disarmament provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT.  The treaty was opened for signature at the United Nations in New York on 20 September 2017.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland on the first day it opened for signature.  As of today, the treaty has received 70 signatures, including 26 ratifications.  The TPNW requires 50 ratifications to enter into force.  I hope that the passage of this legislation will allow Ireland to be among those early ratifiers.</p>  <p>  Ireland is closely associated with this treaty.  Ireland took a leading role in the process that led to the adoption of the TPNW and was a member the core group of states made up of Ireland, Austria, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa which brought forward the resolution giving the UN conference its negotiating mandate.</p><p>I am very proud of the contribution made by Ireland in this regard.  The contribution of this treaty to global peace and security was recognised most prominently through the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 to the International Campaign against Nuclear Weapons, ICAN, an umbrella civil society advocacy group which has long been a close partner for Ireland.  ICAN spent more than a decade advocating for a humanitarian perspective to be considered regarding nuclear weapons and that aspiration was finally realised with the TPNW.  I am further pleased that the specific work of the Irish delegation and our core group partner countries was recognised by the 2018 Arms Control Person of the Year Award for our work in leading the TPNW negotiations.<br/><br/>This new treaty provides for states to fulfil their disarmament obligations under the non-proliferation treaty, Article VI, and affirm their commitment to achieving a world free from nuclear weapons.  The TPNW plugs a legal gap by prohibiting the last form of weapon of mass destruction which had not yet been explicitly outlawed.  Deputies from across the House share my deep concern about the immense human suffering and environmental degradation which would arise from the detonation of a nuclear weapon, whether by accident, miscalculation or design, anywhere on the planet.  The only guarantee of protections from nuclear weapons use is their complete elimination.  The ratification of the TPNW is an important step towards the realisation of this important objective.<br/><br/>The issue of nuclear disarmament is one which has traditionally enjoyed support from across the political spectrum in Ireland, and I would like to remind Deputies of the deep-rooted legacy of engagement Ireland has had on nuclear disarmament.  Nuclear disarmament became a priority foreign policy objective shortly after we joined the United Nations more than 60 years ago.  Ireland played a leading role in the origins of the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament regime, namely, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, which entered into force in 1970.  In 1958, the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Frank Aiken, introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the UN.  These Irish resolutions ultimately led to the adoption of the NPT in 1968.  I would like to recall the words spoken by the then Minister, Frank Aiken, at the 22nd UN General Assembly first committee meeting on 6 May 1968, which adopted the NPT.  His words are as relevant to this treaty, and at this time, as they were then.  He stated that the NPT, for all states large and small, was, he believed, an infinitely more effective shield against a nuclear holocaust, than the most costly armoury of offensive and defensive equipment. <br/><br/>The same commitment to multilateralism that drove Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s informed the Irish approach to the historic TPNW negotiations in 2017.  The outcome of the TPNW negotiations goes to the very heart of our belief in a rules-based international world order.  We live in challenging times, when many of the agreements we have worked hard to collectively reach are unravelling or are being undermined.  The Doomsday Clock, updated each year since 1947 by the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, is now at two minutes to midnight.  That is the closest it has ever been to apocalypse.  The prospect of a new arms race is very real.  There has been a worrying decrease in the taboo around the threat of the use of these weapons of mass destruction.  There is also vast investment in so-called &quot;modernisation&quot;, with talk of more strategic, targeted and usable nuclear weapons and increased reliance on these weapons in security doctrines.  Of deep concern, and one of the most dangerous ideas in the current discourse, is the notion that any nuclear weapon could ever be used again, even in some sort of controlled way.  This idea is completely unacceptable.  As the most powerful and most indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction ever invented, nuclear weapons should have no place in the security doctrine of any state and their very existence threatens us all.<br/><br/>I do not need to recall for anyone the horror visited upon the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who suffered the devastating effects of the only occasions when nuclear weapons have been used in war.  Furthermore, people - often marginalised or vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples - and the planet continue to suffer today the enduring aftermaths of thousands of nuclear tests that occurred in the second half of the 20th century.  Knowing what we know now about the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear explosion and the sheer impossibility of any adequate humanitarian response, we must reject the very notion that they can ever be used again under any circumstances.  Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev had the insight to agree, even at the height of the Cold War, that &quot;a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought'.  It was true then, and it remains true and even more relevant now.<br/><br/>In a context of global mistrust and a deeply challenging security environment, it is ever more necessary to call on enduring principles.  Ireland believes that multilateralism is the key to solving the global challenges we face.  We will hold firm in our belief that the equilibrium of the world order cannot be held in place, and is not currently held in place, by either threat or fear.  It is quite the reverse.  A permanent peace can only ever be attained through respect for the rule of law based on justice.  We are consistently told by large states with nuclear weapons that nuclear disarmament is a challenge for them.  It is an equally important responsibility under the NPT, now re-enforced under the TPNW, however, for small states with no nuclear weapons and this is a responsibility Ireland will continue to discharge in full.<br/><br/>The significance of the TPNW is that the first time the core objective of the prohibition of nuclear weapons will be clearly and unambiguously prohibited.  This will address the current legal gap.  Together with our partners, we will use every opportunity to reiterate that these weapons are inhumane, indiscriminate and beyond any possible legal use.  Our focus will be on the weapon and not on the actor.  As former the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, puts it, &quot;there are no right hands for these wrong weapons&quot;.  For as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are all under existential threat.<br/><br/>The TPNW is very much the child of the multilateralism approach.  It was built on a framework developed over 50 years and in particular the non-proliferation treaty.  The NPT remains the cornerstone of the multilateral nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  It is composed of three pillars: nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Its overriding purpose was to work towards complete nuclear disarmament by capping the number of nuclear weapons states and introducing a legally-binding obligation on those states to disarm.  The drafters of the NPT knew that this document would need to be built on over time and over the last 50 years the international community has built a variety of supporting frameworks and regimes around the treaty to bolster its provisions.  These supporting frameworks are already in place for the non-proliferation pillar through multiple export control regimes and for the peaceful uses pillar, mainly in the form of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.  The NPT also led to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and the global norm against nuclear testing.<br/><br/>Despite all these notable milestones, however, there is one pillar where progress on the implementation of the NPT has fallen short.  That is the nuclear disarmament pillar.  Unlike the other pillars, there are very few supporting regimes for the disarmament provisions.  Attempts to strengthen the disarmament provisions have traditionally been fiercely resisted, in particular by the nuclear weapons states.  For example, commitments made in the NPT action plans from 2000 and 2010 remain unfulfilled and their status called into question.  Some 22 years after being opened for signature the CTBT has yet to enter into force.<br/><br/>We are, unfortunately, now living at time when progress on nuclear disarmament is urgently needed.  While the nuclear weapons states have formally accepted their disarmament obligations, they continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals at the same time.  Even more worryingly, the norm against the threat of the use of nuclear weapons has been seriously eroded in recent times.  Consideration even seems to be given by some states in the international community for the use of nuclear weapons other than as a deterrent.  In this regard, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons gives the NPT some much-needed impetus on disarmament.  It is the first new legal multilateral instrument on nuclear disarmament to be adopted in more than 20 years.  It is a success story.  That is not only because of its ground-breaking content but also because of what it entails in moving toward the fulfilment of the NPT's disarmament provisions.</p><p>It gives back agency to non-nuclear weapon states such as Ireland with respect to nuclear disarmament and it addresses the urgent need to make progress.</p> <p> The treaty establishes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on nuclear weapons activities.  These include undertakings not to develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use weapons.  The TPNW also prohibits the stationing, installation or deployment of nuclear weapons on national territory.  In addition to these core prohibitions that implement the disarmament pillar of the NPT, the TPNW makes its own contributions to the multilateral disarmament regime through a number of ground-breaking provisions.  The treaty obliges states parties to assist survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use in areas under their jurisdiction, and to undertake necessary environmental remediation in areas under their control.</p> <p> The treaty is the first international legal instrument to recognise the disproportionate impact on the health of women and girls of ionising radiation from nuclear weapons use.  The treaty also promotes the equal participation in the treaty's work by women and men and includes a provision on disarmament education.  Ireland was a strong advocate for these provisions during the treaty negotiations, in line with our consistent support for gender mainstreaming in disarmament negotiations and policies.  Ireland's engagement with the treaty negotiations also reflected our principled position on humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, respect for human rights and the promotion of civil society voices.</p> <p> I am happy to acknowledge that the TPNW is reflective of the breadth of participation in the negotiations.  States large and small from all parts of the world were able to participate.  Civil society and academia were very valuable contributors.  Most importantly, the drafting process benefited from hearing crucial testimony from survivors of nuclear weapons testing and use.  The result of these views and experiences is an inclusive and innovative treaty, which acknowledges that we all have a stake in achieving nuclear disarmament.</p> <p> The treaty is not without its detractors.  While a large majority of UN member states voted in its favour, the nuclear weapons states and many of their military allies chose not to participate in the negotiations.  This was regrettable and Ireland consistently called on them to join the negotiations and participate in good faith.  Ireland does not agree with their view that nuclear disarmament must wait until an ideal security environment is reached.  Rather, the opposite is true; the retention of nuclear weapons, and, in particular, the threat of a renewed arms race is itself a driver of insecurity and risk, while nuclear disarmament is an enabler of an improved security environment.</p> <p> Despite this opposition from some quarters, the TPNW represents the best hope in decades for multilateral progress on nuclear disarmament, an issue more pressing than ever.  The TPNW provides a framework for disarmament, and by stigmatising and delegitimising nuclear weapons it may strengthen calls for disarmament in those countries that possess nuclear weapons.  I am also aware of national debates being undertaken in some other neutral states and I hope Ireland can provide leadership and influence through our own ratification.</p> <p> As well as including some innovative elements, the core of the treaty follows the model of other similar weapons prohibitions.  With this in mind, the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 is likewise modelled on similar Irish legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure Ireland will be in a position to meet all its obligations as a state party to the treaty.  The requirement for states to adopt national measures to implement the treaty is set out in Article 5.1 and Article 5.2 of the TPNW.  The Bill represents Ireland's national measures under the treaty and was developed in consultation with other Departments.</p> <p> Section 1 of the Bill defines certain terms for the purposes of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 create the offences.  Section 2 creates criminal offences for specified nuclear weapon activities.  It makes it an offence for a person to develop, produce, manufacture, acquire, possess, transfer or receive the transfer of a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device.  It also makes it an offence to station, install or deploy a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device, or to use or threaten to use them.  In addition, section 2 provides that a person who assists, encourages or induces the commission of an offence shall also be guilty of an offence and that a person who seeks or receives assistance to commit an offence shall be guilty of an offence.</p> <p> Section 3 provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of acts committed outside the Slate in specified circumstances.  These circumstances include the commission of an offence on board an Irish ship, on board an aircraft registered in the State, or where the person is member of the Defence Forces.  Section 4 provides for penalties for the commission of offences under sections 2 and 3.  A person who is found guilty of an offence will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine, imprisonment for life or such a lesser term as the court may determine, or both.  Section 5 applies the rule against double jeopardy and is a standard clause.  Section 6 clarifies offences as they relate to bodies corporate.  Section 7 sets out the short title of the Bill and contains a commencement clause.</p> <p> Ireland's ratification of the treaty would be consistent with our long-standing foreign policy priority on nuclear disarmament and our position as a key proponent of multilateral nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Achieving a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons is a long-standing priority of the Irish people, who take pride in our historic role and who ask us to continue to live up to our great legacy in this field.  I ask all Members of the House to support the Bill in the best interests of disarmament, global security and humanity.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities relating to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long history in working towards the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons and Fianna F&aacute;il is proud of our country's efforts in this regard.  In 1958, led by the then Minister, Frank Aiken, Ireland introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the UN, which eventually led to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, which has become the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament.  The NPT is the most widely recognised agreement relating to nuclear disarmament and arms control among 189 states parties.  Since then, Ireland has continued to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons, recognising the security, humanitarian and gendered threat that they pose.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, nuclear weapons continue to pose a serious threat to society and the environment.  The recent decision of the United States administration to terminate the long-standing Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and the Administration's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal last year are a cause of grave concern.  In addition, Iran's subsequent breaching of the nuclear deal and limits on uranium stockpiles underscores increased tension between nuclear possessing states and the need for ongoing efforts to ban nuclear weapons.</p>  <p>  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the first multilateral treaty relating to nuclear disarmament to have been negotiated in 20 years and is one that Fianna F&aacute;il wholeheartedly supports.  Global disarmament is one of the UN's oldest goals.  The first resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in January 1946 called for control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes and the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons.</p>  <p>  In the 1950s, Frank Aiken, a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for External Affairs, led the charge at international level to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.  His efforts helped to bring about the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.  It grants the five nuclear-weapon states recognised by the NPT, namely, China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, the exclusive right to possess nuclear arsenals but simultaneously obliges them to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament.  Moreover, signatories commit to work on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.  Unfortunately, the aim of global nuclear disarmament, first declared in 1946 and reiterated since, has not been achieved.  Even though global stocks of nuclear weapons are at their lowest level in more than 50 years, there are still an estimated 15,400 nuclear weapons worldwide.</p><p>The overall number of nuclear weapons worldwide has decreased from a peak of 70,000 in the mid-1980s.  However, all states with nuclear weapons are currently investing vast sums in modernising their nuclear arsenals and delivery systems, raising fears of a new arms race.  Renata Dwan, the director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, indicated in May that all states with nuclear weapons have modernisation programmes under way and that the risk of nuclear weapons being used is at its highest since the Second World War.  This is deeply concerning and there needs to be a concerted effort to minimise the risk of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose.</p> <p> Deteriorating relationships between states that possess nuclear weapons, coupled with dangerous new capabilities and technologies is a cause of grave concern and must be addressed.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to seeking a safer world and the promotion of international stability.  To this end, we are committed to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  We would encourage nuclear armed states to reduce their arsenal and to simultaneously increase predictability and mutual confidence between armed states in order to reduce risk.  Fianna F&aacute;il also calls for greater transparency from states on the nuclear weapons they possess and the concrete measures they have taken in the field of nuclear disarmament.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes Ireland's efforts to highlight the gendered nature of the impacts of nuclear weapons.  Ireland has pushed for this to be seriously considered and has highlighted evidence that while the detonation of one or more nuclear weapons would cause massive death and injury to all, the evidence is clear that, over the longer term, of those who are exposed to ionising radiation from such a detonation, women and girls have a far higher risk of developing cancer than men or boys.  Ireland's efforts to give this humanitarian aspect of nuclear weapons is to be commended and one that Fianna F&aacute;il supports.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il supports the CTBT, which was adopted at the UN General Assembly in 1996.  While all EU member states have ratified the CTBT and are abiding by the obligations it lays down, we are concerned that the treaty is not yet in force.  We urge all states that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT without any preconditions or further delay.  The states that have not yet ratified the treaty are China, Egypt, Israel, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Iran and the United States.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il supports Ireland's membership of the New Agenda Coalition, a cross-regional group of states committed to promoting progress on nuclear disarmament.  Ireland played a central role in the coalition's formation in 1998 and remains committed to its objectives alongside fellow members Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa.  Ireland is also a member of the Conference on Disarmament and in August to September 2013 acted as president of the conference.</p> <p> We are happy to support the swift passage of the Bill.</p></speech>

I imagine that it will receive the unanimous support of this House and the Seanad.  The Bill will enable Ireland to become a state party to the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and will give effect to the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities relating to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.  As I said as Gaeilge, this is welcome and something every country should agree to.</p>  <p>  Nuclear weapons threaten the very existence of the human race and life on this planet.  People have become mobilised in recent times over concern for the very existence of life on the planet because of climate change.  The use of nuclear weapons in one day could bring that about much quicker than many people have contemplated for many years.   The effects of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are forgotten by some, hopefully not most.  Some people have a conspiracy theory about it.  In some ways, new generations have not fully seen the effects.  Those effects should be brought home to every schoolchild and every part of society.  Once a year, the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament holds a commemoration for those who died because of the use of nuclear weapons.  People need to be reminded of the full scale of devastation that nuclear weapons can bring about.  We need to create a world free from nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  Ireland must be a global leader in demilitarisation and disarmament, as it has been in the past.  In this debate we should commemorate and remember all the victims and survivors of nuclear weapons.  Two nuclear weapons have been used in war.  They were the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US military in 1945.  These two bombs killed 120,000 civilians and flattened both cities.  They have had a devastating effect on many generations since.  The bombs were deployed to kill as many civilians as possible.  This was a war crime and its effects are still felt today.</p><p>It should never have happened and the deployment of nuclear weapons should have ended there.  Regrettably the opposite happened.  Throughout the Cold War we saw a massive proliferation of nuclear weapons.  This was and remains an existential threat to humanity.  Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations.  This has created huge environmental damage which we do not fully appreciate or understand.  Maybe future generations will be able to calculate the full effect of that damage.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that in 2017 there were approximately 14,465 nuclear weapons in the world, 14,465 Hiroshimas.  Think of all those weapons going off at one time.  That is what a nuclear war would entail.  They all need to be destroyed and put beyond use.</p> <p> The cornerstone of international efforts to begin nuclear disarmament is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, known as the NPT.  This divided countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states.  The NPT provides for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons for countries without nuclear weapons and creates obligations on countries with nuclear weapons to negotiate an agreement leading to complete verifiable nuclear disarmament.  Ireland has been at the forefront of developments in relation to nuclear disarmament and it was one of the first signatories of the NPT.  This is worthy of remembrance and a proud moment in Irish history.</p> <p> However, the NPT also has significant weaknesses.  It allowed the USA, Britain, Russia, France, and China to keep their nuclear arsenals and cemented them as legitimate nuclear weapons holders.  No country should legitimately or legally be allowed to stock, develop or use nuclear weapons.  The NPT also failed to stop India, Pakistan, South Africa, Israel and North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.  South Africa thankfully destroyed its nuclear weapons arsenal when the apartheid regime was coming to an end.  Others should follow its lead.  Additionally, the NPT has been used and abused for political means.  Two nuclear states, the USA which has signed it, and Israel, which has not signed it and continues to lie and deny its nuclear weapons programme, forcibly stopped Iran's attempts to develop nuclear technology for civilian purposes, which is its right under international law.  Essentially Iran, a signatory of the NPT, was stopped from developing nuclear technology for civilian purposes by countries that have nuclear weapons and those who have refused to sign the NPT.</p> <p> The years of sanctions on Iran, despite it opening up its nuclear technology and nuclear sites to international investigation, has done significant damage to the NPT among countries which have signed and abided by it.  This is especially the case with the hypocrisy from Israel, the only nuclear armed state in the Middle East.  A deal was correctly done in 2015 to lift sanctions and allow Iran its right to develop nuclear technology for civilian purposes but the Trump Administration recklessly tore up this progressive and positive agreement under pressure from the Israeli Government.</p> <p> To date 70 countries have signed the new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and 26 states have ratified or acceded to it.  I hope Ireland will be the twenty-seventh because I cannot see anybody in these Houses objecting to it.  In order to come into effect, signature and ratification by at least 50 countries is required.  When he is wrapping up can the Minister of State say how many countries are going through the process now so that we will have some idea when we have ratified and acceded to it that there are another 23 who would quickly come in too and it would take full effect, having been ratified by 50?</p> <p> I welcome the fact that this Treaty provides for extensive prohibitions relating to the development, testing, producing, manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, stockpiling, transferring or receiving control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  The preamble of the Treaty sets out some of the general principles and policies.  It specifically acknowledges the disproportionate impact of nuclear weapons on women and girls.  This is very welcome and it builds on the increasing focus on how women and girls are disproportionately affect by conflict and the historic UN Security Council Resolution 1325.</p> <p> Article 1 of the treaty sets out a comprehensive list of prohibited activities in respect of nuclear weapons.  This includes prohibitions on activities relating to the development, production, use or threat of use, testing, transfer and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.  Article 4 sets out the disarmament requirements of nuclear weapon possessing States.</p> <p> I also want to draw attention to Article 6 which concerns victim assistance and environmental remediation.  Article 6(1) provides that state parties must provide victim assistance to individuals under their jurisdiction who have been affected by nuclear weapons use or testing.  Such assistance should include age and gender sensitive assistance and provide for the social and economic inclusion of victims.  Article 6(2) requires state parties to take remediation measures in respect of areas within their jurisdiction which have been contaminated by activities relating to nuclear weapons testing or use.  This is important considering the huge human suffering and environmental damage that the use and testing of nuclear weapons has created.</p> <p> Those articles are key to the environmental rehabilitation of the islands or nation states that have allowed the testing or that have been forced or bullied into that by the US in particular but also by China and Britain among other countries.  They are also key to an acknowledgement of and financial support for the victims and whole communities who have suffered the consequences, some of whom were moved off the islands to allow for destruction by these weapons.  Unlike the NPT, for nuclear armed states joining this treaty, they will have a time-bound framework for negotiations leading to the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme.</p> <p>  The treaty is therefore a well-written and important one in the fight for nuclear disarmament, but it has yet to get the international buy-in that it deserves and needs.  We hope that it will well exceed the minimum buy-in required.  It continues to be strongly opposed by countries that possess nuclear weapons.  Not only do they oppose the treaty, but they are modernising their nuclear arsenals and many Cold War bilateral treaties between the USA and Russia have been rubbished or are severely under threat.  The slow pace of developments within the NPT framework in relation to nuclear disarmament shows just how important this treaty is.</p> <p> In response to the treaty three of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the USA, Britain, and France, released a joint press statement in which they argue against this treaty and nuclear disarmament.  They said that in their opinion this treaty does not contribute to the development of international law.  That statement is contrary to the development of international law.  Unsurprisingly, all three of them have significant nuclear arsenals.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the UN system when all five permanent members of the UN Security Council have huge amounts of nuclear weapons.</p> <p> In conclusion, I again state my support for this treaty, for Ireland becoming a signatory and for this Bill to give effect to the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  While the treaty is not binding on states which are not a party to it and we have a long race to run until we reach full global nuclear disarmament, this treaty remains an important step in achieving nuclear disarmament.</p><p>In parallel with support for the treaty, the Government should stop its erosion of Irish neutrality and oppose the further militarisation of the EU.  It is not good enough to oppose nuclear weapons while we remain part of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, aligning ourselves to countries that have snubbed their noses at the achievement of nuclear disarmament.  We need to look into our own souls to see what steps we can take to prevent the further militarisation of Europe.  We cannot on the one hand chastise countries in Europe that stockpile and develop nuclear weapons while on the other hand join EU battle groups with those same countries and silently move towards creating a standing EU army with the very countries that hold dearly to the weapons of mass destruction that are nuclear weapons.</p></speech>

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, or the nuclear weapon ban treaty, is the first legally binding international agreement comprehensively to prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of leading towards their total elimination.</p><p>The treaty can work in parallel with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which has acted as a bulwark against mass nuclear weapon proliferation for nearly 50 years.  The latter treaty, however, is showing its age, and we need further impetus towards non-proliferation and, ultimately, full nuclear disarmament.  The hearing of the Bill is timely, given President Trump&rsquo;s recent decision to withdraw the US from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which has raised fears of a new arms race.  Previously faint memories of Cold War tensions return to our minds, in a new and increasingly volatile international picture.  The threat of nuclear conflict seems to be increasing as instability becomes the <i>de facto</i>nature of global security.  There is now a real and ever present danger of nuclear escalation, as exemplified by the recent Kashmir crisis between two of the world&rsquo;s largest nuclear powers, namely, India and Pakistan.  Likewise, ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East are a constant cause of concern, not only for the surrounding regions but for the entire world due to the potentially devastating consequences of a nuclear conflict.</p><p>In this context, Ireland&rsquo;s continued leadership in the prohibition of nuclear weapons is necessary and welcomed by the Labour Party.  Ireland is viewed internationally as a distinguished and credible advocate for nuclear disarmament and a supporter of non-proliferation.  During the Cold War, Ireland was a progressive voice in the international sphere for disarmament.  While superpowers stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals, and other states retained nuclear weapon programmes or continued to develop secret ones, Ireland worked in the multilateral forum of the United Nations to rid the world of this scourge.</p><p>Ireland has consistently punched above its weight on the nuclear issue.  Through Frank Aiken&rsquo;s Irish resolutions in the 1950s and 1960s, the formation of the New Agenda Coalition in 1998, to the skilled diplomacy of the Irish delegation that led to a reaffirmation of the Middle East resolution at the 2010 NPT review conference, Ireland has played a positive role.  It is an area where Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation remains strong and credible, and is proof that a small but independent, principled and neutral country can significantly advance the cause of humanity.  Ireland needs to remain a strong voice for international nuclear disarmament and a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation.  This means we must not only criticise rogue states for pursuing nuclear weapon programmes but we should ask difficult questions of our allies that drag their heels on nuclear disarmament.  In particular, I note the opposition of NATO members, which include the US and most of our EU partners, which have unwisely opposed the treaty.  Again, this highlights the necessity for Irish neutrality, which the Government has sought to undermine at every opportunity.</p><p>The State should never allow itself to be put in a position where it is pressurised, by way of membership of an intergovernmental military alliance, whether NATO or PESCO, to oppose nuclear proliferation.  We must also remain a strong advocate for rigorous inspection programmes of states that pursue nuclear power.  If a state has a peaceful nuclear programme, it needs to allow full-scale International Atomic Energy Agency inspections.  There should be no exceptions.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to condemn those countries that continue to oppose the treaty and once again to reassert our position of disarmament and non-proliferation.</p></speech>

As vice chairperson of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have had the opportunity to attend some of the Common Defence and Security Policy meetings in Europe.  There is no doubt that defence is a growing concern because of the increased worries or threats that certain countries face, and whether they are perceived or actual is another matter.  The Baltic countries, for example, fear their big neighbour wanting to take back what was once under their control.  Georgia has fears over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while there are fears for Ukraine and its difficulties.  There is conflict in many other parts of the world, such as in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and countries in Africa, while there are tensions with Iran and with North Korea.  Within that volatile mix there is the danger of certain countries having nuclear weapons.  I acknowledge that it is a clich&eacute; but it seems that more and more often attack is seen as the best form of defence.  It is a worrying time.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the majority of us seem to agree on the need for a world free from nuclear weapons.  In January 2019, Senator Norris and I endorsed the Basel Appeal on Disarmament and Sustainable Security, which was an open letter to world leaders in the US, Russia, China, the UK, France, as well as to parliamentary committees and the Secretary General of NATO.  In the letter, we quoted from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which highlighted the failure of world leaders to deal with the looming threat of nuclear war and the increasingly high risk of a nuclear exchange, whether by accident, miscalculation, conflict escalation or intent.  The letter welcomed the adoption by the UN of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons but expressed concern about the deteriorating security environment in Europe and internationally because of the erosion of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the US withdrawing from the joint comprehensive plan of action, the further development and modernisation of nuclear weapons, and what the letter's authors called provocative war games and nuclear threat postures.  The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was the historic agreement between the US and the Soviet Union, has unravelled.  The letter called on the Russian Duma and the US Congress to refuse to authorise or allocate funding for developing or deploying weapons that might violate the treaty.  There was also a call on NATO to reaffirm its opposition to any deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe.  The New START treaty, about which there are concerns that it may be undermined by current conflicts, is set to expire in February 2021 and there is a need to expand it further into the 2020s.</p>  <p>  There is always a danger of nuclear weapons being used by accident or miscalculation, which makes all the more urgent the need for countries, especially the US and Russia, and NATO to reaffirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be launched.  They must resile from their high operational readiness to use nuclear weapons.  There is a famous quote from Albert Einstein: "I know not what weapons World War III will be fought with, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."  There were two World Wars in the previous century, followed by a Cold War and an Iron Curtain, and there were many wars of ethnicity and civilisation throughout the world.</p><p>On the other side was the hope that came from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p> <p> Everybody can agree there is a fear that a conflict could escalate into a nuclear war but there are a number of ironies.  One is the attitude of the United States towards nuclear disarmament.  The United States argues that nations it sees as "rogue states" should be stopped at all costs from gaining a nuclear threat.  Nevertheless, the only sovereign state to use atomic weapons has been the United States, with devastating consequences that are still being felt today.  Another irony concerns arms in general.  I am always struck by how NATO countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany sometimes come out in support of nuclear prohibition yet they have an arms industry that sells arms to regimes that are causing conflicts today.  Yemen is the example that immediately springs to mind.  The need for nuclear prohibition is about stopping the threat of wholesale destruction but the bombing and maiming of people with smaller munitions over years is somehow not seen as the same wholesale destruction.  We need a detailed debate around arms sales in general as there is much hypocrisy at play within geopolitics.</p> <p> The Bill is welcome and I hope it is supported.  As a non-aligned and mainly neutral country - although there are concerns about our status in that regard - Ireland should have a stronger voice in the wider debate around arms and the sale of arms to countries with little regard for international law and human suffering in particular.  The western media will always channel the nuclear prohibition debate between bogeyman states like North Korea and Iran, portraying them as unstable and unpredictable and which should never therefore be capable of using nuclear weapons or enriching uranium.  There is nothing about the track record of countries with established nuclear capability.  Israel, for example, disregards international law by continuing to build settlements.  We can also look at what has been happening in India and Pakistan, as well as in the United States.  A leaked memo from some months ago indicates the United States was thinking of invading Venezuela some time ago.</p> <p> The goal of nuclear weapons prohibition is to stop states obtaining nuclear capabilities but there is just as much need to debate the states that already have nuclear capabilities and what they could do.  Going back to 1968, for example, fewer than 20 countries negotiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  It is recognised that five countries - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - had already acquired nuclear arsenals at the time.  Those five countries committed to the process of nuclear disarmament and other countries accepted obligations not to acquire or try to acquire nuclear weapons or programmes.  The treaty came into legal force in 1970, with approximately 60 members joining.  However, in order to encourage non-nuclear countries to sign the 1968 treaty, it actively promoted the use of nuclear technologies for what were called "peaceful" purposes.  Many countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Iran, pursued nuclear programmes with help from nuclear-armed states like the United Kingdom.  When they wanted to try to copy the five countries with nuclear weapons in developing their own weapons, the treaty was used to pressure them.</p> <p> In 2003, North Korea became the first country to withdraw from the treaty.  We know the United States deployed nuclear weapons in and around South Korea until the 1990s and it still stations thousands of troops and weaponry there.  Unfortunately, North Koreans are now being taught that having their own nuclear deterrent is the only way to defend themselves against the United States, which possesses the world's most powerful nuclear arsenal.  The debate is riddled with hypocrisy.</p> <p> There is not enough in the Bill and we also need an action plan for the comprehensive phasing out of nuclear weapons in order to reduce nuclear stockpiles, cancel nuclear weapons modernisation programmes and cut nuclear weapons budgets.  This must be done through dialogue and engagement with all states in order to eliminate all nuclear weapons.  The global militarisation index for 2017 indicates that $1.74 trillion was spent on weapons and military equipment.  The European Union spends $260 billion yearly on its military operations.  That does not include nuclear spending but I saw one figure indicating that $1 trillion will be spent in modernising the nuclear arsenals of nine countries over the next ten years.  We could think about what that nuclear budget could do to end poverty and hunger, protect our climate and achieve sustainable development goals.</p> <p> Deputy Pringle's Bill to divest from fossil fuels has passed through the Oireachtas and we need to do the same and divest from companies involved with nuclear weapons.  Three countries in Europe have done this already and there are 26 companies involved with the production of nuclear weapons.  Ireland has already excluded three of these and it is worthwhile looking further into such action.  There is a role for smaller countries like Ireland because we have a very strong reputation when it comes to humanitarian issues and human rights.  We can be a strong voice here also.  A nuclear war can never happen and the best way to avoid it is to have a position where no nuclear weapons are held by anyone.</p></speech>

I thank all Members who contributed to this afternoon's Second Stage debate.  I am pleased that a world free from nuclear weapons is a shared objective by all Members of this House and I thank those who have also praised Ireland's role in leading the negotiations of the TPNW with the core group of states.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned in earlier remarks, the significance of the TPNW lies in the fact that for the first time the core objective of the prohibition of nuclear weapons will be clearly and unambiguously stated in an international treaty addressing that current legal gap.  The TPNW contains a comprehensive set of prohibitions on nuclear weapons activities, including undertakings not to develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.  These provisions represent in themselves an important milestone on the path towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as do the provisions of the treaty prohibiting the stationing, installation or deployment of nuclear weapons on national territory.</p>  <p>  In addition to the comprehensive prohibitions in the treaty, the TPNW makes its own contributions to the multilateral disarmament framework through a number of groundbreaking provisions that I cited in my opening remarks.  The treaty takes a holistic approach, looking at the actual and potential real world effects of nuclear weapons and, in doing so, it shifts the discourse from a security lens to a humanitarian lens, challenging us to think about the enormity of the threat posed by these weapons.  By stigmatising and prohibiting nuclear weapons, it makes a statement that these weapons are simply no longer acceptable.  It centralises the impact on victims and provides assistance for survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use.  It also addresses the fact that ionising radiation is even more harmful to women than men and it promotes the equal participation of women and men in disarmament fora.  The treaty recognises the alarming impact of nuclear weapons testing and use on our already fragile planet and it provides for environmental remediation measures.</p>  <p>  These new provisions reflect a greater appreciation of the elevated risk and the catastrophic consequences that would result from a nuclear weapons detonation.  Whereas the TPNW is supported by the majority of countries, it is opposed by all nuclear weapons states and their military allies, including NATO members.  That is not surprising, given the arsenals of nuclear weapons that these states hold.  These countries argue that the fact that they have nuclear weapons deters other states from attacking them but Ireland does not subscribe to the nuclear deterrence theory, rather believing that the existence of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to human security and the future of the planet, as outlined so eloquently by other Members this afternoon.</p>  <p>  The argument put forward by opponents of the treaty is that it undermines the existing legal frameworks provided by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.  From our perspective, the negotiating mandate for the conference that adopted the TPNW set out clearly that the new legal instrument to be adopted was to be complementary to and reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.</p><p>Ireland's approach to the negotiations was very much guided by this aspect of the mandate and we are satisfied that the TPNW achieves the same very well.  The non-proliferation treaty always envisaged a separate legal instrument to provide for nuclear disarmament and the TPNW is therefore the first step in implementing the nuclear disarmament provisions of the former.</p> <p> The interaction of the TPNW with the existing disarmament and non-proliferation architecture was a primary concern of many states during the negotiations.  I am confident that the TPNW has adequately addressed these issues by complementing and enhancing existing arrangements while not creating parallel or competing structures.</p> <p> A number of like-minded states which are also not part of military alliances have already signed and ratified the TPNW, for example, Austria and New Zealand.  However, there are some like-minded states which have not signed for now and national debates are taking place in many of these jurisdictions.  We expect up to five further ratifications at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York next week and up to six further signatures.  To date, 122 UN member states have shown support for the TPNW.</p> <p> Despite the criticisms and the reluctance by some states to sign or ratify the treaty, the TPNW is an important milestone.  Not only does it represent significant progress but it also reinvigorates the non-proliferation treaty at a time when this is badly needed.  It gives back the impetus to non-nuclear, small states like Ireland to seize the initiative and move forward the nuclear disarmament agenda once more.  It is incumbent on us to do so because not only is nuclear disarmament a signature aspect of our foreign policy, a nuclear weapons-free world is also in the best interests of humanity.</p> <p> It is clear that issues of nuclear disarmament sometimes require us to take a position that is not universally shared or popular.  I am proud that this principled approach, based on integrity and consistency, is a hallmark of Ireland's disarmament policy stretching back decades.  Ireland has never shied away from its advocacy for nuclear disarmament and the continued existence of nuclear weapons is a challenge to global security, an affront to our planet and abhorrent to our people.  The ethical, humanitarian and now legal imperatives for disarmament are overwhelming.</p> <p> The Government is anxious to carry forward the excellent work that is already being done by being in a position to ratify the TPNW by the end of this year and the enactment of the present Bill facilitates this and will clearly demonstrate Ireland's commitment to promoting the earliest possible entry into force of the TPNW.  I look forward to the progress of the Bill to Committee Stage and thank all the Members for their contributions this afternoon.  We look forward to proceedings on the Bill being concluded in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

That Act recognises the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his or her own family.</p><p>We welcome the progress made with the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Minister's acknowledgement that the current system for the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is flawed and needs to be changed.  Through this process of change, it is crucial that the best interests of a child are at the heart of any decision-making affecting him or her and that the best possible advocacy is provided for every child who is in need of representation because these children's lives will be affected by the decisions made in the courts.</p><p>The guardian <i>ad litem</i>system as it currently operates is not fit for purpose.  It is completely unregulated, there is no oversight or accountability and the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not defined in legislation.  The appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i>in court proceedings is at the discretion of the judge, meaning that access to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is inconsistent across the State.  The provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service cost the State approximately &euro;46.1 million over the three-year period from 2014 to 2016.  That is a considerable amount which cannot be quantified in terms of value for money as there is no clear payment structure in place.  I have no personal issue or difficulty with money being spent on the provision of services that benefit children but this system has got to change.  We must be able to quantify that value for money.  A regulated system can operate on a much more cost-effective basis as evidenced by similar services in other jurisdictions such as those provided by Children's Hearings Scotland.</p><p>We need a better service for the most vulnerable children in our society while being able to quantify costs.  A huge amount of money is being wasted while, at the same time, an inconsistent and relatively <i>ad hoc</i>service is provided to our most vulnerable children.  My biggest issue with and concern about the system relates to its unfortunate inconsistency.</p><p>There is much that needs to change in family law in this State and the manner in which we treat children in the courts.  There are numerous points I would like to make on how positive changes could happen but, for the purpose of this debate, I will confine my comments to the relevant sections of the Bill that I feel need to be revisited and urgently addressed.  I am not a fan of making technical speeches but there are times when they are needed.</p><p>Section 35B(2) has the effect that children whose cases are before the High Court and who are going to be placed in special care will always be appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  This is the correct approach and we welcome the fact that this is standard practice.  However, children whose cases are before the District Court regarding applications to place them in care - whether with relatives, in non-relative foster care or in residential units - are not automatically entitled to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That places affected children at a serious disadvantage and may be unconstitutional.  All children in childcare cases should automatically be appointed guardians <i>ad litem</i>to ensure their wishes and feelings are heard in these important proceedings.  The latest figures from the child care law reporting project indicate that guardians <i>ad litem</i>are presently appointed in 53% of cases.  That means that children do not have that type of representation in 47% of cases.  We are therefore seeking to amend section 35B(3) on this basis.</p><p>The child involved should be a party to proceedings in order to ensure that he or she has equality within those proceedings.  This would be in line with practice that currently exists in Northern Ireland and England.  The child's voice must be heard whatever the circumstances and as much as possible, while protecting his or her emotional and psychological well-being.</p><p>As the Bill is currently drafted, children may or may not be appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Subsequently, the child's guardian <i>ad litem</i>may or may not be able to engage a solicitor as outlined in section 35D(2).  Therefore, legal representation is not a guaranteed right for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  This presents a situation where all parties are guaranteed legal advice except for the child who is at the centre of the case and who the case is essentially about.  Of all parties involved, it is therefore the child who has the least representation.  The child is at a serious disadvantage in proceedings as one can be assured that the Child and Family Agency will have legal representation, as will the parents if they wish to instruct a solicitor.  The child, on the other hand, has a number of hurdles to overcome in order to have a guardian or legal representation.  It is surely the vulnerable and innocent child at the centre of the case who should have the most representation, above everyone else, and who should be prioritised.  At a minimum, the child should be treated equally.  A number of children's rights solicitors have been contacted me to voice their concerns on that point and on the possibility of litigation in the future if this issue is not addressed.</p><p>In instances where parents choose not to engage in the court process, or are incapable of doing so, as is often the case, there may be no one to hold the Child and Family Agency to account and ensure that the child's wishes are being taken into account.  The latter is another reason to believe that guardians <i>ad litem</i>should have the right to legal representation on behalf of the children for whom they are advocating.  This aspect definitely needs to be revisited.</p><p>Section 35G is ambiguous on whether guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be entitled to all information regarding the case they are in charge of.  This may compromise their ability to advocate fully and effectively for the child.<br/><br/>Section 35H should be strengthened to allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be retained in the case of an order being discharged.  The Bill is ambiguous on this.  As a consequence of the high turnover of social workers, the guardian is frequently the only professional who is consistently involved in the case and who is the constant in a child's life throughout proceedings.  We seek assurances around allowing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be retained in the case of an order being discharged.<br/><br/>We understand the Bill attempts to limit the guardians' ability to call and cross-examine witnesses.  This compromises their ability to advocate fully and most effectively for the child.<br/><br/>In the event that the child is not a party to the proceedings, there is a legitimate argument that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be a party to the proceedings.<br/><br/>If the sections highlighted are amended, this has the potential to be a Bill that could improve the protection of children.  However, as it stands, the Bill would have a retrograde impact and would, in fact, weaken advocacy on behalf of, and protection of, the most vulnerable children.  I emphasise the recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs which strongly recommended that there should be no involvement of Tusla in the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  This is essential for absolute impartiality.  I appeal to the Minister and all Deputies in this regard.  There cannot be any overlap between this independent service and Tusla.  I sincerely hope the Minister and her officials are open to taking on board our concerns and will consider our amendments in order that we can work together to improve and strengthen this much-needed Bill.  Working out where the difficulties lie has always been my approach and that of my party.  The Bill has potential for good but we must address these issues which had been raised not only by Sinn F&eacute;in but also solicitors working in the area of children's rights who deal with these matters daily and know exactly what they speak of.  Perhaps the Minister will meet some of tho relevant groups or solicitors to discuss their concerns.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill for discussion.  This legislation, at its core, aims to reform the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system in a manner which benefits insofar as possible children and young people as possible and ensures the best interests of each child is always the foremost consideration in proceedings.</p><p>I particularly welcome the inclusion of section 5 which, taking into consideration a child's age and maturity, not only ensures that a child's views are heard, but that the court must figure out how best to facilitate that child being accommodated in giving their views.  It is always of the utmost importance that a child's voice is heard in each case.  This applies both in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and all other aspects of policy which impact children and young people.  We must recognise the voice of children and young people throughout Ireland, and we must listen to what they have to say.  We in this House are elected to represent our constituents and we must recognise that children and young people are also our constituents, even if they are at not at an age where they have the right to vote.</p><p>I am pleased that, when examining the functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>appointed for children, the viewpoint of the child is treated as a matter of paramount importance in that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has a responsibility to ascertain the views of the child and give them due consideration when making recommendations to the court.  Furthermore, they are also required to keep the child informed of their recommendations and the outcomes of court proceedings, where appropriate.</p><p>I listened carefully to Deputy Funchion who rightly pointed out the concerns of some in the sector, some of which was brought to the committee&rsquo;s attention in recent weeks and months.  Some aspects of the Bill as drafted are appropriate, whereas others deserve discussion on Committee Stage.  The Minister has always given due consideration to amendments to legislation before the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, as committee members appreciate, and I am sure she will do so again in this case.  Some years ago, when the Minister, who was then a Senator, and I were members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, we discussed the issue of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  I welcome that this Bill takes on board recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which were made as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  One such recommendation is that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service should not be subject to a procurement process.  When it comes to protecting our children and young people, we should not be focused on cost saving or any similar consideration.</p><p>It is important to address the issue of who can be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I understand the Bill provides the Minister with the authority to make regulations regarding the levels of experience and qualifications required to act as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  We must ensure that anyone acting in such a position acts on a strong basis from which he or she can best represent and advocate for the child or young person.  I understand that it is proposed that individuals, in order to be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, must hold qualifications in either psychiatry, psychology, social care or social work and have a minimum of five years' experience.  This is most appropriate.  Over the years, particularly during my time as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, regulations were implemented in various areas and some practitioners, who may have been well-meaning, experienced individuals, did not have qualifications.  This presented a difficulty.  The bottom line is that a person must be qualified to act in the post.  Although experience is an essential component of a person&rsquo;s qualification, he or she must have training in the relevant sphere in order to provide the best possible service to a child or young person.  We should ensure, as we have done in the past, that these requirements are absolute.  I would appreciate a commitment from the Minister to ensure such a significant threshold is put in place before someone can be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for a child or young person.</p><p>It is positive that the legislation before us is clear on the circumstances relating to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for a child or young person by the courts and ensures that several factors are taken into account.  On this basis, the District Court must have regard to the best interests of the child; the age and maturity of the child; the nature of the issues in dispute in the proceedings; any report on any matter which may affect the welfare of the child; where a child or young person wishes to express his or her views and whether the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would assist the expression by that child or young person of their views in the proceedings; and any views regarding such an order expressed by the child and the parties to the proceedings or any other person to whom the proceedings relate.  I listened carefully to Deputy Funchion on the requirement for guardians <i>ad litem</i>during District Court proceedings.  This arose during pre-legislative scrutiny and it is something which I ask the Minister to review at the next appropriate Stage should there be an amendment tabled to the legislation. </p><p>It is also positive that, where the court decides against appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it should give reasons for its decision, and in cases where it is satisfied that a child or young person can form and articulate his or her views in the proceedings, it should find and facilitate a means for that child or young person to do so.  Notwithstanding my comments, it should be automatic for someone to be appointed to act as guardian <i>ad litem</i>unless there is a very good reason for not doing so.  The child or advocate should not have to fight for one to be appointed.</p><p>I have placed particular emphasis on the elements of the Bill directly related to ensuring a child's or young person's views are heard in any proceedings.  I cannot overstate the importance of this.  Children and young people, who are among the most vulnerable persons in the system, must be heard and we, as legislators, must work to advocate for them in this House.  The Bill certainly puts the best interests of our children and young people at the forefront of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and reflects the spirit of the children's rights referendum of 2012.</p><p>I commend the Minister and her Department on the work they have done in bringing this Bill forward.  I also wish to recognise the work of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs in informing the Department's work on the Bill.  I look forward to it progressing through the Houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900029#EE00100"><p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate yesterday and today.  Everyone spoke in favour of the Bill in principle and there was a broad welcome for it, which I appreciate.  I also appreciate the good, solid and robust work of the committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Farrell, on the pre-legislative scrutiny.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, we took on two of the most significant recommendations from the committee.  They were not the only recommendations but one of the matters Deputy Farrell referred to in his contribution was that as we put the guardian <i>ad litem </i>on a statutory basis, it should not be subject to procurement and that is not the case.  That was a big decision to make but the committee was correct in recommending that and so we have proposals for same.</p><p>Deputy Funchion spoke about the cost issue, of which I am conscious, and we tried to take that into account in the Department in the construction of the Bill in its current form, although we clearly state that cost is a key component in concerns that will drive the reform.  However, it is not the only concern and there are more comprehensive concerns and overall ambitions for an office that will be initiated by the Department to oversee this as a new set of processes and regulation that are part of that wider reform.</p><p>I will make one or two more general points about the Bill before directly responding to some of the helpful questions and suggestions raised by Deputies yesterday and today, which will assist us as we move to Committee Stage.  Several Deputies identified some of the arenas they will be bringing amendments forward in and some concerns they have.  More generally, the Bill brings the Child Care Act 1991 into line with the provisions of the thirty-first amendment to the Constitution.  Deputy Farrell ended his contribution by saying how important that was.  In particular, one of the first Parts was Part 2 of the Bill where in section 24(1) it states that: &quot;In any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of a child, including proceedings before the High Court under Part IVA in relation to special care, the court shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.&rdquo;  That kind of phrase is repeated throughout the context of our concern in creating the Bill and also within the Bill itself.</p><p>The provision strengthens the child's rights, which is the most important factor in the determination of the proceedings.  To ensure the children and young people are always at the heart of proceedings, the Bill provides for a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in all childcare proceedings before the District Court but this provision also allows for appropriate judicial discretion.  A couple of issues were raised around this.  Yesterday, Deputy Sherlock referred us to section 35B(3) of the Bill.  He quoted from the Bill, which states: &quot;In proceedings under Part IV, IVB or VI the District Court, of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings, shall consider whether to direct that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>be appointed for a child.&quot;  Deputy Sherlock asked whether that was clear enough and whether we should state explicitly that the judge ought to do this.  He raised the question of whether the child has an absolute entitlement to a guardian <i>ad litem </i>or if there is a presumption in favour of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>As Deputies are aware, the Bill lays out that there is a presumption in favour, as distinct from whether it should be an entitlement, which was raised in Deputy Funchion's questions around a possible amendment.  Deputy Farrell also referred to that.  As it stands, there is a presumption in favour, as distinct from an entitlement, which we believe to be important because it may be the case that it is not always the best decision to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem </i>if, for example, a child wishes to have a direct engagement with a judge or if a child or young person wants to speak in a less mediated fashion.  That should be left open as a possibility.  Having said that, if, having gone through all the matters the judge needs to consider in the appointment and the presumption in favour of appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, he or she decides not to do so, the judge must give reasons for that and must identify how the views of the child will be heard.  Although it is true to say there are other mechanisms in other jurisdictions that provide ways of facilitating the views and the best interests of the child to be expressed, in our jurisdiction the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is the way we do that.  As it stands, the Bill strikes the right balance to leave it open if it is more in the interests of the child not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem </i>if the child so wishes but ultimately the judge has to go through a full process because there is a presumption in favour of appointing one.  As has been said, we can take that up more directly when we come to Committee Stage.</p><p>The Bill also seeks to maintain a balance between the different sets of concerns raised by Deputies Rabbitte and Sherlock yesterday.  On the one hand there is the need to ensure the child and young person is at the centre of the proceedings - that is not lost sight of - and on the other hand there is the requirement to ensure that the role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>does not inadvertently lead to more adversarial or protracted proceedings.  The child should be kept at the centre but with a guardian <i>ad litem </i>being there, that facilitates the best possible way of moving through the system to enable what is best for the child.</p><p>On some of the comments yesterday, it is not accurate to say the current section 26 makes any provision for a guardian <i>ad litem </i>to be made a party.  Accordingly, the Bill does not downgrade the status of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Instead, the Bill is seeking to make guardians <i>ad litem </i>available to more children and to children across the country on a systematic and equitable basis.  That is in light of some comments from Deputy Funchion as well.  The Bill is currently constructed so that it is more appropriate for a child to be made party as distinct from a guardian <i>ad litem </i>being made party.  In the Bill, as it is constructed, if that happens, the child or young person can keep a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, whereas currently he or she would not be able to do that.  It is more appropriate that the Bill works more in the best interests of the child.  It is about the child taking that interest in being made a party rather than the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which brings a different and an independent perspective.</p><p>The guardian <i>ad litem </i>has a special and unusual status in the Bill.  Under the provisions of the Bill, guardians <i>ad litem </i>are required to provide a report to the court but to correct a point that was made yesterday, it is not correct to say that the Bill limits them to providing one report.  Section 35E(2) states: &quot;A guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointed for a child shall &ndash; (c) inform the court of any additional matters, relevant to the best interests of the child, coming to his to her knowledge as a result of the performance by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>of his or her functions.&quot;  It is not limited, therefore, to just one report from the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Another progressive aspect of the Bill is that this provision also recognises that in drawn-out proceedings, a child&rsquo;s views may change and a guardian <i>ad litem </i>may need to come back to the court with an update on the child&rsquo;s views on any other matter that is of relevance to the proceedings.</p><p>The question of an automatic entitlement to legal representation was raised by Deputy Funchion.</p><p>As the Bill is drafted, we do not believe an automatic entitlement to legal representation is necessary because it could potentially make cases more adversarial and they may take longer as a result.  However, the office to be established will have a legal services unit, so they will always have access to legal advice and representation when needed.  Under the Bill, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>also has a duty to inform the child or young person at the centre of proceedings of the recommendations in his or her report, and of the outcome of the proceedings.  The intention is that the guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be involved throughout the proceedings.<br/><br/>There is a clear consensus among stakeholders, Deputies and committee members that reform is needed as the current system is costly, unregulated and provides no oversight of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  I reiterate, because it was one of the committee's primary recommendations, that under the Bill a new national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service will be established within the executive office of my Department and Tusla will have no involvement with it.  We have been working to plan for the implementation and bringing into operation of that executive office as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  The decision to establish a guardian <i>ad litem </i>executive office within my Department was taken by the Government.<br/><br/>My officials continue to be open to working with experts in order to hear further views, including those of committee members.  We look forward to moving to Committee Stage, and it was helpful in this debate to hear, first, the general welcome of the principle behind the Bill and, second, that Deputies were so clear in identifying areas about which they have questions or in respect of which they may be tabling amendments in order that we can think further about them.  I have tried to outline some of the reasons we did what we did, but as always we are open to having a debate and seeing whether there are possibilities or a need for change.</p></speech>

The influence young people are having on this debate, in building momentum among older generations to take seriously the scale of the challenge, cannot be underestimated.  They are a constant reminder to those in power that governments must lead this change.  There has been a lack of commitment in the past in Ireland. Although we committed to a 20% reduction in emissions, we have failed to achieve that target.  It is absolutely appropriate that we be called out on that failure.  Younger generations are pointing the finger at our generation and telling us that we will be the first generation to pass the world on in a worse state than in which we found it, and that is a heavy responsibility which we need to seriously address.</p>  <p>  This debate is also appropriate in that the UN will be hosting a series of events relating to the climate agenda this weekend.  The first of those will be a youth engagement and public mobilisation session on Saturday, at which Ireland will be a listener, and where young people will have the opportunity to set out their concerns and expectations in great detail.  This allows a serious debate to occur not only at a local level within our communities but at an international level, so that the UN, which is at the heart of multilateral efforts to work together to confront the climate challenge, will hear directly from young people as to their expectations.  On Monday, the UN Secretary General will hold a climate action summit.  As Deputies will know, this has long been signalled as a time when we need to step up our ambitions, as many new scientific reports note the narrowing window of opportunity for action and the need to significantly scale up our ambitions.  Ireland is part of a coalition within the European Union which wants to commit to net zero carbon emissions for the European Union by 2050.  I welcome the very high-level expression of commitment from the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, with whom I have worked in the past.  I have absolute conviction that when she sets out her agenda for the Commission's work, at the core of which will be climate action and just transition, she will deliver on that ambition.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, this UN conference will be the first opportunity for me to present the strategic approach Ireland has taken in addressing the shortfalls that have clearly occurred in our own climate strategy.  We have much to tell people in that the way we have gone about this shows we have the capacity to mobilise the necessary change.  The Citizens' Assembly has provided leadership on this issue and clearly pointed the way forward, as it has done when addressing previous major changes in Irish society as well.  The all-party Oireachtas committee put huge care and effort into conducting hearings around the scale of the challenge, how we shape that challenge, and how to govern in order to ensure policies for delivering targets are implemented.  The work of that committee, which was chaired by my colleague Deputy Hildegarde Naughton and involved every party and Deputies of no affiliation, was a remarkable piece of work, and it culminated in a unanimous declaration here in the Chamber of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  That is a significant foundation on which to build a climate plan, and that is what I have sought to do.</p>  <p>  As Deputies know, shortly after that declaration I published the Government's climate action plan, which adopts the approach outlined by the Oireachtas committee.  We are moving to a whole new approach to governance, with climate budgets and independent recommendations to the Government of what those budgets should be coming from a much-strengthened climate action council.  There will be far greater levels of accountability for individual Ministers on the delivery on climate budgets within their sectors, and far greater accountability to the Oireachtas here as well.  Just as Departments are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, they will in future be accountable to an equally important - if not more important - climate action committee.</p>  <p>  The plan we have set out is ambitious.  Some people will say it is not ambitious enough, while others will say it is too ambitious.  To give Deputies some notion of the scale of the plan, it is important to outline some of the things we envisage happening, because they represent both change and opportunity.  For example, the amount of renewable energy on our grid will increase to five times what it is today.</p><p>The level of retrofitting activity on our homes will be ten times what it is today. The number of electric vehicles will increase from 4% of purchasers today to 100% by 2030.  The number of heat pumps that are installed will be 20 times what it is today.  The number of trees planted will be double what it is today, representing 250 million additional trees planted over the next decade.  The number of people commuting and travelling by public transport or cycling will be 500,000 more per day.  The amount of non-recyclable plastic will go from 66% today to zero by 2030.  The number of sustainable energy communities will rise to 1,500, which is five times what it is today.</p> <p> This is a very ambitious plan in many ways but it is absolutely essential.  I am very conscious, however, that this requires big changes in the way we think about many things.  People will have to change their concept of what types of infrastructure should be part of a society that is committed to decarbonisation.  We will have to change the habits of a lifetime in many ways.  We will have to accommodate 1 million extra people in this country but do it in such a way that is compact, sustainable and connected.  We will have to mobilise very large amounts of private capital to deliver this.  I believe it is a serious test of politics.</p> <p> The plan is built on four very simple principles.  One is the essential nature of Government leadership.  This means the Government taking responsibility for living within strict carbon budgets, driving the changes that are necessary in our society, being open and accountable for that and ensuring that every public body adopts a mandate for climate action.</p> <p> The second principle is effective policies.  We have to pursue policies that impose the least burden but the most opportunity to Irish people, while delivering the essential targets we have to achieve.  It is very important that our homes, enterprises and farms can be resilient and sustainable and will prosper in a changed world.  This requires significant change.</p> <p> Also embedded is the principle of fairness and recognising that we need to support those who are most exposed to change.  We have seen this in very sharp terms with regard to Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  We also need to support those least equipped to manage those changes, especially those who might be at risk of fuel poverty.  We have to make sure that every element of society is making a fair contribution. This is what we call just transition and it has to be at the heart of the plan.</p> <p> The final principle on which the plan is built is one of citizens' empowerment.  This means that engagement and feedback, especially with the younger generation, are embedded in the plan.  We need to find novel ways to help people shape their own communities and also empower communities and individuals to change the way they address this issue.</p> <p> These four principles are entirely interlocked.  We have to achieve in all areas together.  It is a challenge to the way we do politics and public administration and a test of our structures.  I am looking forward to working with colleagues in the Oireachtas to make a reality for our people the work that the all-party Oireachtas committee took on and which we have embedded in the climate action plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-19a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900031#GG00200"><p>I very much welcome that the climate emergency has been immediately put back on the agenda of this House in the first week of resumption of the D&aacute;il.  It is only right that we have the opportunity to address the need for urgent actions, given the range of important climate events that are taking place in the coming weeks and disturbing news announcements that occurred over the recess.  In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, released a new special report, hot on the heels of the previous year's report, which shows the devastating effect of the climate emergency on land and food systems.  Also last month, the National Parks and Wildlife Service highlighted that 85% of Irish habitats are in an "unfavourable" condition.  The situation is deteriorating.  We also need to be clear that developing countries are suffering the worst impacts.  Compounding decades and centuries of economic injustice, we are now layering climate injustice on top of the global south.  Ireland must finally take collective responsibility for its polluting emissions.</p>  <p>  Thanks to the Citizens' Assembly and the work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, the Government has at least started to take the issue seriously with its new climate plan.  The reality, however, is that at this late stage, slow, incremental progress is not enough.  This is an emergency.  It is particularly disturbing that Fine Gael is failing to live up to the deadlines set out in the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas committee, which appear to have been dismissed and do not even feature in the Government's climate plan, despite Fine Gael expressly committing to them in the committee in March.</p>  <p>  On the plus side, outside this Chamber, the mandate for greater climate ambition is clearer than ever.  Last week, we learned from a new Eurobarometer poll that 95% of Irish people consider climate change to be a serious issue, with similar levels of support for greater action on renewables and energy efficiency and other climate related objectives.  Another sign of hope is tomorrow's schools strike for climate, which also links with events in New York and elsewhere over the coming week.  Schoolchildren in my constituency will be out and I will join them in Maynooth, Celbridge, Naas and elsewhere.  My daughter was on the strikes outside her school.  Across the country and the world, these strikes will only gather in momentum with each passing week.  I salute all of those involved at the picket lines, as it were.</p>  <p>  How is the Government going respond right now?  I am not referring to reviews or potential measures proposed in a few years' time but the here and now.  My fear is that, as happened in March when attention was focused on the previous wave of school strikes, the Government may patronise young people.  It may congratulate them on their engagement, tell them the Government will listen and talk up how they can respond by turning off lights, buying paper straws.</p>  <p>  There will also be much focus on the youth assembly that will take place in the D&aacute;il in November.  This is a significant and welcome move.  The youth assembly will focus public attention and young people will be able to present their ideas to officials.  I sincerely hope they get a good hearing.  It will be an important day for the D&aacute;il and the young people involved.  We cannot allows this to be the only concrete measure taken in these Houses in the coming months.  Members are well aware that Ireland's emissions are continuing to rise and our 2030 targets are at risk and will not be reduced by town hall promotional events.</p>  <p>  Almost a year ago to the day, I raised with the Taoiseach a particular concern about provisioning for potential fines for missing our climate emissions targets again.  The Taoiseach glibly dismissed my concern by telling me we would not make provision in 2019 but would do so in the following budgetary year.  This is symptomatic of the Government's attitude, or at least it has been in the recent past.  It is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Government will make pledges at the UN Climate Action Summit next week to support youth and public participation.  Let us be honest, however; the problem has not been a lack of participation by young people or a lack of communication.  The problem has been that the Government knowingly neglected Ireland's climate responsibilities for the best part of the past decade.  I watched with amusement and enjoyment Greta Thunberg's testimony at the hearings in the US yesterday, including her deft dismissal of some whataboutery.  One of the Senators hearing the evidence in Congress threw out the usual canards and "What ifs?" when he referred to China and everybody else causing pollution.  I watched as Greta, with great dexterity, batted these aside by arguing that the US should get its own house in order first and worry about everybody else later.  The others, she said, could take care of themselves and the US could show example.  I fully agree with that view.  It is back to the old expression of looking after the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves.  Somebody else's inaction is no excuse for someone else not to act.  We have to mind our own house and we can do that.  We in this Chamber have a responsibility to do all we can to make that happen.  One of the most important points Greta Thunberg made was the need for science to be heard.  Will the Minister respond to the science and will the Government make any substantive commitments at the climate action summit next week to reduce emissions? The current approach of announcements, reviews and business as usual is not enough.  It is not a response to the climate, biodiversity and global warming crises.</p>  <p>  The UN summit is also an opportunity for the Government to chart a new course and respond substantively to young people's calls for real action to tackle this emergency.  The Government should commit to supporting the European Commission's proposal that the EU increase its 2030 targets to an emissions reduction of at least 55%.  While it is welcome that the Government has supported an EU commitment to climate neutrality by 2050, the Government must commit to enacting the necessary legislation to introduce this target at national level, with attendant accountability checks.  I urge that this be done before the next election.  Let us get it done now.  Why wait?</p>  <p>  On air quality, when it comes to measures that would reduce emissions and improve public health, particularly for younger generations, we need look no further than the area of air pollution, which results in more than 1,000 deaths in Ireland each year.</p><p>The Government has similarly put legal risks ahead of young people's health and failed to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  We still do not have a clear air strategy and the number of asthma cases continues to increase.  I ask the Minister to clarify what steps he is taking this month, inclusive of his stated work with the Attorney General, to ban smoky coal and put this strategy in place in order that we will begin to see improvements in air quality this year.  </p> <p> I mentioned biodiversity.  A Fianna F&aacute;il motion which enjoyed cross-party support and was agreed earlier this summer saw this House declare a climate and biodiversity emergency.  I do not wish to wade into the beef crisis and farming issues except to say that the proliferation of well spaces and increased biodiversity must be one of the solutions to this issue.  In this regard, I suggest that it may be worth exploring a REP scheme similar to that which existed in the past, whereby farmers were encouraged and financially incentivised to take environmentally sustainable initiatives on the land with support and advice from the relevant agencies.  </p> <p> On agriculture and the Mercosur deal, Government, inclusive of State bodies, must be a leader on climate change and must seek to empower and assist businesses and individuals.  What we have seen thus far is a Government that follows.  In July, Fianna F&aacute;il, together with other parties and organisations, called on the Government to rethink its approach to Mercosur in light of the disastrous affects of deforestation, the climate change affects of the transportation of commodities from pastures and grazing lands in South America across the globe into Europe, not only in terms of the associated air miles but the rule that we should only consume food that comes from within five miles of our own plates, and the devastating affects on the rainforest, which have doubled down since the fires in the Amazon rainforest.  The Government dismissed this advice but when European leaders and others raised similar issues, the Taoiseach finally listened and agreed to consider them in the context of the Mercosur deal.</p> <p> On the retrofitting fiasco, I am sure every Member of this House received representations in relation to this scheme under which homeowners were encouraged to apply for a grant to retrofit their houses.  When a backlog of applications built up, the scheme fell apart and funding was withdrawn.  Thankfully, it has been restored.  However, the fiasco undermined confidence in the Government's approach to this scheme and many other issues.  We have also witnessed a fiasco in regard to the school transport scheme and the increased number of children seeking eligibility under the scheme, to which the response of Government and the Department has been to pare back the scheme using an accountant's rule to reduce the number of children travelling on school buses.  In the middle of a climate emergency, we should be broadening the scheme and providing more places so that parents will be encouraged to avail of it rather than drive their children to school.  The Government should not be using an accountant's rule to pare back the scheme.  That makes no sense.   </p> <p> In regard to public transport, representing the commuter constituency of Kildare North, I have seen first-hand the Government's inaction in terms of the increasing number of people clamouring to get on to trains and into car parks at railway stations.  We learned recently that the next fleet of rail carriages is due in five years.  Having raised this issue in the House consistently with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and having been told that new carriages would be provided soon, we now learn it will be five years before we get them.  If the Government was serious about public transport and climate change, these carriages would have been ordered when it took office and would be due for delivery for now, but that did not happen.  </p> <p> As matters stand, the Government is in the dock in the Four Courts in regard to its inaction on climate change.  Its mitigation plan is being put through the shredder by a team of counsel.  The outcome may have been announced during my contribution.  The fact that the climate groups could put a stateable case to the High Court, taking the Government to court for a lack of action on climate change, speaks volumes about its approach.  I hope we will see a difference in that approach.  I look forward to the remainder of this debate and, I hope, to actions rather than words.  We are at an emergency stage and we need much more than lip service.  Fianna F&aacute;il will not be found wanting in terms of putting its shoulders to the wheel.  The Government is in the driving seat and it needs to get on board and make it happen.</p></speech>

This week, thankfully, a spotlight will be again shone on the issue of climate action and change.  The protest is being led by schoolchildren.  Millions of people around the world will, in my view, come out to support the logic of uniting behind the science.  All of those who come out will call on leaders in this State and people in this Chamber to deliver an urgent and dramatic increase in action.  People want to see real changes.  Many of the changes that are necessary are very exciting and are, I think, the very essence of policies that parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in and left progressive parties have been advocating for a longer number of years, namely, investment in public services and transport and making sure that the State is in the driving seat in regard to dealing with these issues.  The private sector will not be in the driving seat when it comes to making sure that people's homes are to the highest standards, that the homes that people need are built, that we make a fair and just transition to a zero carbon economy and that we have more aggressive afforestation to act as a carbon sink.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned a just transition.  I do not believe that Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il will deliver a just transition - quite the opposite.  In terms of what is necessary for a just transition, it will be about State investment in public services.  It is important that we listen to the voices of young people who are our future voting citizens.  In my view, they have every reason to inform Government about the direction of policymaking.  We need to see this in the context of social justice and fairness underpinning the environmental changes needed.  As with all structural change the pathway, is as important as the destination.  Climate change cannot be tackled with the same methods and the same thinking that created the problem in the first instance.  We know that bad policy positions and bad policy direction have pushed public spending towards costly and unsuccessful measures, which have a negative impact on society and the economy.  Numerous failures worldwide have emerged where political and economic decision-making was lacking foresight, including, for example, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's climate action plan, which uses a marginal abatement cost curve to help identify the most cost-effective pathway to reducing emissions.  That is a disaster waiting to happen because climate change cannot be tackled through accountancy.  Mathematical equations will not save us.  </p>  <p>  Fine Gael and, I would argue, Fianna F&aacute;il, believe that this will be sorted by market forces, the same market forces that have resulted in creeping privatisation of public services, left many people in substandard housing that does not have the same type of high energy ratings as the homes that wealthier people can afford and caused the cessation of bus services in rural areas.  The Expressway services in many parts of the State ceased because they were not economically viable.  If the Government proposes to underpin its response on market forces and market logic rather than social, economic and environmental need, it will not solve the problems and it will not bring about the structural changes which are necessary.  These changes also will not come about through leaflets and advertisement campaigns, of the type which followed the Minister's launch of the plan.  In terms of the Government's record since then, it published its climate action plan at the same time as it was carving up the Irish Sea into speculative boxes for fossil fuel extraction and agreeing a beef deal with Brazil which will hasten the demise of the Amazon rainforest. </p>  <p>  The Minister's flagship policy of electric cars for everybody has already fallen flat on its face.  According to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is pie in the sky thinking and cannot be done.  The retrofit scheme which the Government put in place also fell apart.  Let us be honest; it was a retrofit scheme that was aimed at people who had money to invest in deep retrofitting.  It was not as a starting point a retrofit scheme for older people who are most in need or a scheme targeted at public housing, which is where we should start.</p><p>What we need to do is make sure that the planning laws and building regulations ensure that every house built in the future has the highest energy rating.  All of the Minister's strategies I have seen so far have been severely wanting and will not tackle the core issue, which is structural and behavioural in nature and desperately requires social justice.  </p> <p> One issue that divided members of the committee was carbon tax.  I am not against carbon taxes in principle.  We already have them and we all pay them but the questions are whether we should increase carbon taxes, what impact they will have and who will be most affected by them.  The Minister mentioned the just transition.  It would be an injustice to people in vulnerable circumstances if carbon tax were increased on heating oil.  It would also be an injustice if extra costs were imposed on transport and people could not afford to buy electric cars or could not use alternatives which, in most cases, are not available.  I do not see how that approach would be fair.  I have heard supporters of increases in carbon taxes say that we can ring-fence income from the tax for more climate change mitigation measures and give money back but I am not convinced that this will happen.</p> <p> The Minister's starting point must be to provide alternatives in the first instance.  He must then measure those against the track record of the two parties that have led this State since its foundation.  What is their track record on investing in public transport?  I have spoken to people who are concerned about some of the Minister's measures.  They have told me that they live in rural areas and do not have public transport.  Many people outside Dublin, even those who live in cities, do not have the type of public transport that is necessary.  As a result, they cannot make the transition we want them to make.  Many people do not have the money to carry out the type of deep retrofitting that is necessary or make other necessary changes.  People are worried and they will be concerned about increases in taxes that they believe will not be fair.  </p> <p> We are not on our own and we must work in unison with our European partners.  We must think internationally when it comes to climate change as well.  We must be strong leaders in meeting our emissions targets and other climate change targets.  We have not been strong leaders and are falling way behind.  We have not met any of the targets we have set.  We can point the finger of blame, as we should, at the US Administration, which has turned its face against climate action.  The President of that country is a climate change denier.  We can be angry and upset about that and point the finger but if we are not meeting our targets and are not leaders ourselves, we do not have the moral and political authority to lecture anybody else.  Nobody on the left or outside the two main parties negotiated the many trade deals, including the most recent one which is in serious conflict with the objectives of achieving environmental protection and climate justice.  The Minister cannot give a speech like the one he gave and say we need to do more, take the lead and make sure we meet our targets and then potentially sign this country up to the Mercosur trade deal, which we know is having a significant impact on the Amazon.  Before the D&aacute;il returned, Members saw the Amazon rainforest burning over the summer months.  This has occurred for many different reasons but, again, it is because industrialisation and profit come first in Brazil and the country's right-wing government is not putting the protection of the environment first.  The driver behind these fires is the effort to create more land for agriculture.  The EU and Ireland are encouraging and enabling that by signing up to a deal that is built around that objective.  Let us not have a level of denial about what we are all doing here and what is necessary.  </p> <p> I am very positive and energised about what about what we need to do because I believe in investment in public transport and that people should have the best homes.  I believe the State has a responsibility to make sure it does what it needs to do, including more afforestation, ensuring building regulations are strong and increasing investment in renewable energies.  That is what we need to do.  We do not need more taxes, an unjust transition and gimmicks such as some of those we have seen in the Minister's plan.  We need real, tangible and practical solutions that will work and deliver the necessary change.</p></speech>

However, as a member of the Joint Committee on Action and one of the people who contributed to producing the 42 recommendations that were broadly agreed by its members on a cross-party basis, I am fearful that a tension is emerging between the radical nature of some of the recommendations we made and where the Government sits in terms of its implementation plan.  I am fearful that there is a gap between the climate action plan actions and the joint committee, which is a committee of this House consisting of representatives of all parties and none, and that a tension is emerging between the two.  The committee's report reflected the report of the Citizens' Assembly, which was radical in its actions but based on common sense and easily attainable targets.  I worry, however, that those targets will not be reached.  I hope the Minister continues to engage with the committee about how its recommendations, coupled with the Government's set of recommendations in the climate action plan, can be brought about.</p>  <p>  In chapter 1 of the committee's report, we spoke about the need for a new national framework where new climate change legislation would be enacted in the Oireachtas in 2019 and about how, with regard to new governance structure, action on climate action should be considered a priority activity across all of Government.  We also recommended the establishment of a new climate action council to supersede the Climate Change Advisory Council and the establishment of a standing committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister spoke to those issues but the committee set targets.  I understand that there may be differences of emphasis between what the Government will do and what we have recommended but targets need to be achieved.  I fear that we are pushing actions out in this country to 2020, 2021 and 2022 and that, as every quarter goes by, we miss opportunities for real action.  I appreciate that the Minister has attended town hall meetings, including one in Limerick where he announced that some of the actions in the climate action plan that would be undertaken included a new micro-generation scheme, a transition towards 1 million electric vehicles and a nationwide programme of home retrofitting.  I have no doubt that these objectives will be achieved but I fear that they will not be achieved in a timely fashion or even in the manner set out in the targets driven by the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We have very clear targets relating to ensuring the five-yearly carbon budgets.  This would all be included in the legislation that was to be agreed in 2019.  We also set targets by which the renewable share of electricity generation would reach at least 70% by 2030 and the statutory obligation on public bodies would be strengthened to require that they perform their functions in a manner consistent with the 2050 target.  We need these targets to be set out in very clear legislative terms because the actions that are so vital will flow from this.</p>  <p>  Transport is one of the key thematic areas on which we need action.</p></speech>
