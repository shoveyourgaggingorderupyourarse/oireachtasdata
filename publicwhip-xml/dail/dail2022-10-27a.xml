    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00400"><p>The question relates to the corporate sustainability due diligence COM (2022) 71.  It is an extremely important proposal, which I believe we need to get right.  From the hearings we have had and the small piece of research into this that I have done I believe there is a real opportunity for us to get this right and make a difference.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00500"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly for the question on the proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, CSDD, which was published by the European Commission on 23 February 2022.  It addresses corporate behaviour and due diligence processes for the companies within its scope.  The proposal focuses on establishing a system within company law and corporate governance to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising from companies' own operations, their subsidiaries' operations and their value chains.</p>  <p>  At the outset I wish to state that Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed directive, which should promote responsible business conduct and is seeking to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections while ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate and enforceable.  The proposal will apply to large companies, both EU and non-EU.  SMEs are not directly within scope but may be indirectly impacted under the proposal, for example, if they are part of a large company's supply chain.  </p>  <p>  The proposal has the potential to be far reaching and it is vital that we get it right.  Good progress has been made in discussions to date at EU level but further work is needed to clarify aspects of the proposal, ensure that the practical implications are well understood and that the obligations on companies are reasonable and effective.  For example there has been relatively little discussion of financial sector aspects of the proposal and clarification has been sought on the interaction of the proposal with the suite of existing regulation in the financial sector.  Fundamental issues relating to the scope and definitions remain and are currently under discussion.  There is considerable interest in the proposal across a wide range of interests and my Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders, including civil society organisations and business representative organisations, since the proposal was published.  Officials in my Department have met members of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, ICBHR, and with the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, the latest of which was two weeks ago.  I myself will be meeting both groups in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  It was promised that this directive on corporate sustainability due diligence would ensure that EU companies undertook due diligence and checks along their full supply lines to prevent environmental abuses and human rights violations.  The aims behind the directive were welcomed by progressive politicians, trade unionists, environmental groups and human rights groups.  As it stands, however, unfortunately the law falls far short of what is needed to protect workers, communities and our environment.  The directive falls short of what we need because it will only apply to companies with an annual turnover of &euro;150 million and more than 500 employees and companies in high-risk industries such as agriculture and fashion with more than 250 employees.  Will the Minister of State outline for me the clear policy position of the Irish Government on this corporate sustainability and due diligence directive?  Will Ireland act at European level to raise the ambition of this directive and address the weaknesses that have been highlighted?  The Minister of State said he met representatives of the ICBHR.  I am sure it has outlined to him the weaknesses in this proposal.  The Minister of State should indicate what is our position and what we are doing to address those weaknesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00650"><p>As I said earlier I will personally meet representatives of the ICBHR and the other bodies in the coming weeks.  SMEs are not within the scope directly but may be indirectly affected.  Deputy O'Reilly confirmed what the thresholds are.  We currently consider these thresholds to be appropriate.  While I hear the Deputy's criticisms, it should be noted that the cohort of companies within those thresholds accounts for some 50% of the annual turnover of all the companies within the EU.  It is important to ensure that the right companies are within the scope, namely, those companies with the potential to make significant adverse impacts on human rights and environmental matters and which, through their actions, have the ability to change value chains and change these matters.  By extending the threshold the concern is you will take in much smaller companies that are not in a position to make the kind of changes that are necessary.  The aim is to reach a degree of appropriateness in regard to the transposition of this directive.  I certainly will pursue those issues.  We will come back to the House on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00700"><p>Human rights abuses are never appropriate and no company is immune to engaging in them regardless of its size.  Sorcha Tunney, the co-ordinator for the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, stated recently "We need to take forced labour, deforestation and oil spills out of our shopping baskets once and for all, but this proposal just doesn't go far enough and is riddled with loopholes."  The current guidelines as they stand will exclude 99% of companies.  Only 1% of companies will be included.  The reality is that any size of company can engage in human rights abuses or environmental destruction or both.  Therefore the directive on corporate sustainability and due diligence has to be sufficiently broad and strong to reflect this.  I am worried that the Minister of State stated that some companies may not be able to put the necessary checks and balances in place and make the changes that will be needed, because we are talking about changes that will prevent human rights and environmental abuses.  It should apply in the broadest sense to as many companies as possible.  I do not believe any company can claim immunity just by virtue of its size.  We are talking about human rights abuses, we are talking about environmental destruction. </p></speech>

It is about the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the regulations.  As I said, 50% of companies with the biggest turnover in the EU will be affected by this directive.  We need to make sure that in its implementation it is effective and that it actually does what we want it to do, rather than it being an ineffective piece of work that does not actually achieve.  My concern is also that by extending it in the manner on which the Deputy is focusing, companies that are not in a position to actually make effective use of it will not be able to do so.  We have to get an appropriate balance and ensure that we get the result we all want in respect of environmental sustainability and human rights.  The best way to do that is to ensure it is effective.</p></speech>

At that time the Minister of State, Deputy English, stated that we wanted to see it speedily and effectively implemented.  He was going to call me that afternoon to see how we could have regulations to get this implemented because we do not need legislation.  Where are the regulations?  What has happened?  We are back into winter.  The issue of ventilation is going to be central in regard to the spread of Covid-19 again.  What has the Government done to ensure that workers have the right to clean air?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A01200"><p>As the Deputy is aware, following our discussion that night on his Private Members&rsquo; Bill on workplace ventilation, which was not opposed by the Government, I asked the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to start immediately a formal review of the existing provisions on workplace ventilation to determine what further enhancement measures could be considered.  Following this review, a decision was made to update the existing regulations and to introduce a robust code of practice on ventilation in the workplace.  Both the new regulations and the new code of practice are being progressed by my Department officials in conjunction with the HSA.</p> <p>The code of practice for indoor air quality will set out the optimal standards for indoor air quality, along with detailed practical guidance for employers and employees.  A code of practice is an established compliance mechanism and can be referred to in legal proceedings.  </p> <p> The board of the HSA has approved the draft code of practice for indoor air quality for public consultation.  The public consultation will commence in the week beginning 31 October 2022, that is, next week.  It will last about four weeks.  The timeline for the publication of the finalised code of practice will depend on the extent of any amendments to be made following the public consultation but it is anticipated that the code of practice will be published in early 2023 and the updated regulations will be introduced at the same time. </p> <p> The existing 2007 general application regulations create a requirement on employers to make sure that there is an adequate supply of ventilation in the workplace and that the evaluation of ventilation forms part of an overall workplace risk assessment.  Amendment of the general application regulations will bring into force the new code of practice for indoor air quality.  Any worker who is concerned about appropriate levels of ventilation in their workplace should immediately contact the HSA for advice and guidance on the matter.</p> <p> This is progressing quite well as per our agreement on that, even with the Deputy&rsquo;s legislation as well.  I believe our regulations will probably go further and achieve more.  The Deputy&rsquo;s legislation requires specific Covid measures and we are trying to improve air ventilation in general, which has many other benefits beyond the prevention of the spread of Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00200"><p>The Minister of State said there will be a code of practice.  What will be the consequence if a company does not abide by the code of practice?  What is the level prescribed in terms of CO<sub>2</sub>parts per million in the code of practice?</p><p>Our Bill did not just relate to Covid, rather, it related to CO<sub>2</sub>parts per million.  It effectively was a proxy for the likely presence of Covid but it related to the air being of good quality.  This is a moment when it is not just in relation to Covid but where we can guarantee workers access to clean air at work.  It is estimated that 2 million disability-adjusted life years are lost in the EU 28 each year due to poor indoor air quality and effects, which include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, asthma, respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute intoxication.  We need to know what the levels are and what the consequences are for not sticking to them.</p><p>This is a problem.  We are going into winter again, people will be inside more and Covid will spread.  This needs to be done as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00300"><p>The fact that the code of practice is being published next week means we are moving it pretty quickly.  It will be in place in 2023, which I must remind the Deputy is only about eight or nine weeks away.  It is not as if we are saying this will be in a couple of years&rsquo; time.  To be fair, there is a process to go through when updating these regulations.  I assume the Deputy wants this done right.  I believe it will be done right in the way it is being done.</p>  <p>  The code of practice will be published next week.  The development of the regulations to bring into force the new code of practice in the workplace is being progressed by officials.  The existing 2007 regulations are being amended to impose an obligation on employers to comply with higher standards of indoor air quality, which will be set out in the associated code of practice.  The updated regulations will give legal effect to the code of practice.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what that is about.  The code of practice for indoor air quality will set out the optimum standard for indoor air quality, along with detailed practical advice and guidance for employers and employees on areas such as contaminants, indoor air and its sources and health effects, risk assessment, indoor pollutants and their thresholds, measurement and analysis, ventilation strategy, ventilation types and appropriate control measures, along with practical checklists and a tool for employers.  Under the code of practice, the HSA inspectors will have the full range of powers available to them, including the right to assess a report of inspection, serve an improvement or prohibition notice, enter a place of work, question certain individuals, investigate and examine records and examine the workplace activity and processes carried out.  Findings can be used in criminal proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00400"><p>Let us see what the code of practice is.  I wonder whether there is a need for a primary legislative framework for there to be real, substantial sanctions on employers that do not provide clean air for their workers.  Belgium, for example, which has been one of the first movers on this in the EU, is currently introducing something quite similar to our Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill.</p>  <p>  Has the Department any idea of how many people who have long Covid were infected in their workplace?  Will the Department change its policy of refusing to classify Covid as an occupational illness?  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service estimated last January that there could be around 115,000 people in Ireland suffering from long Covid.  We will add more people to that list over the course of the coming winter and many of them will have picked Covid and long Covid up in their workplaces in poorly ventilated buildings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00500"><p>Again, we analysed the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill and we felt that amending existing regulations was a more appropriate and pragmatic way of achieving the objectives of that Bill.  We probably will have achieved the same things.</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s Bill, as drafted, focused primarily on improved workplace ventilation.  However, both the Department and the HSA believe that workplace ventilation goes beyond Covid-19.  The code of practice will provide a more long-term, sustainable and holistic approach to workplace ventilation and gives flexibility to further updates, as opposed to primary legislation.  The Bill, as currently drafted, is quite prescriptive.  It is not practical to use primary legislation to deal with every single place of work because places of work are very different.  They differ greatly from one another and the impact of CO<sub>2</sub>readings must be judged in the context of different workplaces with different workforces at different times.  </p><p>The measurement of CO<sub>2</sub>levels was recommended by the Government&rsquo;s expert group on ventilation as an effective measure of identifying poorly ventilated, multi-occupant and enclosed indoor areas.  The work safety protocol set out how these monitors should be used in the workplace.  However, a high CO<sub>2</sub>monitor reading is not a proxy for risk of exposure to Covid-19 but, rather, for identifying poor ventilation.  This needs to be fully appreciated when reading CO<sub>2</sub>levels, as well as the fact that other sources of CO<sub>2</sub>exist in certain workplaces.  That is why we think regulations that can be changed and adjusted as we move on are important.</p></speech>

Has preparatory work begun to incorporate these recommendations into legislation given that, as we know, the European Council has given the green light to the EU directive on adequate minimum wages and collective bargaining on 4 October?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00800"><p>Collective bargaining is an important element of ensuring good industrial relations in Ireland.  Industrial relations stability comes from a voluntarist system where the State does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but will assist them at arriving at one.  This approach has served us well in resolving many complex and protracted disputes.  However, our laws are very weak when parties refuse to engage.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, I appointed a high-level working group under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, to review collective bargaining and the industrial relations landscape.  I want to record my appreciation to the group, the employer and trade union representatives and its chairperson, Professor Michael Doherty of Maynooth University, for their hard work in concluding this report.  The report was published earlier this month and is now available to the public on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  The report is timely, as we need to keep abreast of developments at EU level, which require us to promote the capacity of social partners to engage in effective collective bargaining systems.  The EU directive on minimum wages and collective bargaining was adopted by the European Council on 4 October and I welcome the directive&rsquo;s focus on strengthening collective bargaining structures in member States.</p>  <p>  The way forward is by no means predetermined and we have to work through the various legal hurdles and legislative issues in this area.  I have asked my Department to carefully consider the report, consult with stakeholders and develop proposals for the Government in respect of its implementation.  These proposals may well include examining how recommendations need to be incorporated into legislation.  I am pleased to inform the House that this work is already under way.</p>  <p>   I look forward to continuing to engage, through the LEEF, on the issues raised in the report and how we can continue to promote positive industrial relations in Ireland.</p></speech>

I want to particularly thank Patricia King, the outgoing general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a former colleague and, indeed, a very good friend of mine.  I wish her well in her retirement.  I also wish Owen Reidy, the incoming general secretary, well.  He has much work to do.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s answer does not fill me with an awful lot of optimism that this will get moving quickly.  We need to expand the percentage of workers who are covered by some form of collective bargaining.  It is clear that we need legislation to be able to facilitate this.  It is not our job as legislators to organise workers; we know that.  However, it is our job to create the conditions for workers to be able to organise.  As I have said many times on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber and in other places, the best way for a worker to ensure that his or her voice is heard at work is to join his or her trade union and be active in it.  Unfortunately, however, the system as it currently stands facilitates employers effectively ignoring not just their trade union, but the will of their own workforce.</p></speech>

I interacted with her in many ways and on many levels in the past ten years or so.  She is a very impressive person and I wish her the best in her future.  As the Deputy is aware, Ms King will continue to be a member of the commission on housing and to bring her expertise to the table in that regard.  In addition, I congratulate Owen Reidy on his recent appointment to his new role in ICTU.</p>  <p>  To give the Deputy some assurance, we will get moving on this.  The new directive is now European law.  It is not a choice.  We cannot ignore it, nor do we want to.  The European directive requires us to have 70% or 80% of the working population covered by some form of collective bargaining.  That does not necessarily mean being a member of a trade union or trade union recognition; it can be done through joint labour committees, JLCs, or different mechanisms.  It is absolutely the case, however, that we need to make progress in this regard.  We are only at about 30%, so the gap is large.  I anticipate that there will be legislative change next year.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste stated, trade union density is at a low level and that means protection for workers is at a low level because the two things are interlinked.</p>  <p>  An issue that is not expressly related to this but on which the T&aacute;naiste and I have corresponded previously is that agencies that are funded by the Government are also ignoring Labour Court recommendations when they do not have the funds to respond.  That makes a mockery of the system.  The quicker we can move to a system of collective bargaining and recognition, the better.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, we may have different views on how that might be done, but we need to expedite this legislation because workers have waited a very long time for this.  Trade union density being at its current level means that protection for workers is at a low level and that needs to change.  Many of the practices that could be stamped out by having collective bargaining and strong unionised workforces were exposed during Covid.  We need to move quickly on this.</p></speech>

I know she will agree, however, that it is important that we get this right.  That is why it will require further engagement with unions and employers.  We also need to have particular regard to small business and how this would operate at the level of a company that might only have one or two employees.  There is a lot to be worked out at this stage.  It is not intended to make Labour Court recommendations legally binding.  The Deputy will be aware of unions that have not respected Labour Court recommendations, particularly in the public transport sector.  That does work both ways.  The fundamental change that needs to come about is there needs to be proper legal procedures where employers refuse to engage.  That is the change I anticipate happening both in terms of refusal to co-operate or participate or to appoint members to JLCs.  As regards the wider issue of where employees want to be represented by a union but their employer states it will not even have a meeting with them, that is not going to be sustainable into the future.</p></speech>

The cost of energy, and the cost of doing business generally, is rising, interest rates are going up and consumer confidence is waning, so businesses need help with their energy bills.  The Government has introduced a significant package in the budget to help them in the coming months.</p>  <p>  This morning, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I launched the &euro;200 million Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  It will be implemented through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and is now open for applications.  It is not limited to client companies of those agencies.  It will assist viable but vulnerable firms of all sizes in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors that are suffering liquidity problems or are affected by severe rises in energy costs as a result of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  The scheme will operate under two streams and will provide between &euro;20,000 and &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available in the markets, thereby reducing additional costs for firms.  For energy-intensive companies impacted by exceptionally severe increases in gas or electricity costs, the scheme will provide for a minimum of &euro;20,000 and a maximum of &euro;2 million per firm.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the climate action plan, the scheme recognises the importance of encouraging sustainability, and successful applicants will be required to put in place an energy efficiency plan.  I point out that the scheme is only for manufacturers and those involved in the internationally traded sectors.</p>  <p>  The scheme will work alongside other measures announced in the budget, such as the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme which will provide &euro;1.2 billion in low-cost lending to business, and the temporary business energy support scheme, administered through the Revenue Commissioners.  The latter scheme is being finalised at present and will have an estimated cost of approximately &euro;1.25 billion.  It will provide energy subsidies to businesses of that level.</p></speech>

I have raised previously with the T&aacute;naiste the need for specific sectoral supports.  I highlight the food processing sector, which is in real trouble, and food retailers.  I recently wrote to finance Ministers regarding a south-east food processing company whose monthly bill has gone from &euro;8,000 to &euro;48,000.  Just last night, I was in discussion with Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland.  More than 650 butcher shops are facing increases in their electricity rates, with bills rising from less than &euro;1,000 to more than &euro;4,500 per month.  That is unsustainable.  Two butcher shops closed in the past week alone.  There is a need for urgency here.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste stated that the TBESS is due to open.  When will it be available to be accessed?  These businesses will not remain viable for much longer.  Many of these small butcher shops are very much integrated in the rural and regional economy and employ between two and eight people each.  This is an indigenous sector that badly needs to be supported.</p></speech>

The scheme announced this morning is now open for applications through the agencies.  I will have to double check to be certain, but I think food processing should be covered under the scheme because it is the manufacture of food products and most of our food is exported, so I anticipate that the companies to which the Deputy refers could apply under the scheme.  They would have to demonstrate that their energy bills constitute a significant amount of their turnover and that their profits are down.  This may be an option for some of them.</p>  <p>  I need to be frank with the House, however.  We are not going to be in a position to cover fully the cost of increases in electricity bills for business, no more than we can do it for households.  There are limitations on the budget even though the economy is going well.  We know the effect of unlimited price promises across the water.  We are not going to do that.  We are not going to be able to cover fully the increased cost, unfortunately.  In addition, we are covered by EU temporary crisis framework state aid rules.  They are there for good reasons, namely, to protect the taxpayer and to ensure that different countries do not engage in unfair competition.</p></speech>

I welcome the news of the Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  I hope the company to which I referred will be able to access funding under the scheme.</p>  <p>  There are incredible challenges right across the business and SME sectors, particularly for companies such as food processors which are using large amounts of gas or electricity and whose business model has been completely destroyed.  We need to have a clear strategy in terms of what we are trying to do.  I accept, as I am sure does every other Member, that we cannot save every business, but we do need to have a serious look at the businesses that can be saved, particularly those that contribute to Tourism Ireland and our tourism offering.  The hospitality and retail sectors are part of that.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste clarified when the TBESS scheme will be open and business will be able to access funding from it.  That is what these small businesses need, particularly now.  They just need some relief from the bills they are facing.</p></speech>

The temporary business energy support scheme requires legislation.  The Finance Bill has to get through this House and the Seanad before that scheme can be up and running.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>Presuming we get the Finance Bill through the Houses, and I believe we will, we would expect it to be up and running by the end of November or early December.  Any payments will be backdated to September.  Businesses can be assured that they will receive money through the Revenue Commissioners before Christmas to help them with their energy bills, not just going forward but backdated to September.  </p></speech>

Indeed, he has commented on it previously.  In a half-mile triangle in the town we now have three companies employing 2,300 people.  That is certain to grow with Abbott Diagnostics, Avery Dennison Medical and Technimark Ireland all focused on growth plans.  Mindful of the importance of foreign direct investment, FDI, for provincial Ireland, I ask the Minister of State to update the House on the IDA's plans for an advanced building solution for Longford town.</p></reply>

As the House knows, regional development is at the centre of IDA Ireland's current strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024.  Under this strategy the IDA is targeting half of all investments to regional locations which aligns with the objectives of the programme for Government.  Specifically, the IDA is targeting 25 investments for the midlands region, including Longford, in the period from 2021 to 2024.</p>  <p>  Longford, as Deputy Flaherty has said, is already home to six IDA Ireland client companies directly employing more than 1,300 people and has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with strengths in life science, technology, global business services, international financial services and engineering in industrial technologies.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the specific question from Deputy Flaherty, IDA Ireland has advised me that the site selection process for the advanced building solution in Longford is ongoing.  The IDA continues to liaise with Longford County Council and with wider stakeholders as it seeks to find a suitable site for the proposed facility.  </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, innovative and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions that meet the needs of our multinational community remains essential to winning FDI.  Over the last five years the IDA regional property programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.  In a competitive and uncertain global environment, the IDA's regional property programme, supported by my Department, ensures the supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations, as required by current and prospective clients of both IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The IDA's plan is to deliver 19 advanced building solutions in 15 regional locations across the country, including in Athlone, Longford and Mullingar.  National capital investment plans outlined in the new IDA strategy, subject to planning permission and public procurement processes, are expected to commence and be delivered within the term of the new strategy at all identified locations.  The Exchequer allocation for the IDA regional property programme in 2022 includes an additional &euro;10 million, bringing the budget for that programme to &euro;52 million.</p></speech>

Technimark Ireland is nearing completion of a new wing at its factory in Longford town and will shortly be adding 100 staff to its workforce.  In the coming days, we are expecting Abbott Diagnostics to lodge a planning application for a major expansion at its plant in Longford town which, doubtless, will lead to additional employment there also.  Throughout the period of the crash we saw the importance of FDI for provincial Ireland.  The towns that prospered or survived best during that time were those that had the benefit of tourism or of FDI.  The Minister of State will be very familiar with the importance of tourism in the context of Westport and many of the provincial towns in Mayo but where there was no tourism, it was those towns that had the benefit and the crutch of FDI that did best.  Notwithstanding the successes to date in Longford, it is critical that the Department makes it an absolute priority to ensure that IDA Ireland delivers a new advanced building solution for Longford town without any further delay.  I am conscious that there is a commitment to deliver before 2024 but we are now at the end of 2022.  This is an absolute priority for Longford.</p></speech>

In addition to that, the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, investment of &euro;10.4 million in the Camlin Quarter in Longford town, the rural regeneration development fund, RRDF, investment of &euro;1.1 million in Granard, along with the investments in Ballymahon through the very successful Center Parcs project, demonstrate a whole-of-county approach that is essential for attracting FDI.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks we have also engaged with the chair of the Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan on its work.

By way of an update, the Carlow facility is almost ready, while the one in Cavan is expected to be ready in 2023.  The IDA has recently purchased lands in Kerry, while the facilities at Galway, Dundalk, Monaghan and Sligo have all been built.  Planning permission was recently granted for a facility in Athlone and the plans for Mullingar are advancing.  As the Minister of State said, there is a commitment to deliver plants in Longford, Mullingar and Athlone before 2024.  I implore the Minister of State to visit Longford at his earliest convenience to meet officials from Longford County Council.  It behoves the local authority to take the lead on this and acquire a site.  On that basis, there would be no excuse for the IDA but to press ahead.  The quest for a site has been dragging on for too long.  We need the local authority to take the lead on this and then IDA Ireland can follow through with the investment.</p></speech>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists.  Doctors, including non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are on the critical skills list.</p>  <p>  The critical skills employment permit is targeted at highly skilled people in eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland's economy and who are in significant short supply in our labour market.  The permit provides for immediate family reunification and broad access to the labour market for dependants, spouses and partners, as well as for fast-tracking to long-term residency after two years.  The criteria attached to this permit type include the requirement for the non-EEA national to have secured a job offer and employment contract of at least two years.  As most NCHD contracts tend to be six to 12 months in duration, until recently these doctors had to apply for a general employment permit which had to be renewed after each contract.  To reduce this administrative burden, my Department, working with the Department of Health, introduced a new two-year multi-site general employment permit in November 2021.  This new permit for non-EEA doctors was established to eliminate the requirement for a new permit for each six-month rotation, thereby reducing the administrative burden on the Department, the HSE, hospitals and, most importantly, on the doctors themselves.  This new permit is only available to public hospitals who hold trusted partner status with the Department.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of this new permit, the doctor is required to provide a new contract and location to the Department at the end of each rotation, rather than applying for a new permit each time.  At the end of the two-year period, the doctor will be eligible to apply to my Department for a stamp 4 support letter, which will put him or her on a pathway to permanent residency.  Previously, this was only issued after a five-year period.</p>  <p>  To coincide with the introduction of this new permit, the Department of Justice created a new stamp 1H, which is issued to all doctors who hold a multi-site general employment permit.  This new permission requires doctors to register yearly with the Department of Justice, as well as providing a stamp 1G permission to spouses of these doctors, allowing them to access the labour market without the need for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  In addition to this new permit, in March 2022 the opening of the temporary fast track to stamp 4 permission scheme was announced.  All non-EEA doctors working in the State for more than two years while holding a general employment permit between 2018 and 2022 can apply to my Department for a stamp 4 support letter.</p></speech>

Any change being brought about which will facilitate the recruitment of doctors such that a very fast mechanism is in place is important.  As for the scheme now in place, however, is there a need to set up a review of it in, say, six months to see how it is working and to see if any further changes can be made in order to make sure we are not losing people with the medical skills to other jurisdictions?  We are competing with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.  Therefore, we need to be fast and efficient in dealing with applications.  Can a review process be put in place in, say, 12 months to see how the scheme is working, if further changes need to be made and if there are glitches in the system that need to be resolved?</p></speech>

We keep this under review.  The changes were put in place last November in our Department and then the Departments of Health and Justice followed suit.  The three Departments are working quite closely to try to prioritise this area.</p>  <p>  When it comes to judgments on the permits, we have made a lot of changes in our own Department to streamline that overall process and to be responsive.  The time for most permit applications is down to a couple of weeks now.  We have for a long number of years prioritised all cases related to health.</p>  <p>  The system is probably correct now.  It allows us to compete for talent, certainly when it comes to medical doctors, all over the world.  I think we compare quite favourably with any other jurisdiction.  We keep this under review and engage with the Departments of Health and Justice quite regularly on it.  As late as yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I and our officials all met again to review the system in general in order to see how we can align our services to make them as fast and efficient as possible.  When it comes to critical skills, we want to be able to react quickly.  I believe we can do so, but we will keep this under review.  If Deputy Burke has any issues he wants to raise directly, that is no problem at all.  I am happy to meet him.</p></speech>

It is causing huge frustration and there needs to be more co-ordination between Departments on it.  The Minister of State talked about going across his Department and the Department of Health.  His Department is also going across the Department Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a big issue as regards people being on emergency tax for a long time.  It is frustrating people and they are tending to say "I am getting out of here" because of the tax structure and the lack of a more structured process.  Once a person gets one contract, they should not have to go onto emergency tax if they move in six months' time.  That is not an issue for the Minister of State's Department but it is a case of all Departments needing to work together to try to make sure we streamline the process for these people who are coming into this country and providing a valuable service.</p></speech>

It is important that we have streamlined the process.  It is now much more accommodating to the situation regarding stamp 4 and family reunification.  The issues the Deputy raises probably cross over with the Department of Finance and Revenue as well as the Department of Social Protection.  I am certainly happy to raise them.  We have been for a long number of years trying to implement a lot more cross-departmental arrangements to solving problems, and that is working quite well.  I will raise the issues the Deputy raises.  If there are any others, I ask him to let us know because we value the expertise of the people coming to work here.  We need them to complement our own talent.  Changes have been made in respect of the number of doctors coming through our education system.  We would encourage the continuation of that work along with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in that area.  We are very much open to working cross-departmentally.  I will bring any issues the Deputy raises to the relevant Departments.</p></speech>

Understandably, a lot of businesses are very worried heading into the winter.  The cost of energy and the cost of doing business more broadly is rising.  Interest rates are going up and consumer confidence is waning.  Businesses need help with their energy bills so the Government has introduced a significant package in the budget to help them over the coming months.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the temporary business energy support scheme has been designed to help eligible businesses that have experienced a significant increase in their electricity or natural gas costs.  It will apply to trades, professions and new businesses and is currently being finalised as part of the Finance Bill, which is progressing through the Houses.</p>  <p>  This morning, along with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, I launched the new &euro;200 million Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  That is for manufacturers and internationally traded firms.  It will provide up to &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available and up to &euro;2 million per firm for those businesses that are particularly energy-intensive.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;1.2 billion State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will help the wider business sector with liquidity and help it invest in energy efficiency.  I received Government approval earlier this week to publish the legislation to underpin this, which I will bring through the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Also, a new State-backed growth and sustainability loan scheme will be opened next year and will be the successor to the future growth loan scheme.</p>  <p>  The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until 28 February 2023.</p>  <p>  This is very much an evolving situation, though.  We understand the scale of the energy crisis and I assure the Deputies that we will respond with scale.</p></speech>

To what extent might a short-term and longer-term response be forthcoming if it is found necessary, given that many of the contributory factors to the dramatic oil price increases are likely to continue for a considerable time?  In those circumstances what might now be the best approach to make provision for the long battle that lies ahead?</p></speech>

The schemes being announced are very welcome and will make an enormous difference, but the energy costs of businesses like the retail businesses ringing me, particularly supermarkets, are now going up threefold.  Those businesses are very genuine.  They are huge employers in the area and they are asking if there will be latitude in the level of support provided.  The temporary business energy support scheme provides 40% off their energy costs, but in many cases their energy costs have now trebled.  I had one supermarket on to me whose costs have gone from &euro;16,000 per month to &euro;48,000 in the past month alone, and they will go even higher again.</p>  <p>  All the schemes are great.  I just want to know if there will be latitude in the percentage discount the Government can give under the temporary business energy support scheme.  Will the Department have further flexibility in being able to extend the scheme beyond February of next year if the energy crisis continues?  Furthermore, is there flexibility under the scheme to allow for charities, which operate very much in supporting sectors?</p></speech>

Its latest bill is for &euro;8,000.  The story relating to the company is on the front page of our local paper as a result of the fact that it is asking its customers to leave early in the afternoon because it cannot afford to light the shop, cook the food or keep the fridges going the way it wants to.  I welcome all of the T&aacute;naiste's announcements and the work he is doing but businesses under a certain size find it much harder to bear the increased costs of their heating and cooling operations, particularly butchers like Callaghans in Ardee, the Bare Food Company and Tuites Butchers in Drogheda.  Many people have serious worries.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look again at smaller businesses, which do not have the margin capacity of larger businesses to shift their profit and losses on different accounts.</p></speech>

However, there are constraints - much more so than would have been the case during the pandemic.  Now that the cost of Government borrowing is rising, we are in a different place compared with where we were two or three years ago.  There are budget limits and we are not in a position to say to any household or business that we cover the full cost of its increased energy bills.  In fairness, I do not think anyone is calling for or expects that.</p>  <p>  We are also constrained by the EU temporary crisis framework, which comprises a set of European rules that are not just there to annoy us.  Those rules are there for a good reason, namely, to ensure that taxpayers' money is protected and that different countries do not out-compete each other with better subsidies all the time.  That is just a beggar-my-neighbour attitude.  The temporary crisis framework is there to protect us from that.  Under the framework, we are only permitted to cover 30% of the increase in energy costs.  We are trying to push that to 40% but I do not want to raise expectations that it will be possible to do better than 40% because that is not the feedback we are getting from the Commission or other member states.  We can always look at other ways of helping businesses beyond energy supports.  We have done that with the VAT reduction and perhaps there are other ways.</p>  <p>  In the short term, the focus will be on the Government-backed loans, the energy subsidy and the new emergency scheme we announced today.  In the medium to long term, the EU temporary crisis framework will allow us to extend these interventions beyond the end of February.  They can be extended to the end of next year, but, obviously, no decision has been made on that nor can it be at this stage.  The longer-term approach is quite different.  It involves ramping up investment in renewables so we are less dependent on oil and gas and encouraging businesses to adopt energy efficiency.  I have heard of some businesses that have reduced their energy bills dramatically just by covering their fridges, but I also know of plenty of businesses that have done everything right and are still facing very high energy bills.</p>  <p>  Under the schemes operated by my Department and the Department of Finance, charities are not covered unless they have a trading income.  There is a fund to help charities and sports clubs in a different way.  This is run by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></speech>

In the event of there being a long battle, for want of a better word, against fuel price increases, has there been any investigation into the possibility of replacement by renewables?  Can that be speeded up to give confidence to those in the sector in order that they can plan ahead knowing what is likely to happen in the future and knowing the necessity of competing in the marketplace among their peers and those who might be hostile?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he is willing to consider with businesses and understand the constraints under which he is operating regarding energy supports and the European Commission, that he will keep other supports under consideration and that he has the flexibility to extend the supports beyond the end of February depending on the position regarding the energy crisis.  When will businesses see the money hit their bank accounts under the temporary business energy support scheme and when they will get the arrears back to September?</p></speech>

There may be grants available to businesses, particularly smaller ones, to upgrade their heating facilities and find the most efficient and effective way of using energy, although I am not familiar with them.  Is advice available to them regarding how they can reduce their costs in this regard?  Is there a possibility of special grants to allow them to upgrade their fridges or cooking facilities to make them more efficient?  We need to put pressure on energy companies as well.  In particular, the ESB makes huge profits.  I know the money is going to the State, but I am concerned that not enough is coming back down to smaller businesses.</p>  <p>  It may not be a major issue but is there an option to introduce rates relief for businesses, particularly smaller businesses, that can prove their energy costs have increased exponentially?  Are there any other supports or strategies in other countries that we could look at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700008#F00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  There is room for bio-renewables as part of the new energy mix.  One company in Cork, whose representatives I met recently makes boilers.  It was explained to me how you could move away from using oil for those boilers to a blend or bio-renewables.  I do not know enough about the matter to comment too much, but I take the Deputy's point that we need to give confidence to people around price and policy before they invest.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  Like many people in this House, I engage with business a lot, whether that be on an individual level, with businesspeople and employers, representative groups headquartered in Dublin or chambers of commerce all around the country.  All of them are raising the issue of energy costs with me.  I still say that the difficulty involved in finding staff is probably as significant an issue, perhaps even more so.  It is interesting to hear that.  We must think about the policy wisdom of subsidising businesses while other businesses cannot get staff.  You could have two restaurants in the one town, one of which is doing okay and could do better but cannot get staff and another that is really struggling but has staff.  We must think about the wisdom of subsidising businesses at a time when other businesses cannot get any staff at all.</p>  <p>  The temporary business energy support scheme is contingent on the Finance Bill being passed.  The Minister for Finance's target is to get it through by the end of November, which means the scheme can be open at the end of November or in early December.  The subsidy will be backdated to September, so we anticipate businesses getting a substantial amount of cash from Revenue to cover some of their energy bills before Christmas.  That is certainly the plan at the moment.  In fairness to Revenue, it has proven to be very efficient with the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme in the past.  In such circumstances, I would have a lot of confidence in it.</p>  <p>  The Government has 20 schemes to help businesses to reduce their energy use and use renewables.  The best port of call for small businesses would be the local enterprise office but much of it is doing through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The rules around solar panels have been changed so that pretty much any business in the country can put a solar panel on its roof without needing planning permission.  There are few exceptions but not many.  We hope to launch a new grant scheme in the very near future that will help businesses with the capital cost of investing in renewables and energy saving - up to 50% in some cases.</p> <p>Businesses tell me that there is a great deal of help with audits, consultancy and advice, but maybe not enough when it comes to doing the work that needs to be done, whether it is with the small turbine, the solar panel, the insulation, the fridge doors or whatever.  This is on the way.</p> <p> Turning to the issue of relief from commercial rates, there is no plan to do this at present.  Commercial rates are an important source of income for local authorities.

This is welcome.  I would appreciate any additional details the T&aacute;naiste may have, particularly regarding the total new acreage and if the site will be serviced.  This addition will provide some 44 or 45 acres in total.  This will be a great advantage to the town, especially if, or when, it is serviced.</p></reply>

He has a keen interest in ensuring that we get more employment and investment into Drogheda.  The new IDA Ireland land bank at the Mell in Drogheda forms part of IDA Ireland's long-term strategic plans to position Drogheda and the wider mid-east region to compete for FDI.  I have been advised that since acquiring this land bank last year, IDA Ireland has undertaken an infrastructural review on servicing and how best to position the land bank for a potential major investment.  The project is at the concept review stage now and a multidisciplinary team has been appointed by IDA Ireland.  This review is ongoing and progressing well.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland and Louth County Council have agreed terms on the transfer of seven acres to IDA Ireland.  This transfer is currently the subject of a conveyancing process.  Once the transfer is complete, it will increase IDA Ireland's current landholding to 46 acres and enhance the marketability and attractiveness of the lands to potential investors.  In recent years, IDA Ireland has worked with companies on investments and expansions in County Louth, including WUXI, Wasdell, Almac, PCI Pharma Services, Amazon Web Services, AWS, and Simply NUC.  IDA Ireland is pleased to have acquired these two land banks which will enhance its ability to bring capital intensive projects of significant scale to the area.</p></speech>

It is good news indeed.  It shows joined-up thinking and, literally, joined-up land, which increases road frontage.  This site is especially well located as it is beside the motorway.  We had significant investment, particularly with AWS building in the town.  Areas with these types of data centres need these companies to invest.  People who need data need to be beside their data.  Hopefully, the fact that AWS is now in Drogheda and operating will make it a more attractive site for inward and other investment by companies that need access to their data in close proximity.  This is extremely good news.  It is very welcome.  I would be grateful if we could get a timeline regarding the servicing of this site.  This is critical.  Once the site is serviced, it will be up and running.  Until that happens, this is a lovely plan but we need the site open and active.</p></speech>

The acquisition of the extra seven acres by IDA Ireland from Louth County Council makes the entire parcel of land much more attractive to investment.  The Deputy knows the geography of the area better than I do, but I know where the site is.  The purchase has not just increased the footprint from 39 acres to 46 acres but has also made this a better-shaped site, if this makes any sense.  As the Deputy said as well, it provides better access to the road and should make it easier to service.  I do not have a timeline for the servicing of the site.  I will keep putting pressure on IDA Ireland in this regard.  I am conscious that, in the context of County Louth, there has been much investment in Dundalk.  There has been a great deal in Drogheda as well, but perhaps not as much.  The AWS development is very welcome in Drogheda and is positive in respect of attracting additional investment to the town.  The number of jobs there is limited, though, and we want to ensure that we use this 46-acre site on the edge of the town for investments that will be jobs-rich.  We want to bring in hundreds of jobs to that site and this is very much what we intend to do.</p></speech>

They are working long hours in contravention of the EU directive.  Currently, they cannot go to the WRC.  The Government has promised on multiple occasions that it will introduce amending legislation to enable the fishers to do so, but it keeps failing to do it.  It is the migrant workers who are losing out.  I will give examples later.</p></reply>

I presume this is the scheme the Deputy is mainly referring to.  The WRC has particular responsibility for checking compliance insofar as terms of employment, permission to work, payment of wages, annual leave, public holidays, and National Minimum Wage Act 2000 entitlements are concerned.</p>  <p>  Hours of work and rest periods of fishers who work under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship on board Irish-registered fishing vessels are governed by the European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Working Hours) Regulations 2019 (SI No 672 of 2019), which are monitored by the Department of Transport.  Marine surveyors of the Department of Transport are authorised officers for the purposes of the enforcement of these regulations and may, where a contravention of the regulations is detected, issue directions to the owner or master of a vessel or detain a vessel.  Proceedings concerning offences under these regulations may be brought by the Minister for Transport.  WRC inspectors currently do not have a statutory function in relation to SI 672/2019.</p>  <p>  Following mediation in April 2019 on the atypical scheme, however, a settlement agreement provided that the Department of Justice would recommend that WRC adjudicators have jurisdiction over violations of the fishing vessel working time hours of rest regulations and that this would be implemented by the appropriate measures to be determined by my Department.  In this regard, our Department has engaged with the Department of Transport and agreed a proposal to extend the WRC's jurisdiction relating to excessive working hours and insufficient breaks and rest periods.  This proposal will be progressed as soon as is practicable in new legislation as part of a package we are working on.  Hopefully, I will be able to provide a further update to the Deputy on this matter soon.  I hope this deals with the specific question tabled.  I think the Deputy wants to go further than this as well, which I am happy to do if there is time.</p></speech>

I do wish to focus on this issue.  The consequence of the Government failing to act on the agreement with the International Transport Workers Federation is that workers like Jose Pame Salandron are not able to vindicate their rights in the WRC.  This is a guy who was working 80 or 90 hours a week regularly.  He went to the WRC and he was awarded, wrongly, &euro;14,000 under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The case then went to the Labour Court and it was stated that this context was not covered.  This is accurate.  His award was then cut down to &euro;4,000.  Mr. Salandron may now be taking a case against the State, which could cost it money under the Francovich damages' principle, which he is seeking, because of the State's failure to transpose the directive.  The Minister of State indicated that this is going to be done as soon as is practicable.  In answering a parliamentary question from Deputy Barry in January, however, he said, "This proposal will be included as a miscellaneous amendment in a legislative instrument in the Spring".  When is this going to be?  I presume it was the Spring of 2022 that was referred to and not the Spring of 2023.  The Government is leaving migrant workers extremely vulnerable to continued massive exploitation and to working 80 to 90 hours a week.  When is this measure going to be progressed?</p></speech>

We are bringing forward this package.  I do not have a timeline for it now.  I will, though, try to get it fast-tracked.  We were waiting for the recommendations and the changes and the review of the atypical worker permission scheme.  The Deputy will agree that it is positive that this scheme will now be changed and replaced by access to the work permits scheme.  A cross-departmental working group is examining this endeavour and these changes will be brought forward in the next couple of months as well.  Overall, then, new legislation will be required.  It is not prepared or ready yet, but I will try to respond to the Deputy with a timeline as fast as we possibly can.  Several Departments are involved in this process and the associated complications.  The commitment was that the WRC would be involved in this and we will follow through on this as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

The reply to the parliamentary question was given in January of this year.  Do the Minister of State and the Government not feel bad that this failure to act has left extremely vulnerable workers ripe for extreme exploitation?  They are being left with no remedy in respect of going to the WRC to deal with being asked to work an illegal number of hours.  The Government continues to fail to transpose the working time at sea directive by not giving workers access to a remedy here.  People like Jose Pame Salandron are being asked to work 80 or 90 hours a week.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he is not alone.  I urge the Government to stop taking its time with this matter.  It is urgent.  The Government should act immediately.</p></speech>

It is not all vessels and it is not all employers.  Where it happens, however, it is awful.</p>  <p>  We have people working 17 hours a day in unconscionably awful conditions.  They are extremely vulnerable.  These are migrant workers.  It is already tough for workers who work on land and who might have access to some resources to vindicate their rights at work.  It is nearly next to impossible for workers at sea - people who are extremely vulnerable - to vindicate their rights.  Collectively, we should be trying to alleviate that to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the International Transport Workers Federation for the work it does.  However, that organisation has to feel that the Government is working against it instead of working with it.  The Government should be working with the federation, particularly as we all have a responsibility to protect these workers.</p></speech>

Most stakeholders with whom I engage in this sector across the different Departments wanted the review of the atypical working scheme prioritised as soon as possible.  To be honest with the Deputies, that is where a lot of our work has gone in.  That review is to be completed.  The recommendations and the report went to Cabinet a few weeks ago, and we can get on with that work to replace the atypical working scheme with the work permit scheme.  That will be beneficial to everybody.  Most Members of the House will agree that was the right area to concentrate our work on.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the atypical working scheme in February 2016, the WRC has been involved in closely monitoring it.  In particular, during the period from when the scheme was launched to 31 October this year, it carried out 530 inspections.  It detected 392 contraventions and completed 251 investigations and 21 prosecutions.  The WRC has also made 45 referrals to the Department of Transport in respect of potential contraventions of the hours of rest and working time regulations enforced by that Department.  There has been ongoing monitoring.  This is to do with the next part that the Deputy is concerned with as well.</p>  <p>  A number of information awareness measures have been introduced by the WRC since 2016 to enhance employment rights awareness and compliance in the fishing industry.  In order to enhance these measures, the WRC consulted last December with 16 relevant stakeholders who were requested to make written submissions in relation to, among other matters, possible additional outreach measures for fishing vessel owners and migrant fishers.  Submissions were received subsequently from five of the 16 stakeholders.  The WRC 2022 report on the outcomes of these consultations sets out a range of actions, including some 23 measures and initiatives currently being progressed.  Such measures include: information provision; awareness and promotion; and direct engagement with officials, vessel owners and representative organisations, taking in training and use of communication and social media channels.</p>  <p>  There is much change afoot in the sector, and rightly so.  Those need to be driven across Departments as well.  We are willing to play our part and have been doing so.</p></speech>

The ministerial decision on the TRIPS Agreement provides for a waiver of certain obligations of the agreement and includes clarifications that will allow eligible WTO members to authorise a company to manufacture and export Covid-19 vaccines in a fast and simplified manner and without the consent of the patent owner.  Developing countries will be able to use this solution to authorise the manufacture, import or export of Covid-19 vaccines without prior negotiation with the patent owner and without any notification requirements that would delay the start of the manufacture or export.  Equally important is the clarification that the remuneration for patent owners may take account of humanitarian or not-for-profit purpose of production and hence support the production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines at affordable prices for those in need.</p>  <p>  The ministerial decision covers Covid-19 vaccines as well as the ingredients and processes necessary for their manufacture.  At the time of the adoption of the decision, there was no consensus among the members to cover also Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.  As a compromise, paragraph 8 of the decision stipulates that no later than six months from the date of that decision, which would bring us to 17 December next, members will be expected to decide on whether to extend the decision to cover the production and supply of Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>  <p>  Deputies will already be aware that trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, and, accordingly, the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  The EU is in the process of conducting internal consultations and analysis on the extension, taking into consideration that the case for Covid-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is more complex than the one pertaining to vaccines.  Discussions on the extension of the mechanism to cover the production and supply of Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are ongoing at the WTO.  The EU is engaging constructively in these discussions.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position.  A decision to extend the earlier ministerial decision from June will require the agreement of all WTO members.  The next main date is December, if we are to stay within the six month-period.  We will certainly update Deputies after that session as well.</p></speech>

The Minister of State spoke for a long time but he did not say what Ireland's position is.  Does Ireland support extending the TRIPS waiver to diagnostics - technology other than vaccines - or does it not?  Does it stand with the poorest people in the world who want to get access to the technology to be able to test for Covid, etc., or does it stand with the big pharmaceutical companies that want to keep a monopoly on those technologies in order to maximise their profits?</p>  <p>  Where does Ireland stand?  That is important to know because what is being reported is that the obstructive position in the talks is being taken by the EU, the UK, Canada and Japan which are seeking to delay progress in relation to that.

The decision that was agreed in June falls far short of what was asked by countries, led by India and others, in October 2020.  They asked for a lot more.</p>  <p>  Here we are now.  In the beginning, there might have been some excuse, although I do not think there was.  We were reacting.  Now there has been time for reflection.  Is our voice being heard at EU level to say this has to be extended in a fair manner to diagnostics, tests and treatments?  Is that happening?  Where is our voice?</p>  <p>  The Government continuously tells us that trade is an EU competency.  We know that.  We do not need the Minister of State to keep telling us that.

Ireland has always taken a prominent position on that within the EU.  They hold the competency for this and we contribute to that.  Our officials in Dublin, Brussels and Geneva are involved in a round of negotiations since that meeting nearly four and a half months ago in preparing for the next round, which is on 17 December, and we are feeding into that.</p>  <p>  The EU is in the process of engaging with various stakeholders, conducting internal consultations and analysing available information to gain an understanding, and we are feeding into that as well.  We have always had the view - we are clear from an Irish point of view - that we had to find the best way to get access to what was on offer while protecting the intellectual property, IP, as well.  Deputy Paul Murphy and I differ on that.  We believe that one must protect an IP regime to encourage more people to invest in that and to invest in future medicines and future therapeutics, and health services as well.  If one does not have that regime right, one will lose out on that investment and everyone - developing countries or not - suffers.</p> <p>We have been feeding in to try to find the best way.  We have always made it clear that the opportunity to manufacture and access the infrastructure on the ground was important.  We have made a lot of progress since the previous talks.  The conversation has moved on and that is the part in which the EU is involved.  The talks are politically sensitive and they involve many countries.  The EU has been one of the leaders in this and we have made some progress since the previous talks.  I will be able to update Deputy Murphy after the December meeting.  I am afraid that is as far as we can go today.</p></speech>

We are asking a question.  The answer of the Minister of State, repeatedly, was to say we are feeding in to find the best way.  I have no idea what this means.  Is Ireland at European Council level pushing for the EU to support the extension of the waiver or is it not?  We have the right to know what position the Irish Government is taking.  The Minister of State does not, or certainly should not, have the right to come in here and talk nonsense and not say anything.  He says he supports the intellectual property.  If the Government's position is that the right of the companies to profit and the right of Ireland to get a small amount of corporation tax should come before the lives of millions of people the Minister of State should come and argue that position and let us have a debate about it.  To hide Ireland's position in language stating that we are feeding in to try to find the best way is quite craven.  Come out and say what is the Irish Government's position.  If the Irish Government supports the extension of that waiver that is great.  Clearly that is what I think we should be doing.  It is not acceptable to refuse to answer the question.  The negotiations are happening now.  As the Minister of State said, this has to be done by 17 December.  It will be scandalous if the Irish Government stands with the pharmaceutical companies and not billions of people around the world.</p></speech>

I understand he is in possession of a letter from more than 18 non-governmental organisations, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  They have pointed out that less than 20% of people in the poorest countries are fully vaccinated.  At the same time high-income countries account for 75% of total known supplied details of all existing therapeutics.  Within a minute one cannot read out the letter.  The NGOs are deeply disappointed that the WTO TRIPS decision, made on 17 June and endorsed by the Irish Government, was not comprehensive.</p>  <p>  We are speaking about health.  There is no point in making Ireland safe if other countries are not safe.  If we endorsed a system that enriched a small number of pharmaceutical companies beyond belief on public money let us learn from it.  Let us stop praising the wonderful pharmaceutical companies that did this on public money.  Perhaps at some point the Minister of State might tell us how much public money went into it.  He might also tell us how many vaccine doses we have given to COVAX.  I do not expect him to have the answers now.  We are constantly trying to get information.  At this point I am just asking for leadership to let our voice be heard.</p></speech>

We have to reflect on what progress has already been made on access to the vaccine since we discussed this when people raised it previously.  The ministerial decision on the TRIPS agreement provides for a waiver of certain obligations of the TRIPS agreement.  It includes clarifications that will allow eligible WTO members to authorise a company to manufacture and export Covid-19 vaccines in a fast and simplified manner and without the consent of the patent owner.  There have been major changes.  Developing countries will be able to use this solution to authorise the manufacture, import or export of Covid-19 vaccines without prior negotiation with the patent owner and without notification requirements that would delay the start of the manufacture or export.</p>  <p>  Equally important is the clarification that the remuneration for patent owners may take account of a humanitarian or not-for-profit purpose of production and hence support the production supply of Covid-19 vaccines at affordable prices for those in need.  The decision that has been made will simplify to the maximum the process to export vaccines and their ingredients to other developing countries.  This includes waiving various prior notification packaging or labelling requirements.  It will also enable developing countries to scale up production capacity and supply vaccines to other eligible members.  It will also support the establishment of manufacturing hubs that rely on supply chains in multiple countries.  This will facilitate, for instance, filling and finishing capacity in several countries.  The outcome maintains the protection of intellectual property as opposed to waving intellectual property rights.  This is a key element for developing countries not only to benefit from the innovation the system sustains but also to have an environment that incentivises investment the international community should make to boost capacity and diversification in the production of vaccines and pharmaceutical products more broadly throughout the world.</p>  <p>  I have argued previously that the successful production of new vaccines and new medicines involves public money and private money.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about this.  There was an investment of private money well before this.  We have to make sure the intellectual property regime protects both of these investments and enhances the best opportunities.  We believe Ireland's role in our negotiations through the EU in the trade talks has assisted with these changes.  We will continue to take this approach in the coming months until 17 December.  They are negotiations.  We are part of negotiations through the EU and the WTO that involve more than 150 companies.

I do not have all the figures here today but I ask Deputy Connolly to trust me that the private end has been higher than the public end for a long number of years.  Let us be fair about this.  It is important that we maximise the opportunity.  We differ on the need to have a blend of public and private money in research.  To me it is about how we maximise the impact of expenditure.  This is done by combining the two in many ways.  This is not an approach shared by Deputy Paul Murphy.  I am not sure of the approach of Deputy Connolly but I know Deputy Murphy believes it should be all taxpayers' money.  I believe that would miss out on opportunities that we have to build on.</p>  <p>  With regard to COVAX I do not have the figures but I will get them for Deputy Connolly.</p></speech>

We undertook an extensive consultation with the public, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties over the summer.  We also held a symposium on the project earlier this month.</p>  <p>  The White Paper will seek to articulate what needs to be done differently to realise our aspirations for our economy in 2030 and beyond.  It will set out the risks we face, the policy choices and, importantly, the trade-offs we will need to consider.  It will also seek to confirm what elements of the ecosystem are working well and what should be continued or adapted in the context that Ireland's enterprise and industrial policy which has, to date, served us well.</p>  <p>  Prioritising sustainable indigenous industry, as Deputy Connolly has identified, will be an important theme of the White Paper.  It will also cover entrepreneurship, innovation, scaling companies, the twin transitions of digital and green, investment in skills and education and competitiveness among other issues.  The outcome will likely be one of evolution and adaptation rather than revolution.  My ambition for the White Paper is that it will contribute to a more prosperous, equitable and sustainable Ireland.</p></speech>

The White Paper will be crucial to set out the policy for Ireland.  I had hoped to make a submission.  I read all the documentation and I got as far as writing a draft submission.  I took the trouble to read it and what troubles me is that in theory we will make a change but the documentation I read suggests that we are continuing in the same direction.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Rural and Community Development will also deal with my next point in the next business.  We do not yet have a policy for sustainable living on the islands and for supporting what is being done there with indigenous industries.  I will take as examples areas in which I have taken a particular interest.  One of these is seaweed - the Minister is nodding his head.  We have got nowhere with this as an indigenous industry.  Another is wool, which I discussed yesterday.  We have spent &euro;100,000 on being told the possibilities for wool.  In the scheme of the big accountancy firms this is not much but it is still a lot.  The possibilities for wool include everything from insulation to fertilisers but we have done nothing.  These are the examples that come to mind very quickly.</p></speech>

It is a non-statutory process and if the Deputy or any other Oireachtas Member wants to make a submission even at this late stage they are very welcome to do so.  Our industrial policy down the years has served us very well.  We have done well in our economic success, full employment, high levels of prosperity and high living standards in a ranking of 200 countries.  It is largely based on trade and exports.  It is not just about foreign direct investment.  People often do not know this but there are as many people working now in Enterprise Ireland companies and Irish-owned exporting companies as there are in IDA Ireland companies.  The objective of the White Paper is to give us a high-level roadmap on where we go from here to consolidate the gains we have made and to consider what the next wave of industries we need to invest in will be.</p> <p>Many of them will be in the digital space as well as the green space, such as in renewables, circular economy and new products, some of which the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister who will be dealing with the next questions on the progress that has been made.  However, we have been waiting on the policy for the islands for so long and on interdepartmental reports.</p>  <p>  Going back to the topic of seaweed, these are good news stories we are ignoring.  I am only picking two or three, the latest of which was the story on wool.  You read a report that tells you about the potential of wool, only for the Government to do a Pontius Pilate and says it is up to the industry.  The industry has not done it.  The farmers who depend on sheep and say they are not getting any price for their wool, are begging for help and leadership on this.  Of course they will work with the Government, but it has not happened.  Therefore, the new policy must look at indigenous industries in a real way and look at regional imbalance.  The Minister of State seated beside the Minister knows very well that the north west has been downgraded by Europe for the second time.  There is something seriously wrong here in that we are not taking charge with a different vision of the possibilities that exist, with the people on the ground, and having co-ops as a serious part of that vision.</p></speech>

The policy commits to developing an effective rural-proofing model within the lifetime of the policy.  This will aim to ensure Departments fully consider the effects of new proposals on rural communities and the need to better target the particular challenges and opportunities facing rural areas.</p>  <p>  Building a on rural-proofing report my Department commissioned, I also recently hosted the 13th OECD international rural development conference.  This event provided a further valuable insight on how the challenge of rural proofing is being addressed in other countries.  To develop a rural-proofing model that is effective, it must be seen as a valuable tool to support the objectives of multiple Departments and not just the Department responsible for rural development.  It must be focused on delivering positive outcomes for rural communities and the achievement of Government objectives.</p>  <p>  My officials are in discussions with a number of Departments to pilot a new rural-proofing model as an aid to effective policymaking.  This process will identify particular policy areas or initiatives that can benefit from the application of a rural lens to policy development.  The pilot approach will serve to underpin the development of an effective, efficient, and implementable rural-proofing model that will support rural development and ensure we maximise the opportunities for rural areas to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

She said the report was completed and that she hoped to receive it shortly.  Will she tell us more about the next steps?  She also mentioned this is to be done within the lifetime of the policy, which is until 2025.  Will she provide us with more information on the timeframe?</p>  <p>  The implementation of a rural-proofing mechanism is very important.  The EU Commission has again downgraded the west and north west for a second time, which it now considers a lagging region.  That is very concerning.  It tells us the west and north west is not getting an equal share of investment and infrastructure.  Alarm bells should be ringing given we have been downgraded to a region in transition and now to a lagging region, the only region in Ireland in such a situation.  That gives reason for the need of a rural-proofing mechanism, and we must to move on this as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I do not want it to be a box-ticking exercise.  We want other Departments to engage meaningfully, so it is important we get it right.  We do hold other Departments to account through Our Rural Future.  We have a work programme and actions for every year.  I meet with the relevant Ministers in those Departments to make sure I hold them to account on their delivery for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  When I was appointed a Minister of this Government, I made a decision that the Department of Rural and Community Development would be kept as a stand-alone Department.  It is very important that it has not been amalgamated with any other Department.  We have benefited from that through the investment we have got for rural Ireland.  The fact it is stand-alone Department is also a strong signal, from the Government and me, that we are committed to rural development.</p></speech>

That brings me back to the point about the emergency situation in the west and north west, where we are now seen as a lagging region.  We need to turn that into something positive and take as much additional funding as we can get through Europe and make sure it is invested in the west and north west.  We need to turn that situation around.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about engaging with other Departments and holding them to account.  They need to be held to account regarding the region status that is of concern.  The rural-proofing mechanism is one way we can turn that around.  Has there been a response to the change in regional status, and has the Minister engaged with other Departments in that regard?</p></speech>

I am aware of the challenges faced by inland counties, such as my own county of Monaghan, the Deputy&rsquo;s county of Roscommon, Leitrim, and Longford - although not in that region - and I have been focusing additional investment in those areas.</p>  <p>  We are looking at developing a pilot scheme based on the report on rural proofing.  I must note that the OECD conference was very impressed with our policy, Our Rural Future.  The policy was held up as an example of best practice.  Many people attended the conference, with 400 people attending from all over the world, including ministers from Canada, the US, Colombia, the Czech Republic, and other countries.  The OECD said this policy could be a cut-and-paste job for other countries to follow.  What we have here is a good policy.  We review it and set targets every year.  I hold the various Departments to account and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Will she provide up with an update on that?</p></reply>

Rural connectivity is an important element in Our Rural Future.  Such roads represent a vital piece of infrastructure for rural residents, providing access to people&rsquo;s homes and farms as well as outdoor amenities such as lakes, rivers or beaches.</p> <p>LIS was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding in place.  The scheme is administered locally by the relevant local authority, which is responsible for prioritising and selecting eligible applications within broad parameters set by my Department.  I have prioritised the scheme in my Department, and this year alone I have allocated &euro;22 million to LIS.  While there are, of course, competing demands on finite resources, in four of the past six years, additional resources were directed to the scheme mid-year to address strong demand for the scheme across rural Ireland.</p> <p> Since the scheme was reintroduced in 2017, aggregate investment has now surpassed the &euro;100 million mark.  I acknowledge there is strong demand for the scheme and in some counties local authorities have significant levels of applications on hand.  I have asked my officials to engage with local authorities to ascertain what level of applications were in hand in each county and what could be delivered in 2023 should additional funding become available.  I am satisfied that the roads local improvement scheme continues to play an important role in the delivery of our rural development policy, Our Rural Future.</p> <p> When I was growing up, I lived somewhere with a lane nearly a mile long and I know the benefit of the LIS and the difference it can make to rural dwellers, in particular.  It creates access, whether it is a milk or feed lorry or whatever else needs to get in and out of lanes.  It is a good scheme and I am glad we have been able to provide additional funding for it.</p></speech>

She said the same thing last year about her Department reaching out to local authorities to see what they had on their books, what had not been completed and what they could complete by the end of the year.  I presume from the response of the Minister that is happening again now.  It would be useful for all of us to have the figures, local authority by local authority, regarding what is left and what can be completed by the end of this year and into 2023.</p>  <p>  The Minister has said many times that she has engaged with the Department of Transport with a view to it providing additional funding to go along with the funding she provides through her Department.  That would be very welcome.  In the nicest way possible, I wish to ask whether she is meeting resistance from that Department.  It previously funded the scheme and I do not see why it would not make a contribution.  The Minister might be able to come back to me on that.</p></speech>

In fairness to Deputy Michael Ring, when he became Minister in the Department, he started to fund them.  No more than Deputy Kerrane, we are rural Deputies and know the benefits.  He created a fund within the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has a very large capital budget, far in excess of what my Department has.  I am putting 10% of my budget into LIS schemes via the capital budget.  I have raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on a number of occasions and have not made much progress yet.  I am a firm believer that if you do not succeed, you try and try again.  I will continue to keep after the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on this because that Department should match the funding.  If it matched the fund I am putting in place, we would not be long getting rid of the list of LIS schemes.  I spoke to representatives from Leitrim County Council the other day and it has cleared its backlog.  I want to see how we can get rid of the backlog.</p></speech>

I understand that is what her Department is gathering and the information would be helpful.  Perhaps "resistance" is the wrong word, but I know the Minister has raised this matter a number of times with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  Obviously, all of us have a job of work to do in putting it across to him nicely that funding is badly needed.  If we could clear the backlog, perhaps the funding provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development would be enough.  A joint venture between both Departments would be helpful and there is a role to play for the Department of Transport.  All of us, including the Minister, have a job of work to do to convince the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that the funding would be appreciated and well spent.</p></speech>

I know all rural Deputies feel the same.  The issue was raised in the House recently.  Perhaps we can convince the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to help us deal with the backlog and get rid of it.</p>  <p>  As I said, some counties are doing quite well and have nearly cleared their backlog.  Others have more lanes than others.  In my county of Monaghan, there are a serious number of lanes.  Everybody seems to live in a lane when it comes to farming.  That is how things developed over the years.  It is important the councils give us their lists.  When it comes to top-up money during the year, I write to local authorities to ask them what they can deliver by the end of the year.  Some are ambitious and deliver, while others do not put in a request.  It is up to local authorities to decide what they request and can deliver.  It is important the money is spent when I give it to them.  We will keep working on it.</p></speech>

The allocations for each LEADER area have also been announced as part of this process.  The procedure to select LEADER groups will be open, transparent and competitive.  Central to the formation of the groups will be a clear partnership approach, with public and private interest groups coming together to deliver the programme in rural communities throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, &euro;180 million has been committed to the new LEADER programme for 2023 to 2027 and I can confirm that all of this funding will be allocated to the LEADER groups that will be appointed to deliver the new programme.  A number of factors were considered when deciding on the funding allocations.  These included providing a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to each subregional area, with the remaining funding distributed based on population and level of deprivation of the area.  This ensures funding is targeted at the areas most in need of LEADER support.  The views of stakeholders were also taken into account in this regard.  Full details of the selection process and the funding allocation to each county are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  It is now important that the key public and private stakeholders in communities throughout Ireland come together in partnership to deliver the new LEADER programme.  I look forward to seeing the new programme being implemented and ensuring LEADER can continue to deliver real benefits to rural communities throughout Ireland.</p></speech>

A letter co-signed by the chairs of Cork local community development committees, LCDCs, all three of them Fine Gael councillors, calls for a fairer distribution of funding.  Cork County Council's administrative area is divided into three LCDCs and the funding allocation need to reflect that.  The county-based system in the previous programmes has resulted in under-resourcing of Cork communities.  In figures provided by the Fine Gael councillors, under the 2014 to 2022 allocations, County Cork, with a population of almost 400,000, received just under &euro;40 million, while Waterford, with a population of 67,000, received &euro;7.5 million and Roscommon, with a population of 64,000, received almost &euro;9 million.  Proportionately, Waterford receives three times as much as Cork and Roscommon almost four times as much.  The funding distribution system for the new LEADER programme drastically needs reform and I ask the Minister to reconsider the distribution method.</p></speech>

It is the highest allocation in the country, so they should be pleased to see that.</p> <p>My focus is on delivery.  It is based on the population and level of deprivation of the area, so that is taken into consideration as well.  The Deputy gave me the example of Roscommon, and in fairness to the county, when the figures are added up, it needs more investment.  The western and Border area is also recognised by the EU as needing additional support.  My focus is very much on delivery.  The selection process is open and all of the details are available on the Department's website.  Interested parties will have until 16 December to put in their expressions of interest.  Cork has been allocated almost &euro;21 million, which should keep them happy.</p></speech>

The geographical size of the county has to be taken into consideration.  LEADER funding is vital for rural areas, and many community centres, playgrounds and local amenities are only possible with such funding.  Many communities do not even have the basics of a playground.  I am working with Bandon and Skibbereen family resource centres, neither of which has a home and they are essential services.  I raised it recently with a Minister who directed me towards LEADER.  This is something that happens all the time.</p>  <p>  County Cork should be treated on an equal basis with other areas.  I am not seeking any special treatment, just that the funding awarded is proportionate.  Cork County Council has worked with the All-Island Research Observatory in Maynooth University to provide analysis of the funding allocation, with suggestions for improving the distribution.  I ask that the Minister works with them to ensure that LEADER 2023 to 2027 is a fair programme that does not disadvantage counties just because of their geographical size.</p></speech>

Whether it is LEADER, the rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation fund; CL&Aacute;R, the new community centre investment fund, the streetscape scheme or the community enhancement programme, there is a funding scheme for everything and each scheme makes a real and lasting difference in rural communities.</p>  <p>  I have visited every county during my time as Minister.  Great projects are funded under all of these programmes, many of which are in the Deputy's own county.  Cork County Council and the LEADER companies in Cork are doing great work on the ground.  I have not been to every bit of Cork but I have been to a good bit of it and it is great to see what is happening on the ground.  The message I am getting back from communities is to keep the money coming because there has never been more funding in rural development.  The level of funding is unprecedented.  LEADER is one part of this approach to investment in rural Ireland.  In fairness to Cork, it has been getting a fair share of funding, but it should be glad of this extra money.</p></speech>

My Department was also instrumental in setting up the local authority community response forum, or community call forums, which had a particular focus on vulnerable people in our communities.  A review of the effectiveness of these forums carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, concluded that the work and processes developed through community call have been effective in delivering support to vulnerable groups during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Other supports provided by my Department at that time included the Covid-19 stability fund, which supported 863 organisations in 2020 and 2021 with total funding of approximately &euro;48.8 million.  In 2020, &euro;4.2 million was provided under the Covid-19 emergency fund, which targeted help at groups participating in the Government's community call initiative.  The community enhancement programme provides vital supports to assist local groups to reopen their facilities post Covid-19.  The programme provided &euro;4.5 million funding in 2021 for small capital grants for the improvement of facilities.  In November 2021, I launched the community activities fund.  This &euro;9 million fund was provided to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19 to help them with their bills and maintenance.</p>  <p>  A number of the rural schemes delivered by my Department were also adapted to assist communities respond to the pandemic, including through accelerated funding under the town and village renewal scheme for measures such as outdoor meeting spaces and public dining areas.  In 2020, the CL&Aacute;R programme placed a particular focus on supporting communities to deal with the impact of Covid-19.  The scheme was broadened to allow projects that helped adapt community facility environs.  The community services programme, CSP, which is also funded by my Department, supports more than 420 community organisations nationwide.  In response to the Covid-19 crisis, my Department developed a &euro;8.95 million CSP support fund to cover the period 2020 to 2021.</p></speech>

What really struck me at the time was how isolated and vulnerable older people in particular were and those who had disabilities.  I was at a recent launch of iCommunity with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communities in the North, Ms Deirdre Hargey.  I was struck by the Disability Action Network saying that 35% of social care had been impacted, more than half the people surveyed experienced disruption to accessing food and medication, and there was a notable decline in physical and mental well-being.  We are still seeing the effects of that today.  One of the issues is around the management of such effects.  What did we do during Covid and what do we need to do post Covid to ensure that, if circumstances such as those arise again, we are in a better place to deal with them?  There are many learnings.</p></speech>

I met a group of women last week - I do not know whether you would call them women's sheds, hen's sheds, sisters' sheds or whatever - to see how we can develop a national organisation similar to the men's sheds, because women do not have such an organisation in place.  One lady from Dublin said she lost her mother during Covid and she did not leave the house during that time.  She just did not have the ability or the confidence to go outside.  Somebody set up the sisters' sheds and invited her to go along.  She told me it changed her life.  Those are the types of interventions that make a difference, where you can go to a group.</p>  <p>  We have learned a lot.  Community call, as the Deputy said, was very successful.  We need to take learnings as to how we can engage with communities.  Local authorities were able to engage much more with communities during Covid.  We always find it hard to engage with people who are marginalised and do not know about the services that are in place.  It is about how we get in to support them.</p></speech>

As an example, people within the drug community are especially marginalised.  These would be people who are active drug users who are getting supports from community drug teams.  There had been a fractious relationship at times between Government agencies and some of the community projects.  All of that was washed away during Covid, however, because everybody recognised we needed to work together to ensure what we did supported those who are particularly marginalised and disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  My concern is that some of those learnings are being lost and that State agencies are in some ways reasserting their silo to a certain extent.  That is why we need a detailed study or report into how we all worked together, what worked very well, what did not and what practices and policies we can put in place to ensure that if a pandemic ever happened again, which it possibly could, we are ready for it and the State agencies take those learnings of the very good work during Covid and move them into present-day work.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  He mentioned addiction.  Two weeks ago I was in Fettercairn, out beside Tallaght, where there is a group called Connect.  I think it is funded by the partnership.  Its members go out at night, identify people who are vulnerable, bring them in and try to help them.  The group does great work.  It is working collaboratively with the partnership out there.</p>  <p>  Siloing and empire-building should be banned.  They should not exist.  There should be collaboration.  There is loads of work for everybody and a role for everybody but sometimes you find people like to expand their little space and that is not the way it should work.  It is about working together.</p></speech>

This year my Department had a budget of &euro;378 million, which is utilised to provide supports to both urban and rural communities.  The national development plan also places a particular focus on solutions to strengthen housing, climate ambitions, transport, healthcare and jobs growth for communities in every region.  My Department supports the development of community infrastructure across the country through programmes such as the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, the LEADER programme, the town and village renewal scheme and the community enhancement programme.  This year I have further supplemented this investment by establishing a community centre investment fund that will support groups in every county to carry out refurbishments and improvements of their local community facility.  These facilities represent vital infrastructure to support our communities, including in expanding areas such as those referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My Department also operates a range of other community supports such as the community services programme, which assists community-based organisations through a social enterprise model.  It typically supports organisations to meet local service gaps and provide access to services and facilities that would otherwise generally be unavailable.  In addition, the social inclusion and communities activation programme, SICAP, provides funding to tackle poverty and social exclusion at a local level.  The value of the programme has again been seen in recent times in responding to the needs of the people from Ukraine to help them settle and engage with local communities.  I am confident the current suite of supports provided by my Department will continue to support and enable our growing communities to thrive throughout the country.</p></speech>

I ask that she ask her officials to provide her with data on the proportion of those moneys that goes to the high-growth communities on the edges or our cities in Waterford, Galway and Dublin, including in my and the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach's constituency.  These communities do not have the sports clubs that can draw down sports grants.  They do not have the community facilities that can be refurbished.  They do not have schools because the Department of Education has a policy of waiting to build a school until the children have been in the area for ten years.  This needs leadership within Government to join up thinking so there are special quotas from sports capital grants and social capital grants to protect and grow those communities.  We are saying half the population growth over the next ten years, which is a minimum of 500,000 people, are going to go into those areas.  There is not sufficient thinking about them and the NDP has not seriously addressed them.</p></speech>

That is my priority as Minister for Rural and Community Development.  Many of my Department's funding programmes, such as CL&Aacute;R and the rural regeneration fund, are specifically targeted at rural towns, villages and parishes.  For the larger urban population areas the Government has the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, under the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government.  Some very significant projects across the country have been funded under the URDF.  In my Department I have introduced the new community centre investment fund, which is available to all communities, be they urban or rural.  Where there is population growth we want to ensure families have access to quality community facilities.  I have already announced the small-scale grants of up to &euro;25,000 under that fund and hope to announce the larger grants of up to &euro;300,000 in the coming weeks.  That funding is to support the upgrade and enhancement of existing community centres.</p></speech>

Who is looking out for these urban communities if not her Department?  It is a gap in Government thinking.  If those urban communities do not grow well the hope of compact development with low emissions, and all those things we believe are the future, will struggle.  We need to frontload investment into those areas and not do as most Departments do and wait far too long to make that investment.  I plead with the Minster to try to take a leadership role in this and maybe elbow some of her compatriots around the Cabinet table to shift their position on this.</p></speech>

I take Deputy Bruton's point.  I appreciate there are bigger communities, more people moving in and facilities are needed.  I secured &euro;20 million for a fund targeted at new-build community centres.  That fund can be drawn down in both rural and urban areas.  It will be targeted specifically at areas where there has been population growth and there is currently a lack of a community centre.  The URDF is the scheme that should look at the areas the Deputy is addressing because as I said there is a specific focus on the rural in my Department.  He will appreciate there has been unprecedented investment in rural Ireland, which is paying off, making changes and making a difference to people's lives.  It is something we need to look at as a Government and I am happy to follow up on it with my colleagues though my focus remains, as I said, on the rural side of things.</p></speech>

When people made submissions, they were based on submissions they got in at the time.  Is the Minister's Department going to take into account the increase that has occurred in the cost of building since the applications were made and by the time the roll-out will occur?</p></reply>

The fund has to date allocated funding of &euro;280 million for 191 projects nationwide costing over &euro;380 million.  Calls for applications to the fund are sought under two categories, namely, category 1 and category 2.  Category 1 relates to large-scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed.  Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for category 1 applications.</p>  <p>  My Department has received 42 applications under the fourth call for category 1 applications under the fund.  They are seeking funding of over &euro;149 million.  The focus of this fourth call is very much on revitalising our towns and villages, and funding infrastructure that can drive economic growth and support communities in rural areas.  In order to maximise the quality of the projects being submitted to the fund, the application process is competitive.  Applications are assessed against the appraisal scheme published as part of the call for applications.</p> <p>This process is undertaken by my Department, with the guidance of a project advisory board comprised of representatives from key Departments and independent experts.  My Department then prepares a report on the assessment process, setting out projects recommended for funding.  Following consideration of that report, I make the final decisions on the projects that will be funded.  I expect to conclude this process shortly and make an announcement of successful projects in the coming weeks.  There are some really transformational projects in line for funding that will have a big impact on towns and villages right across the country.</p> <p> The Deputy asked about funding shortfalls.  Projects that emerge as successful from calls for applications to the fund are initially approved in principle before progressing through a further comprehensive approval process.  This review always includes an assessment by an independent quantity surveyor.  I can give more details of that presently if the Deputy so wishes.</p></speech>

It is important that the funding be rolled out at the earliest possible date because costs continue to rise.  A large number of applicants are waiting for decisions as to whether they have been successful.  In fairness to every group that makes a submission to the scheme, its agenda is to provide facilities for communities and, in many cases, deliver a whole regeneration that will assist those communities.  Do we need to revisit this scheme to ensure unsuccessful projects can in some way be accommodated in the not-too-distant future?</p></speech>

The cost of construction has gone up.  We employ a quantity surveyor as part of the assessment, which is important to ensure the costs and contingencies have been included by the lead party for the project.  In line with best practice in project management, all applicants to the fund are asked to put in a contingency budget at a level appropriate for the type of project being undertaken.  A carefully calculated contingency budget will meet many of the challenges people face in terms of cost overruns.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is open to project lead parties to make a case to the Department for additional funding if the cost of an approved project significantly increases after the procurement process is completed.  Many leaders have said to me that after they went to procurement, the project ended up costing a lot more than they thought it would.  If that is the case, they can make a detailed justification as to why they need more money.  We certainly are not in the business of holding people back from developing good projects for their communities.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that she has increased the funding for County Cork.  She also announced funding for community centres, which will be extremely beneficial to communities.  I hope the new programme can be rolled out at the earliest possible date in order that groups can get on with the projects and deliver them in a timely manner.</p></speech>

This is a 50% increase and the highest allocation in the country for the biggest county in the country.  We assess applications on population and deprivation.  Some counties get more funding than others based on that.  There may be a smaller population but greater deprivation.</p>  <p>  My focus now is on delivery.  As I said, the selection process is open and all the details are available on the Department's website.  Interested parties have until 16 December to put in their expressions of interest.  I would tell them to get to it.  As far as I am concerned, the ball has been thrown in, the funding is there and it is up to groups to get their bids in and deliver their projects.  It is a great programme.  I advise applicants to work collaboratively because when we work together, we get better results.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

As part of that commitment and in line with the programme for Government, I launched the &euro;15 million community centres investment fund in April this year.  The fund was available to community groups under three categories.  Category 1 was for grants up to &euro;25,000, category 2 for grants between &euro;25,001 and &euro;100,000 and category 3 for grants between &euro;100,001 and &euro;300,000.  The fund closed to applications in July.</p>  <p>  Interest was extremely high, with more than 1,000 applications received under the three categories.  All applications were subject to a competitive appraisal process that has been ongoing since the closing date.  Earlier this month, I announced more than &euro;12.5 million in funding for 580 successful category 1 applicants, details of which are available on my Department's website.  Due to the high level of applications to the fund, the appraisal process is still ongoing for categories 2 and 3.  I expect to make announcements on the outcome of the process in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the extremely high level of demand for the fund, I am delighted to inform the House that I have secured &euro;20 million in funding in the budget for a 2023 community centres investment fund.  It is intended that the 2023 fund will be targeted at new-build community centres, as well as upgrades and improvements to existing centres.  The details of the scheme are currently being developed by officials within my Department and further details will be announced early next year.</p>  <p>  The funding under the community centres investment fund was open to groups from both urban and rural areas, particularly disadvantaged areas.  When I announced the funding last July, we tried to encompass as many projects as possible.  We looked at works to improve communal facilities, such as kitchen and toilet facilities, energy retrofitting, including new windows, doors and heating systems, upgrades to lighting systems and stage areas, works to address safety concerns, including those identified as a result of fire safety audits, works to improve disability access, improvements to provide additional or better services to communities, such as meals for the elderly and youth facilities, works to develop community centres as social hubs through the development of community cinemas, youth hubs and community libraries, and essential maintenance work, such as repairs to roofs and so on.  Many community centres were unable to do their usual fundraising during the Covid crisis.  A large number had a leaking roof, for example, or needed to upgrade their kitchen.  This was a particularly welcome fund and there was a large number of applications.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to include upgrades to GAA clubhouses in the fund.  Many clubhouses, particularly in rural areas, also function as community centres.  They could not get money from the sports capital fund to upgrade the clubhouses because that funding is only for sports facilities.  I was delighted to include them in this round of funding, which meant we were able to support a good number of GAA centres around the country.</p> <p>As Members know they are at the heart of rural Ireland.  As I said, I was delighted to secure the &euro;20 million for the further iteration of the fund in 2023.  It will once again look at more upgrades and refurbishment of existing centres.  We tried to fund as many as we could.  In the case of those that did not get funding this time, either the application was not eligible or did not meet the criteria or it scored very badly.  A great many of the applications were funded.  About 90% of them were funded.  We tried to spread the loaves and fishes as far as possible and it was very well received.  </p></speech>

In Mayo it was well received by 30 community groups and organisations that received funding in the region of &euro;640,000.  Some of the awardees locally were Partry, Ballyhean, Turlough, Cong, Islandeady and Balla and the feedback has been tremendous.  I also want to compliment the Minister on her earlier points in regard to sporting bodies such as Charlestown Bellaghy recreational development centre and Mayo Gaels GAA club.  They received essential funding for the upgrade of lighting systems.  Also, funding was directly targeted at essential repairs to leaking roofs and so forth, which possibly they would only get during the sports capital programme.  It was certainly very welcome.</p>  <p>  As for the unsuccessful applicants under category 1, will they have an opportunity to appeal a decision or will they have to reapply in 2023?</p></speech>

Mayo did very well actually.  I have a long list to hand of projects funded.  It is important that we help these community centres.  The Deputy asked me whether there is an appeals system and there is.  We asked Pobal to assess these applications for us and it did so.  There will be an appeal system whereby an organisation that has not been successful can see exactly where it fell down.  The good news is that I am trying to put a fund together for next year.  If at first you do not succeed, I always recommend that you try again.  Maybe with some changes the application can be successful the next time.  Good projects always get money.</p></speech>

In Limerick at the start of October, we got &euro;680,000 for 33 projects under category 1.  There were some great projects.  As for categories 2 and 3, many worthwhile projects are seeking funding, such as St. Munchin's Community Centre, Kileely, in the city, Murroe Wood Park, which has done fantastic community work, Our Lady of Lourdes Community Centre, Childers Road, Limerick city, and Hope for People with Autism, under D&oacute;chas.  When does the Minister anticipate that the announcement will be made?  I know the difference this scheme makes to groups.  I have seen groups such as Caherdavin Community Centre, the Cari Foundation, Mulcair Men&rsquo;s Shed, Abington, and Southill Hub with the tranche going to category 1 and what a difference it has made to community groups.  In regard to the timing for categories 2 and 3, when will the Minister be making that announcement?  This is a brilliant scheme.</p></speech>

There is a good long list in Limerick as well.  I want to thank all the Deputies.  I believe everybody supported me on this scheme because it makes a huge difference to communities.  That is what we are about.  We are about helping people and communities to realise their ambition for their areas.  There is nothing more annoying than struggling at community level and just needing a few pounds.  It does not take an awful lot and it makes a difference.  We get good value because they match it.  Many of the centres had not been upgraded for decades.</p>  <p>  In respect of categories 2 and 3 they are at a final stage of assessment.  It is not finished yet but I hope to announce categories 2 and 3 in the coming weeks.  The money is tight because we originally had &euro;15 million in the fund.  As we received more than &euro;70 million worth of applications, there was a touch of the loaves and fishes about it.  We will keep at it.  </p></speech>

My parish community centre benefited from &euro;25,000 under category 1.  This was one of 27 projects funded in County Kerry.  This was most welcome.  In a small rural parish, collecting &euro;25,000 is virtually impossible in the current times so that funding from the Government is crucial.  I remember in the 1980s going around in the back of my father's Fiat 127.  Along with the other members of the community council, he was collecting &pound;5 a month from householders to build the centre.  It now needs reinvestment.  This funding is a huge boost to a small rural community.  It is the same throughout the country.  I congratulate the Minister and thank her for putting the fund in place for next year also.  I encourage the further categories to be announced as soon as possible.  The good people of Listowel have been on to me about Listowel Community Centre.  They do fantastic work there.  The term, "community centre", explains what is going on there.  These places are at the centre of their communities.  The work that goes on in them is enormously important.  This funding is crucially important as well.</p></speech>

I value the input that I get in this Chamber and from each Member individually.  At different points, Members say to me that I should look at this or that and I continually review the schemes.  In fairness, there was a great number of successful applications in County Kerry, averaging around &euro;18,000, &euro;19,000 or up to &euro;25,000, which was the maximum.  Many of them did very well.  I will share a story with Members.  I remember when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il and a small grant for about &euro;10,000 came out.  I had been working on it for a while and phoned this community group to advise it had received &euro;10,000.  That is not a lot of money in the overall scheme of things.  The boy said to me, "You know, I would be a long time standing at the traffic lights in Monaghan with a bucket by the time I would get &euro;10,000".  That is the difference it makes.  We need to support communities.</p></speech>

It is the first time ever that we have had a dedicated national scheme focusing solely on community centres throughout rural Ireland.  I live in a small, rural village, Carrabane, in east Galway and when I look at my own community centre it is the very epicentre of life in that community right from the beginning of life through to the end of life.  It starts with a mother and toddler group, it has For&oacute;ige and scouts and older citizens meet there regularly.  We even have yoga for men on Monday nights which I have yet to partake in but am looking forward to.</p>  <p>  In assessing all the applications that came in, did any trends emerge in regard to the most pressing needs from within the community centre network throughout the country?  Also, I ask the Minister to contemplate at some point in the future, perhaps with Cabinet colleagues, on the real possibility that many of these centres could be used as social centres for retirement villages throughout our rural communities.  There are many good examples and exemplars being established internationally now that there is an aging population that these centres could serve much more than just their current needs.  They could become the epicentre for very successful retirement facilities immersed and embedded within our rural communities. </p></speech>

He is right actually.  It could be a social centre for a retirement village.  I visited Bree, Wexford, a few weeks ago where they have a wonderful community centre.  It is like a campus.  They have everything together including the community centre, the GAA club, with a school and a cr&egrave;che beside it.  These are all together, so that when you leave one you just walk to the next, which is a big advantage.  This was thanks to the vision of people many years ago to buy a plot of land that made this a very successful centre.  It was helping people and providing services for people with disabilities.  There is a wide range of services.  I was in Fettercairn, Tallaght, and launched the fund out there.</p> <p>I saw the difference it will make to its centre as well.  It is not just about the rural areas; it is about the city areas well.  It encourages them and helps them to do the work that they need to do.  It also shows that Government is investing in them and that we want to support them.</p></speech>

That was central in order to support communities in the application process.  As public representatives, it certainly made our job easier in promoting this scheme.  It is positive to hear that the Government is increasing the national pot next year to &euro;20 million.  I look forward to the applications opening in 2023 and to further announcements for categories 2 and 3.</p></speech>

The Minister referenced how hard it would be to collect &euro;10,000 at traffic lights with a bucket.  The limit of &euro;25,000 in category 1 has made a phenomenal difference to communities.  Next year, there will be many smaller groups out there looking at this.  We are now at the end of 2022.  When will the scheme for category 1 reopen next year?</p></speech>

For example, there is a family resource centre in Cahersiveen in County Kerry doing enormously important work in the wider south Kerry community.  It recently purchased a building that it is hoping to do up and improve.  Unfortunately, Kerry County Council did not put it forward for funding recently under the rural regeneration scheme.  However, this may be a scheme that would cover it if it could be expanded.  Will the Minister please consider that?</p></speech>

We have a city that is radically overheating at the moment.  We have a commuter belt that is sprawling into Ulster, Munster and Connacht, where people are travelling two and three hours into Dublin to go to work.  Every year, we have rural areas where the population of young people is reducing.  That is not a sustainable process and these are not viable communities.  They do not have necessary investment into infrastructure, such as broadband, roads, rail and all of the business and enterprise investments that they need.

Our Rural Future 2021-2025 is the most ambitious rural development policy for Ireland in decades.   It was published in March 2021 and contains more than 150 measures across the whole of Government for both short-term recovery and long-term development.</p>  <p>  Delivery of the Our Rural Future rural development policy is monitored through a series of work programmes and progress reports.  The second progress report was published in August 2022 and covered delivery in the first half of this year.  It contained updates on 148 of the 312 actions in the 2022 work programme and included contributions from 22 Departments or agencies.  Some 35 of these actions were of an ongoing nature.  Of the remaining 113  actions, which were due for delivery in the first half of 2022, a total of 82, or 72%, were completed.  Work is under way on the third progress report, which will cover the second half of 2022.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the very enthusiastic engagement and inputs from across Government in respect of the implementation of Our Rural Future.  My officials will shortly begin bilateral consultations with relevant Departments in preparation for the work programme for 2023.  The development of these annual work programmes allows for priorities to be updated in light of emerging opportunities and challenges and the introduction of brand new measures to the overall Our Rural Future policy.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the publication of these documents will demonstrate continued commitment to realising the ambitions of Our Rural Future in delivering this Government's vision for rural Ireland.  I will finish at that.</p></speech>

I understand that the north and the west of this island have been downgraded to lagging region status under the Government.  That is an incredible assessment from the European Union in relation to what the north and the west are undergoing at the moment.  I am referring to the agreement that has unlocked funding through the bloc's cohesion policy.  I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform whether he will confirm that the two regions have been downgraded or to release the relevant document to me.  However, he has point-blank refused to do so.</p>  <p>  This is very important.  I also understand that these regions, which include the Minister's county, have been ranked at 177 out of 240 European regions.  That is a damning indictment of the policy that this Government is involved in.  Those areas, in European terms, are seeing a reduction in the level of development and competition that happens there.  When the Government gives grants and make communities dependent for &euro;10,000 here or there, that does not lift their viability for families to be able to earn an income and raise children there and young people to able to stay there and do exactly the same.</p></speech>

Through the RRDF, there has been millions of euro invested in town centre regeneration projects and the conversion of old, derelict buildings into remote working hubs.  There has been investment through the town and village streetscape enhancement initiative, which is now looking at repurposing whole buildings.</p>  <p>  I spoke to local authority chief executives yesterday.  They said very clearly that there has been unprecedented investment in rural Ireland and it is working and paying off.  There are many different avenues for communities and local authorities to draw down money from central government.  It is about the bottom-up approach and people identifying opportunities, weaknesses in their community, looking for funding to address those weaknesses and building on the strengths.</p>  <p>  The population in rural areas is increasing.  More and more young people are coming back to live and work in their home areas.</p> <p>We have been able to afford them that opportunity through remote working.

She should ignore the core performance indicator of her Government.  It is not just or fair to citizens living in the counties in the western and northern parts of this country that we are having this conversation.  The Minister is not going to admit that the European Union has downgraded those areas to 177th place out of 240.  Only for the <i>Business Post</i>releasing this information, we would not know it.  Will the Minister release to the citizens of Ireland the document the European Union has provided in order that we can have transparent government and see why the European Union is downgrading regions of Ireland in terms of their ability to compete?

The driving force has been the fact that people cannot live in Dublin any more because the cost of doing so has gone through the roof.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, launched the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund.  The fund is initially focused on supporting the refurbishment of vacant homes in regional towns and villages.  It is a key funding support under the town centre first policy that was jointly developed by my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The publication of Town Centre First was a key deliverable under Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  In July, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched the vacant property refurbishment grant, funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.  The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched the ready-to-build scheme in September.  This scheme will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes.  These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the  principal private residence of the purchaser.  This scheme is also funded under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.</p>  <p>  Given that pathway 4 of Housing for All is intended to support reuse of existing buildings and the synergy with the Government's Our Rural Future policy, I am pleased to say that it has been decided to extend the vacant property refurbishment grant to vacant properties in cities and rural areas to ensure we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage expects to have that extension to cities and rural properties in place by November.</p></speech>

That was probably one of the few criticisms I had of the policy and it is good to see that the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage have responded to that and extended the scheme to rural communities.  It is a great scheme that will provide incentives for people to bring those properties back into circulation.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions regarding interaction with local authorities.  How many indications have there been up to now?  How many properties are involved?  There is a condition whereby the State claws back up to 100% of the grant if the person who availed of it subsequently sells the property within five years.  Who administers or is responsible for that clawback?</p></speech>

All present know from walking through rural towns and villages that there are derelict houses in them.  A bit of encouragement would bring people back to living in the centre of towns and villages.  It is welcome that the scheme has been extended to rural houses.  I acknowledge that.  The Minister for housing, Local Government and Heritage was committed to the scheme from day one.  We had conversations about it and it is very welcome.</p>  <p>  As regards our engagement with local authorities, we recently published Town Centre First, a major new policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into town centres.  Town Centre First contains 33 unique actions which will give towns the tools and resources they need to become more viable and attractive places to visit, live, work and run a business.  The policy is underpinned by multibillion euro investment spread across major Government schemes such as the RRDF, the urban regeneration and development fund, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund and the town and village scheme.  For the first time, designated towns will gain their own dedicated town regeneration officers, who will be crucial in driving future development.</p></speech>

I will get onto that in a minute.  As regards the administration of the scheme, if a person avails of the grant and subsequently sells the property and there is a clawback by the State, is that done through Revenue or via the local authority?  What is the vehicle to ensure that clawback is in place and the scheme is not taken advantage of?  There is a significant budget for the scheme, but are there targets in terms of the number of applicants it is anticipated will avail of it?  Are there set targets per annum for the coming years or is it just operating on a first come, first served basis?</p></speech>

I am not sure of the position with regard to the clawback.  It is right that there should be a clawback.  I agree with that principle in the context of a person selling a house.  The idea is that the person will live in the town.  People living in town centres will bring vibrancy to them.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question on that aspect, but I will find out exactly what happens or who is responsible for administering the clawback clause.</p>  <p>  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is just one part of what we are doing in rural Ireland.   Under my Department, there is the town and village renewal scheme.  We have expanded that scheme and funding can be sought for bigger projects up to a maximum of &euro;500,000.  In that context, we have done a lot of work in repurposing old buildings such as old Garda stations or train stations.  Several different projects that have come forward through consultations with communities - asking people what they need in their area and how we can help them to realise their vision.</p></speech>

The RRDF provides funding for the development and construction of capital projects in towns and villages and rural areas across Ireland.  The fund has to date allocated funding of &euro;280 million for 191 projects across the country worth a total of &euro;380 million.  The RRDF is central to achieving the objectives and key deliverables of Our Rural Future, the Government's five year policy for rural Ireland.  The projects supported by the fund assist in the regeneration of rural towns and villages by addressing vacancy and dereliction and positioning them for further growth through regeneration and town centre renewal.  The fund also invests in strategic projects that contribute to further economic development in rural areas.</p><p>The 2022 allocation for the RRDF is &euro;60 million.  There is also a carry forward from 2021 of &euro;9 million which can be utilised across the wider programme area depending on the level of demand.  The total spend to date in 2022 from the fund is &euro;20.3 million, with significant levels of further funding draw downs expected before year end. In January, I announced funding of &euro;24.5 million for 27 projects from the third call for category 2 applications.  Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls.  The fourth call for category 1 applications to the RRDF, which are the large scale capital projects with planning in place, closed earlier this year.  I expect to be in a position to make a substantial announcement on the successful projects arising from that call in the coming weeks.  This will further strengthen the pipeline of projects to be delivered under the fund for the coming years.</p></speech>

What she is saying is that &euro;69 million was available for spending this year but that only &euro;20.3 million has been spent to date, which means that &euro;49 million is left to be spent in two months.  I ask the Minister to explain how it is that in ten months of the year only &euro;20 million has been spent, when the Department had budgeted for far more.  No doubt the Minister went fighting to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and told him that she needed a lot of money for this scheme.  I ask the Minister to explain why the spending under this scheme is so slow.  Is the infernal habit repeating itself whereby local authorities send in their bills at the end of the year?</p></speech>

As I said to them yesterday, if they do not spend the money, it is very hard for me to make the case for more money.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will appreciate that because there are always competing demands at budget time.  The budget for this year is &euro;69 million.  We have spent more than &euro;20 million so far, but I expect significant levels of draw down before Christmas.  As the Deputy knows, the bills do tend to come in towards the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I have taken steps to use savings in other areas this year already.  For example, I transferred money into LIS.  I was also able to provide some additional funding for the community centres fund and I expect much of that money will be drawn down very quickly because the grants in the first tranche are relatively small.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that I am continually putting pressure on local authorities to spend the money available.</p></speech>

A sum of &euro;20 million has been spent.  When we take the &euro;9 million out of that, however, the Department has actually only spent &euro;11 million of this year's allocation, which is a very small percentage after ten months.  The Minister said the Department will spend "a significant amount" between now and the end of the year.  That phrase suggests to me that the Department might not know what will be spent.  What is the Department's estimate of what will be spent between now and the end of the year, which is only really five or six weeks away when one takes the Christmas period into account?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister foresee a carry forward once again, even though people are screaming for money under schemes like LIS?  Does she foresee a significant carry forward by her Department of capital funding into next year?</p></speech>

Some of these projects are taking longer than anybody would like.  They have had problems with supply chains.  One project is awaiting a particular piece of equipment before it can be finished and we are seeing that right across the board.  I am putting the pressure on constantly.  When one sees the finished projects, even if they take a bit longer than expected, they are well worth it.  I was in New Ross a couple of weeks ago.  The project there took a lot longer than they thought it would but my goodness, it is some project.  They have regenerated the centre of the town.  Sometimes there are delays with the large-scale projects but they are very impactful, in terms of making a real difference in town centres.</p>  <p>  It is too early to say exactly what the savings will be this year but I am trying to keep any carry over to the bare minimum.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, when he was in this Department, I am trying to keep the spending going and the pressure on.</p></speech>

More &euro;21 million has been approved to date in respect of 15 projects located in Mayo costing over &euro;30 million.  Mayo has the second highest allocation of funding in the country.</p><p>I will shortly be announcing the successful projects under the fourth call for funding for category 1 applications.  Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed.The focus of the fourth call for Category 1 applications is to support ambitious capital projects which make the best case to assist in revitalising our towns, villages and rural areas through planned and sustainable regeneration.  These projects will drive greater economic activity, address vacancy and dereliction and provide the necessary facilities and infrastructure which will assist in attracting people back to live in rural areas.  This investment will help to drive economic development within these areas.</p><p>My Department received 42 applications to this latest call for funding, together seeking funding of over &euro;149 million.  I understand that two applications for projects located in County Mayo were submitted to this call.  The application process for the fund is competitive in nature.  Applications are assessed by my Department under the oversight of the project advisory board comprised of representatives from key Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department prepares a report setting out recommended projects.  My role as Minister is to consider that report and make final decisions in respect of the allocation of funding.  I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks. </p><p>I know that Deputy Dillon is particularly interested in two projects in Ballinrobe and Newport in County Mayo.  He has brought them to my attention previously.</p></speech>

One such project is the Connaught GAA centre of excellence and air dome based in Bekan outside Ballyhaunis.  It is a fantastic facility that is used by so many young people and up-and-coming underage footballers.</p>  <p>  I would also like to make the call for Ballinrobe civic arts and amenity centre, a hugely important project for the community in Ballinrobe.  The project will cost somewhere in the region of &euro;4.5 million and will reform the centre of Ballinrobe town.</p> <p>There is also the Newport regeneration project, which is led by Mayo County Council.  Those two projects will be game changers in both those communities.  I would advocate strongly that they be successful in the next call under category 1 of the RRDF.</p></speech>

I had thought the Deputy would mention the Connacht GAA dome.  It is a great job.  I believe it has been very successful.  That was funded from my Department.  These projects are all mighty big multimillion-euro projects.  They are all assessed independently and, as I said, are nearly at a final stage.  I will be announcing them in a few weeks' time.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; in am anois dearcadh ar&iacute;s ar fhaoiseamh &uacute;s morg&aacute;iste.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will know that workers and families are struggling and that prices are rising and spilling over into every part of household budgets.  The European Central Bank is expected today to raise interest rates again by another three quarters of a percentage point.  That is a two percentage point increase since July of this year and it will have an immediate impact on households on tracker mortgages.  Such a household with an outstanding balance of &euro;200,000 would see its annual payment increase by more than &euro;2,000 compared with the start of this year.  For other mortgage holders, the decision rests with their banks as to whether they will pass these interest rate hikes on to their customers or absorb them.</p>  <p>  Our position in Sinn F&eacute;in is clear.  Banks should absorb these interest rate hikes in the interests of their customers.  The banks are in a good position to do so and to do the right thing.  In the first half of this year, Bank of Ireland and AIB had combined profits of &euro;950 million.  They have increased their market share since and have continued dividend payments to shareholders this year and, as the Central Bank made clear in May of this year, "Profitability in the banking sector has recovered and is set to be bolstered" as a result of rising interest rates.  The Central Bank went further, noting that Irish banks were positioned to increase their profits more than other European banks as a result of rising interest rates.  According to the banks' own estimates, these interest rate hikes could bolster their interest income by more than &euro;1 billion each year.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear: interest rate hikes announced by the ECB provide a bonanza for Irish banks.  The financial outlook and position of our banks is strong, while for households it is not.  Those on variable rates are at the mercy of these banks and the decisions they will make in the coming weeks and months.  Their decisions could increase the mortgage repayments of households by thousands of euro.  These households are already struggling to make ends meet.  Banks need to do the right thing.  They need to not pass on these interest rate hikes and they need to make that clear to their customers.  Families have spent the past year looking at their household budgets.  They are planning how best they can manage to get through the winter and into the coming year.  However, no household could have anticipated that the cost of their mortgage would increase by this much and so quickly.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in calling on the banks to do the right thing and not to pass these interest rate hikes on to households, which are already struggling under immense financial pressures?  The T&aacute;naiste will know that those on tracker mortgages will automatically see these rate hikes passed on to them, just as the previous two rate hikes have been passed on to them since July.  These households cannot be expected to shoulder an additional burden of more than &euro;2,000 per year in mortgage costs without the State and without the Government exploring every possible avenue to support them.  Will the T&aacute;naiste therefore commit to examining options to introduce targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief to those who are most heavily impacted as a result of interest rate hikes announced by the ECB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700021#T00700"><p>I am conscious of the fact we have not had any announcement yet from the ECB on interest rates, but it is anticipated, or widely reported at least, that the ECB will raise interest rates by 0.75 of a percentage point today.  I have to emphasise that, as we in this House all know, the European Central Bank is independent in its functions, does not take directions from this Government or any government and will make its decisions based on what it believes is the right thing to do for the economy in the round.  I know that any increase in interest rates for mortgage holders will be very unwelcome.  People who have tracker mortgages, in particular, will receive a third letter this year telling them their monthly repayments are going up.  That is very much unwelcome for those of us who hold tracker mortgages.  The ECB's rationale, however, as the Deputy will understand, will be that interest rates need to rise now to bring prices under control and to bring inflation down.  That will be to the benefit of everyone.  Ultimately, it is the remit of the European Central Bank to ensure we have price stability and that inflation is no higher than 2% per year.  One of its tools is to increase interest rates; the other is quantitative tightening.  It would appear the ECB intends to employ both those.</p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out that we have had a prolonged period of very low interest rates for a long time now and that is now ending.  We are likely to see interest rates closer to their long-term average in future.  For example, as recently as 2014, not all that long ago, the average fixed interest rate for new lending was 4.1%; it is now 2.5%.  That gives just an example of how low interest rates have gone.  This prolonged period of low interest rates is not going to continue.  We will see much more normal interest rates into the future.  I know that will not be welcome for many people, but not telling people the truth should not be welcome either.  It is important we tell people the truth about these things.</p>  <p>  Any decision on variable rates, of course, is a commercial decision for the bank involved.  I agree with the Deputy that banks should not use rising interest rates as an opportunity to make excessive profits, but they do need to take other factors into play as well.  For example, we want banks to offer new mortgages to first-time buyers.  We want them to offer those new mortgages at competitive rates.  We want banks to offer long-term rates.  Of course, many older people, who perhaps have some small savings, will be looking for an increase in their deposit rate.  The banks have to take all of that into account.  We cannot focus on just one group.  That would not be fair.  I agree with Deputy Doherty, however, that banks should not use this as an opportunity to make excessive profits.</p></speech>

The banks have told us themselves that, despite making nearly &euro;1 billion in the first six months of this year, this will boost their interest income by another &euro;1 billion.  The Central Bank has told us that, of all European banks, Irish banks will benefit most from the hikes.  It is not just about making excess profits.  We are now in an almighty cost-of-living crisis and the banks should do the right thing.  Some banks have not passed on the first two interest rate hikes.  They need to do likewise with the third.  I make that call on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in to the banks today.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste has recognised, there is an automatic increase for tracker mortgage customers.  There has been mortgage interest relief in the past.  It has been targeted.  It was tailored and time-bound.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not believe it is now time to introduce a similar measure to deal with this shock?  It is a shock to many tracker mortgage customers, who will see interest rate payments increase by &euro;2,000 per year.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, the European Central Bank has done three interest rate hikes.  It has signalled that it could do as much as five, and there is expectation that there will be another early in the new year.  Will the T&aacute;naiste therefore consider options to look at mortgage interest relief in a tailored, time-bound fashion that is targeted at those who are most under pressure as a result of these moves?</p></speech>

We had mortgage interest relief in the past when interest rates were much higher than they are now.  We now have a prolonged period of very low interest rates coming to an end and we are seeing interest rates go back to something that would have been considered much more normal five, ten or 15 years ago.</p>  <p>  It seems to me that Deputy Doherty has learnt nothing from what has happened across the water.  He spent the past few months calling for a mini-budget.  After that he called for a limitless energy price cap.  We see how that has turned out in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

We are less than 12 hours away from the looming deadline in Northern Ireland where it appears that yet another election will be called.  The people of Northern Ireland have been left without a functioning Executive for six months as we approach a deepened winter cost-of-living crisis and as we see significant issues around governance and day-to-day administration that need to be resolved but cannot be resolved without a functioning Administration in the North.  There was a deeply worrying report today of Ukrainian refugees being targeted by gangs in the North who are exploiting the political stalemate and the Border to bring refugees into human trafficking and the brutal exploitation of the sex trade, while there is a &pound;90 million funding shortage for the PSNI that needs to be resolved to ensure this can be policed.  As we speak, Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are gathering in Stormont to try to elect a Speaker and get on with the job of governing, but it appears that nothing will change the current position of the DUP, which will maintain its veto, and so it seems the stark reality is that the British Government will call an election at five minutes past midnight.  As Claire Hanna MP from our sister party, the SDLP, said this morning on RT&Eacute;, an election called in this way and under such duress is unlikely to change much and may even entrench stalemate and delay any return to normal negotiations between the EU 27 and the British Government on seeking to resolve issues with the protocol.  If no Executive is formed, we know there will not be a return to the direct rule of the past, so how will democratic institutions be restored?</p>  <p>  The assembly has not had a functioning Executive for four out of the past six years due to intransigence on the part of different parties, so it must be time to look at reform.  Since the changes resulting from the St. Andrews Agreement, the largest party in either designated community can in effect use a veto against the formation of a power-sharing Executive.  The use of that veto has entrenched division, hollowed out the centre ground parties and resulted in more voters opting for unaligned alternatives, as we saw in the most recent Stormont election, yet the current structures take no account of the rise of support for parties that do not designate as either unionist or nationalist.  It is deeply damaging to efforts to normalise politics in the North when either of the two largest parties can veto power-sharing.  It appears the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Government do not have a plan B for what will happen after the likely election in mid-December in the North.  We will be no closer to an Executive.  The election is unlikely to change the position of the DUP.  We are approaching the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement with the principles at the heart of it that are so crucial on consent and partnership, and yet there is no functioning Executive.</p>  <p>  Is it time to consider reforms that would allow those parties that are willing and ready to form an Executive to carry on with their work?  Is there a plan B for the Irish Government to ensure that, after a likely election is held, we can see necessary reforms put in place in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure a functioning Administration in the North?</p></speech>

If the Executive is not formed, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is required by law to call an election.  However, we believe Northern Ireland does not need a new election.  It had an election 24 weeks ago and the results were clear and should be honoured.</p>  <p>  What Northern Ireland needs is a functioning assembly and a functioning Executive to give effect to that choice and provide leadership during the difficult period ahead, so every effort should be made to avoid an unwanted election.  There is a last chance to do so and all that is required is for one political party to stop blocking the formation of the Executive.  The decision of one party to block the operation of the Northern Ireland Executive runs counter to democracy and risks undermining the faith of the people in the potential for democratic politics to respond to their needs.</p>  <p>  In the event that there is a sustained period without functioning institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, there cannot be a return to the direct rule arrangements of the past.  The Good Friday Agreement recognises the need for close consultation between the Irish and British Governments on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government will fully pursue its consultative role under the Good Friday Agreement should this arise and will exhaust every possibility within the framework of an agreement if there is a sustained period of no Executive and no assembly.</p></speech>

He stated clearly the Government position that there is no need for a new election.  I agree entirely.  All of us in this House would agree.  The last Stormont election was just 24 weeks ago.  Clearly, there are very pressing issues affecting the people in Northern Ireland every day, particularly with the cost-of-living crisis, and they need a functioning Executive and a functioning assembly to resolve those issues.  Given we are facing a last chance today to resolve the matter without the calling of another election by the British Government, I am asking what our Government's plan B is.  If an election is announced at five minutes past midnight, as seems likely despite everyone's wishes here, it is unlikely to change the dynamics in the North.  Is it not now time to look again at how we can reform the governance arrangements in the North in keeping with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure there will be functioning democratic institutions in the North and the will of the people as expressed through assembly elections can be carried out through functioning democratic institutions?  I am suggesting to the T&aacute;naiste that no party should be excluded from power-sharing in that scenario, that every party should be given the option to take part, and that it is undemocratic to allow one party to take a unilateral decision to veto power-sharing and hold all others in Northern Ireland to ransom.</p></speech>

This is something we are very keen to do with Prime Minister Sunak and his Cabinet.  If the election is called and goes ahead, we will have to take stock of the result.  I doubt it will be very different or different at all but it may be.  Who knows?  At that point, we will engage with the British Government bilaterally to see what we can do to get an Executive formed or, if that cannot happen, what alternatives we can put in place.  We are making it very clear there cannot be a return to the direct rule of the past.</p>  <p>  What the Deputy is touching on are some very reasonable questions but what she is talking about essentially is changes to key provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement was passed by a referendum here and north of the Border and making any changes to it would be profound and would have to be dealt with sensitively.</p></speech>

Employers in small businesses are bombarded regarding the way they can reward employees.  I am talking about hair salons, barbers, boutiques, pubs, chains of supermarkets, coffee shops and restaurants around the country.  I am delighted to see conditions are improving for employees.  Unfortunately, this may not be affordable.  While it may be affordable for larger companies, it is a two-tier system when it comes to SMEs.  Where are the supports for SMEs to ensure the employment benefits are given to people in SMEs?  There has been legislation on things like sick pay and the increase in the minimum wage, which I welcome.  Getting staff back to work is increasingly difficult.</p>  <p>  Fuel costs are having a major impact on SMEs.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that as the price of fuel goes up, VAT goes up.  When the citizens referred to are not in a position to spend money in the shops or local economy, we collect less VAT.  These are the SMEs I am talking about.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that we collect more tax on fuel because we are not collecting the VAT in the shops and in the local economy.</p> <p>This tells us that SMEs are in huge trouble.  These are the rural employers.  They are the small shops, such as the local butchers and hair salons.  I am talking about these people and not about multinationals.  I am talking about the local shops in our area.</p> <p> If the T&aacute;naiste were to go around my county of Limerick, he would find no local shops in Crecora, Fedamore or Ardagh.  I refer to the number of SME businesses that have closed in Limerick in the past week alone because they have not got the support to reward their employees, which they want to do.  Overhead costs are killing these businesses.  I repeat these are not multinational corporations.  These are the bread-and-butter people providing employment in the local communities I represent.  I am asking the Government, therefore, to intervene.  I ask it to consider a two-tier system so we will be able to help the SMEs, these small employers who help small and local communities to survive.  The post offices have a big impact in this regard as well and an attempt is being made to close these around the country as well.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to intervene.</p></speech>

The main way in which we can intervene to help small businesses is through the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS.  This legislation is now going through the House.  It will give businesses up to &euro;10,000 monthly to help them with their energy bills.  We are keen to get this measure legislated for as soon as possible, to get the scheme up and running and to backdate it to September 2022.  This will help many businesses to a large extent with their energy costs.  As is the case with households, though, there is no way we can cover the entire increase.  We can, however, make a big difference and this is the main way we are going to help small businesses in the months ahead.  I note and welcome the Deputy's support for the increase in the national minimum wage.  I wish to emphasise this in the House.</p>  <p>  One thing I should say, and we should not forget this, is that more people - 2.5 million - are now at work in Ireland than ever before.  This has come against the backdrop where we have seen improvements in pay, terms and conditions and new workers' rights pretty much every year for the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  It does not add up therefore that anyone thinks there is some kind of correlation between low pay and poor rights.  Ireland is a classic example of where we have improved pay, terms and conditions and workers' rights every year for ten or 15 years now, and yet we have seen levels of employment rise.  I hope it will continue to rise.</p>  <p>  Regarding what we have done on fuel costs, which the Deputy mentioned, when the price of fuel goes up, the VAT take also goes up.  This is not the case with excise duty.  We have cut the rate of excise duty, and we have taken 20 cent off a litre of petrol and 15 cent off a litre of diesel precisely for this reason.  We have also cut VAT levied on electricity and gas prices.  The rate has been cut to 9%, which is the lowest rate of VAT charged on electricity and gas prices since taxes began, or certainly since VAT levies began.  The Deputy did not mention this in his contribution.</p>  <p>  I hear the Deputy's suggestion regarding some sort of two-tier system to help SMEs.  I do not know what this means, however, and I would be interested if the Deputy could flesh out some proposals.  First, how would he define an SME?  Would it be based on the number of employees, on turnover or on profits?  These are all very different things, as the Deputy will understand.  A business can have a small number of employees but a large turnover.  Similarly, a business could have many employees but no profits.  How would it be decided, then, which businesses would be in which tier?  Second, what would the differences be?  Would small businesses be allowed to pay their staff less?  Would there be a lower minimum wage?  If the Deputy wishes to flesh out proposals, I would be interested to see them.</p></speech>

Watch this now.  There is tax in regard to VAT and the T&aacute;naiste said the VAT receipts go up.  The Government is taking 50% in tax on petrol and 44% in tax on diesel, when everything is included together.  This applies to everyone who has to use a car, a van, a tractor, a truck or a motorbike to do whatever they have to do in an area where there is no public transport.  This includes getting children to school in areas where the Government is unable to provide buses, such as in Dromcolliher.  I mentioned during the week that 50 students were waiting on a bus and now we have 30 cars driving to Dromcolliher.  This is an unfair tax on people carrying their children to school.</p>  <p>  I am talking about SMEs in rural Ireland, which the Government seems to have given up on once it goes beyond the Red Cow roundabout.  This is what I am talking about.  I am talking about where I live in Limerick.  I make no apologies for mentioning Limerick and the rural areas I represent.  This is what I am here to do.  I am here to ensure our people in our area are represented.  An unfair tax from the Government, which is taking 50% on petrol and 44% on diesel, means it is only looking after people who have access to public transport.  All the people in my area have to go to work and they are being taxed before they leave their houses every week.</p></speech>

Seeing the price of diesel going up again is alarming for many people.  I absolutely get this.  I understand and appreciate it, and this is why the Government has intervened.  We have reduced excise duties on petrol and diesel by 20 cent per litre and 15 cent per litre, respectively.  It is now down as low as it can go under European rules on diesel duty.  We could, potentially, go down a little bit more on the price of petrol-----</p></speech>

There is, therefore, no point in calling for this.  As the Deputy knows, we have reduced the VAT rate charged on electricity and gas costs to 9%, which is the lowest ever.  Businesses can, of course, claim back their VAT expenses.  We cannot, however, be divorced from the reality of what is going on here.  Energy prices are not being driven up by the Government.

We have heard about the increase in the cost of energy.  All businesses are impacted.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste's responses this morning to oral questions.  The Government has taken some steps in this regard.  The temporary business energy support scheme is a good scheme, but it is worth taking a closer look at its impact.  The owners of the local Centra shop in Magheraboy contacted me and sent me copies of that business's ESB bills.  I was asked to use this shop as an example.  In 2019, for example, one of this shop's monthly bills cost just over &euro;7,000, with VAT of &euro;925.  In August 2022, this shop's bill was &euro;20,966, with VAT at 9% of &euro;1,731.  The cost has trebled and the VAT due has doubled.  I note that the TBESS will help, but only at the rate of 40%.  This shop will still be left to carry the can for 60% of the cost.  For this business, this amounts to &euro;5,000 every month.</p>  <p>  I know businesses can make savings and they are doing so assiduously already.  It is not just the impact of the energy costs alone, however, but the cumulative impact overall.  Returning to the example of my local Centra shop, rates have also increased.  This is happening in many counties.  Insurance costs have also increased.  Motor insurance costs have been addressed but public liability insurance costs have not been.  There has also been an increase in packaging costs.  The biggest increase in costs has been in wages.  The minimum wage increased by 80 cent.  I voted for it and I support it.  In fact, I would support a living wage.  The impact in this regard on these businesses, though, of paying 80 cent an hour at 1,400 hours weekly will be &euro;58,000 next year.</p>  <p>  My point is that businesses are taking one hit after another.  Their capital reserves are gone.  They cannot use capital reserves to benefit from some of the initiatives, such as that for solar panels, that the T&aacute;naiste spoke about.  These businesses are talking to the banks about interest-only repayments.  I am hearing this from retailers across my constituency, as I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is as well.  This morning, I spoke to the owner of the SuperValu shop in Manorhamilton.  He wrote to the T&aacute;naiste only a few days ago and again raised the point that it is the cumulative impacts that are really hitting businesses.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, therefore, if there is anything more he can do to deal with the cumulative impact of all these increased costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700023#V01300"><p>I welcome the Deputy's support for the increase in the national minimum wage and her call for us to go further through the introduction of a living wage.  I acknowledge that businesses are facing rising costs from many different angles, whether it is from the costs of labour, materials or energy and fuel.  The budget had several measures to help.  These included the extension of the 9% rate of VAT until the end of February.</p> <p>Crucially, the temporary business energy support scheme, which we are legislating for in the Houses at present, will refund approximately 40% of the increase in the cost of energy to businesses up to &euro;10,000 a month.</p> <p> However, there are constraints.  We need to be honest with people about that.  This is taxpayers' money.  It is over &euro;1 billion in ordinary taxpayers' money helping businesses with their energy bills.  Another &euro;1 billion in loans is being guaranteed by ordinary taxpayers to help businesses with their bills, and rightly so.  Businesses are taxpayers too and they employ people who are taxpayers, but it is still well over &euro;2 billion in financial support being provided to businesses only between now and the end of February.  It is not a small amount of money.  We need to be honest with people that we will not be able to fully cover the increase in their bills.  We are limited by EU state aid rules, which only allow us to refund 30% of the difference.  We are pushing for 40%, which is higher.  It will not be possible to go beyond that and we need to be honest about that.  Anyone calling for measures going beyond that is not making an honest call.</p> <p> I deal and engage with businesses all over the country all the time.  I talk to individuals who are in business.  They regularly give me copies of their electricity bills and gas bills, as the Deputy can imagine, so that I can see for myself what the increases are.  In most cases, they are double and treble.  I engage with the business groups headquartered here in Dublin but also chambers of commerce around the country.</p> <p> Something I am struck by, whether it is the chamber of commerce in Dublin or the chamber of commerce in Dungarvan that I met on Friday last, is that the biggest issue still coming up is the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.  It is as big an issue, if not a bigger issue, than energy costs.  We need to ask ourselves as a Government, as a Parliament and as custodians of taxpayers' money, if there are lots of businesses that cannot get staff at all, are doing well but cannot get staff, have to close early because they cannot get staff, or sometimes cannot open six or seven days a week because they cannot get staff, does it make sense to use a considerable amount of taxpayers' money to subsidise businesses that are not doing so well?  We have to be realistic about these matters.</p></speech>

Even a small supermarket employs ten to 15 people.  Those at the larger end in small towns still employ perhaps 50 or 60 people.  The money that goes into the local community from the wages is significant.  I hear what the T&aacute;naiste says about subsidising businesses that may find it hard to get staff but I ask him to think about what will happen to those staff if they lose their jobs and those communities if they lose their local supermarket, their local caf&eacute; and their services.  These are the businesses that support local clubs, local charities, local GAA clubs, soccer clubs and societies.  They are part of the fabric of many rural towns and urban centres.  We are looking at some of them closing unless they pass on these increased costs to consumers.  That will send inflation through the roof.  People will not be without supermarkets.  They will have the large chains and the multinationals but the small ones will close unless the Government looks at rates rebates or finding some other way of giving more support to these businesses.</p></speech>

We have shown true cause on that in the years that have gone by.  We have cut taxes.  We cut VAT to 9% for electricity, gas, hospitality and personal services.  We have also reduced excise on petrol and diesel.  Now we are bringing in energy subsidies to help businesses to pay their energy bills.  They will see that money in the next few weeks and it will be backdated to September.  It will help a lot.</p>  <p>  At a time of close to full employment, when lots of businesses cannot expand or open fully because they cannot get staff, it does not make sense to continue to fund and subsidise businesses that are not viable when there is another business down the road that cannot stay open because it cannot get staff.</p></speech>

They remained locked out of the scheme and facing a shortfall of tens of thousands of euro to rebuild their homes and their lives.  Ms Hone described in her own words how thousands of families are enduring life in unstable structures that are impossible to heat and are riddled with damp, black mould and dangerous electrics.  They are extremely dangerous conditions.  Ms Hone's words are true.  I have seen those homes with my own eyes.  Ms Hone also spoke of the fact that the Minister has still not appointed a senior counsel, as promised, to investigate how to pursue those who supplied the defective materials, ruining their homes and ruining their lives.</p>  <p>  The reality on the ground is that we have thousands of people in my own county and right across the State who are locked out of redress.  When will the Government bring forward the scheme that was promised over a year ago and when will it keep its promise to appoint a senior counsel to investigate those who caused such disruption and devastation in the first instance?</p></speech>

The reason I raise this with the T&aacute;naiste is because a number of people have been on to me concerned that their bills are even more inflated.  One customer had to engage in quite a number of emails and phone calls with Energia before the company admitted that it had been charging the wrong unit prices because his bill was estimated.  It took him a long time to get this.  They stated they were very sorry that they did not consider this.  For how many more customers did the company not consider this?  It was charging the wrong rate over an estimated period.  In other words, it was charging the higher rate now for a period over the last number of months.  I will be writing to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities on this but I would appreciate it if the Government would do so as well.  Obviously, this is an issue.</p></speech>

The "RT&Eacute; Investigates" documentary last week encapsulates many of the problems that probably any of us who live or work in the city knew have been happening there for a long time.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the issues on O'Connell Street are vast and complex and require a multi-departmental approach.  Dublin City Council is pointing at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Garda is saying it cannot police what are ostensibly health-based issues.  In six weeks' time, the T&aacute;naiste potentially will be the Taoiseach.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to having a Taoiseach's task force on the rejuvenation of the main thoroughfare in our city's capital because it is long past time we had leadership on this issue?</p></speech>

The issues range from dereliction to planning, addiction and policing.  They are complex.  It is not only O'Connell Street, by the way.  It might be the worst manifestation of some of the problems that we have but there are other streets that are not in good condition either.  There is already a north-east inner city task force, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>

Everyone will acknowledge that we have come a long way in the last ten years and her death ignited a movement that saw an end to the misogynistic anti-choice laws in this country.  However, we still have a way to go.  Abortion services are patchy and sometimes difficult to access.  Doctors still operate under the shadow of criminalisation.  The pro-choice movement has organised a march on Saturday, starting at 1 p.m. in Parnell Square, that I want to amplify in the hope that many people will come both to remember Savita and to honour the courage of her family and to demand that we improve the abortion legislation.</p> <p>When will we see the results of the abortion review that is long overdue?</p></speech>

As she has said, much has changed in Ireland since then in terms of our laws in this area.  The review is under way.  I do not have it in front of me but I understand that it is led by an independent chair and has two main phases.  I do not want to misinform the Deputy but I understand that it is supposed to be done by the end of this calendar year.  I will double-check and come back to the Deputy if this is not the case.</p></speech>

It is estimated this is worth approximately &euro;40 million.  It is alleged that the supplier of the fertiliser is a sanctioned Russian oligarch.  This is an incredible situation.  The Government plans to train Ukrainian military personnel in Ireland, which is clearly in breach of Irish neutrality, on the one hand and it appears the Government is allowing sanctions against Russian oligarchs to be breached on the other.  In the middle of all of this, we have farmers trying to buy fertiliser at inflated prices with very little help from the Government.  Prices are 250% higher than they were.  What investigation is the T&aacute;naiste undertaking into this importation?  Will he provide more help to farmers to deal with the shocking cost of fertiliser?</p></speech>

This morning I received a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Justice.  It states that 3,254 people arrived in this country without documentation in the first eight months of the year.  This breaks down to 400 a month or 100 a week.  The reply also states these individuals presented full documentation when they boarded at their point of departure.  When they arrived at Dublin Airport they had no documentation.  What is going on?  We are trying to accommodate people who have a right to be looked after.  If people have no documentation when they arrive, surely there must be some checks.  The sheer amount in eight months is crazy.  Do we have enough police at immigration in Dublin Airport?  I do not believe we do.  These are very frightening figures.  They are from the Minister for Justice I will forward the T&aacute;naiste the reply I received.</p></speech>

I have not seen the figures.  We do have a problem with people entering the country illegally.  This is the case and has been for quite some time.  Sometimes people are not properly checked when they get on the plane.  That happens in a different jurisdiction and there is very little we can do about it.  Other times people use false documents.  Sometimes, people destroy their documents.  If people present at the airport to claim asylum and have no documents, it is very difficult for us to send them back.  These are the practical difficulties that we face.  Even without documents, people are entitled to apply for asylum.  We have been increasing checks and increasing engagement with the airlines.  We remind airlines they have a responsibility not to allow people to board unless they have the right documents and they have to take them back.  We must also ensure that we have the checks at the airport.</p></speech>

One lady from Grange, Sligo pledged a room last March.  She was Garda vetted in the summer.  The house was inspected in September.  She was asked to install smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and a fire blanket.  She did all of this and she was approved.  There is still no word.  Somebody from Boyle, County Roscommon, wants to provide 14 places of accommodation on a commercial basis.  He applied six months ago.  My question this morning is, who do these people contact?  Is it the Red Cross, the International Protection Accommodation Services, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or the local authority?</p></speech>

If it is on a commercial basis it is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or the local authority.  I have had the same experience as the Deputy of people who have pledged accommodation in their own homes or perhaps in a property they own on a non-commercial basis and of people who are offering properties on a commercial basis.  They tell me how frustrated they are that they are not getting the level of engagement or of response that they should be getting.  I have heard the same stories and they are real.  Let us not forget we have accommodated more than 40,000 people.  It is not that nothing has been done but it is clear that more offers are being made and we need to take them up.  We need to intensify our efforts throughout the Government to make sure it happens.</p></speech>

The total of 45,000 planning permissions is also the highest of the past 15 years.  What is clear is that while 80% of housing permissions are being completed, only 40% of apartment permissions are being built and completed.  How have the two Land Development Agency initiatives to activate these delayed permissions done?  Can more be done to drive the commencement of apartment developments?</p></speech>

I saw the housing numbers today also.  They are very encouraging.  They are better than we had expected with 7,544 new dwellings completed in the three summer months of July, August and September.  This is an increase of 62.5% on last year.  The number of apartments has more than doubled.  Over the first three quarters of this year, more than 20,000 new homes were built.  We can confidently say we will reach our target of 25,000 new homes being built this year in Ireland.  The Deputy is right.  Apartment completions have increased a lot but they are still lagging behind housing.  Two initiatives from the Government are taking place at present to activate apartment developments.  One is the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe process that the Deputy is aware of.  It does not yet have European Commission approval but there is a lot of interest in it.  We have agreed in principle to mandate the Land Development Agency to pre-purchase apartments for affordable housing and social housing to de-risk developments in order that they can go ahead and get started.</p></speech>

They pay three, four and five times the rate of other providers.  They have no right to switch to another provider.  They are not regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Even people who have not turned on the heat received bills for approximately &euro;400 a month for July and August.  I have a set of bills in front of me.  They go from 0.8 cent per kilowatt hour to 21 cent, 31 cent, 49 cent and 59 cent per kilowatt hour since January.  Even if people do not turn on their heat, they can pay &euro;2, &euro;3 and up to &euro;6 a day in non-usage charges.

The conference will hear that greenhouse gas emissions were at record levels last year.  Ireland has ambitious targets that are agreed.  They include a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  To achieve that, offshore wind will play a significant role.  Our ports will also play a significant role but they will need to be ready.  We know they sought funding through the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, but they were not successful.  We do not have a port that is ready for the manufacture and installation of offshore wind infrastructure.  They will need significant funding, be it through the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or green funds.  Is this a priority for the T&aacute;naiste and his Department?

It found that while much progress was made, we are still among the worst in the EU for ovarian and breast cancer outcomes.  The report specifically cited that our drug reimbursement system is not fit for purpose and that it costs the equivalent of 2,600 life years per annum due to the cumbersome nature of the reimbursement process.  Can we, please, prioritise the publication of the Mazars report, which looks into reimbursement, and update the rare disease plan, which expired since 2018?

Rates are ahead of those in the UK but are still behind the EU average.  The impact of what we did five or ten years ago is being seen in the statistics now.

It is absolutely critical that the economic argument for the western rail corridor, both freight and rail, is included in the all-Ireland strategic rail review report to boost sustainable connectivity and address regional imbalance.  I attended a conference in Tuam on achieving regional balance.  There is cross-party support throughout the entire western region for the restoration of this key infrastructure, which has lain idle for far too long.  If the corridor is extended to Claremorris, it will provide a strategic objective, connecting the Port of Waterford and Shannon Foynes Port to Ballina.  For that reason, the Foynes project and the Galway-Mayo link should commence without delay.  The importance of opening the western rail corridor cannot be stressed enough and I hope the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are giving it serious consideration.</p></speech>

The case for extending the western rail corridor is stronger than it was in the past given that public finances are in a much better state and we are able to increase capital spending, the need to meet our climate plans, the high cost of fuel and the desire to get more freight off the roads and onto the rail lines.  I know consideration is being given to a commuter to Tuam service and the possibility of freight from Athenry to Claremorris.  However, we will have to see the outcome of that review before we can make any decisions at Government level.</p></speech>

The most important thing is that garda&iacute; are rostered for when we need them.  They are there to serve the public.  They must be rostered for when we need them most.  That is my position but I also acknowledge that we must make sure it provides an attractive career.  The same thing often applies in health care.  People say that doctors and nurses should work 24-7, every weekend.  You will not recruit any doctors or nurses if you expect that.  Therefore, we must get the balance right.</p></speech>

That occurred on 25 October, with the worst of the winter yet to come.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is looking for a number of measures to ensure the situation in CUH does not deteriorate in the coming weeks and months in order that we do not have a terrible winter.  These includes additional specialists to be directed by the HSE to CUH, a bespoke plan for CUH, and additional capacity in the Cork region to be found from wherever it can, including from the private sector.</p></speech>

There are lots of reasons for this.  As the Deputy knows, giving the fact that the pandemic restrictions are now gone - although Covid is not gone - there is pent-up demand stemming from the pandemic period.  We also have an increasingly aging population.  All those factors are giving rise to what could be a very busy winter in our emergency departments.  Many of the actions mentioned by the Deputy will be taken, including the recruitment of additional specialist, securing additional capacity where we can, the use of the private sector and the use of home care.</p> <p>We will do as much as we can to increase capacity within hospitals and emergency departments, as well as to get people out quicker and to avoid people going to hospital, where possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700028#DD00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  Today I am bringing the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill before the House.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a scheme to make payments and to provide a form of enhanced medical card to eligible applicants.  The scheme will recognise the time spent and the harsh conditions, emotional abuse and other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma, experienced by people while resident in a mother and baby or county home institution.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Government is under no illusion that there is any financial payment or service provision that could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been impacted by the shameful legacy of mother and baby home institutions in Ireland.  That immense pain has had a unique impact on each and every survivor.  We cannot take that pain away and I am truly sorry for that.  However, we can offer support to all of those who need it and ensure that such things never happen again.</p>  <p>  I thank survivors for sharing their experiences with me and with many of Members here today to help us all understand what they have been through.  Recognising the unique impact of time spent in these institutions on each and every survivor requires a wide range of tailored remedies.</p>  <p>  Redress means different things to different people and as such the Government's action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions seeks to provide an enduring response to the priority needs of all those concerned.  The mother and baby institutions payment scheme is one action in this broad-reaching plan, which spans a wide range of priority issues that have been raised by survivors and includes significant commitments across the areas of apology; access to personal information; health supports; financial payments; memorialisation; records, archives and databases; education and research; and dignified burial.</p>  <p>  The ongoing work in this area is a top priority for me, with eight of the 22 commitments set out in the action plan already achieved and intensive work under way on many others.  Following the publication of the general scheme of this Bill last March, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth conducted pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am grateful to the Chair, Deputy Funchion, and all of the members for their examination of the legislative proposals.  I also appreciate the committee's acknowledging the features of the scheme which it welcomed, including the low burden of proof built into the design of the scheme and the moves beyond the commission of investigation's recommendations, particularly regarding including in the scheme survivors who were resident in the institutions post 1973.  This low burden of proof has been achieved by basing the approach to the scheme on time spent in an institution.</p>  <p>  I carefully considered the committee's recommendations.  I believe the Bill represents a considerable improvement on the general scheme published last March.  I have been able to incorporate some of the committee's recommendations in the Bill.  Some other recommendations are being considered as part of the design and operational roll-out of the scheme itself, while the intent of some others is being achieved through the broader action plan.  As recommended by the committee, the scheme has been designed with regard to human rights and equality principles.  The proposals were informed by an advisory paper prepared by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission as well as by the public consultation process undertaken by OAK.</p>  <p>  The recommendations that the administration of the scheme should be underscored by independence also feature in the Bill.</p> <p>The office of the chief deciding officer will function as part of my Department in order to benefit from its corporate structures and to allow for a quicker establishment of the scheme.  However, the Bill provides that the chief deciding officer will be independent in the performance of his or her functions.  Furthermore, recourse to an independent appeals process is also provided for in the Bill.<br/><br/>With regard to the recommended expansion of the scheme to cover additional institutions, the Bill provides for the list of institutions in Schedule 1 to be expanded if it were to come to light that an institution fulfilled a similar function with regard to single women and their children as the 14 mother and baby institutions for which the State had a regulatory or inspection function.  One of the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations called for survivors to be provided with funded legal aid at all stages of engaging with the scheme.  The Bill makes provision for applicants to be financially supported in obtaining legal services in two circumstances, namely, where an affidavit is required and where they wish to seek legal advice at the point of accepting a payment under the scheme and, thus, signing a legal waiver.  It is important to note that the scheme will adopt a non-adversarial approach and applicants will not be required to bring forward evidence of abuse suffered.  Applicants will be supported in making an application to the scheme and throughout that process.<br/><br/>On the recommendation to increase the payment amounts under the scheme, I have improved the overall approach to the payment rates by introducing more refined bands.  This will benefit applicants, particularly where they would have been at the upper end of a given annual band under the original proposals.  I have also introduced into the Bill that periods of temporary absence of up to 180 days can be included when calculating the total duration of a person's time in a relevant institution and their corresponding financial payment.  This recognises that many mothers and children spent time outside an institution, for example, as a result of a hospital stay.  The inclusion of such periods of temporary absences will also have the effect of increasing the payment amounts which some applicants may be entitled to.<br/><br/>There was another cohort of recommendations which are not directly reflected in the Bill but which are being incorporated in the design and operational roll-out of the scheme.  When the scheme is operational, a comprehensive communications campaign will be undertaken both in Ireland and abroad.  My officials are currently working on the overall communications strategy for the scheme.  The recommendation that a stakeholder advisory group should be established is also being taken on board as part of the design and roll-out of the scheme, with plans in development to put in place a stakeholder reference group.  Under action 1 of the Government's action plan, work is also under way on the development of a new structure to support wider stakeholder engagement.<br/><br/>This brings me on to a number of recommendations where the intent is being achieved through the broader action plan.  For example, in terms of the use of sensitive and appropriate language, researchers from the University of Galway, funded by my Department, have been working on a project aiming to highlight the stigmatising and labelling language that has been used in the past, and to provide guidance as to how to address this issue.  With regard to the role of local authorities in assisting survivors, I continue to liaise with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how survivors can be better supported.  Counselling support is available to all survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions through the national counselling service in the HSE.  It is free of charge, including out-of-hours support, and those who identify themselves as survivors of the institutions are prioritised for the next available counselling space.<br/><br/>In the context of the action plan, I want to address the sentiments expressed by those who feel excluded from redress because their circumstances are not covered by the payment scheme.  I stress again that it is through the action plan that the Government is delivering the most inclusive response possible to the suffering experienced by so many who have been hurt by Ireland's legacy in this area.  The scheme is one element of that plan and can only deliver a limited amount.  Following deliberations on the design of the scheme, it was decided that a general payment, based on time spent in the institution, was the best option in order to provide for a non-adversarial approach to delivering the scheme.  It is not a perfect solution but it means applicants will not have to bring forward evidence of abuse, harm or mistreatment in order to benefit from the scheme.  This approach, unfortunately, does not cater for the circumstances of people who were boarded.  Given their very individual experiences, they would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>The action plan includes other measures that will provide support and assistance to those who were boarded out as children, including access to birth and early life information as part of the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022, and the provision of an <i>ex-gratia</i>payment to reimburse anyone who was boarded out and had to pay inheritance taxes for farms they inherited from their foster parents.  Furthermore, funding of &euro;330,000 has been provided for specialist therapeutic counselling services to persons who were boarded out or placed at nurse as children.  Those who were boarded out after having spent more than six months in a mother and baby or county institution will of course be able to apply to the payment scheme for the time spent in that institution.<br/><br/>With regard to children who spent less than six months in an institution and were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family, the overwhelming priority need expressed is for access to records.  The action plan responds to their needs through the recently enacted Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.  From 3 October, statutory Information and tracing services under the Act opened, guaranteeing people access to their birth and early life information.  In the first two weeks, over 4,000 applications have been received under the Act.  The Government's proposals for the scheme mean financial payments will be made to an estimated 34,000 people and a form of enhanced medical card will be provided to an estimated 19,000 people who were resident in mother and baby and county home institutions, at a value of approximately &euro;800 million.  These proposals go significantly beyond the recommendations of the commission of investigation, under which an estimated 6,500 people would have been eligible for a financial payment, at an estimated cost of &euro;400 million.  This will be the largest scheme of its kind in the history of the State in terms of beneficiaries, recognising the scale of the impact of mother and baby institutions on Irish society.<br/><br/>I will now outline the key parts of the Bill as initiated.  Part 1 provides for a number of preliminary matters including commencement and the payment of expenses for the administration of the Act and the making of regulations and orders.  Part 1 also provides for the relevant definitions.  A key definition is that of &quot;relevant person&quot;, encompassing a person who was resident as a child or a mother, or both, in one of the institutions listed in Schedule 1, and, therefore, eligible to apply for the scheme.<br/><br/>Part 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme and its duration, guaranteeing that all applications received before the closing date of the scheme will be processed.  The scheme will be administered through the office of the chief deciding officer of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, which will be situated in my Department.  The chief deciding officer will be independent in the performance of their functions relating to the scheme.  In order that the scheme may open as quickly as possible, this approach allows for the office to draw on my Department's existing infrastructure and resources to support the fastest possible establishment of the scheme, including the administrative structures required to operate it.  The chief deciding officer will be provided with staff to assist with the operation of the scheme, and there is potential to contract third-party support to undertake some of the more straightforward processing tasks.  The office of the chief deciding officer will widely promote awareness of the scheme, in Ireland and abroad, and will prepare an annual report, which I will lay before each House of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Part 3 provides for all aspects of the application, determination and notification processes for applicants and also for the arrangements in respect of internal reviews and the independent appeals process, where an applicant is not happy with a determination on their application.<br/><br/>The benefits available to applicants under the scheme are a general payment, a work-related payment, an enhanced medical card and a health support payment.  The overall determination of an applicant's eligibility for benefits under the scheme hinges on his or her period of residence in one of the institutions.  The general and work-related payment amounts will rise based on time spent in one of the institutions.  Regarding eligibility for the health support payment, applicants who are deemed eligible for a form of enhanced medical card under the scheme but who live outside of Ireland may choose to take the card or opt instead to receive a once-off health support payment of &euro;3,000, in recognition of their individual health needs.<br/><br/>The Bill sets out what people need to do to make an application to the scheme.  One application can cover time spent in different institutions, so only one application to the scheme is required.  However, if an additional institution is added to Schedule 1, a person will be entitled to make a further application in respect of that institution.  Certain applications can be prioritised, having regard to the age or health status of the applicant, if the chief deciding officer considers it is in the interest of fairness and efficiency to do so.  To support the assessment of applications, the Bill provides for the office of the chief deciding officer to be able to search the copy of the commission of investigation's archive held by my Department, to establish the applicant's period of residency in a relevant institution.  The office of the chief deciding officer will also have the authority to request relevant information from an &quot;information source&quot;, where they hold relevant records that are not held in the archive.  In the limited circumstances where records may not be available, the Bill allows for affidavits to be sought at the application stage.</p></speech>
