    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00400"><p>The question relates to the corporate sustainability due diligence COM (2022) 71.  It is an extremely important proposal, which I believe we need to get right.  From the hearings we have had and the small piece of research into this that I have done I believe there is a real opportunity for us to get this right and make a difference.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00500"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly for the question on the proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, CSDD, which was published by the European Commission on 23 February 2022.  It addresses corporate behaviour and due diligence processes for the companies within its scope.  The proposal focuses on establishing a system within company law and corporate governance to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising from companies' own operations, their subsidiaries' operations and their value chains.</p>  <p>  At the outset I wish to state that Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed directive, which should promote responsible business conduct and is seeking to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections while ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate and enforceable.  The proposal will apply to large companies, both EU and non-EU.  SMEs are not directly within scope but may be indirectly impacted under the proposal, for example, if they are part of a large company's supply chain.  </p>  <p>  The proposal has the potential to be far reaching and it is vital that we get it right.  Good progress has been made in discussions to date at EU level but further work is needed to clarify aspects of the proposal, ensure that the practical implications are well understood and that the obligations on companies are reasonable and effective.  For example there has been relatively little discussion of financial sector aspects of the proposal and clarification has been sought on the interaction of the proposal with the suite of existing regulation in the financial sector.  Fundamental issues relating to the scope and definitions remain and are currently under discussion.  There is considerable interest in the proposal across a wide range of interests and my Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders, including civil society organisations and business representative organisations, since the proposal was published.  Officials in my Department have met members of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, ICBHR, and with the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, the latest of which was two weeks ago.  I myself will be meeting both groups in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  It was promised that this directive on corporate sustainability due diligence would ensure that EU companies undertook due diligence and checks along their full supply lines to prevent environmental abuses and human rights violations.  The aims behind the directive were welcomed by progressive politicians, trade unionists, environmental groups and human rights groups.  As it stands, however, unfortunately the law falls far short of what is needed to protect workers, communities and our environment.  The directive falls short of what we need because it will only apply to companies with an annual turnover of &euro;150 million and more than 500 employees and companies in high-risk industries such as agriculture and fashion with more than 250 employees.  Will the Minister of State outline for me the clear policy position of the Irish Government on this corporate sustainability and due diligence directive?  Will Ireland act at European level to raise the ambition of this directive and address the weaknesses that have been highlighted?  The Minister of State said he met representatives of the ICBHR.  I am sure it has outlined to him the weaknesses in this proposal.  The Minister of State should indicate what is our position and what we are doing to address those weaknesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00650"><p>As I said earlier I will personally meet representatives of the ICBHR and the other bodies in the coming weeks.  SMEs are not within the scope directly but may be indirectly affected.  Deputy O'Reilly confirmed what the thresholds are.  We currently consider these thresholds to be appropriate.  While I hear the Deputy's criticisms, it should be noted that the cohort of companies within those thresholds accounts for some 50% of the annual turnover of all the companies within the EU.  It is important to ensure that the right companies are within the scope, namely, those companies with the potential to make significant adverse impacts on human rights and environmental matters and which, through their actions, have the ability to change value chains and change these matters.  By extending the threshold the concern is you will take in much smaller companies that are not in a position to make the kind of changes that are necessary.  The aim is to reach a degree of appropriateness in regard to the transposition of this directive.  I certainly will pursue those issues.  We will come back to the House on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A00700"><p>Human rights abuses are never appropriate and no company is immune to engaging in them regardless of its size.  Sorcha Tunney, the co-ordinator for the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, stated recently "We need to take forced labour, deforestation and oil spills out of our shopping baskets once and for all, but this proposal just doesn't go far enough and is riddled with loopholes."  The current guidelines as they stand will exclude 99% of companies.  Only 1% of companies will be included.  The reality is that any size of company can engage in human rights abuses or environmental destruction or both.  Therefore the directive on corporate sustainability and due diligence has to be sufficiently broad and strong to reflect this.  I am worried that the Minister of State stated that some companies may not be able to put the necessary checks and balances in place and make the changes that will be needed, because we are talking about changes that will prevent human rights and environmental abuses.  It should apply in the broadest sense to as many companies as possible.  I do not believe any company can claim immunity just by virtue of its size.  We are talking about human rights abuses, we are talking about environmental destruction. </p></speech>

It is about the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the regulations.  As I said, 50% of companies with the biggest turnover in the EU will be affected by this directive.  We need to make sure that in its implementation it is effective and that it actually does what we want it to do, rather than it being an ineffective piece of work that does not actually achieve.  My concern is also that by extending it in the manner on which the Deputy is focusing, companies that are not in a position to actually make effective use of it will not be able to do so.  We have to get an appropriate balance and ensure that we get the result we all want in respect of environmental sustainability and human rights.  The best way to do that is to ensure it is effective.</p></speech>

At that time the Minister of State, Deputy English, stated that we wanted to see it speedily and effectively implemented.  He was going to call me that afternoon to see how we could have regulations to get this implemented because we do not need legislation.  Where are the regulations?  What has happened?  We are back into winter.  The issue of ventilation is going to be central in regard to the spread of Covid-19 again.  What has the Government done to ensure that workers have the right to clean air?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700003#A01200"><p>As the Deputy is aware, following our discussion that night on his Private Members&rsquo; Bill on workplace ventilation, which was not opposed by the Government, I asked the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to start immediately a formal review of the existing provisions on workplace ventilation to determine what further enhancement measures could be considered.  Following this review, a decision was made to update the existing regulations and to introduce a robust code of practice on ventilation in the workplace.  Both the new regulations and the new code of practice are being progressed by my Department officials in conjunction with the HSA.</p> <p>The code of practice for indoor air quality will set out the optimal standards for indoor air quality, along with detailed practical guidance for employers and employees.  A code of practice is an established compliance mechanism and can be referred to in legal proceedings.  </p> <p> The board of the HSA has approved the draft code of practice for indoor air quality for public consultation.  The public consultation will commence in the week beginning 31 October 2022, that is, next week.  It will last about four weeks.  The timeline for the publication of the finalised code of practice will depend on the extent of any amendments to be made following the public consultation but it is anticipated that the code of practice will be published in early 2023 and the updated regulations will be introduced at the same time. </p> <p> The existing 2007 general application regulations create a requirement on employers to make sure that there is an adequate supply of ventilation in the workplace and that the evaluation of ventilation forms part of an overall workplace risk assessment.  Amendment of the general application regulations will bring into force the new code of practice for indoor air quality.  Any worker who is concerned about appropriate levels of ventilation in their workplace should immediately contact the HSA for advice and guidance on the matter.</p> <p> This is progressing quite well as per our agreement on that, even with the Deputy&rsquo;s legislation as well.  I believe our regulations will probably go further and achieve more.  The Deputy&rsquo;s legislation requires specific Covid measures and we are trying to improve air ventilation in general, which has many other benefits beyond the prevention of the spread of Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00200"><p>The Minister of State said there will be a code of practice.  What will be the consequence if a company does not abide by the code of practice?  What is the level prescribed in terms of CO<sub>2</sub>parts per million in the code of practice?</p><p>Our Bill did not just relate to Covid, rather, it related to CO<sub>2</sub>parts per million.  It effectively was a proxy for the likely presence of Covid but it related to the air being of good quality.  This is a moment when it is not just in relation to Covid but where we can guarantee workers access to clean air at work.  It is estimated that 2 million disability-adjusted life years are lost in the EU 28 each year due to poor indoor air quality and effects, which include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, asthma, respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute intoxication.  We need to know what the levels are and what the consequences are for not sticking to them.</p><p>This is a problem.  We are going into winter again, people will be inside more and Covid will spread.  This needs to be done as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00300"><p>The fact that the code of practice is being published next week means we are moving it pretty quickly.  It will be in place in 2023, which I must remind the Deputy is only about eight or nine weeks away.  It is not as if we are saying this will be in a couple of years&rsquo; time.  To be fair, there is a process to go through when updating these regulations.  I assume the Deputy wants this done right.  I believe it will be done right in the way it is being done.</p>  <p>  The code of practice will be published next week.  The development of the regulations to bring into force the new code of practice in the workplace is being progressed by officials.  The existing 2007 regulations are being amended to impose an obligation on employers to comply with higher standards of indoor air quality, which will be set out in the associated code of practice.  The updated regulations will give legal effect to the code of practice.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what that is about.  The code of practice for indoor air quality will set out the optimum standard for indoor air quality, along with detailed practical advice and guidance for employers and employees on areas such as contaminants, indoor air and its sources and health effects, risk assessment, indoor pollutants and their thresholds, measurement and analysis, ventilation strategy, ventilation types and appropriate control measures, along with practical checklists and a tool for employers.  Under the code of practice, the HSA inspectors will have the full range of powers available to them, including the right to assess a report of inspection, serve an improvement or prohibition notice, enter a place of work, question certain individuals, investigate and examine records and examine the workplace activity and processes carried out.  Findings can be used in criminal proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00400"><p>Let us see what the code of practice is.  I wonder whether there is a need for a primary legislative framework for there to be real, substantial sanctions on employers that do not provide clean air for their workers.  Belgium, for example, which has been one of the first movers on this in the EU, is currently introducing something quite similar to our Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill.</p>  <p>  Has the Department any idea of how many people who have long Covid were infected in their workplace?  Will the Department change its policy of refusing to classify Covid as an occupational illness?  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service estimated last January that there could be around 115,000 people in Ireland suffering from long Covid.  We will add more people to that list over the course of the coming winter and many of them will have picked Covid and long Covid up in their workplaces in poorly ventilated buildings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00500"><p>Again, we analysed the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill and we felt that amending existing regulations was a more appropriate and pragmatic way of achieving the objectives of that Bill.  We probably will have achieved the same things.</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s Bill, as drafted, focused primarily on improved workplace ventilation.  However, both the Department and the HSA believe that workplace ventilation goes beyond Covid-19.  The code of practice will provide a more long-term, sustainable and holistic approach to workplace ventilation and gives flexibility to further updates, as opposed to primary legislation.  The Bill, as currently drafted, is quite prescriptive.  It is not practical to use primary legislation to deal with every single place of work because places of work are very different.  They differ greatly from one another and the impact of CO<sub>2</sub>readings must be judged in the context of different workplaces with different workforces at different times.  </p><p>The measurement of CO<sub>2</sub>levels was recommended by the Government&rsquo;s expert group on ventilation as an effective measure of identifying poorly ventilated, multi-occupant and enclosed indoor areas.  The work safety protocol set out how these monitors should be used in the workplace.  However, a high CO<sub>2</sub>monitor reading is not a proxy for risk of exposure to Covid-19 but, rather, for identifying poor ventilation.  This needs to be fully appreciated when reading CO<sub>2</sub>levels, as well as the fact that other sources of CO<sub>2</sub>exist in certain workplaces.  That is why we think regulations that can be changed and adjusted as we move on are important.</p></speech>

Has preparatory work begun to incorporate these recommendations into legislation given that, as we know, the European Council has given the green light to the EU directive on adequate minimum wages and collective bargaining on 4 October?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700004#B00800"><p>Collective bargaining is an important element of ensuring good industrial relations in Ireland.  Industrial relations stability comes from a voluntarist system where the State does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but will assist them at arriving at one.  This approach has served us well in resolving many complex and protracted disputes.  However, our laws are very weak when parties refuse to engage.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, I appointed a high-level working group under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, to review collective bargaining and the industrial relations landscape.  I want to record my appreciation to the group, the employer and trade union representatives and its chairperson, Professor Michael Doherty of Maynooth University, for their hard work in concluding this report.  The report was published earlier this month and is now available to the public on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  The report is timely, as we need to keep abreast of developments at EU level, which require us to promote the capacity of social partners to engage in effective collective bargaining systems.  The EU directive on minimum wages and collective bargaining was adopted by the European Council on 4 October and I welcome the directive&rsquo;s focus on strengthening collective bargaining structures in member States.</p>  <p>  The way forward is by no means predetermined and we have to work through the various legal hurdles and legislative issues in this area.  I have asked my Department to carefully consider the report, consult with stakeholders and develop proposals for the Government in respect of its implementation.  These proposals may well include examining how recommendations need to be incorporated into legislation.  I am pleased to inform the House that this work is already under way.</p>  <p>   I look forward to continuing to engage, through the LEEF, on the issues raised in the report and how we can continue to promote positive industrial relations in Ireland.</p></speech>

I want to particularly thank Patricia King, the outgoing general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a former colleague and, indeed, a very good friend of mine.  I wish her well in her retirement.  I also wish Owen Reidy, the incoming general secretary, well.  He has much work to do.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s answer does not fill me with an awful lot of optimism that this will get moving quickly.  We need to expand the percentage of workers who are covered by some form of collective bargaining.  It is clear that we need legislation to be able to facilitate this.  It is not our job as legislators to organise workers; we know that.  However, it is our job to create the conditions for workers to be able to organise.  As I have said many times on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber and in other places, the best way for a worker to ensure that his or her voice is heard at work is to join his or her trade union and be active in it.  Unfortunately, however, the system as it currently stands facilitates employers effectively ignoring not just their trade union, but the will of their own workforce.</p></speech>

I interacted with her in many ways and on many levels in the past ten years or so.  She is a very impressive person and I wish her the best in her future.  As the Deputy is aware, Ms King will continue to be a member of the commission on housing and to bring her expertise to the table in that regard.  In addition, I congratulate Owen Reidy on his recent appointment to his new role in ICTU.</p>  <p>  To give the Deputy some assurance, we will get moving on this.  The new directive is now European law.  It is not a choice.  We cannot ignore it, nor do we want to.  The European directive requires us to have 70% or 80% of the working population covered by some form of collective bargaining.  That does not necessarily mean being a member of a trade union or trade union recognition; it can be done through joint labour committees, JLCs, or different mechanisms.  It is absolutely the case, however, that we need to make progress in this regard.  We are only at about 30%, so the gap is large.  I anticipate that there will be legislative change next year.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste stated, trade union density is at a low level and that means protection for workers is at a low level because the two things are interlinked.</p>  <p>  An issue that is not expressly related to this but on which the T&aacute;naiste and I have corresponded previously is that agencies that are funded by the Government are also ignoring Labour Court recommendations when they do not have the funds to respond.  That makes a mockery of the system.  The quicker we can move to a system of collective bargaining and recognition, the better.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, we may have different views on how that might be done, but we need to expedite this legislation because workers have waited a very long time for this.  Trade union density being at its current level means that protection for workers is at a low level and that needs to change.  Many of the practices that could be stamped out by having collective bargaining and strong unionised workforces were exposed during Covid.  We need to move quickly on this.</p></speech>

I know she will agree, however, that it is important that we get this right.  That is why it will require further engagement with unions and employers.  We also need to have particular regard to small business and how this would operate at the level of a company that might only have one or two employees.  There is a lot to be worked out at this stage.  It is not intended to make Labour Court recommendations legally binding.  The Deputy will be aware of unions that have not respected Labour Court recommendations, particularly in the public transport sector.  That does work both ways.  The fundamental change that needs to come about is there needs to be proper legal procedures where employers refuse to engage.  That is the change I anticipate happening both in terms of refusal to co-operate or participate or to appoint members to JLCs.  As regards the wider issue of where employees want to be represented by a union but their employer states it will not even have a meeting with them, that is not going to be sustainable into the future.</p></speech>

The cost of energy, and the cost of doing business generally, is rising, interest rates are going up and consumer confidence is waning, so businesses need help with their energy bills.  The Government has introduced a significant package in the budget to help them in the coming months.</p>  <p>  This morning, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I launched the &euro;200 million Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  It will be implemented through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and is now open for applications.  It is not limited to client companies of those agencies.  It will assist viable but vulnerable firms of all sizes in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors that are suffering liquidity problems or are affected by severe rises in energy costs as a result of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  The scheme will operate under two streams and will provide between &euro;20,000 and &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available in the markets, thereby reducing additional costs for firms.  For energy-intensive companies impacted by exceptionally severe increases in gas or electricity costs, the scheme will provide for a minimum of &euro;20,000 and a maximum of &euro;2 million per firm.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the climate action plan, the scheme recognises the importance of encouraging sustainability, and successful applicants will be required to put in place an energy efficiency plan.  I point out that the scheme is only for manufacturers and those involved in the internationally traded sectors.</p>  <p>  The scheme will work alongside other measures announced in the budget, such as the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme which will provide &euro;1.2 billion in low-cost lending to business, and the temporary business energy support scheme, administered through the Revenue Commissioners.  The latter scheme is being finalised at present and will have an estimated cost of approximately &euro;1.25 billion.  It will provide energy subsidies to businesses of that level.</p></speech>

I have raised previously with the T&aacute;naiste the need for specific sectoral supports.  I highlight the food processing sector, which is in real trouble, and food retailers.  I recently wrote to finance Ministers regarding a south-east food processing company whose monthly bill has gone from &euro;8,000 to &euro;48,000.  Just last night, I was in discussion with Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland.  More than 650 butcher shops are facing increases in their electricity rates, with bills rising from less than &euro;1,000 to more than &euro;4,500 per month.  That is unsustainable.  Two butcher shops closed in the past week alone.  There is a need for urgency here.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste stated that the TBESS is due to open.  When will it be available to be accessed?  These businesses will not remain viable for much longer.  Many of these small butcher shops are very much integrated in the rural and regional economy and employ between two and eight people each.  This is an indigenous sector that badly needs to be supported.</p></speech>

The scheme announced this morning is now open for applications through the agencies.  I will have to double check to be certain, but I think food processing should be covered under the scheme because it is the manufacture of food products and most of our food is exported, so I anticipate that the companies to which the Deputy refers could apply under the scheme.  They would have to demonstrate that their energy bills constitute a significant amount of their turnover and that their profits are down.  This may be an option for some of them.</p>  <p>  I need to be frank with the House, however.  We are not going to be in a position to cover fully the cost of increases in electricity bills for business, no more than we can do it for households.  There are limitations on the budget even though the economy is going well.  We know the effect of unlimited price promises across the water.  We are not going to do that.  We are not going to be able to cover fully the increased cost, unfortunately.  In addition, we are covered by EU temporary crisis framework state aid rules.  They are there for good reasons, namely, to protect the taxpayer and to ensure that different countries do not engage in unfair competition.</p></speech>

I welcome the news of the Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  I hope the company to which I referred will be able to access funding under the scheme.</p>  <p>  There are incredible challenges right across the business and SME sectors, particularly for companies such as food processors which are using large amounts of gas or electricity and whose business model has been completely destroyed.  We need to have a clear strategy in terms of what we are trying to do.  I accept, as I am sure does every other Member, that we cannot save every business, but we do need to have a serious look at the businesses that can be saved, particularly those that contribute to Tourism Ireland and our tourism offering.  The hospitality and retail sectors are part of that.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste clarified when the TBESS scheme will be open and business will be able to access funding from it.  That is what these small businesses need, particularly now.  They just need some relief from the bills they are facing.</p></speech>

The temporary business energy support scheme requires legislation.  The Finance Bill has to get through this House and the Seanad before that scheme can be up and running.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>Presuming we get the Finance Bill through the Houses, and I believe we will, we would expect it to be up and running by the end of November or early December.  Any payments will be backdated to September.  Businesses can be assured that they will receive money through the Revenue Commissioners before Christmas to help them with their energy bills, not just going forward but backdated to September.  </p></speech>

Indeed, he has commented on it previously.  In a half-mile triangle in the town we now have three companies employing 2,300 people.  That is certain to grow with Abbott Diagnostics, Avery Dennison Medical and Technimark Ireland all focused on growth plans.  Mindful of the importance of foreign direct investment, FDI, for provincial Ireland, I ask the Minister of State to update the House on the IDA's plans for an advanced building solution for Longford town.</p></reply>

As the House knows, regional development is at the centre of IDA Ireland's current strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024.  Under this strategy the IDA is targeting half of all investments to regional locations which aligns with the objectives of the programme for Government.  Specifically, the IDA is targeting 25 investments for the midlands region, including Longford, in the period from 2021 to 2024.</p>  <p>  Longford, as Deputy Flaherty has said, is already home to six IDA Ireland client companies directly employing more than 1,300 people and has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with strengths in life science, technology, global business services, international financial services and engineering in industrial technologies.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the specific question from Deputy Flaherty, IDA Ireland has advised me that the site selection process for the advanced building solution in Longford is ongoing.  The IDA continues to liaise with Longford County Council and with wider stakeholders as it seeks to find a suitable site for the proposed facility.  </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, innovative and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions that meet the needs of our multinational community remains essential to winning FDI.  Over the last five years the IDA regional property programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.  In a competitive and uncertain global environment, the IDA's regional property programme, supported by my Department, ensures the supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations, as required by current and prospective clients of both IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The IDA's plan is to deliver 19 advanced building solutions in 15 regional locations across the country, including in Athlone, Longford and Mullingar.  National capital investment plans outlined in the new IDA strategy, subject to planning permission and public procurement processes, are expected to commence and be delivered within the term of the new strategy at all identified locations.  The Exchequer allocation for the IDA regional property programme in 2022 includes an additional &euro;10 million, bringing the budget for that programme to &euro;52 million.</p></speech>

Technimark Ireland is nearing completion of a new wing at its factory in Longford town and will shortly be adding 100 staff to its workforce.  In the coming days, we are expecting Abbott Diagnostics to lodge a planning application for a major expansion at its plant in Longford town which, doubtless, will lead to additional employment there also.  Throughout the period of the crash we saw the importance of FDI for provincial Ireland.  The towns that prospered or survived best during that time were those that had the benefit of tourism or of FDI.  The Minister of State will be very familiar with the importance of tourism in the context of Westport and many of the provincial towns in Mayo but where there was no tourism, it was those towns that had the benefit and the crutch of FDI that did best.  Notwithstanding the successes to date in Longford, it is critical that the Department makes it an absolute priority to ensure that IDA Ireland delivers a new advanced building solution for Longford town without any further delay.  I am conscious that there is a commitment to deliver before 2024 but we are now at the end of 2022.  This is an absolute priority for Longford.</p></speech>

In addition to that, the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, investment of &euro;10.4 million in the Camlin Quarter in Longford town, the rural regeneration development fund, RRDF, investment of &euro;1.1 million in Granard, along with the investments in Ballymahon through the very successful Center Parcs project, demonstrate a whole-of-county approach that is essential for attracting FDI.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks we have also engaged with the chair of the Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan on its work.

By way of an update, the Carlow facility is almost ready, while the one in Cavan is expected to be ready in 2023.  The IDA has recently purchased lands in Kerry, while the facilities at Galway, Dundalk, Monaghan and Sligo have all been built.  Planning permission was recently granted for a facility in Athlone and the plans for Mullingar are advancing.  As the Minister of State said, there is a commitment to deliver plants in Longford, Mullingar and Athlone before 2024.  I implore the Minister of State to visit Longford at his earliest convenience to meet officials from Longford County Council.  It behoves the local authority to take the lead on this and acquire a site.  On that basis, there would be no excuse for the IDA but to press ahead.  The quest for a site has been dragging on for too long.  We need the local authority to take the lead on this and then IDA Ireland can follow through with the investment.</p></speech>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists.  Doctors, including non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are on the critical skills list.</p>  <p>  The critical skills employment permit is targeted at highly skilled people in eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland's economy and who are in significant short supply in our labour market.  The permit provides for immediate family reunification and broad access to the labour market for dependants, spouses and partners, as well as for fast-tracking to long-term residency after two years.  The criteria attached to this permit type include the requirement for the non-EEA national to have secured a job offer and employment contract of at least two years.  As most NCHD contracts tend to be six to 12 months in duration, until recently these doctors had to apply for a general employment permit which had to be renewed after each contract.  To reduce this administrative burden, my Department, working with the Department of Health, introduced a new two-year multi-site general employment permit in November 2021.  This new permit for non-EEA doctors was established to eliminate the requirement for a new permit for each six-month rotation, thereby reducing the administrative burden on the Department, the HSE, hospitals and, most importantly, on the doctors themselves.  This new permit is only available to public hospitals who hold trusted partner status with the Department.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of this new permit, the doctor is required to provide a new contract and location to the Department at the end of each rotation, rather than applying for a new permit each time.  At the end of the two-year period, the doctor will be eligible to apply to my Department for a stamp 4 support letter, which will put him or her on a pathway to permanent residency.  Previously, this was only issued after a five-year period.</p>  <p>  To coincide with the introduction of this new permit, the Department of Justice created a new stamp 1H, which is issued to all doctors who hold a multi-site general employment permit.  This new permission requires doctors to register yearly with the Department of Justice, as well as providing a stamp 1G permission to spouses of these doctors, allowing them to access the labour market without the need for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  In addition to this new permit, in March 2022 the opening of the temporary fast track to stamp 4 permission scheme was announced.  All non-EEA doctors working in the State for more than two years while holding a general employment permit between 2018 and 2022 can apply to my Department for a stamp 4 support letter.</p></speech>

Any change being brought about which will facilitate the recruitment of doctors such that a very fast mechanism is in place is important.  As for the scheme now in place, however, is there a need to set up a review of it in, say, six months to see how it is working and to see if any further changes can be made in order to make sure we are not losing people with the medical skills to other jurisdictions?  We are competing with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.  Therefore, we need to be fast and efficient in dealing with applications.  Can a review process be put in place in, say, 12 months to see how the scheme is working, if further changes need to be made and if there are glitches in the system that need to be resolved?</p></speech>

We keep this under review.  The changes were put in place last November in our Department and then the Departments of Health and Justice followed suit.  The three Departments are working quite closely to try to prioritise this area.</p>  <p>  When it comes to judgments on the permits, we have made a lot of changes in our own Department to streamline that overall process and to be responsive.  The time for most permit applications is down to a couple of weeks now.  We have for a long number of years prioritised all cases related to health.</p>  <p>  The system is probably correct now.  It allows us to compete for talent, certainly when it comes to medical doctors, all over the world.  I think we compare quite favourably with any other jurisdiction.  We keep this under review and engage with the Departments of Health and Justice quite regularly on it.  As late as yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I and our officials all met again to review the system in general in order to see how we can align our services to make them as fast and efficient as possible.  When it comes to critical skills, we want to be able to react quickly.  I believe we can do so, but we will keep this under review.  If Deputy Burke has any issues he wants to raise directly, that is no problem at all.  I am happy to meet him.</p></speech>

It is causing huge frustration and there needs to be more co-ordination between Departments on it.  The Minister of State talked about going across his Department and the Department of Health.  His Department is also going across the Department Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a big issue as regards people being on emergency tax for a long time.  It is frustrating people and they are tending to say "I am getting out of here" because of the tax structure and the lack of a more structured process.  Once a person gets one contract, they should not have to go onto emergency tax if they move in six months' time.  That is not an issue for the Minister of State's Department but it is a case of all Departments needing to work together to try to make sure we streamline the process for these people who are coming into this country and providing a valuable service.</p></speech>

It is important that we have streamlined the process.  It is now much more accommodating to the situation regarding stamp 4 and family reunification.  The issues the Deputy raises probably cross over with the Department of Finance and Revenue as well as the Department of Social Protection.  I am certainly happy to raise them.  We have been for a long number of years trying to implement a lot more cross-departmental arrangements to solving problems, and that is working quite well.  I will raise the issues the Deputy raises.  If there are any others, I ask him to let us know because we value the expertise of the people coming to work here.  We need them to complement our own talent.  Changes have been made in respect of the number of doctors coming through our education system.  We would encourage the continuation of that work along with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in that area.  We are very much open to working cross-departmentally.  I will bring any issues the Deputy raises to the relevant Departments.</p></speech>

Understandably, a lot of businesses are very worried heading into the winter.  The cost of energy and the cost of doing business more broadly is rising.  Interest rates are going up and consumer confidence is waning.  Businesses need help with their energy bills so the Government has introduced a significant package in the budget to help them over the coming months.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the temporary business energy support scheme has been designed to help eligible businesses that have experienced a significant increase in their electricity or natural gas costs.  It will apply to trades, professions and new businesses and is currently being finalised as part of the Finance Bill, which is progressing through the Houses.</p>  <p>  This morning, along with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, I launched the new &euro;200 million Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  That is for manufacturers and internationally traded firms.  It will provide up to &euro;500,000 per firm to ensure there is sufficient liquidity available and up to &euro;2 million per firm for those businesses that are particularly energy-intensive.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;1.2 billion State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will help the wider business sector with liquidity and help it invest in energy efficiency.  I received Government approval earlier this week to publish the legislation to underpin this, which I will bring through the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Also, a new State-backed growth and sustainability loan scheme will be opened next year and will be the successor to the future growth loan scheme.</p>  <p>  The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until 28 February 2023.</p>  <p>  This is very much an evolving situation, though.  We understand the scale of the energy crisis and I assure the Deputies that we will respond with scale.</p></speech>

To what extent might a short-term and longer-term response be forthcoming if it is found necessary, given that many of the contributory factors to the dramatic oil price increases are likely to continue for a considerable time?  In those circumstances what might now be the best approach to make provision for the long battle that lies ahead?</p></speech>

The schemes being announced are very welcome and will make an enormous difference, but the energy costs of businesses like the retail businesses ringing me, particularly supermarkets, are now going up threefold.  Those businesses are very genuine.  They are huge employers in the area and they are asking if there will be latitude in the level of support provided.  The temporary business energy support scheme provides 40% off their energy costs, but in many cases their energy costs have now trebled.  I had one supermarket on to me whose costs have gone from &euro;16,000 per month to &euro;48,000 in the past month alone, and they will go even higher again.</p>  <p>  All the schemes are great.  I just want to know if there will be latitude in the percentage discount the Government can give under the temporary business energy support scheme.  Will the Department have further flexibility in being able to extend the scheme beyond February of next year if the energy crisis continues?  Furthermore, is there flexibility under the scheme to allow for charities, which operate very much in supporting sectors?</p></speech>

Its latest bill is for &euro;8,000.  The story relating to the company is on the front page of our local paper as a result of the fact that it is asking its customers to leave early in the afternoon because it cannot afford to light the shop, cook the food or keep the fridges going the way it wants to.  I welcome all of the T&aacute;naiste's announcements and the work he is doing but businesses under a certain size find it much harder to bear the increased costs of their heating and cooling operations, particularly butchers like Callaghans in Ardee, the Bare Food Company and Tuites Butchers in Drogheda.  Many people have serious worries.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look again at smaller businesses, which do not have the margin capacity of larger businesses to shift their profit and losses on different accounts.</p></speech>

However, there are constraints - much more so than would have been the case during the pandemic.  Now that the cost of Government borrowing is rising, we are in a different place compared with where we were two or three years ago.  There are budget limits and we are not in a position to say to any household or business that we cover the full cost of its increased energy bills.  In fairness, I do not think anyone is calling for or expects that.</p>  <p>  We are also constrained by the EU temporary crisis framework, which comprises a set of European rules that are not just there to annoy us.  Those rules are there for a good reason, namely, to ensure that taxpayers' money is protected and that different countries do not out-compete each other with better subsidies all the time.  That is just a beggar-my-neighbour attitude.  The temporary crisis framework is there to protect us from that.  Under the framework, we are only permitted to cover 30% of the increase in energy costs.  We are trying to push that to 40% but I do not want to raise expectations that it will be possible to do better than 40% because that is not the feedback we are getting from the Commission or other member states.  We can always look at other ways of helping businesses beyond energy supports.  We have done that with the VAT reduction and perhaps there are other ways.</p>  <p>  In the short term, the focus will be on the Government-backed loans, the energy subsidy and the new emergency scheme we announced today.  In the medium to long term, the EU temporary crisis framework will allow us to extend these interventions beyond the end of February.  They can be extended to the end of next year, but, obviously, no decision has been made on that nor can it be at this stage.  The longer-term approach is quite different.  It involves ramping up investment in renewables so we are less dependent on oil and gas and encouraging businesses to adopt energy efficiency.  I have heard of some businesses that have reduced their energy bills dramatically just by covering their fridges, but I also know of plenty of businesses that have done everything right and are still facing very high energy bills.</p>  <p>  Under the schemes operated by my Department and the Department of Finance, charities are not covered unless they have a trading income.  There is a fund to help charities and sports clubs in a different way.  This is run by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></speech>

In the event of there being a long battle, for want of a better word, against fuel price increases, has there been any investigation into the possibility of replacement by renewables?  Can that be speeded up to give confidence to those in the sector in order that they can plan ahead knowing what is likely to happen in the future and knowing the necessity of competing in the marketplace among their peers and those who might be hostile?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he is willing to consider with businesses and understand the constraints under which he is operating regarding energy supports and the European Commission, that he will keep other supports under consideration and that he has the flexibility to extend the supports beyond the end of February depending on the position regarding the energy crisis.  When will businesses see the money hit their bank accounts under the temporary business energy support scheme and when they will get the arrears back to September?</p></speech>

There may be grants available to businesses, particularly smaller ones, to upgrade their heating facilities and find the most efficient and effective way of using energy, although I am not familiar with them.  Is advice available to them regarding how they can reduce their costs in this regard?  Is there a possibility of special grants to allow them to upgrade their fridges or cooking facilities to make them more efficient?  We need to put pressure on energy companies as well.  In particular, the ESB makes huge profits.  I know the money is going to the State, but I am concerned that not enough is coming back down to smaller businesses.</p>  <p>  It may not be a major issue but is there an option to introduce rates relief for businesses, particularly smaller businesses, that can prove their energy costs have increased exponentially?  Are there any other supports or strategies in other countries that we could look at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700008#F00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  There is room for bio-renewables as part of the new energy mix.  One company in Cork, whose representatives I met recently makes boilers.  It was explained to me how you could move away from using oil for those boilers to a blend or bio-renewables.  I do not know enough about the matter to comment too much, but I take the Deputy's point that we need to give confidence to people around price and policy before they invest.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  Like many people in this House, I engage with business a lot, whether that be on an individual level, with businesspeople and employers, representative groups headquartered in Dublin or chambers of commerce all around the country.  All of them are raising the issue of energy costs with me.  I still say that the difficulty involved in finding staff is probably as significant an issue, perhaps even more so.  It is interesting to hear that.  We must think about the policy wisdom of subsidising businesses while other businesses cannot get staff.  You could have two restaurants in the one town, one of which is doing okay and could do better but cannot get staff and another that is really struggling but has staff.  We must think about the wisdom of subsidising businesses at a time when other businesses cannot get any staff at all.</p>  <p>  The temporary business energy support scheme is contingent on the Finance Bill being passed.  The Minister for Finance's target is to get it through by the end of November, which means the scheme can be open at the end of November or in early December.  The subsidy will be backdated to September, so we anticipate businesses getting a substantial amount of cash from Revenue to cover some of their energy bills before Christmas.  That is certainly the plan at the moment.  In fairness to Revenue, it has proven to be very efficient with the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme in the past.  In such circumstances, I would have a lot of confidence in it.</p>  <p>  The Government has 20 schemes to help businesses to reduce their energy use and use renewables.  The best port of call for small businesses would be the local enterprise office but much of it is doing through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The rules around solar panels have been changed so that pretty much any business in the country can put a solar panel on its roof without needing planning permission.  There are few exceptions but not many.  We hope to launch a new grant scheme in the very near future that will help businesses with the capital cost of investing in renewables and energy saving - up to 50% in some cases.</p> <p>Businesses tell me that there is a great deal of help with audits, consultancy and advice, but maybe not enough when it comes to doing the work that needs to be done, whether it is with the small turbine, the solar panel, the insulation, the fridge doors or whatever.  This is on the way.</p> <p> Turning to the issue of relief from commercial rates, there is no plan to do this at present.  Commercial rates are an important source of income for local authorities.

This is welcome.  I would appreciate any additional details the T&aacute;naiste may have, particularly regarding the total new acreage and if the site will be serviced.  This addition will provide some 44 or 45 acres in total.  This will be a great advantage to the town, especially if, or when, it is serviced.</p></reply>

He has a keen interest in ensuring that we get more employment and investment into Drogheda.  The new IDA Ireland land bank at the Mell in Drogheda forms part of IDA Ireland's long-term strategic plans to position Drogheda and the wider mid-east region to compete for FDI.  I have been advised that since acquiring this land bank last year, IDA Ireland has undertaken an infrastructural review on servicing and how best to position the land bank for a potential major investment.  The project is at the concept review stage now and a multidisciplinary team has been appointed by IDA Ireland.  This review is ongoing and progressing well.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland and Louth County Council have agreed terms on the transfer of seven acres to IDA Ireland.  This transfer is currently the subject of a conveyancing process.  Once the transfer is complete, it will increase IDA Ireland's current landholding to 46 acres and enhance the marketability and attractiveness of the lands to potential investors.  In recent years, IDA Ireland has worked with companies on investments and expansions in County Louth, including WUXI, Wasdell, Almac, PCI Pharma Services, Amazon Web Services, AWS, and Simply NUC.  IDA Ireland is pleased to have acquired these two land banks which will enhance its ability to bring capital intensive projects of significant scale to the area.</p></speech>

It is good news indeed.  It shows joined-up thinking and, literally, joined-up land, which increases road frontage.  This site is especially well located as it is beside the motorway.  We had significant investment, particularly with AWS building in the town.  Areas with these types of data centres need these companies to invest.  People who need data need to be beside their data.  Hopefully, the fact that AWS is now in Drogheda and operating will make it a more attractive site for inward and other investment by companies that need access to their data in close proximity.  This is extremely good news.  It is very welcome.  I would be grateful if we could get a timeline regarding the servicing of this site.  This is critical.  Once the site is serviced, it will be up and running.  Until that happens, this is a lovely plan but we need the site open and active.</p></speech>

The acquisition of the extra seven acres by IDA Ireland from Louth County Council makes the entire parcel of land much more attractive to investment.  The Deputy knows the geography of the area better than I do, but I know where the site is.  The purchase has not just increased the footprint from 39 acres to 46 acres but has also made this a better-shaped site, if this makes any sense.  As the Deputy said as well, it provides better access to the road and should make it easier to service.  I do not have a timeline for the servicing of the site.  I will keep putting pressure on IDA Ireland in this regard.  I am conscious that, in the context of County Louth, there has been much investment in Dundalk.  There has been a great deal in Drogheda as well, but perhaps not as much.  The AWS development is very welcome in Drogheda and is positive in respect of attracting additional investment to the town.  The number of jobs there is limited, though, and we want to ensure that we use this 46-acre site on the edge of the town for investments that will be jobs-rich.  We want to bring in hundreds of jobs to that site and this is very much what we intend to do.</p></speech>

They are working long hours in contravention of the EU directive.  Currently, they cannot go to the WRC.  The Government has promised on multiple occasions that it will introduce amending legislation to enable the fishers to do so, but it keeps failing to do it.  It is the migrant workers who are losing out.  I will give examples later.</p></reply>

I presume this is the scheme the Deputy is mainly referring to.  The WRC has particular responsibility for checking compliance insofar as terms of employment, permission to work, payment of wages, annual leave, public holidays, and National Minimum Wage Act 2000 entitlements are concerned.</p>  <p>  Hours of work and rest periods of fishers who work under a contract of employment or in an employment relationship on board Irish-registered fishing vessels are governed by the European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Working Hours) Regulations 2019 (SI No 672 of 2019), which are monitored by the Department of Transport.  Marine surveyors of the Department of Transport are authorised officers for the purposes of the enforcement of these regulations and may, where a contravention of the regulations is detected, issue directions to the owner or master of a vessel or detain a vessel.  Proceedings concerning offences under these regulations may be brought by the Minister for Transport.  WRC inspectors currently do not have a statutory function in relation to SI 672/2019.</p>  <p>  Following mediation in April 2019 on the atypical scheme, however, a settlement agreement provided that the Department of Justice would recommend that WRC adjudicators have jurisdiction over violations of the fishing vessel working time hours of rest regulations and that this would be implemented by the appropriate measures to be determined by my Department.  In this regard, our Department has engaged with the Department of Transport and agreed a proposal to extend the WRC's jurisdiction relating to excessive working hours and insufficient breaks and rest periods.  This proposal will be progressed as soon as is practicable in new legislation as part of a package we are working on.  Hopefully, I will be able to provide a further update to the Deputy on this matter soon.  I hope this deals with the specific question tabled.  I think the Deputy wants to go further than this as well, which I am happy to do if there is time.</p></speech>

I do wish to focus on this issue.  The consequence of the Government failing to act on the agreement with the International Transport Workers Federation is that workers like Jose Pame Salandron are not able to vindicate their rights in the WRC.  This is a guy who was working 80 or 90 hours a week regularly.  He went to the WRC and he was awarded, wrongly, &euro;14,000 under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The case then went to the Labour Court and it was stated that this context was not covered.  This is accurate.  His award was then cut down to &euro;4,000.  Mr. Salandron may now be taking a case against the State, which could cost it money under the Francovich damages' principle, which he is seeking, because of the State's failure to transpose the directive.  The Minister of State indicated that this is going to be done as soon as is practicable.  In answering a parliamentary question from Deputy Barry in January, however, he said, "This proposal will be included as a miscellaneous amendment in a legislative instrument in the Spring".  When is this going to be?  I presume it was the Spring of 2022 that was referred to and not the Spring of 2023.  The Government is leaving migrant workers extremely vulnerable to continued massive exploitation and to working 80 to 90 hours a week.  When is this measure going to be progressed?</p></speech>

We are bringing forward this package.  I do not have a timeline for it now.  I will, though, try to get it fast-tracked.  We were waiting for the recommendations and the changes and the review of the atypical worker permission scheme.  The Deputy will agree that it is positive that this scheme will now be changed and replaced by access to the work permits scheme.  A cross-departmental working group is examining this endeavour and these changes will be brought forward in the next couple of months as well.  Overall, then, new legislation will be required.  It is not prepared or ready yet, but I will try to respond to the Deputy with a timeline as fast as we possibly can.  Several Departments are involved in this process and the associated complications.  The commitment was that the WRC would be involved in this and we will follow through on this as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

The reply to the parliamentary question was given in January of this year.  Do the Minister of State and the Government not feel bad that this failure to act has left extremely vulnerable workers ripe for extreme exploitation?  They are being left with no remedy in respect of going to the WRC to deal with being asked to work an illegal number of hours.  The Government continues to fail to transpose the working time at sea directive by not giving workers access to a remedy here.  People like Jose Pame Salandron are being asked to work 80 or 90 hours a week.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he is not alone.  I urge the Government to stop taking its time with this matter.  It is urgent.  The Government should act immediately.</p></speech>

It is not all vessels and it is not all employers.  Where it happens, however, it is awful.</p>  <p>  We have people working 17 hours a day in unconscionably awful conditions.  They are extremely vulnerable.  These are migrant workers.  It is already tough for workers who work on land and who might have access to some resources to vindicate their rights at work.  It is nearly next to impossible for workers at sea - people who are extremely vulnerable - to vindicate their rights.  Collectively, we should be trying to alleviate that to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the International Transport Workers Federation for the work it does.  However, that organisation has to feel that the Government is working against it instead of working with it.  The Government should be working with the federation, particularly as we all have a responsibility to protect these workers.</p></speech>

Most stakeholders with whom I engage in this sector across the different Departments wanted the review of the atypical working scheme prioritised as soon as possible.  To be honest with the Deputies, that is where a lot of our work has gone in.  That review is to be completed.  The recommendations and the report went to Cabinet a few weeks ago, and we can get on with that work to replace the atypical working scheme with the work permit scheme.  That will be beneficial to everybody.  Most Members of the House will agree that was the right area to concentrate our work on.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the atypical working scheme in February 2016, the WRC has been involved in closely monitoring it.  In particular, during the period from when the scheme was launched to 31 October this year, it carried out 530 inspections.  It detected 392 contraventions and completed 251 investigations and 21 prosecutions.  The WRC has also made 45 referrals to the Department of Transport in respect of potential contraventions of the hours of rest and working time regulations enforced by that Department.  There has been ongoing monitoring.  This is to do with the next part that the Deputy is concerned with as well.</p>  <p>  A number of information awareness measures have been introduced by the WRC since 2016 to enhance employment rights awareness and compliance in the fishing industry.  In order to enhance these measures, the WRC consulted last December with 16 relevant stakeholders who were requested to make written submissions in relation to, among other matters, possible additional outreach measures for fishing vessel owners and migrant fishers.  Submissions were received subsequently from five of the 16 stakeholders.  The WRC 2022 report on the outcomes of these consultations sets out a range of actions, including some 23 measures and initiatives currently being progressed.  Such measures include: information provision; awareness and promotion; and direct engagement with officials, vessel owners and representative organisations, taking in training and use of communication and social media channels.</p>  <p>  There is much change afoot in the sector, and rightly so.  Those need to be driven across Departments as well.  We are willing to play our part and have been doing so.</p></speech>

The ministerial decision on the TRIPS Agreement provides for a waiver of certain obligations of the agreement and includes clarifications that will allow eligible WTO members to authorise a company to manufacture and export Covid-19 vaccines in a fast and simplified manner and without the consent of the patent owner.  Developing countries will be able to use this solution to authorise the manufacture, import or export of Covid-19 vaccines without prior negotiation with the patent owner and without any notification requirements that would delay the start of the manufacture or export.  Equally important is the clarification that the remuneration for patent owners may take account of humanitarian or not-for-profit purpose of production and hence support the production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines at affordable prices for those in need.</p>  <p>  The ministerial decision covers Covid-19 vaccines as well as the ingredients and processes necessary for their manufacture.  At the time of the adoption of the decision, there was no consensus among the members to cover also Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.  As a compromise, paragraph 8 of the decision stipulates that no later than six months from the date of that decision, which would bring us to 17 December next, members will be expected to decide on whether to extend the decision to cover the production and supply of Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>  <p>  Deputies will already be aware that trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, and, accordingly, the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  The EU is in the process of conducting internal consultations and analysis on the extension, taking into consideration that the case for Covid-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is more complex than the one pertaining to vaccines.  Discussions on the extension of the mechanism to cover the production and supply of Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are ongoing at the WTO.  The EU is engaging constructively in these discussions.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position.  A decision to extend the earlier ministerial decision from June will require the agreement of all WTO members.  The next main date is December, if we are to stay within the six month-period.  We will certainly update Deputies after that session as well.</p></speech>

The Minister of State spoke for a long time but he did not say what Ireland's position is.  Does Ireland support extending the TRIPS waiver to diagnostics - technology other than vaccines - or does it not?  Does it stand with the poorest people in the world who want to get access to the technology to be able to test for Covid, etc., or does it stand with the big pharmaceutical companies that want to keep a monopoly on those technologies in order to maximise their profits?</p>  <p>  Where does Ireland stand?  That is important to know because what is being reported is that the obstructive position in the talks is being taken by the EU, the UK, Canada and Japan which are seeking to delay progress in relation to that.

The decision that was agreed in June falls far short of what was asked by countries, led by India and others, in October 2020.  They asked for a lot more.</p>  <p>  Here we are now.  In the beginning, there might have been some excuse, although I do not think there was.  We were reacting.  Now there has been time for reflection.  Is our voice being heard at EU level to say this has to be extended in a fair manner to diagnostics, tests and treatments?  Is that happening?  Where is our voice?</p>  <p>  The Government continuously tells us that trade is an EU competency.  We know that.  We do not need the Minister of State to keep telling us that.

Ireland has always taken a prominent position on that within the EU.  They hold the competency for this and we contribute to that.  Our officials in Dublin, Brussels and Geneva are involved in a round of negotiations since that meeting nearly four and a half months ago in preparing for the next round, which is on 17 December, and we are feeding into that.</p>  <p>  The EU is in the process of engaging with various stakeholders, conducting internal consultations and analysing available information to gain an understanding, and we are feeding into that as well.  We have always had the view - we are clear from an Irish point of view - that we had to find the best way to get access to what was on offer while protecting the intellectual property, IP, as well.  Deputy Paul Murphy and I differ on that.  We believe that one must protect an IP regime to encourage more people to invest in that and to invest in future medicines and future therapeutics, and health services as well.  If one does not have that regime right, one will lose out on that investment and everyone - developing countries or not - suffers.</p> <p>We have been feeding in to try to find the best way.  We have always made it clear that the opportunity to manufacture and access the infrastructure on the ground was important.  We have made a lot of progress since the previous talks.  The conversation has moved on and that is the part in which the EU is involved.  The talks are politically sensitive and they involve many countries.  The EU has been one of the leaders in this and we have made some progress since the previous talks.  I will be able to update Deputy Murphy after the December meeting.  I am afraid that is as far as we can go today.</p></speech>

We are asking a question.  The answer of the Minister of State, repeatedly, was to say we are feeding in to find the best way.  I have no idea what this means.  Is Ireland at European Council level pushing for the EU to support the extension of the waiver or is it not?  We have the right to know what position the Irish Government is taking.  The Minister of State does not, or certainly should not, have the right to come in here and talk nonsense and not say anything.  He says he supports the intellectual property.  If the Government's position is that the right of the companies to profit and the right of Ireland to get a small amount of corporation tax should come before the lives of millions of people the Minister of State should come and argue that position and let us have a debate about it.  To hide Ireland's position in language stating that we are feeding in to try to find the best way is quite craven.  Come out and say what is the Irish Government's position.  If the Irish Government supports the extension of that waiver that is great.  Clearly that is what I think we should be doing.  It is not acceptable to refuse to answer the question.  The negotiations are happening now.  As the Minister of State said, this has to be done by 17 December.  It will be scandalous if the Irish Government stands with the pharmaceutical companies and not billions of people around the world.</p></speech>

I understand he is in possession of a letter from more than 18 non-governmental organisations, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  They have pointed out that less than 20% of people in the poorest countries are fully vaccinated.  At the same time high-income countries account for 75% of total known supplied details of all existing therapeutics.  Within a minute one cannot read out the letter.  The NGOs are deeply disappointed that the WTO TRIPS decision, made on 17 June and endorsed by the Irish Government, was not comprehensive.</p>  <p>  We are speaking about health.  There is no point in making Ireland safe if other countries are not safe.  If we endorsed a system that enriched a small number of pharmaceutical companies beyond belief on public money let us learn from it.  Let us stop praising the wonderful pharmaceutical companies that did this on public money.  Perhaps at some point the Minister of State might tell us how much public money went into it.  He might also tell us how many vaccine doses we have given to COVAX.  I do not expect him to have the answers now.  We are constantly trying to get information.  At this point I am just asking for leadership to let our voice be heard.</p></speech>

We have to reflect on what progress has already been made on access to the vaccine since we discussed this when people raised it previously.  The ministerial decision on the TRIPS agreement provides for a waiver of certain obligations of the TRIPS agreement.  It includes clarifications that will allow eligible WTO members to authorise a company to manufacture and export Covid-19 vaccines in a fast and simplified manner and without the consent of the patent owner.  There have been major changes.  Developing countries will be able to use this solution to authorise the manufacture, import or export of Covid-19 vaccines without prior negotiation with the patent owner and without notification requirements that would delay the start of the manufacture or export.</p>  <p>  Equally important is the clarification that the remuneration for patent owners may take account of a humanitarian or not-for-profit purpose of production and hence support the production supply of Covid-19 vaccines at affordable prices for those in need.  The decision that has been made will simplify to the maximum the process to export vaccines and their ingredients to other developing countries.  This includes waiving various prior notification packaging or labelling requirements.  It will also enable developing countries to scale up production capacity and supply vaccines to other eligible members.  It will also support the establishment of manufacturing hubs that rely on supply chains in multiple countries.  This will facilitate, for instance, filling and finishing capacity in several countries.  The outcome maintains the protection of intellectual property as opposed to waving intellectual property rights.  This is a key element for developing countries not only to benefit from the innovation the system sustains but also to have an environment that incentivises investment the international community should make to boost capacity and diversification in the production of vaccines and pharmaceutical products more broadly throughout the world.</p>  <p>  I have argued previously that the successful production of new vaccines and new medicines involves public money and private money.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about this.  There was an investment of private money well before this.  We have to make sure the intellectual property regime protects both of these investments and enhances the best opportunities.  We believe Ireland's role in our negotiations through the EU in the trade talks has assisted with these changes.  We will continue to take this approach in the coming months until 17 December.  They are negotiations.  We are part of negotiations through the EU and the WTO that involve more than 150 companies.

I do not have all the figures here today but I ask Deputy Connolly to trust me that the private end has been higher than the public end for a long number of years.  Let us be fair about this.  It is important that we maximise the opportunity.  We differ on the need to have a blend of public and private money in research.  To me it is about how we maximise the impact of expenditure.  This is done by combining the two in many ways.  This is not an approach shared by Deputy Paul Murphy.  I am not sure of the approach of Deputy Connolly but I know Deputy Murphy believes it should be all taxpayers' money.  I believe that would miss out on opportunities that we have to build on.</p>  <p>  With regard to COVAX I do not have the figures but I will get them for Deputy Connolly.</p></speech>

We undertook an extensive consultation with the public, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties over the summer.  We also held a symposium on the project earlier this month.</p>  <p>  The White Paper will seek to articulate what needs to be done differently to realise our aspirations for our economy in 2030 and beyond.  It will set out the risks we face, the policy choices and, importantly, the trade-offs we will need to consider.  It will also seek to confirm what elements of the ecosystem are working well and what should be continued or adapted in the context that Ireland's enterprise and industrial policy which has, to date, served us well.</p>  <p>  Prioritising sustainable indigenous industry, as Deputy Connolly has identified, will be an important theme of the White Paper.  It will also cover entrepreneurship, innovation, scaling companies, the twin transitions of digital and green, investment in skills and education and competitiveness among other issues.  The outcome will likely be one of evolution and adaptation rather than revolution.  My ambition for the White Paper is that it will contribute to a more prosperous, equitable and sustainable Ireland.</p></speech>

The White Paper will be crucial to set out the policy for Ireland.  I had hoped to make a submission.  I read all the documentation and I got as far as writing a draft submission.  I took the trouble to read it and what troubles me is that in theory we will make a change but the documentation I read suggests that we are continuing in the same direction.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Rural and Community Development will also deal with my next point in the next business.  We do not yet have a policy for sustainable living on the islands and for supporting what is being done there with indigenous industries.  I will take as examples areas in which I have taken a particular interest.  One of these is seaweed - the Minister is nodding his head.  We have got nowhere with this as an indigenous industry.  Another is wool, which I discussed yesterday.  We have spent &euro;100,000 on being told the possibilities for wool.  In the scheme of the big accountancy firms this is not much but it is still a lot.  The possibilities for wool include everything from insulation to fertilisers but we have done nothing.  These are the examples that come to mind very quickly.</p></speech>

It is a non-statutory process and if the Deputy or any other Oireachtas Member wants to make a submission even at this late stage they are very welcome to do so.  Our industrial policy down the years has served us very well.  We have done well in our economic success, full employment, high levels of prosperity and high living standards in a ranking of 200 countries.  It is largely based on trade and exports.  It is not just about foreign direct investment.  People often do not know this but there are as many people working now in Enterprise Ireland companies and Irish-owned exporting companies as there are in IDA Ireland companies.  The objective of the White Paper is to give us a high-level roadmap on where we go from here to consolidate the gains we have made and to consider what the next wave of industries we need to invest in will be.</p> <p>Many of them will be in the digital space as well as the green space, such as in renewables, circular economy and new products, some of which the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister who will be dealing with the next questions on the progress that has been made.  However, we have been waiting on the policy for the islands for so long and on interdepartmental reports.</p>  <p>  Going back to the topic of seaweed, these are good news stories we are ignoring.  I am only picking two or three, the latest of which was the story on wool.  You read a report that tells you about the potential of wool, only for the Government to do a Pontius Pilate and says it is up to the industry.  The industry has not done it.  The farmers who depend on sheep and say they are not getting any price for their wool, are begging for help and leadership on this.  Of course they will work with the Government, but it has not happened.  Therefore, the new policy must look at indigenous industries in a real way and look at regional imbalance.  The Minister of State seated beside the Minister knows very well that the north west has been downgraded by Europe for the second time.  There is something seriously wrong here in that we are not taking charge with a different vision of the possibilities that exist, with the people on the ground, and having co-ops as a serious part of that vision.</p></speech>

The policy commits to developing an effective rural-proofing model within the lifetime of the policy.  This will aim to ensure Departments fully consider the effects of new proposals on rural communities and the need to better target the particular challenges and opportunities facing rural areas.</p>  <p>  Building a on rural-proofing report my Department commissioned, I also recently hosted the 13th OECD international rural development conference.  This event provided a further valuable insight on how the challenge of rural proofing is being addressed in other countries.  To develop a rural-proofing model that is effective, it must be seen as a valuable tool to support the objectives of multiple Departments and not just the Department responsible for rural development.  It must be focused on delivering positive outcomes for rural communities and the achievement of Government objectives.</p>  <p>  My officials are in discussions with a number of Departments to pilot a new rural-proofing model as an aid to effective policymaking.  This process will identify particular policy areas or initiatives that can benefit from the application of a rural lens to policy development.  The pilot approach will serve to underpin the development of an effective, efficient, and implementable rural-proofing model that will support rural development and ensure we maximise the opportunities for rural areas to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

She said the report was completed and that she hoped to receive it shortly.  Will she tell us more about the next steps?  She also mentioned this is to be done within the lifetime of the policy, which is until 2025.  Will she provide us with more information on the timeframe?</p>  <p>  The implementation of a rural-proofing mechanism is very important.  The EU Commission has again downgraded the west and north west for a second time, which it now considers a lagging region.  That is very concerning.  It tells us the west and north west is not getting an equal share of investment and infrastructure.  Alarm bells should be ringing given we have been downgraded to a region in transition and now to a lagging region, the only region in Ireland in such a situation.  That gives reason for the need of a rural-proofing mechanism, and we must to move on this as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I do not want it to be a box-ticking exercise.  We want other Departments to engage meaningfully, so it is important we get it right.  We do hold other Departments to account through Our Rural Future.  We have a work programme and actions for every year.  I meet with the relevant Ministers in those Departments to make sure I hold them to account on their delivery for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  When I was appointed a Minister of this Government, I made a decision that the Department of Rural and Community Development would be kept as a stand-alone Department.  It is very important that it has not been amalgamated with any other Department.  We have benefited from that through the investment we have got for rural Ireland.  The fact it is stand-alone Department is also a strong signal, from the Government and me, that we are committed to rural development.</p></speech>

That brings me back to the point about the emergency situation in the west and north west, where we are now seen as a lagging region.  We need to turn that into something positive and take as much additional funding as we can get through Europe and make sure it is invested in the west and north west.  We need to turn that situation around.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about engaging with other Departments and holding them to account.  They need to be held to account regarding the region status that is of concern.  The rural-proofing mechanism is one way we can turn that around.  Has there been a response to the change in regional status, and has the Minister engaged with other Departments in that regard?</p></speech>

I am aware of the challenges faced by inland counties, such as my own county of Monaghan, the Deputy&rsquo;s county of Roscommon, Leitrim, and Longford - although not in that region - and I have been focusing additional investment in those areas.</p>  <p>  We are looking at developing a pilot scheme based on the report on rural proofing.  I must note that the OECD conference was very impressed with our policy, Our Rural Future.  The policy was held up as an example of best practice.  Many people attended the conference, with 400 people attending from all over the world, including ministers from Canada, the US, Colombia, the Czech Republic, and other countries.  The OECD said this policy could be a cut-and-paste job for other countries to follow.  What we have here is a good policy.  We review it and set targets every year.  I hold the various Departments to account and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Will she provide up with an update on that?</p></reply>

Rural connectivity is an important element in Our Rural Future.  Such roads represent a vital piece of infrastructure for rural residents, providing access to people&rsquo;s homes and farms as well as outdoor amenities such as lakes, rivers or beaches.</p> <p>LIS was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding in place.  The scheme is administered locally by the relevant local authority, which is responsible for prioritising and selecting eligible applications within broad parameters set by my Department.  I have prioritised the scheme in my Department, and this year alone I have allocated &euro;22 million to LIS.  While there are, of course, competing demands on finite resources, in four of the past six years, additional resources were directed to the scheme mid-year to address strong demand for the scheme across rural Ireland.</p> <p> Since the scheme was reintroduced in 2017, aggregate investment has now surpassed the &euro;100 million mark.  I acknowledge there is strong demand for the scheme and in some counties local authorities have significant levels of applications on hand.  I have asked my officials to engage with local authorities to ascertain what level of applications were in hand in each county and what could be delivered in 2023 should additional funding become available.  I am satisfied that the roads local improvement scheme continues to play an important role in the delivery of our rural development policy, Our Rural Future.</p> <p> When I was growing up, I lived somewhere with a lane nearly a mile long and I know the benefit of the LIS and the difference it can make to rural dwellers, in particular.  It creates access, whether it is a milk or feed lorry or whatever else needs to get in and out of lanes.  It is a good scheme and I am glad we have been able to provide additional funding for it.</p></speech>

She said the same thing last year about her Department reaching out to local authorities to see what they had on their books, what had not been completed and what they could complete by the end of the year.  I presume from the response of the Minister that is happening again now.  It would be useful for all of us to have the figures, local authority by local authority, regarding what is left and what can be completed by the end of this year and into 2023.</p>  <p>  The Minister has said many times that she has engaged with the Department of Transport with a view to it providing additional funding to go along with the funding she provides through her Department.  That would be very welcome.  In the nicest way possible, I wish to ask whether she is meeting resistance from that Department.  It previously funded the scheme and I do not see why it would not make a contribution.  The Minister might be able to come back to me on that.</p></speech>

In fairness to Deputy Michael Ring, when he became Minister in the Department, he started to fund them.  No more than Deputy Kerrane, we are rural Deputies and know the benefits.  He created a fund within the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has a very large capital budget, far in excess of what my Department has.  I am putting 10% of my budget into LIS schemes via the capital budget.  I have raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on a number of occasions and have not made much progress yet.  I am a firm believer that if you do not succeed, you try and try again.  I will continue to keep after the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on this because that Department should match the funding.  If it matched the fund I am putting in place, we would not be long getting rid of the list of LIS schemes.  I spoke to representatives from Leitrim County Council the other day and it has cleared its backlog.  I want to see how we can get rid of the backlog.</p></speech>

I understand that is what her Department is gathering and the information would be helpful.  Perhaps "resistance" is the wrong word, but I know the Minister has raised this matter a number of times with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  Obviously, all of us have a job of work to do in putting it across to him nicely that funding is badly needed.  If we could clear the backlog, perhaps the funding provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development would be enough.  A joint venture between both Departments would be helpful and there is a role to play for the Department of Transport.  All of us, including the Minister, have a job of work to do to convince the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that the funding would be appreciated and well spent.</p></speech>

I know all rural Deputies feel the same.  The issue was raised in the House recently.  Perhaps we can convince the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to help us deal with the backlog and get rid of it.</p>  <p>  As I said, some counties are doing quite well and have nearly cleared their backlog.  Others have more lanes than others.  In my county of Monaghan, there are a serious number of lanes.  Everybody seems to live in a lane when it comes to farming.  That is how things developed over the years.  It is important the councils give us their lists.  When it comes to top-up money during the year, I write to local authorities to ask them what they can deliver by the end of the year.  Some are ambitious and deliver, while others do not put in a request.  It is up to local authorities to decide what they request and can deliver.  It is important the money is spent when I give it to them.  We will keep working on it.</p></speech>

The allocations for each LEADER area have also been announced as part of this process.  The procedure to select LEADER groups will be open, transparent and competitive.  Central to the formation of the groups will be a clear partnership approach, with public and private interest groups coming together to deliver the programme in rural communities throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, &euro;180 million has been committed to the new LEADER programme for 2023 to 2027 and I can confirm that all of this funding will be allocated to the LEADER groups that will be appointed to deliver the new programme.  A number of factors were considered when deciding on the funding allocations.  These included providing a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to each subregional area, with the remaining funding distributed based on population and level of deprivation of the area.  This ensures funding is targeted at the areas most in need of LEADER support.  The views of stakeholders were also taken into account in this regard.  Full details of the selection process and the funding allocation to each county are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  It is now important that the key public and private stakeholders in communities throughout Ireland come together in partnership to deliver the new LEADER programme.  I look forward to seeing the new programme being implemented and ensuring LEADER can continue to deliver real benefits to rural communities throughout Ireland.</p></speech>

A letter co-signed by the chairs of Cork local community development committees, LCDCs, all three of them Fine Gael councillors, calls for a fairer distribution of funding.  Cork County Council's administrative area is divided into three LCDCs and the funding allocation need to reflect that.  The county-based system in the previous programmes has resulted in under-resourcing of Cork communities.  In figures provided by the Fine Gael councillors, under the 2014 to 2022 allocations, County Cork, with a population of almost 400,000, received just under &euro;40 million, while Waterford, with a population of 67,000, received &euro;7.5 million and Roscommon, with a population of 64,000, received almost &euro;9 million.  Proportionately, Waterford receives three times as much as Cork and Roscommon almost four times as much.  The funding distribution system for the new LEADER programme drastically needs reform and I ask the Minister to reconsider the distribution method.</p></speech>

It is the highest allocation in the country, so they should be pleased to see that.</p> <p>My focus is on delivery.  It is based on the population and level of deprivation of the area, so that is taken into consideration as well.  The Deputy gave me the example of Roscommon, and in fairness to the county, when the figures are added up, it needs more investment.  The western and Border area is also recognised by the EU as needing additional support.  My focus is very much on delivery.  The selection process is open and all of the details are available on the Department's website.  Interested parties will have until 16 December to put in their expressions of interest.  Cork has been allocated almost &euro;21 million, which should keep them happy.</p></speech>

The geographical size of the county has to be taken into consideration.  LEADER funding is vital for rural areas, and many community centres, playgrounds and local amenities are only possible with such funding.  Many communities do not even have the basics of a playground.  I am working with Bandon and Skibbereen family resource centres, neither of which has a home and they are essential services.  I raised it recently with a Minister who directed me towards LEADER.  This is something that happens all the time.</p>  <p>  County Cork should be treated on an equal basis with other areas.  I am not seeking any special treatment, just that the funding awarded is proportionate.  Cork County Council has worked with the All-Island Research Observatory in Maynooth University to provide analysis of the funding allocation, with suggestions for improving the distribution.  I ask that the Minister works with them to ensure that LEADER 2023 to 2027 is a fair programme that does not disadvantage counties just because of their geographical size.</p></speech>

Whether it is LEADER, the rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation fund; CL&Aacute;R, the new community centre investment fund, the streetscape scheme or the community enhancement programme, there is a funding scheme for everything and each scheme makes a real and lasting difference in rural communities.</p>  <p>  I have visited every county during my time as Minister.  Great projects are funded under all of these programmes, many of which are in the Deputy's own county.  Cork County Council and the LEADER companies in Cork are doing great work on the ground.  I have not been to every bit of Cork but I have been to a good bit of it and it is great to see what is happening on the ground.  The message I am getting back from communities is to keep the money coming because there has never been more funding in rural development.  The level of funding is unprecedented.  LEADER is one part of this approach to investment in rural Ireland.  In fairness to Cork, it has been getting a fair share of funding, but it should be glad of this extra money.</p></speech>

My Department was also instrumental in setting up the local authority community response forum, or community call forums, which had a particular focus on vulnerable people in our communities.  A review of the effectiveness of these forums carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, concluded that the work and processes developed through community call have been effective in delivering support to vulnerable groups during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Other supports provided by my Department at that time included the Covid-19 stability fund, which supported 863 organisations in 2020 and 2021 with total funding of approximately &euro;48.8 million.  In 2020, &euro;4.2 million was provided under the Covid-19 emergency fund, which targeted help at groups participating in the Government's community call initiative.  The community enhancement programme provides vital supports to assist local groups to reopen their facilities post Covid-19.  The programme provided &euro;4.5 million funding in 2021 for small capital grants for the improvement of facilities.  In November 2021, I launched the community activities fund.  This &euro;9 million fund was provided to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19 to help them with their bills and maintenance.</p>  <p>  A number of the rural schemes delivered by my Department were also adapted to assist communities respond to the pandemic, including through accelerated funding under the town and village renewal scheme for measures such as outdoor meeting spaces and public dining areas.  In 2020, the CL&Aacute;R programme placed a particular focus on supporting communities to deal with the impact of Covid-19.  The scheme was broadened to allow projects that helped adapt community facility environs.  The community services programme, CSP, which is also funded by my Department, supports more than 420 community organisations nationwide.  In response to the Covid-19 crisis, my Department developed a &euro;8.95 million CSP support fund to cover the period 2020 to 2021.</p></speech>

What really struck me at the time was how isolated and vulnerable older people in particular were and those who had disabilities.  I was at a recent launch of iCommunity with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communities in the North, Ms Deirdre Hargey.  I was struck by the Disability Action Network saying that 35% of social care had been impacted, more than half the people surveyed experienced disruption to accessing food and medication, and there was a notable decline in physical and mental well-being.  We are still seeing the effects of that today.  One of the issues is around the management of such effects.  What did we do during Covid and what do we need to do post Covid to ensure that, if circumstances such as those arise again, we are in a better place to deal with them?  There are many learnings.</p></speech>

I met a group of women last week - I do not know whether you would call them women's sheds, hen's sheds, sisters' sheds or whatever - to see how we can develop a national organisation similar to the men's sheds, because women do not have such an organisation in place.  One lady from Dublin said she lost her mother during Covid and she did not leave the house during that time.  She just did not have the ability or the confidence to go outside.  Somebody set up the sisters' sheds and invited her to go along.  She told me it changed her life.  Those are the types of interventions that make a difference, where you can go to a group.</p>  <p>  We have learned a lot.  Community call, as the Deputy said, was very successful.  We need to take learnings as to how we can engage with communities.  Local authorities were able to engage much more with communities during Covid.  We always find it hard to engage with people who are marginalised and do not know about the services that are in place.  It is about how we get in to support them.</p></speech>

As an example, people within the drug community are especially marginalised.  These would be people who are active drug users who are getting supports from community drug teams.  There had been a fractious relationship at times between Government agencies and some of the community projects.  All of that was washed away during Covid, however, because everybody recognised we needed to work together to ensure what we did supported those who are particularly marginalised and disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  My concern is that some of those learnings are being lost and that State agencies are in some ways reasserting their silo to a certain extent.  That is why we need a detailed study or report into how we all worked together, what worked very well, what did not and what practices and policies we can put in place to ensure that if a pandemic ever happened again, which it possibly could, we are ready for it and the State agencies take those learnings of the very good work during Covid and move them into present-day work.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  He mentioned addiction.  Two weeks ago I was in Fettercairn, out beside Tallaght, where there is a group called Connect.  I think it is funded by the partnership.  Its members go out at night, identify people who are vulnerable, bring them in and try to help them.  The group does great work.  It is working collaboratively with the partnership out there.</p>  <p>  Siloing and empire-building should be banned.  They should not exist.  There should be collaboration.  There is loads of work for everybody and a role for everybody but sometimes you find people like to expand their little space and that is not the way it should work.  It is about working together.</p></speech>

This year my Department had a budget of &euro;378 million, which is utilised to provide supports to both urban and rural communities.  The national development plan also places a particular focus on solutions to strengthen housing, climate ambitions, transport, healthcare and jobs growth for communities in every region.  My Department supports the development of community infrastructure across the country through programmes such as the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, the LEADER programme, the town and village renewal scheme and the community enhancement programme.  This year I have further supplemented this investment by establishing a community centre investment fund that will support groups in every county to carry out refurbishments and improvements of their local community facility.  These facilities represent vital infrastructure to support our communities, including in expanding areas such as those referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My Department also operates a range of other community supports such as the community services programme, which assists community-based organisations through a social enterprise model.  It typically supports organisations to meet local service gaps and provide access to services and facilities that would otherwise generally be unavailable.  In addition, the social inclusion and communities activation programme, SICAP, provides funding to tackle poverty and social exclusion at a local level.  The value of the programme has again been seen in recent times in responding to the needs of the people from Ukraine to help them settle and engage with local communities.  I am confident the current suite of supports provided by my Department will continue to support and enable our growing communities to thrive throughout the country.</p></speech>

I ask that she ask her officials to provide her with data on the proportion of those moneys that goes to the high-growth communities on the edges or our cities in Waterford, Galway and Dublin, including in my and the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach's constituency.  These communities do not have the sports clubs that can draw down sports grants.  They do not have the community facilities that can be refurbished.  They do not have schools because the Department of Education has a policy of waiting to build a school until the children have been in the area for ten years.  This needs leadership within Government to join up thinking so there are special quotas from sports capital grants and social capital grants to protect and grow those communities.  We are saying half the population growth over the next ten years, which is a minimum of 500,000 people, are going to go into those areas.  There is not sufficient thinking about them and the NDP has not seriously addressed them.</p></speech>

That is my priority as Minister for Rural and Community Development.  Many of my Department's funding programmes, such as CL&Aacute;R and the rural regeneration fund, are specifically targeted at rural towns, villages and parishes.  For the larger urban population areas the Government has the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, under the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government.  Some very significant projects across the country have been funded under the URDF.  In my Department I have introduced the new community centre investment fund, which is available to all communities, be they urban or rural.  Where there is population growth we want to ensure families have access to quality community facilities.  I have already announced the small-scale grants of up to &euro;25,000 under that fund and hope to announce the larger grants of up to &euro;300,000 in the coming weeks.  That funding is to support the upgrade and enhancement of existing community centres.</p></speech>

Who is looking out for these urban communities if not her Department?  It is a gap in Government thinking.  If those urban communities do not grow well the hope of compact development with low emissions, and all those things we believe are the future, will struggle.  We need to frontload investment into those areas and not do as most Departments do and wait far too long to make that investment.  I plead with the Minster to try to take a leadership role in this and maybe elbow some of her compatriots around the Cabinet table to shift their position on this.</p></speech>

I take Deputy Bruton's point.  I appreciate there are bigger communities, more people moving in and facilities are needed.  I secured &euro;20 million for a fund targeted at new-build community centres.  That fund can be drawn down in both rural and urban areas.  It will be targeted specifically at areas where there has been population growth and there is currently a lack of a community centre.  The URDF is the scheme that should look at the areas the Deputy is addressing because as I said there is a specific focus on the rural in my Department.  He will appreciate there has been unprecedented investment in rural Ireland, which is paying off, making changes and making a difference to people's lives.  It is something we need to look at as a Government and I am happy to follow up on it with my colleagues though my focus remains, as I said, on the rural side of things.</p></speech>

When people made submissions, they were based on submissions they got in at the time.  Is the Minister's Department going to take into account the increase that has occurred in the cost of building since the applications were made and by the time the roll-out will occur?</p></reply>

The fund has to date allocated funding of &euro;280 million for 191 projects nationwide costing over &euro;380 million.  Calls for applications to the fund are sought under two categories, namely, category 1 and category 2.  Category 1 relates to large-scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed.  Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for category 1 applications.</p>  <p>  My Department has received 42 applications under the fourth call for category 1 applications under the fund.  They are seeking funding of over &euro;149 million.  The focus of this fourth call is very much on revitalising our towns and villages, and funding infrastructure that can drive economic growth and support communities in rural areas.  In order to maximise the quality of the projects being submitted to the fund, the application process is competitive.  Applications are assessed against the appraisal scheme published as part of the call for applications.</p> <p>This process is undertaken by my Department, with the guidance of a project advisory board comprised of representatives from key Departments and independent experts.  My Department then prepares a report on the assessment process, setting out projects recommended for funding.  Following consideration of that report, I make the final decisions on the projects that will be funded.  I expect to conclude this process shortly and make an announcement of successful projects in the coming weeks.  There are some really transformational projects in line for funding that will have a big impact on towns and villages right across the country.</p> <p> The Deputy asked about funding shortfalls.  Projects that emerge as successful from calls for applications to the fund are initially approved in principle before progressing through a further comprehensive approval process.  This review always includes an assessment by an independent quantity surveyor.  I can give more details of that presently if the Deputy so wishes.</p></speech>

It is important that the funding be rolled out at the earliest possible date because costs continue to rise.  A large number of applicants are waiting for decisions as to whether they have been successful.  In fairness to every group that makes a submission to the scheme, its agenda is to provide facilities for communities and, in many cases, deliver a whole regeneration that will assist those communities.  Do we need to revisit this scheme to ensure unsuccessful projects can in some way be accommodated in the not-too-distant future?</p></speech>

The cost of construction has gone up.  We employ a quantity surveyor as part of the assessment, which is important to ensure the costs and contingencies have been included by the lead party for the project.  In line with best practice in project management, all applicants to the fund are asked to put in a contingency budget at a level appropriate for the type of project being undertaken.  A carefully calculated contingency budget will meet many of the challenges people face in terms of cost overruns.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is open to project lead parties to make a case to the Department for additional funding if the cost of an approved project significantly increases after the procurement process is completed.  Many leaders have said to me that after they went to procurement, the project ended up costing a lot more than they thought it would.  If that is the case, they can make a detailed justification as to why they need more money.  We certainly are not in the business of holding people back from developing good projects for their communities.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that she has increased the funding for County Cork.  She also announced funding for community centres, which will be extremely beneficial to communities.  I hope the new programme can be rolled out at the earliest possible date in order that groups can get on with the projects and deliver them in a timely manner.</p></speech>

This is a 50% increase and the highest allocation in the country for the biggest county in the country.  We assess applications on population and deprivation.  Some counties get more funding than others based on that.  There may be a smaller population but greater deprivation.</p>  <p>  My focus now is on delivery.  As I said, the selection process is open and all the details are available on the Department's website.  Interested parties have until 16 December to put in their expressions of interest.  I would tell them to get to it.  As far as I am concerned, the ball has been thrown in, the funding is there and it is up to groups to get their bids in and deliver their projects.  It is a great programme.  I advise applicants to work collaboratively because when we work together, we get better results.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

As part of that commitment and in line with the programme for Government, I launched the &euro;15 million community centres investment fund in April this year.  The fund was available to community groups under three categories.  Category 1 was for grants up to &euro;25,000, category 2 for grants between &euro;25,001 and &euro;100,000 and category 3 for grants between &euro;100,001 and &euro;300,000.  The fund closed to applications in July.</p>  <p>  Interest was extremely high, with more than 1,000 applications received under the three categories.  All applications were subject to a competitive appraisal process that has been ongoing since the closing date.  Earlier this month, I announced more than &euro;12.5 million in funding for 580 successful category 1 applicants, details of which are available on my Department's website.  Due to the high level of applications to the fund, the appraisal process is still ongoing for categories 2 and 3.  I expect to make announcements on the outcome of the process in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the extremely high level of demand for the fund, I am delighted to inform the House that I have secured &euro;20 million in funding in the budget for a 2023 community centres investment fund.  It is intended that the 2023 fund will be targeted at new-build community centres, as well as upgrades and improvements to existing centres.  The details of the scheme are currently being developed by officials within my Department and further details will be announced early next year.</p>  <p>  The funding under the community centres investment fund was open to groups from both urban and rural areas, particularly disadvantaged areas.  When I announced the funding last July, we tried to encompass as many projects as possible.  We looked at works to improve communal facilities, such as kitchen and toilet facilities, energy retrofitting, including new windows, doors and heating systems, upgrades to lighting systems and stage areas, works to address safety concerns, including those identified as a result of fire safety audits, works to improve disability access, improvements to provide additional or better services to communities, such as meals for the elderly and youth facilities, works to develop community centres as social hubs through the development of community cinemas, youth hubs and community libraries, and essential maintenance work, such as repairs to roofs and so on.  Many community centres were unable to do their usual fundraising during the Covid crisis.  A large number had a leaking roof, for example, or needed to upgrade their kitchen.  This was a particularly welcome fund and there was a large number of applications.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to include upgrades to GAA clubhouses in the fund.  Many clubhouses, particularly in rural areas, also function as community centres.  They could not get money from the sports capital fund to upgrade the clubhouses because that funding is only for sports facilities.  I was delighted to include them in this round of funding, which meant we were able to support a good number of GAA centres around the country.</p> <p>As Members know they are at the heart of rural Ireland.  As I said, I was delighted to secure the &euro;20 million for the further iteration of the fund in 2023.  It will once again look at more upgrades and refurbishment of existing centres.  We tried to fund as many as we could.  In the case of those that did not get funding this time, either the application was not eligible or did not meet the criteria or it scored very badly.  A great many of the applications were funded.  About 90% of them were funded.  We tried to spread the loaves and fishes as far as possible and it was very well received.  </p></speech>

In Mayo it was well received by 30 community groups and organisations that received funding in the region of &euro;640,000.  Some of the awardees locally were Partry, Ballyhean, Turlough, Cong, Islandeady and Balla and the feedback has been tremendous.  I also want to compliment the Minister on her earlier points in regard to sporting bodies such as Charlestown Bellaghy recreational development centre and Mayo Gaels GAA club.  They received essential funding for the upgrade of lighting systems.  Also, funding was directly targeted at essential repairs to leaking roofs and so forth, which possibly they would only get during the sports capital programme.  It was certainly very welcome.</p>  <p>  As for the unsuccessful applicants under category 1, will they have an opportunity to appeal a decision or will they have to reapply in 2023?</p></speech>

Mayo did very well actually.  I have a long list to hand of projects funded.  It is important that we help these community centres.  The Deputy asked me whether there is an appeals system and there is.  We asked Pobal to assess these applications for us and it did so.  There will be an appeal system whereby an organisation that has not been successful can see exactly where it fell down.  The good news is that I am trying to put a fund together for next year.  If at first you do not succeed, I always recommend that you try again.  Maybe with some changes the application can be successful the next time.  Good projects always get money.</p></speech>

In Limerick at the start of October, we got &euro;680,000 for 33 projects under category 1.  There were some great projects.  As for categories 2 and 3, many worthwhile projects are seeking funding, such as St. Munchin's Community Centre, Kileely, in the city, Murroe Wood Park, which has done fantastic community work, Our Lady of Lourdes Community Centre, Childers Road, Limerick city, and Hope for People with Autism, under D&oacute;chas.  When does the Minister anticipate that the announcement will be made?  I know the difference this scheme makes to groups.  I have seen groups such as Caherdavin Community Centre, the Cari Foundation, Mulcair Men&rsquo;s Shed, Abington, and Southill Hub with the tranche going to category 1 and what a difference it has made to community groups.  In regard to the timing for categories 2 and 3, when will the Minister be making that announcement?  This is a brilliant scheme.</p></speech>

There is a good long list in Limerick as well.  I want to thank all the Deputies.  I believe everybody supported me on this scheme because it makes a huge difference to communities.  That is what we are about.  We are about helping people and communities to realise their ambition for their areas.  There is nothing more annoying than struggling at community level and just needing a few pounds.  It does not take an awful lot and it makes a difference.  We get good value because they match it.  Many of the centres had not been upgraded for decades.</p>  <p>  In respect of categories 2 and 3 they are at a final stage of assessment.  It is not finished yet but I hope to announce categories 2 and 3 in the coming weeks.  The money is tight because we originally had &euro;15 million in the fund.  As we received more than &euro;70 million worth of applications, there was a touch of the loaves and fishes about it.  We will keep at it.  </p></speech>

My parish community centre benefited from &euro;25,000 under category 1.  This was one of 27 projects funded in County Kerry.  This was most welcome.  In a small rural parish, collecting &euro;25,000 is virtually impossible in the current times so that funding from the Government is crucial.  I remember in the 1980s going around in the back of my father's Fiat 127.  Along with the other members of the community council, he was collecting &pound;5 a month from householders to build the centre.  It now needs reinvestment.  This funding is a huge boost to a small rural community.  It is the same throughout the country.  I congratulate the Minister and thank her for putting the fund in place for next year also.  I encourage the further categories to be announced as soon as possible.  The good people of Listowel have been on to me about Listowel Community Centre.  They do fantastic work there.  The term, "community centre", explains what is going on there.  These places are at the centre of their communities.  The work that goes on in them is enormously important.  This funding is crucially important as well.</p></speech>

I value the input that I get in this Chamber and from each Member individually.  At different points, Members say to me that I should look at this or that and I continually review the schemes.  In fairness, there was a great number of successful applications in County Kerry, averaging around &euro;18,000, &euro;19,000 or up to &euro;25,000, which was the maximum.  Many of them did very well.  I will share a story with Members.  I remember when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il and a small grant for about &euro;10,000 came out.  I had been working on it for a while and phoned this community group to advise it had received &euro;10,000.  That is not a lot of money in the overall scheme of things.  The boy said to me, "You know, I would be a long time standing at the traffic lights in Monaghan with a bucket by the time I would get &euro;10,000".  That is the difference it makes.  We need to support communities.</p></speech>

It is the first time ever that we have had a dedicated national scheme focusing solely on community centres throughout rural Ireland.  I live in a small, rural village, Carrabane, in east Galway and when I look at my own community centre it is the very epicentre of life in that community right from the beginning of life through to the end of life.  It starts with a mother and toddler group, it has For&oacute;ige and scouts and older citizens meet there regularly.  We even have yoga for men on Monday nights which I have yet to partake in but am looking forward to.</p>  <p>  In assessing all the applications that came in, did any trends emerge in regard to the most pressing needs from within the community centre network throughout the country?  Also, I ask the Minister to contemplate at some point in the future, perhaps with Cabinet colleagues, on the real possibility that many of these centres could be used as social centres for retirement villages throughout our rural communities.  There are many good examples and exemplars being established internationally now that there is an aging population that these centres could serve much more than just their current needs.  They could become the epicentre for very successful retirement facilities immersed and embedded within our rural communities. </p></speech>

He is right actually.  It could be a social centre for a retirement village.  I visited Bree, Wexford, a few weeks ago where they have a wonderful community centre.  It is like a campus.  They have everything together including the community centre, the GAA club, with a school and a cr&egrave;che beside it.  These are all together, so that when you leave one you just walk to the next, which is a big advantage.  This was thanks to the vision of people many years ago to buy a plot of land that made this a very successful centre.  It was helping people and providing services for people with disabilities.  There is a wide range of services.  I was in Fettercairn, Tallaght, and launched the fund out there.</p> <p>I saw the difference it will make to its centre as well.  It is not just about the rural areas; it is about the city areas well.  It encourages them and helps them to do the work that they need to do.  It also shows that Government is investing in them and that we want to support them.</p></speech>

That was central in order to support communities in the application process.  As public representatives, it certainly made our job easier in promoting this scheme.  It is positive to hear that the Government is increasing the national pot next year to &euro;20 million.  I look forward to the applications opening in 2023 and to further announcements for categories 2 and 3.</p></speech>

The Minister referenced how hard it would be to collect &euro;10,000 at traffic lights with a bucket.  The limit of &euro;25,000 in category 1 has made a phenomenal difference to communities.  Next year, there will be many smaller groups out there looking at this.  We are now at the end of 2022.  When will the scheme for category 1 reopen next year?</p></speech>

For example, there is a family resource centre in Cahersiveen in County Kerry doing enormously important work in the wider south Kerry community.  It recently purchased a building that it is hoping to do up and improve.  Unfortunately, Kerry County Council did not put it forward for funding recently under the rural regeneration scheme.  However, this may be a scheme that would cover it if it could be expanded.  Will the Minister please consider that?</p></speech>

We have a city that is radically overheating at the moment.  We have a commuter belt that is sprawling into Ulster, Munster and Connacht, where people are travelling two and three hours into Dublin to go to work.  Every year, we have rural areas where the population of young people is reducing.  That is not a sustainable process and these are not viable communities.  They do not have necessary investment into infrastructure, such as broadband, roads, rail and all of the business and enterprise investments that they need.

Our Rural Future 2021-2025 is the most ambitious rural development policy for Ireland in decades.   It was published in March 2021 and contains more than 150 measures across the whole of Government for both short-term recovery and long-term development.</p>  <p>  Delivery of the Our Rural Future rural development policy is monitored through a series of work programmes and progress reports.  The second progress report was published in August 2022 and covered delivery in the first half of this year.  It contained updates on 148 of the 312 actions in the 2022 work programme and included contributions from 22 Departments or agencies.  Some 35 of these actions were of an ongoing nature.  Of the remaining 113  actions, which were due for delivery in the first half of 2022, a total of 82, or 72%, were completed.  Work is under way on the third progress report, which will cover the second half of 2022.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the very enthusiastic engagement and inputs from across Government in respect of the implementation of Our Rural Future.  My officials will shortly begin bilateral consultations with relevant Departments in preparation for the work programme for 2023.  The development of these annual work programmes allows for priorities to be updated in light of emerging opportunities and challenges and the introduction of brand new measures to the overall Our Rural Future policy.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the publication of these documents will demonstrate continued commitment to realising the ambitions of Our Rural Future in delivering this Government's vision for rural Ireland.  I will finish at that.</p></speech>

I understand that the north and the west of this island have been downgraded to lagging region status under the Government.  That is an incredible assessment from the European Union in relation to what the north and the west are undergoing at the moment.  I am referring to the agreement that has unlocked funding through the bloc's cohesion policy.  I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform whether he will confirm that the two regions have been downgraded or to release the relevant document to me.  However, he has point-blank refused to do so.</p>  <p>  This is very important.  I also understand that these regions, which include the Minister's county, have been ranked at 177 out of 240 European regions.  That is a damning indictment of the policy that this Government is involved in.  Those areas, in European terms, are seeing a reduction in the level of development and competition that happens there.  When the Government gives grants and make communities dependent for &euro;10,000 here or there, that does not lift their viability for families to be able to earn an income and raise children there and young people to able to stay there and do exactly the same.</p></speech>

Through the RRDF, there has been millions of euro invested in town centre regeneration projects and the conversion of old, derelict buildings into remote working hubs.  There has been investment through the town and village streetscape enhancement initiative, which is now looking at repurposing whole buildings.</p>  <p>  I spoke to local authority chief executives yesterday.  They said very clearly that there has been unprecedented investment in rural Ireland and it is working and paying off.  There are many different avenues for communities and local authorities to draw down money from central government.  It is about the bottom-up approach and people identifying opportunities, weaknesses in their community, looking for funding to address those weaknesses and building on the strengths.</p>  <p>  The population in rural areas is increasing.  More and more young people are coming back to live and work in their home areas.</p> <p>We have been able to afford them that opportunity through remote working.

She should ignore the core performance indicator of her Government.  It is not just or fair to citizens living in the counties in the western and northern parts of this country that we are having this conversation.  The Minister is not going to admit that the European Union has downgraded those areas to 177th place out of 240.  Only for the <i>Business Post</i>releasing this information, we would not know it.  Will the Minister release to the citizens of Ireland the document the European Union has provided in order that we can have transparent government and see why the European Union is downgrading regions of Ireland in terms of their ability to compete?

The driving force has been the fact that people cannot live in Dublin any more because the cost of doing so has gone through the roof.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, launched the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund.  The fund is initially focused on supporting the refurbishment of vacant homes in regional towns and villages.  It is a key funding support under the town centre first policy that was jointly developed by my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The publication of Town Centre First was a key deliverable under Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  In July, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched the vacant property refurbishment grant, funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.  The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched the ready-to-build scheme in September.  This scheme will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes.  These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the  principal private residence of the purchaser.  This scheme is also funded under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.</p>  <p>  Given that pathway 4 of Housing for All is intended to support reuse of existing buildings and the synergy with the Government's Our Rural Future policy, I am pleased to say that it has been decided to extend the vacant property refurbishment grant to vacant properties in cities and rural areas to ensure we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage expects to have that extension to cities and rural properties in place by November.</p></speech>

That was probably one of the few criticisms I had of the policy and it is good to see that the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage have responded to that and extended the scheme to rural communities.  It is a great scheme that will provide incentives for people to bring those properties back into circulation.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions regarding interaction with local authorities.  How many indications have there been up to now?  How many properties are involved?  There is a condition whereby the State claws back up to 100% of the grant if the person who availed of it subsequently sells the property within five years.  Who administers or is responsible for that clawback?</p></speech>

All present know from walking through rural towns and villages that there are derelict houses in them.  A bit of encouragement would bring people back to living in the centre of towns and villages.  It is welcome that the scheme has been extended to rural houses.  I acknowledge that.  The Minister for housing, Local Government and Heritage was committed to the scheme from day one.  We had conversations about it and it is very welcome.</p>  <p>  As regards our engagement with local authorities, we recently published Town Centre First, a major new policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into town centres.  Town Centre First contains 33 unique actions which will give towns the tools and resources they need to become more viable and attractive places to visit, live, work and run a business.  The policy is underpinned by multibillion euro investment spread across major Government schemes such as the RRDF, the urban regeneration and development fund, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund and the town and village scheme.  For the first time, designated towns will gain their own dedicated town regeneration officers, who will be crucial in driving future development.</p></speech>

I will get onto that in a minute.  As regards the administration of the scheme, if a person avails of the grant and subsequently sells the property and there is a clawback by the State, is that done through Revenue or via the local authority?  What is the vehicle to ensure that clawback is in place and the scheme is not taken advantage of?  There is a significant budget for the scheme, but are there targets in terms of the number of applicants it is anticipated will avail of it?  Are there set targets per annum for the coming years or is it just operating on a first come, first served basis?</p></speech>

I am not sure of the position with regard to the clawback.  It is right that there should be a clawback.  I agree with that principle in the context of a person selling a house.  The idea is that the person will live in the town.  People living in town centres will bring vibrancy to them.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question on that aspect, but I will find out exactly what happens or who is responsible for administering the clawback clause.</p>  <p>  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is just one part of what we are doing in rural Ireland.   Under my Department, there is the town and village renewal scheme.  We have expanded that scheme and funding can be sought for bigger projects up to a maximum of &euro;500,000.  In that context, we have done a lot of work in repurposing old buildings such as old Garda stations or train stations.  Several different projects that have come forward through consultations with communities - asking people what they need in their area and how we can help them to realise their vision.</p></speech>

The RRDF provides funding for the development and construction of capital projects in towns and villages and rural areas across Ireland.  The fund has to date allocated funding of &euro;280 million for 191 projects across the country worth a total of &euro;380 million.  The RRDF is central to achieving the objectives and key deliverables of Our Rural Future, the Government's five year policy for rural Ireland.  The projects supported by the fund assist in the regeneration of rural towns and villages by addressing vacancy and dereliction and positioning them for further growth through regeneration and town centre renewal.  The fund also invests in strategic projects that contribute to further economic development in rural areas.</p><p>The 2022 allocation for the RRDF is &euro;60 million.  There is also a carry forward from 2021 of &euro;9 million which can be utilised across the wider programme area depending on the level of demand.  The total spend to date in 2022 from the fund is &euro;20.3 million, with significant levels of further funding draw downs expected before year end. In January, I announced funding of &euro;24.5 million for 27 projects from the third call for category 2 applications.  Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls.  The fourth call for category 1 applications to the RRDF, which are the large scale capital projects with planning in place, closed earlier this year.  I expect to be in a position to make a substantial announcement on the successful projects arising from that call in the coming weeks.  This will further strengthen the pipeline of projects to be delivered under the fund for the coming years.</p></speech>

What she is saying is that &euro;69 million was available for spending this year but that only &euro;20.3 million has been spent to date, which means that &euro;49 million is left to be spent in two months.  I ask the Minister to explain how it is that in ten months of the year only &euro;20 million has been spent, when the Department had budgeted for far more.  No doubt the Minister went fighting to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and told him that she needed a lot of money for this scheme.  I ask the Minister to explain why the spending under this scheme is so slow.  Is the infernal habit repeating itself whereby local authorities send in their bills at the end of the year?</p></speech>

As I said to them yesterday, if they do not spend the money, it is very hard for me to make the case for more money.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will appreciate that because there are always competing demands at budget time.  The budget for this year is &euro;69 million.  We have spent more than &euro;20 million so far, but I expect significant levels of draw down before Christmas.  As the Deputy knows, the bills do tend to come in towards the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I have taken steps to use savings in other areas this year already.  For example, I transferred money into LIS.  I was also able to provide some additional funding for the community centres fund and I expect much of that money will be drawn down very quickly because the grants in the first tranche are relatively small.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that I am continually putting pressure on local authorities to spend the money available.</p></speech>

A sum of &euro;20 million has been spent.  When we take the &euro;9 million out of that, however, the Department has actually only spent &euro;11 million of this year's allocation, which is a very small percentage after ten months.  The Minister said the Department will spend "a significant amount" between now and the end of the year.  That phrase suggests to me that the Department might not know what will be spent.  What is the Department's estimate of what will be spent between now and the end of the year, which is only really five or six weeks away when one takes the Christmas period into account?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister foresee a carry forward once again, even though people are screaming for money under schemes like LIS?  Does she foresee a significant carry forward by her Department of capital funding into next year?</p></speech>

Some of these projects are taking longer than anybody would like.  They have had problems with supply chains.  One project is awaiting a particular piece of equipment before it can be finished and we are seeing that right across the board.  I am putting the pressure on constantly.  When one sees the finished projects, even if they take a bit longer than expected, they are well worth it.  I was in New Ross a couple of weeks ago.  The project there took a lot longer than they thought it would but my goodness, it is some project.  They have regenerated the centre of the town.  Sometimes there are delays with the large-scale projects but they are very impactful, in terms of making a real difference in town centres.</p>  <p>  It is too early to say exactly what the savings will be this year but I am trying to keep any carry over to the bare minimum.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, when he was in this Department, I am trying to keep the spending going and the pressure on.</p></speech>

More &euro;21 million has been approved to date in respect of 15 projects located in Mayo costing over &euro;30 million.  Mayo has the second highest allocation of funding in the country.</p><p>I will shortly be announcing the successful projects under the fourth call for funding for category 1 applications.  Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed.The focus of the fourth call for Category 1 applications is to support ambitious capital projects which make the best case to assist in revitalising our towns, villages and rural areas through planned and sustainable regeneration.  These projects will drive greater economic activity, address vacancy and dereliction and provide the necessary facilities and infrastructure which will assist in attracting people back to live in rural areas.  This investment will help to drive economic development within these areas.</p><p>My Department received 42 applications to this latest call for funding, together seeking funding of over &euro;149 million.  I understand that two applications for projects located in County Mayo were submitted to this call.  The application process for the fund is competitive in nature.  Applications are assessed by my Department under the oversight of the project advisory board comprised of representatives from key Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department prepares a report setting out recommended projects.  My role as Minister is to consider that report and make final decisions in respect of the allocation of funding.  I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks. </p><p>I know that Deputy Dillon is particularly interested in two projects in Ballinrobe and Newport in County Mayo.  He has brought them to my attention previously.</p></speech>

One such project is the Connaught GAA centre of excellence and air dome based in Bekan outside Ballyhaunis.  It is a fantastic facility that is used by so many young people and up-and-coming underage footballers.</p>  <p>  I would also like to make the call for Ballinrobe civic arts and amenity centre, a hugely important project for the community in Ballinrobe.  The project will cost somewhere in the region of &euro;4.5 million and will reform the centre of Ballinrobe town.</p> <p>There is also the Newport regeneration project, which is led by Mayo County Council.  Those two projects will be game changers in both those communities.  I would advocate strongly that they be successful in the next call under category 1 of the RRDF.</p></speech>

I had thought the Deputy would mention the Connacht GAA dome.  It is a great job.  I believe it has been very successful.  That was funded from my Department.  These projects are all mighty big multimillion-euro projects.  They are all assessed independently and, as I said, are nearly at a final stage.  I will be announcing them in a few weeks' time.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; in am anois dearcadh ar&iacute;s ar fhaoiseamh &uacute;s morg&aacute;iste.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will know that workers and families are struggling and that prices are rising and spilling over into every part of household budgets.  The European Central Bank is expected today to raise interest rates again by another three quarters of a percentage point.  That is a two percentage point increase since July of this year and it will have an immediate impact on households on tracker mortgages.  Such a household with an outstanding balance of &euro;200,000 would see its annual payment increase by more than &euro;2,000 compared with the start of this year.  For other mortgage holders, the decision rests with their banks as to whether they will pass these interest rate hikes on to their customers or absorb them.</p>  <p>  Our position in Sinn F&eacute;in is clear.  Banks should absorb these interest rate hikes in the interests of their customers.  The banks are in a good position to do so and to do the right thing.  In the first half of this year, Bank of Ireland and AIB had combined profits of &euro;950 million.  They have increased their market share since and have continued dividend payments to shareholders this year and, as the Central Bank made clear in May of this year, "Profitability in the banking sector has recovered and is set to be bolstered" as a result of rising interest rates.  The Central Bank went further, noting that Irish banks were positioned to increase their profits more than other European banks as a result of rising interest rates.  According to the banks' own estimates, these interest rate hikes could bolster their interest income by more than &euro;1 billion each year.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear: interest rate hikes announced by the ECB provide a bonanza for Irish banks.  The financial outlook and position of our banks is strong, while for households it is not.  Those on variable rates are at the mercy of these banks and the decisions they will make in the coming weeks and months.  Their decisions could increase the mortgage repayments of households by thousands of euro.  These households are already struggling to make ends meet.  Banks need to do the right thing.  They need to not pass on these interest rate hikes and they need to make that clear to their customers.  Families have spent the past year looking at their household budgets.  They are planning how best they can manage to get through the winter and into the coming year.  However, no household could have anticipated that the cost of their mortgage would increase by this much and so quickly.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in calling on the banks to do the right thing and not to pass these interest rate hikes on to households, which are already struggling under immense financial pressures?  The T&aacute;naiste will know that those on tracker mortgages will automatically see these rate hikes passed on to them, just as the previous two rate hikes have been passed on to them since July.  These households cannot be expected to shoulder an additional burden of more than &euro;2,000 per year in mortgage costs without the State and without the Government exploring every possible avenue to support them.  Will the T&aacute;naiste therefore commit to examining options to introduce targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief to those who are most heavily impacted as a result of interest rate hikes announced by the ECB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700021#T00700"><p>I am conscious of the fact we have not had any announcement yet from the ECB on interest rates, but it is anticipated, or widely reported at least, that the ECB will raise interest rates by 0.75 of a percentage point today.  I have to emphasise that, as we in this House all know, the European Central Bank is independent in its functions, does not take directions from this Government or any government and will make its decisions based on what it believes is the right thing to do for the economy in the round.  I know that any increase in interest rates for mortgage holders will be very unwelcome.  People who have tracker mortgages, in particular, will receive a third letter this year telling them their monthly repayments are going up.  That is very much unwelcome for those of us who hold tracker mortgages.  The ECB's rationale, however, as the Deputy will understand, will be that interest rates need to rise now to bring prices under control and to bring inflation down.  That will be to the benefit of everyone.  Ultimately, it is the remit of the European Central Bank to ensure we have price stability and that inflation is no higher than 2% per year.  One of its tools is to increase interest rates; the other is quantitative tightening.  It would appear the ECB intends to employ both those.</p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out that we have had a prolonged period of very low interest rates for a long time now and that is now ending.  We are likely to see interest rates closer to their long-term average in future.  For example, as recently as 2014, not all that long ago, the average fixed interest rate for new lending was 4.1%; it is now 2.5%.  That gives just an example of how low interest rates have gone.  This prolonged period of low interest rates is not going to continue.  We will see much more normal interest rates into the future.  I know that will not be welcome for many people, but not telling people the truth should not be welcome either.  It is important we tell people the truth about these things.</p>  <p>  Any decision on variable rates, of course, is a commercial decision for the bank involved.  I agree with the Deputy that banks should not use rising interest rates as an opportunity to make excessive profits, but they do need to take other factors into play as well.  For example, we want banks to offer new mortgages to first-time buyers.  We want them to offer those new mortgages at competitive rates.  We want banks to offer long-term rates.  Of course, many older people, who perhaps have some small savings, will be looking for an increase in their deposit rate.  The banks have to take all of that into account.  We cannot focus on just one group.  That would not be fair.  I agree with Deputy Doherty, however, that banks should not use this as an opportunity to make excessive profits.</p></speech>

The banks have told us themselves that, despite making nearly &euro;1 billion in the first six months of this year, this will boost their interest income by another &euro;1 billion.  The Central Bank has told us that, of all European banks, Irish banks will benefit most from the hikes.  It is not just about making excess profits.  We are now in an almighty cost-of-living crisis and the banks should do the right thing.  Some banks have not passed on the first two interest rate hikes.  They need to do likewise with the third.  I make that call on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in to the banks today.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste has recognised, there is an automatic increase for tracker mortgage customers.  There has been mortgage interest relief in the past.  It has been targeted.  It was tailored and time-bound.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not believe it is now time to introduce a similar measure to deal with this shock?  It is a shock to many tracker mortgage customers, who will see interest rate payments increase by &euro;2,000 per year.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, the European Central Bank has done three interest rate hikes.  It has signalled that it could do as much as five, and there is expectation that there will be another early in the new year.  Will the T&aacute;naiste therefore consider options to look at mortgage interest relief in a tailored, time-bound fashion that is targeted at those who are most under pressure as a result of these moves?</p></speech>

We had mortgage interest relief in the past when interest rates were much higher than they are now.  We now have a prolonged period of very low interest rates coming to an end and we are seeing interest rates go back to something that would have been considered much more normal five, ten or 15 years ago.</p>  <p>  It seems to me that Deputy Doherty has learnt nothing from what has happened across the water.  He spent the past few months calling for a mini-budget.  After that he called for a limitless energy price cap.  We see how that has turned out in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

We are less than 12 hours away from the looming deadline in Northern Ireland where it appears that yet another election will be called.  The people of Northern Ireland have been left without a functioning Executive for six months as we approach a deepened winter cost-of-living crisis and as we see significant issues around governance and day-to-day administration that need to be resolved but cannot be resolved without a functioning Administration in the North.  There was a deeply worrying report today of Ukrainian refugees being targeted by gangs in the North who are exploiting the political stalemate and the Border to bring refugees into human trafficking and the brutal exploitation of the sex trade, while there is a &pound;90 million funding shortage for the PSNI that needs to be resolved to ensure this can be policed.  As we speak, Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are gathering in Stormont to try to elect a Speaker and get on with the job of governing, but it appears that nothing will change the current position of the DUP, which will maintain its veto, and so it seems the stark reality is that the British Government will call an election at five minutes past midnight.  As Claire Hanna MP from our sister party, the SDLP, said this morning on RT&Eacute;, an election called in this way and under such duress is unlikely to change much and may even entrench stalemate and delay any return to normal negotiations between the EU 27 and the British Government on seeking to resolve issues with the protocol.  If no Executive is formed, we know there will not be a return to the direct rule of the past, so how will democratic institutions be restored?</p>  <p>  The assembly has not had a functioning Executive for four out of the past six years due to intransigence on the part of different parties, so it must be time to look at reform.  Since the changes resulting from the St. Andrews Agreement, the largest party in either designated community can in effect use a veto against the formation of a power-sharing Executive.  The use of that veto has entrenched division, hollowed out the centre ground parties and resulted in more voters opting for unaligned alternatives, as we saw in the most recent Stormont election, yet the current structures take no account of the rise of support for parties that do not designate as either unionist or nationalist.  It is deeply damaging to efforts to normalise politics in the North when either of the two largest parties can veto power-sharing.  It appears the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Government do not have a plan B for what will happen after the likely election in mid-December in the North.  We will be no closer to an Executive.  The election is unlikely to change the position of the DUP.  We are approaching the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement with the principles at the heart of it that are so crucial on consent and partnership, and yet there is no functioning Executive.</p>  <p>  Is it time to consider reforms that would allow those parties that are willing and ready to form an Executive to carry on with their work?  Is there a plan B for the Irish Government to ensure that, after a likely election is held, we can see necessary reforms put in place in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure a functioning Administration in the North?</p></speech>

If the Executive is not formed, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is required by law to call an election.  However, we believe Northern Ireland does not need a new election.  It had an election 24 weeks ago and the results were clear and should be honoured.</p>  <p>  What Northern Ireland needs is a functioning assembly and a functioning Executive to give effect to that choice and provide leadership during the difficult period ahead, so every effort should be made to avoid an unwanted election.  There is a last chance to do so and all that is required is for one political party to stop blocking the formation of the Executive.  The decision of one party to block the operation of the Northern Ireland Executive runs counter to democracy and risks undermining the faith of the people in the potential for democratic politics to respond to their needs.</p>  <p>  In the event that there is a sustained period without functioning institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, there cannot be a return to the direct rule arrangements of the past.  The Good Friday Agreement recognises the need for close consultation between the Irish and British Governments on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government will fully pursue its consultative role under the Good Friday Agreement should this arise and will exhaust every possibility within the framework of an agreement if there is a sustained period of no Executive and no assembly.</p></speech>

He stated clearly the Government position that there is no need for a new election.  I agree entirely.  All of us in this House would agree.  The last Stormont election was just 24 weeks ago.  Clearly, there are very pressing issues affecting the people in Northern Ireland every day, particularly with the cost-of-living crisis, and they need a functioning Executive and a functioning assembly to resolve those issues.  Given we are facing a last chance today to resolve the matter without the calling of another election by the British Government, I am asking what our Government's plan B is.  If an election is announced at five minutes past midnight, as seems likely despite everyone's wishes here, it is unlikely to change the dynamics in the North.  Is it not now time to look again at how we can reform the governance arrangements in the North in keeping with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure there will be functioning democratic institutions in the North and the will of the people as expressed through assembly elections can be carried out through functioning democratic institutions?  I am suggesting to the T&aacute;naiste that no party should be excluded from power-sharing in that scenario, that every party should be given the option to take part, and that it is undemocratic to allow one party to take a unilateral decision to veto power-sharing and hold all others in Northern Ireland to ransom.</p></speech>

This is something we are very keen to do with Prime Minister Sunak and his Cabinet.  If the election is called and goes ahead, we will have to take stock of the result.  I doubt it will be very different or different at all but it may be.  Who knows?  At that point, we will engage with the British Government bilaterally to see what we can do to get an Executive formed or, if that cannot happen, what alternatives we can put in place.  We are making it very clear there cannot be a return to the direct rule of the past.</p>  <p>  What the Deputy is touching on are some very reasonable questions but what she is talking about essentially is changes to key provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement was passed by a referendum here and north of the Border and making any changes to it would be profound and would have to be dealt with sensitively.</p></speech>

Employers in small businesses are bombarded regarding the way they can reward employees.  I am talking about hair salons, barbers, boutiques, pubs, chains of supermarkets, coffee shops and restaurants around the country.  I am delighted to see conditions are improving for employees.  Unfortunately, this may not be affordable.  While it may be affordable for larger companies, it is a two-tier system when it comes to SMEs.  Where are the supports for SMEs to ensure the employment benefits are given to people in SMEs?  There has been legislation on things like sick pay and the increase in the minimum wage, which I welcome.  Getting staff back to work is increasingly difficult.</p>  <p>  Fuel costs are having a major impact on SMEs.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that as the price of fuel goes up, VAT goes up.  When the citizens referred to are not in a position to spend money in the shops or local economy, we collect less VAT.  These are the SMEs I am talking about.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that we collect more tax on fuel because we are not collecting the VAT in the shops and in the local economy.</p> <p>This tells us that SMEs are in huge trouble.  These are the rural employers.  They are the small shops, such as the local butchers and hair salons.  I am talking about these people and not about multinationals.  I am talking about the local shops in our area.</p> <p> If the T&aacute;naiste were to go around my county of Limerick, he would find no local shops in Crecora, Fedamore or Ardagh.  I refer to the number of SME businesses that have closed in Limerick in the past week alone because they have not got the support to reward their employees, which they want to do.  Overhead costs are killing these businesses.  I repeat these are not multinational corporations.  These are the bread-and-butter people providing employment in the local communities I represent.  I am asking the Government, therefore, to intervene.  I ask it to consider a two-tier system so we will be able to help the SMEs, these small employers who help small and local communities to survive.  The post offices have a big impact in this regard as well and an attempt is being made to close these around the country as well.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to intervene.</p></speech>

The main way in which we can intervene to help small businesses is through the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS.  This legislation is now going through the House.  It will give businesses up to &euro;10,000 monthly to help them with their energy bills.  We are keen to get this measure legislated for as soon as possible, to get the scheme up and running and to backdate it to September 2022.  This will help many businesses to a large extent with their energy costs.  As is the case with households, though, there is no way we can cover the entire increase.  We can, however, make a big difference and this is the main way we are going to help small businesses in the months ahead.  I note and welcome the Deputy's support for the increase in the national minimum wage.  I wish to emphasise this in the House.</p>  <p>  One thing I should say, and we should not forget this, is that more people - 2.5 million - are now at work in Ireland than ever before.  This has come against the backdrop where we have seen improvements in pay, terms and conditions and new workers' rights pretty much every year for the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  It does not add up therefore that anyone thinks there is some kind of correlation between low pay and poor rights.  Ireland is a classic example of where we have improved pay, terms and conditions and workers' rights every year for ten or 15 years now, and yet we have seen levels of employment rise.  I hope it will continue to rise.</p>  <p>  Regarding what we have done on fuel costs, which the Deputy mentioned, when the price of fuel goes up, the VAT take also goes up.  This is not the case with excise duty.  We have cut the rate of excise duty, and we have taken 20 cent off a litre of petrol and 15 cent off a litre of diesel precisely for this reason.  We have also cut VAT levied on electricity and gas prices.  The rate has been cut to 9%, which is the lowest rate of VAT charged on electricity and gas prices since taxes began, or certainly since VAT levies began.  The Deputy did not mention this in his contribution.</p>  <p>  I hear the Deputy's suggestion regarding some sort of two-tier system to help SMEs.  I do not know what this means, however, and I would be interested if the Deputy could flesh out some proposals.  First, how would he define an SME?  Would it be based on the number of employees, on turnover or on profits?  These are all very different things, as the Deputy will understand.  A business can have a small number of employees but a large turnover.  Similarly, a business could have many employees but no profits.  How would it be decided, then, which businesses would be in which tier?  Second, what would the differences be?  Would small businesses be allowed to pay their staff less?  Would there be a lower minimum wage?  If the Deputy wishes to flesh out proposals, I would be interested to see them.</p></speech>

Watch this now.  There is tax in regard to VAT and the T&aacute;naiste said the VAT receipts go up.  The Government is taking 50% in tax on petrol and 44% in tax on diesel, when everything is included together.  This applies to everyone who has to use a car, a van, a tractor, a truck or a motorbike to do whatever they have to do in an area where there is no public transport.  This includes getting children to school in areas where the Government is unable to provide buses, such as in Dromcolliher.  I mentioned during the week that 50 students were waiting on a bus and now we have 30 cars driving to Dromcolliher.  This is an unfair tax on people carrying their children to school.</p>  <p>  I am talking about SMEs in rural Ireland, which the Government seems to have given up on once it goes beyond the Red Cow roundabout.  This is what I am talking about.  I am talking about where I live in Limerick.  I make no apologies for mentioning Limerick and the rural areas I represent.  This is what I am here to do.  I am here to ensure our people in our area are represented.  An unfair tax from the Government, which is taking 50% on petrol and 44% on diesel, means it is only looking after people who have access to public transport.  All the people in my area have to go to work and they are being taxed before they leave their houses every week.</p></speech>

Seeing the price of diesel going up again is alarming for many people.  I absolutely get this.  I understand and appreciate it, and this is why the Government has intervened.  We have reduced excise duties on petrol and diesel by 20 cent per litre and 15 cent per litre, respectively.  It is now down as low as it can go under European rules on diesel duty.  We could, potentially, go down a little bit more on the price of petrol-----</p></speech>

There is, therefore, no point in calling for this.  As the Deputy knows, we have reduced the VAT rate charged on electricity and gas costs to 9%, which is the lowest ever.  Businesses can, of course, claim back their VAT expenses.  We cannot, however, be divorced from the reality of what is going on here.  Energy prices are not being driven up by the Government.

We have heard about the increase in the cost of energy.  All businesses are impacted.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste's responses this morning to oral questions.  The Government has taken some steps in this regard.  The temporary business energy support scheme is a good scheme, but it is worth taking a closer look at its impact.  The owners of the local Centra shop in Magheraboy contacted me and sent me copies of that business's ESB bills.  I was asked to use this shop as an example.  In 2019, for example, one of this shop's monthly bills cost just over &euro;7,000, with VAT of &euro;925.  In August 2022, this shop's bill was &euro;20,966, with VAT at 9% of &euro;1,731.  The cost has trebled and the VAT due has doubled.  I note that the TBESS will help, but only at the rate of 40%.  This shop will still be left to carry the can for 60% of the cost.  For this business, this amounts to &euro;5,000 every month.</p>  <p>  I know businesses can make savings and they are doing so assiduously already.  It is not just the impact of the energy costs alone, however, but the cumulative impact overall.  Returning to the example of my local Centra shop, rates have also increased.  This is happening in many counties.  Insurance costs have also increased.  Motor insurance costs have been addressed but public liability insurance costs have not been.  There has also been an increase in packaging costs.  The biggest increase in costs has been in wages.  The minimum wage increased by 80 cent.  I voted for it and I support it.  In fact, I would support a living wage.  The impact in this regard on these businesses, though, of paying 80 cent an hour at 1,400 hours weekly will be &euro;58,000 next year.</p>  <p>  My point is that businesses are taking one hit after another.  Their capital reserves are gone.  They cannot use capital reserves to benefit from some of the initiatives, such as that for solar panels, that the T&aacute;naiste spoke about.  These businesses are talking to the banks about interest-only repayments.  I am hearing this from retailers across my constituency, as I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is as well.  This morning, I spoke to the owner of the SuperValu shop in Manorhamilton.  He wrote to the T&aacute;naiste only a few days ago and again raised the point that it is the cumulative impacts that are really hitting businesses.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, therefore, if there is anything more he can do to deal with the cumulative impact of all these increased costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700023#V01300"><p>I welcome the Deputy's support for the increase in the national minimum wage and her call for us to go further through the introduction of a living wage.  I acknowledge that businesses are facing rising costs from many different angles, whether it is from the costs of labour, materials or energy and fuel.  The budget had several measures to help.  These included the extension of the 9% rate of VAT until the end of February.</p> <p>Crucially, the temporary business energy support scheme, which we are legislating for in the Houses at present, will refund approximately 40% of the increase in the cost of energy to businesses up to &euro;10,000 a month.</p> <p> However, there are constraints.  We need to be honest with people about that.  This is taxpayers' money.  It is over &euro;1 billion in ordinary taxpayers' money helping businesses with their energy bills.  Another &euro;1 billion in loans is being guaranteed by ordinary taxpayers to help businesses with their bills, and rightly so.  Businesses are taxpayers too and they employ people who are taxpayers, but it is still well over &euro;2 billion in financial support being provided to businesses only between now and the end of February.  It is not a small amount of money.  We need to be honest with people that we will not be able to fully cover the increase in their bills.  We are limited by EU state aid rules, which only allow us to refund 30% of the difference.  We are pushing for 40%, which is higher.  It will not be possible to go beyond that and we need to be honest about that.  Anyone calling for measures going beyond that is not making an honest call.</p> <p> I deal and engage with businesses all over the country all the time.  I talk to individuals who are in business.  They regularly give me copies of their electricity bills and gas bills, as the Deputy can imagine, so that I can see for myself what the increases are.  In most cases, they are double and treble.  I engage with the business groups headquartered here in Dublin but also chambers of commerce around the country.</p> <p> Something I am struck by, whether it is the chamber of commerce in Dublin or the chamber of commerce in Dungarvan that I met on Friday last, is that the biggest issue still coming up is the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.  It is as big an issue, if not a bigger issue, than energy costs.  We need to ask ourselves as a Government, as a Parliament and as custodians of taxpayers' money, if there are lots of businesses that cannot get staff at all, are doing well but cannot get staff, have to close early because they cannot get staff, or sometimes cannot open six or seven days a week because they cannot get staff, does it make sense to use a considerable amount of taxpayers' money to subsidise businesses that are not doing so well?  We have to be realistic about these matters.</p></speech>

Even a small supermarket employs ten to 15 people.  Those at the larger end in small towns still employ perhaps 50 or 60 people.  The money that goes into the local community from the wages is significant.  I hear what the T&aacute;naiste says about subsidising businesses that may find it hard to get staff but I ask him to think about what will happen to those staff if they lose their jobs and those communities if they lose their local supermarket, their local caf&eacute; and their services.  These are the businesses that support local clubs, local charities, local GAA clubs, soccer clubs and societies.  They are part of the fabric of many rural towns and urban centres.  We are looking at some of them closing unless they pass on these increased costs to consumers.  That will send inflation through the roof.  People will not be without supermarkets.  They will have the large chains and the multinationals but the small ones will close unless the Government looks at rates rebates or finding some other way of giving more support to these businesses.</p></speech>

We have shown true cause on that in the years that have gone by.  We have cut taxes.  We cut VAT to 9% for electricity, gas, hospitality and personal services.  We have also reduced excise on petrol and diesel.  Now we are bringing in energy subsidies to help businesses to pay their energy bills.  They will see that money in the next few weeks and it will be backdated to September.  It will help a lot.</p>  <p>  At a time of close to full employment, when lots of businesses cannot expand or open fully because they cannot get staff, it does not make sense to continue to fund and subsidise businesses that are not viable when there is another business down the road that cannot stay open because it cannot get staff.</p></speech>

They remained locked out of the scheme and facing a shortfall of tens of thousands of euro to rebuild their homes and their lives.  Ms Hone described in her own words how thousands of families are enduring life in unstable structures that are impossible to heat and are riddled with damp, black mould and dangerous electrics.  They are extremely dangerous conditions.  Ms Hone's words are true.  I have seen those homes with my own eyes.  Ms Hone also spoke of the fact that the Minister has still not appointed a senior counsel, as promised, to investigate how to pursue those who supplied the defective materials, ruining their homes and ruining their lives.</p>  <p>  The reality on the ground is that we have thousands of people in my own county and right across the State who are locked out of redress.  When will the Government bring forward the scheme that was promised over a year ago and when will it keep its promise to appoint a senior counsel to investigate those who caused such disruption and devastation in the first instance?</p></speech>

The reason I raise this with the T&aacute;naiste is because a number of people have been on to me concerned that their bills are even more inflated.  One customer had to engage in quite a number of emails and phone calls with Energia before the company admitted that it had been charging the wrong unit prices because his bill was estimated.  It took him a long time to get this.  They stated they were very sorry that they did not consider this.  For how many more customers did the company not consider this?  It was charging the wrong rate over an estimated period.  In other words, it was charging the higher rate now for a period over the last number of months.  I will be writing to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities on this but I would appreciate it if the Government would do so as well.  Obviously, this is an issue.</p></speech>

The "RT&Eacute; Investigates" documentary last week encapsulates many of the problems that probably any of us who live or work in the city knew have been happening there for a long time.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the issues on O'Connell Street are vast and complex and require a multi-departmental approach.  Dublin City Council is pointing at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Garda is saying it cannot police what are ostensibly health-based issues.  In six weeks' time, the T&aacute;naiste potentially will be the Taoiseach.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to having a Taoiseach's task force on the rejuvenation of the main thoroughfare in our city's capital because it is long past time we had leadership on this issue?</p></speech>

The issues range from dereliction to planning, addiction and policing.  They are complex.  It is not only O'Connell Street, by the way.  It might be the worst manifestation of some of the problems that we have but there are other streets that are not in good condition either.  There is already a north-east inner city task force, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>

Everyone will acknowledge that we have come a long way in the last ten years and her death ignited a movement that saw an end to the misogynistic anti-choice laws in this country.  However, we still have a way to go.  Abortion services are patchy and sometimes difficult to access.  Doctors still operate under the shadow of criminalisation.  The pro-choice movement has organised a march on Saturday, starting at 1 p.m. in Parnell Square, that I want to amplify in the hope that many people will come both to remember Savita and to honour the courage of her family and to demand that we improve the abortion legislation.</p> <p>When will we see the results of the abortion review that is long overdue?</p></speech>

As she has said, much has changed in Ireland since then in terms of our laws in this area.  The review is under way.  I do not have it in front of me but I understand that it is led by an independent chair and has two main phases.  I do not want to misinform the Deputy but I understand that it is supposed to be done by the end of this calendar year.  I will double-check and come back to the Deputy if this is not the case.</p></speech>

It is estimated this is worth approximately &euro;40 million.  It is alleged that the supplier of the fertiliser is a sanctioned Russian oligarch.  This is an incredible situation.  The Government plans to train Ukrainian military personnel in Ireland, which is clearly in breach of Irish neutrality, on the one hand and it appears the Government is allowing sanctions against Russian oligarchs to be breached on the other.  In the middle of all of this, we have farmers trying to buy fertiliser at inflated prices with very little help from the Government.  Prices are 250% higher than they were.  What investigation is the T&aacute;naiste undertaking into this importation?  Will he provide more help to farmers to deal with the shocking cost of fertiliser?</p></speech>

This morning I received a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Justice.  It states that 3,254 people arrived in this country without documentation in the first eight months of the year.  This breaks down to 400 a month or 100 a week.  The reply also states these individuals presented full documentation when they boarded at their point of departure.  When they arrived at Dublin Airport they had no documentation.  What is going on?  We are trying to accommodate people who have a right to be looked after.  If people have no documentation when they arrive, surely there must be some checks.  The sheer amount in eight months is crazy.  Do we have enough police at immigration in Dublin Airport?  I do not believe we do.  These are very frightening figures.  They are from the Minister for Justice I will forward the T&aacute;naiste the reply I received.</p></speech>

I have not seen the figures.  We do have a problem with people entering the country illegally.  This is the case and has been for quite some time.  Sometimes people are not properly checked when they get on the plane.  That happens in a different jurisdiction and there is very little we can do about it.  Other times people use false documents.  Sometimes, people destroy their documents.  If people present at the airport to claim asylum and have no documents, it is very difficult for us to send them back.  These are the practical difficulties that we face.  Even without documents, people are entitled to apply for asylum.  We have been increasing checks and increasing engagement with the airlines.  We remind airlines they have a responsibility not to allow people to board unless they have the right documents and they have to take them back.  We must also ensure that we have the checks at the airport.</p></speech>

One lady from Grange, Sligo pledged a room last March.  She was Garda vetted in the summer.  The house was inspected in September.  She was asked to install smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and a fire blanket.  She did all of this and she was approved.  There is still no word.  Somebody from Boyle, County Roscommon, wants to provide 14 places of accommodation on a commercial basis.  He applied six months ago.  My question this morning is, who do these people contact?  Is it the Red Cross, the International Protection Accommodation Services, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or the local authority?</p></speech>

If it is on a commercial basis it is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or the local authority.  I have had the same experience as the Deputy of people who have pledged accommodation in their own homes or perhaps in a property they own on a non-commercial basis and of people who are offering properties on a commercial basis.  They tell me how frustrated they are that they are not getting the level of engagement or of response that they should be getting.  I have heard the same stories and they are real.  Let us not forget we have accommodated more than 40,000 people.  It is not that nothing has been done but it is clear that more offers are being made and we need to take them up.  We need to intensify our efforts throughout the Government to make sure it happens.</p></speech>

The total of 45,000 planning permissions is also the highest of the past 15 years.  What is clear is that while 80% of housing permissions are being completed, only 40% of apartment permissions are being built and completed.  How have the two Land Development Agency initiatives to activate these delayed permissions done?  Can more be done to drive the commencement of apartment developments?</p></speech>

I saw the housing numbers today also.  They are very encouraging.  They are better than we had expected with 7,544 new dwellings completed in the three summer months of July, August and September.  This is an increase of 62.5% on last year.  The number of apartments has more than doubled.  Over the first three quarters of this year, more than 20,000 new homes were built.  We can confidently say we will reach our target of 25,000 new homes being built this year in Ireland.  The Deputy is right.  Apartment completions have increased a lot but they are still lagging behind housing.  Two initiatives from the Government are taking place at present to activate apartment developments.  One is the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe process that the Deputy is aware of.  It does not yet have European Commission approval but there is a lot of interest in it.  We have agreed in principle to mandate the Land Development Agency to pre-purchase apartments for affordable housing and social housing to de-risk developments in order that they can go ahead and get started.</p></speech>

They pay three, four and five times the rate of other providers.  They have no right to switch to another provider.  They are not regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Even people who have not turned on the heat received bills for approximately &euro;400 a month for July and August.  I have a set of bills in front of me.  They go from 0.8 cent per kilowatt hour to 21 cent, 31 cent, 49 cent and 59 cent per kilowatt hour since January.  Even if people do not turn on their heat, they can pay &euro;2, &euro;3 and up to &euro;6 a day in non-usage charges.

The conference will hear that greenhouse gas emissions were at record levels last year.  Ireland has ambitious targets that are agreed.  They include a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  To achieve that, offshore wind will play a significant role.  Our ports will also play a significant role but they will need to be ready.  We know they sought funding through the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, but they were not successful.  We do not have a port that is ready for the manufacture and installation of offshore wind infrastructure.  They will need significant funding, be it through the European Investment Bank, EIB, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or green funds.  Is this a priority for the T&aacute;naiste and his Department?

It found that while much progress was made, we are still among the worst in the EU for ovarian and breast cancer outcomes.  The report specifically cited that our drug reimbursement system is not fit for purpose and that it costs the equivalent of 2,600 life years per annum due to the cumbersome nature of the reimbursement process.  Can we, please, prioritise the publication of the Mazars report, which looks into reimbursement, and update the rare disease plan, which expired since 2018?

Rates are ahead of those in the UK but are still behind the EU average.  The impact of what we did five or ten years ago is being seen in the statistics now.

It is absolutely critical that the economic argument for the western rail corridor, both freight and rail, is included in the all-Ireland strategic rail review report to boost sustainable connectivity and address regional imbalance.  I attended a conference in Tuam on achieving regional balance.  There is cross-party support throughout the entire western region for the restoration of this key infrastructure, which has lain idle for far too long.  If the corridor is extended to Claremorris, it will provide a strategic objective, connecting the Port of Waterford and Shannon Foynes Port to Ballina.  For that reason, the Foynes project and the Galway-Mayo link should commence without delay.  The importance of opening the western rail corridor cannot be stressed enough and I hope the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are giving it serious consideration.</p></speech>

The case for extending the western rail corridor is stronger than it was in the past given that public finances are in a much better state and we are able to increase capital spending, the need to meet our climate plans, the high cost of fuel and the desire to get more freight off the roads and onto the rail lines.  I know consideration is being given to a commuter to Tuam service and the possibility of freight from Athenry to Claremorris.  However, we will have to see the outcome of that review before we can make any decisions at Government level.</p></speech>

The most important thing is that garda&iacute; are rostered for when we need them.  They are there to serve the public.  They must be rostered for when we need them most.  That is my position but I also acknowledge that we must make sure it provides an attractive career.  The same thing often applies in health care.  People say that doctors and nurses should work 24-7, every weekend.  You will not recruit any doctors or nurses if you expect that.  Therefore, we must get the balance right.</p></speech>

That occurred on 25 October, with the worst of the winter yet to come.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is looking for a number of measures to ensure the situation in CUH does not deteriorate in the coming weeks and months in order that we do not have a terrible winter.  These includes additional specialists to be directed by the HSE to CUH, a bespoke plan for CUH, and additional capacity in the Cork region to be found from wherever it can, including from the private sector.</p></speech>

There are lots of reasons for this.  As the Deputy knows, giving the fact that the pandemic restrictions are now gone - although Covid is not gone - there is pent-up demand stemming from the pandemic period.  We also have an increasingly aging population.  All those factors are giving rise to what could be a very busy winter in our emergency departments.  Many of the actions mentioned by the Deputy will be taken, including the recruitment of additional specialist, securing additional capacity where we can, the use of the private sector and the use of home care.</p> <p>We will do as much as we can to increase capacity within hospitals and emergency departments, as well as to get people out quicker and to avoid people going to hospital, where possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700028#DD00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  Today I am bringing the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill before the House.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a scheme to make payments and to provide a form of enhanced medical card to eligible applicants.  The scheme will recognise the time spent and the harsh conditions, emotional abuse and other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma, experienced by people while resident in a mother and baby or county home institution.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Government is under no illusion that there is any financial payment or service provision that could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been impacted by the shameful legacy of mother and baby home institutions in Ireland.  That immense pain has had a unique impact on each and every survivor.  We cannot take that pain away and I am truly sorry for that.  However, we can offer support to all of those who need it and ensure that such things never happen again.</p>  <p>  I thank survivors for sharing their experiences with me and with many of Members here today to help us all understand what they have been through.  Recognising the unique impact of time spent in these institutions on each and every survivor requires a wide range of tailored remedies.</p>  <p>  Redress means different things to different people and as such the Government's action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions seeks to provide an enduring response to the priority needs of all those concerned.  The mother and baby institutions payment scheme is one action in this broad-reaching plan, which spans a wide range of priority issues that have been raised by survivors and includes significant commitments across the areas of apology; access to personal information; health supports; financial payments; memorialisation; records, archives and databases; education and research; and dignified burial.</p>  <p>  The ongoing work in this area is a top priority for me, with eight of the 22 commitments set out in the action plan already achieved and intensive work under way on many others.  Following the publication of the general scheme of this Bill last March, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth conducted pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am grateful to the Chair, Deputy Funchion, and all of the members for their examination of the legislative proposals.  I also appreciate the committee's acknowledging the features of the scheme which it welcomed, including the low burden of proof built into the design of the scheme and the moves beyond the commission of investigation's recommendations, particularly regarding including in the scheme survivors who were resident in the institutions post 1973.  This low burden of proof has been achieved by basing the approach to the scheme on time spent in an institution.</p>  <p>  I carefully considered the committee's recommendations.  I believe the Bill represents a considerable improvement on the general scheme published last March.  I have been able to incorporate some of the committee's recommendations in the Bill.  Some other recommendations are being considered as part of the design and operational roll-out of the scheme itself, while the intent of some others is being achieved through the broader action plan.  As recommended by the committee, the scheme has been designed with regard to human rights and equality principles.  The proposals were informed by an advisory paper prepared by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission as well as by the public consultation process undertaken by OAK.</p>  <p>  The recommendations that the administration of the scheme should be underscored by independence also feature in the Bill.</p> <p>The office of the chief deciding officer will function as part of my Department in order to benefit from its corporate structures and to allow for a quicker establishment of the scheme.  However, the Bill provides that the chief deciding officer will be independent in the performance of his or her functions.  Furthermore, recourse to an independent appeals process is also provided for in the Bill.<br/><br/>With regard to the recommended expansion of the scheme to cover additional institutions, the Bill provides for the list of institutions in Schedule 1 to be expanded if it were to come to light that an institution fulfilled a similar function with regard to single women and their children as the 14 mother and baby institutions for which the State had a regulatory or inspection function.  One of the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations called for survivors to be provided with funded legal aid at all stages of engaging with the scheme.  The Bill makes provision for applicants to be financially supported in obtaining legal services in two circumstances, namely, where an affidavit is required and where they wish to seek legal advice at the point of accepting a payment under the scheme and, thus, signing a legal waiver.  It is important to note that the scheme will adopt a non-adversarial approach and applicants will not be required to bring forward evidence of abuse suffered.  Applicants will be supported in making an application to the scheme and throughout that process.<br/><br/>On the recommendation to increase the payment amounts under the scheme, I have improved the overall approach to the payment rates by introducing more refined bands.  This will benefit applicants, particularly where they would have been at the upper end of a given annual band under the original proposals.  I have also introduced into the Bill that periods of temporary absence of up to 180 days can be included when calculating the total duration of a person's time in a relevant institution and their corresponding financial payment.  This recognises that many mothers and children spent time outside an institution, for example, as a result of a hospital stay.  The inclusion of such periods of temporary absences will also have the effect of increasing the payment amounts which some applicants may be entitled to.<br/><br/>There was another cohort of recommendations which are not directly reflected in the Bill but which are being incorporated in the design and operational roll-out of the scheme.  When the scheme is operational, a comprehensive communications campaign will be undertaken both in Ireland and abroad.  My officials are currently working on the overall communications strategy for the scheme.  The recommendation that a stakeholder advisory group should be established is also being taken on board as part of the design and roll-out of the scheme, with plans in development to put in place a stakeholder reference group.  Under action 1 of the Government's action plan, work is also under way on the development of a new structure to support wider stakeholder engagement.<br/><br/>This brings me on to a number of recommendations where the intent is being achieved through the broader action plan.  For example, in terms of the use of sensitive and appropriate language, researchers from the University of Galway, funded by my Department, have been working on a project aiming to highlight the stigmatising and labelling language that has been used in the past, and to provide guidance as to how to address this issue.  With regard to the role of local authorities in assisting survivors, I continue to liaise with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how survivors can be better supported.  Counselling support is available to all survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions through the national counselling service in the HSE.  It is free of charge, including out-of-hours support, and those who identify themselves as survivors of the institutions are prioritised for the next available counselling space.<br/><br/>In the context of the action plan, I want to address the sentiments expressed by those who feel excluded from redress because their circumstances are not covered by the payment scheme.  I stress again that it is through the action plan that the Government is delivering the most inclusive response possible to the suffering experienced by so many who have been hurt by Ireland's legacy in this area.  The scheme is one element of that plan and can only deliver a limited amount.  Following deliberations on the design of the scheme, it was decided that a general payment, based on time spent in the institution, was the best option in order to provide for a non-adversarial approach to delivering the scheme.  It is not a perfect solution but it means applicants will not have to bring forward evidence of abuse, harm or mistreatment in order to benefit from the scheme.  This approach, unfortunately, does not cater for the circumstances of people who were boarded.  Given their very individual experiences, they would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>The action plan includes other measures that will provide support and assistance to those who were boarded out as children, including access to birth and early life information as part of the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022, and the provision of an <i>ex-gratia</i>payment to reimburse anyone who was boarded out and had to pay inheritance taxes for farms they inherited from their foster parents.  Furthermore, funding of &euro;330,000 has been provided for specialist therapeutic counselling services to persons who were boarded out or placed at nurse as children.  Those who were boarded out after having spent more than six months in a mother and baby or county institution will of course be able to apply to the payment scheme for the time spent in that institution.<br/><br/>With regard to children who spent less than six months in an institution and were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family, the overwhelming priority need expressed is for access to records.  The action plan responds to their needs through the recently enacted Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.  From 3 October, statutory Information and tracing services under the Act opened, guaranteeing people access to their birth and early life information.  In the first two weeks, over 4,000 applications have been received under the Act.  The Government's proposals for the scheme mean financial payments will be made to an estimated 34,000 people and a form of enhanced medical card will be provided to an estimated 19,000 people who were resident in mother and baby and county home institutions, at a value of approximately &euro;800 million.  These proposals go significantly beyond the recommendations of the commission of investigation, under which an estimated 6,500 people would have been eligible for a financial payment, at an estimated cost of &euro;400 million.  This will be the largest scheme of its kind in the history of the State in terms of beneficiaries, recognising the scale of the impact of mother and baby institutions on Irish society.<br/><br/>I will now outline the key parts of the Bill as initiated.  Part 1 provides for a number of preliminary matters including commencement and the payment of expenses for the administration of the Act and the making of regulations and orders.  Part 1 also provides for the relevant definitions.  A key definition is that of &quot;relevant person&quot;, encompassing a person who was resident as a child or a mother, or both, in one of the institutions listed in Schedule 1, and, therefore, eligible to apply for the scheme.<br/><br/>Part 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme and its duration, guaranteeing that all applications received before the closing date of the scheme will be processed.  The scheme will be administered through the office of the chief deciding officer of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, which will be situated in my Department.  The chief deciding officer will be independent in the performance of their functions relating to the scheme.  In order that the scheme may open as quickly as possible, this approach allows for the office to draw on my Department's existing infrastructure and resources to support the fastest possible establishment of the scheme, including the administrative structures required to operate it.  The chief deciding officer will be provided with staff to assist with the operation of the scheme, and there is potential to contract third-party support to undertake some of the more straightforward processing tasks.  The office of the chief deciding officer will widely promote awareness of the scheme, in Ireland and abroad, and will prepare an annual report, which I will lay before each House of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Part 3 provides for all aspects of the application, determination and notification processes for applicants and also for the arrangements in respect of internal reviews and the independent appeals process, where an applicant is not happy with a determination on their application.<br/><br/>The benefits available to applicants under the scheme are a general payment, a work-related payment, an enhanced medical card and a health support payment.  The overall determination of an applicant's eligibility for benefits under the scheme hinges on his or her period of residence in one of the institutions.  The general and work-related payment amounts will rise based on time spent in one of the institutions.  Regarding eligibility for the health support payment, applicants who are deemed eligible for a form of enhanced medical card under the scheme but who live outside of Ireland may choose to take the card or opt instead to receive a once-off health support payment of &euro;3,000, in recognition of their individual health needs.<br/><br/>The Bill sets out what people need to do to make an application to the scheme.  One application can cover time spent in different institutions, so only one application to the scheme is required.  However, if an additional institution is added to Schedule 1, a person will be entitled to make a further application in respect of that institution.  Certain applications can be prioritised, having regard to the age or health status of the applicant, if the chief deciding officer considers it is in the interest of fairness and efficiency to do so.  To support the assessment of applications, the Bill provides for the office of the chief deciding officer to be able to search the copy of the commission of investigation's archive held by my Department, to establish the applicant's period of residency in a relevant institution.  The office of the chief deciding officer will also have the authority to request relevant information from an &quot;information source&quot;, where they hold relevant records that are not held in the archive.  In the limited circumstances where records may not be available, the Bill allows for affidavits to be sought at the application stage.</p> <p>Where relevant, a formal offer of payment will issue to an applicant and he or she will have six months to accept or reject the offer.  Applicants will also have the right to request a review of the determination and an independent appeal.  The period of six months will give applicants enough time to avail of independent legal advice on the legal waiver.  The waiver will only be signed at the point where the applicant accepts an offer of a payment under the scheme in order that the applicant will have full knowledge of what they are being offered prior to signing.  It is the intention to make a capped amount of financial support available to applicants for the purposes of obtaining independent legal advice.  A contribution to legal costs will also be provided in cases where an applicant makes an affidavit to apply to the scheme.</p> <p> Applicants who were resident in a relevant institution for a minimum of six months will be eligible for a form of enhanced medical card.  The card will enable the holder to access the services specified in the Bill free of charge.  Applicants who are deemed eligible for a medical card but live outside of the State may opt to receive a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 instead of the card.</p> <p> The Bill provides that a person can apply on behalf of a relevant person in specified circumstances.  An application may also be made for a general payment and-or work-related payment on behalf of a person who would have been eligible to apply but has died since the date of the State apology, that is, since 13 January 2021.</p> <p> Part 4 contains provisions on a range of ancillary matters.  These include: the power to make regulations; the power to prescribe a person as an information source where the person holds relevant records; the power of those administering the scheme to process personal data and special categories of personal data for the purposes of fulfilling functions set out in the Bill; a prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information by those administering the scheme; and the service of documents and penalties.  In addition, it provides that general payments and work-related payments made under the scheme are exempt from income tax and capital gains and capital acquisitions tax.  Part 4 also provides for the carrying out of a review of the operation of the scheme after two years and again at the end of the scheme.  It also provides that an additional institution may be added to the Schedule of eligible institutions by way of a ministerial order.</p> <p> I reiterate my appreciation to survivors and their families for their ongoing patience as Government continues to work through these complex issues.  Recognising the importance of delivering this scheme for survivors, I hope to be able to bring the Bill swiftly through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In parallel with the legislation, the significant work required to establish the scheme is under way.  I assure survivors that we are doing everything in our power to deliver this scheme as quickly as possible.  Subject to the legislation being passed and enacted, and the administrative structures being established, the scheme will open for applications as soon as possible in 2023.</p></speech>

The cynical part of me thinks that other Ministers did not mind leaving stacks of files on their desk for somebody else to deal with.  I acknowledge that the Minister has dealt with many of the outstanding issues relating to the mother and baby institutions.  We have not always agreed and, in fact, we have disagreed on many of the issues but I acknowledge that he has at least tried to push on with them, unlike previous Ministers who held the post before him.  I will make my comments in that spirit.</p>  <p>  Sometimes there is so much to say that I do not even know where to start and other times, when we talk about this topic, I seem to say the same thing time and again.  Much of it goes back to the terrible patriarchal mindset at the heart of all of this.  First, there is the history of the institutions and how or why they were even allowed to exist.  Second, there is the timeline of the commission of investigation report.  The report was leaked and we called for a Garda investigation.  An internal investigation was launched but, as far as I am aware, we have no information on what exactly happened.  Third, there is the report itself.  I will never forget sitting upstairs waiting for and reading the report because I was dismayed from the very start.  I tried to see how it would go, given there was a lot in it, but the dismissive tone and the disingenuous language was a disaster.  That is saying something.</p>  <p>  The authors of the report may not have done so but the everybody else understood the torture, deprivation and humiliation that was hidden behind the walls of those institutions.  Some 15%, which is the equivalent of 9,000 babies, of all babies born into one of these institutions died which tells its own sad and horrific story.  There were calls from some quarters to repudiate the report.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth invited the authors of the report to come before it who of course declined.  RT&Eacute; made a programme on illegal adoptions, and I believe a report is due from Dr. Niall Muldoon on that matter.  We already know how much the people who were born into or sent to these institutions were failed and then they had all of this.  Professor Daly, to add insult to injury, spoke at an event in Oxford.  The authors of the report were again asked to come before the committee to give some explanation of their findings but they totally refused all of the invitations.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the Birth Information and Tracing Act is a step forward for many people, there is still that mandatory information session, which brings me back to the patriarchal mindset.  It is as though people who were born into or sent to the institutions have to be constantly told that they may not be able for all of this.  The we-know-best attitude is inherent to all of this.  We had judicial cases some of which were successful.  In contrast, we had the Institutional Burials Bill, which was actually a very good example of legislation being done the right way.  Stuff that was discussed in pre-legislative scrutiny was taken on board and some, while not all, of the amendments on Committee Stage were taken on board.  That is in contrast to this legislation and the Birth Information and Tracing Act.</p>  <p>  I know nobody in this House needs a history of the situation, but it is important to realise how, time and again, people have been failed by the State, religious organisations and the system.  Unfortunately, this generation of politicians will be added to that failure if we do not properly take this on board, make proper recommendations and ensure that it is not just words on a page or nodding heads of sympathy.  It is terrible what happened and we can all apologise but we have to see proper action.  By proper action, I mean much of the stuff that was in the OAK consultation report, the process of which survivors were very happy.</p>  <p>  I will never understand the six-month rule.  I cannot understand how someone who was five months in an institution can be totally left out.  I totally disagree with that and we will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I do not like the inclusion of a legal waiver.  It goes back to the mindset of "we know best" and there is an issue of trust.  I also know of some legal firms that have written to survivors since the report was published to tell them that they may need legal assistance.  Such firms should take a good long look at themselves because, in some cases, they just trying to get people to sign up and to get money from very vulnerable people.  Those firms know exactly who they are and they should stop.</p>  <p>  The exclusion of those who were boarded out is horrific.  The Minister made reference to it.  He is aware of the two brothers to whom Deputy Pa Daly regularly refers, Mr. James Sugrue and his brother, who were among those who were boarded out.  The Minister said in his speech that they would be able to apply if they were in an institution for six months.  It does not take into account that in most cases they were used as slaves in the situation.  Has the list of institutions that was in the mother and baby investigation report been expanded?</p>  <p>  Human rights experts spoke at length about systemic racism faced by mixed-race people resident in the institutions, much of which does not seem to have been taken on board.</p> <p> Some 58,208 people passed through one of the mother and baby institutions.  That is the total number of people who should be supported by means of any proposed redress scheme.  That brings me to the pharmaceutical companies and religious orders that have come out and publicly apologised.  They have acknowledged their role in all this, yet they seem to think they have no part to play when it comes to writing a cheque.  That is absolutely disgusting in light of the amount of wealth the religious organisations and the pharmaceutical companies own.  They should be pursued strongly.  We should be looking to see if there is any way we can pursue them through the courts because if somebody acknowledges and apologises for something publicly, surely they are saying they have a very strong role to play.  It is disgusting to think the companies felt it was okay to use people as human guinea pigs and that they can just walk away from their responsibilities now.</p> <p> I again acknowledge everyone who has ever contacted me or whom I have met.  Much of the time - and I appreciate it is mean sincerely - we acknowledge the courage and bravery of people but when the women who were sent to these institutions come in they often feel they need to tell us all their very personal medical stuff, just because they are trying to access medical services.  That is totally and utterly wrong.  Much of the time these are very personal situations people might not even want to discuss with their own family.  They are coming in to a total stranger because they are so desperate to get medical services and are being left on waiting lists.  I hope that whatever medical card is being proposed will be sufficient to ensure that these people are not just going to be joining the back of a three-, four-, five- or six-year waiting list and that they will get the services they need.  This applies to the women who were left to give birth in the most horrific of circumstances and who have never been the same physically since.  I feel strongly about that, and about all of it, but the religious organisations and the pharmaceutical companies aspect really bothers me.  I hope they are watching today, though they probably do not care.  I hope we can go after them in some way, shape or form and that they will be made pay their fair share of everything.  As we all know, there is no price that can be put on this but the very first thing we do should not be to exclude people.  Everybody needs to be included in this scheme.  I refer to the OAK recommendations.  Survivors trusted the OAK process and anyone I spoke to was -  "happy" is not the word - satisfied with it.  They felt they were listened to and that they were given time.  Those are the recommendations we should be looking at for the redress.</p></speech>

I begin by acknowledging all those who contacted Members across this House to outline their views and concerns on the provisions of the Bill.  Before I address several matters of concern I have with the Bill, I must state that time is a crucial factor here.  It has been said to me on numerous occasions that valuable time has been allowed go by while those who fell victim to these institutions awaited justice.  That did not just happen in the decades gone by because it is also the case with the delays leading up to the report of the commission of investigation and the processes that have been mired in controversy since.  The people who have been seeking justice, redress and answers for their entire lives have been let down by these delays.  They do not have the luxury of being able to wait for answers or to be afforded justice.</p>  <p>  For decades, the women who were incarcerated in mother and baby homes were shut away from society; they were hidden, silenced and worked.  Their children were in many cases subjected to a separation from their mothers that defies belief.  They were often treated as commodities to be traded.  These women and children were treated like very few others in society.  Their pursuit of truth, justice and their own histories has been beset by obstacles.  These include records that are missing or were destroyed - deliberately or otherwise - accounts misrepresented, as we have seen in recent times, or accounts not being given the context they deserved.  Over the years these people looked on as they were spoken about by those who did not share the horrors they endured or spend their lives piecing back together the missing parts of those lives.  I want us to recognise this because we must ensure the issues we are discussing are framed by that knowledge and the consequences of those experiences.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, while I believe the Minister is committed to doing right by survivors of these institutions, the Bill falls short in a number of areas.  I begin with the deeply-flawed decision to exclude from redress anybody who was in one of these institutions for fewer than 180 days as a child.  I have been told that survivors are feeling "sold out" by this - that is the term that was used.  That is not the response we want to hear when seeking to make amends to a person for a lifetime of being wronged.  Imagine a person who was in a mother and baby home for six months or fewer.  Does the Minister think their sense of loss and the gaps that may remain in their personal histories are any less than those of people who were in one of those places for two years or more?  A stay of thee to six months was typical at Sean Ross Abbey, so that is where the feeling of being sold out comes from.  Does the Minster think nobody who was born in an institution covered by this Bill, or who was born in one and stayed there for fewer than six months before they were moved on or exported, should have that recognised?  Are their potential needs any less?  Are the emotional impact of what or who they lost or the overall consequences for them any less?  I cannot see the sense in all of this.  There is not even a medical card.  I can only put it down to an effort to limit liability to reduce costs.  I am reluctant to say that but it is the only answer I can come up with.  When talking about the survivors of these institutions we must talk about them all.  They all had an element of self-determination taken away from them by a system that dominated their direction in life and it deeply affected their lives from that time on.  This is a fundamental flaw the Minister must see.  The nuns of Sean Ross Abbey got the money for their transactions regardless, yet an arbitrary bar is set for survivors.  Deep down, the Minister knows this is profoundly wrong.  I urge him to revise this or accept an amendment to address it.</p>  <p>  This shortcoming also affects those who were boarded out as children.  They were in many cases workhorses for others.  It is unjust in the extreme.  Furthermore, the legal waiver remains, so we see more restrictions on who qualifies for this scheme.  This effectively removes people's ability to exercise their right to justice and pursue legal action while at the same time the religious orders that sought to profit from their inhumane methods and treatment of women and children are afforded all the time they want to further delay justice for survivors.  Where are they now?  I will tell the Minister.  They are again holding back from the survivors.  They are again abandoning them, wasting their valuable time and running down the clock.  They are pinching every penny, just as they kept women and children at subsistence levels throughout their time in these places.  It is the same old story for survivors - different rules apply to them.  They are left without while other parties, including the pharmaceutical companies, have a free hand to act as they please.  The UN special rapporteur, its human rights committee and its human rights experts have all called for appropriate compensation, removal of legal waivers and for any scheme to address child victims of racial discrimination within Irish institutions.  These calls are being largely ignored.  I urge the Minister to address this, rethink some of the provisions in the Bill, to take a hard line in those negotiations and to get them wrapped up as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Earlier, I spoke of the obstacles survivors of these institutions had to overcome.  I spoke of accounts being misrepresented or presented out of context.  The elements of the Bill I have highlighted are representative of that, in a way.  OAK was called on to consult survivors, many of whom had to add to their original testimonies as the commission of investigation misrepresented the original accounts, questioned their veracity or laid them aside.  In much the same way, the recommendations obtained from the accounts repeatedly given by some survivors have been ignored in the Bill.  Survivors engaged in good faith in many cases, relived the trauma they went through and yet their testimonies were either misrepresented or dismissed.  Despite this, the request to appoint a human rights expert to examine testimony given to the commission of investigation has been refused.  That is totally unacceptable.  The lack of trust in the process that survivors have developed over the years must be addressed.  The Minister has an opportunity to do this now.  While I thank him for the attention he has given to the survivors of Sean Ross Abbey in my constituency, I strongly urge him not to leave this Bill as it is.</p>  <p>  There are two further issues I wish to address.  Survivors have numerous questions about the payments a select number will receive.  Given the age of many survivors, there are concerns that if the processes involved are too onerous or lengthy, some may not live to receive those payments.  What timescale can we expect?  If a person passes away before receiving his or her entitlements, will they be passed on to the family?</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to see this debate as an opportunity to do what is right.  On foot of my engagement with him, I am sure he wants to do what is right.</p> <p>Whatever or whoever is holding him back, I urge him to resist and to bring sense and compassion into play.  To echo Deputy Funchion, a massive push must be put on the religious orders and pharmaceutical companies to make payments, provide redress and give these survivors what they deserve.</p></speech>

There is so much information for us to analyse that it is hard to encapsulate it within a reasonably short debate such as this.  Nonetheless, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate.</p><p>We are fortunate as Deputies that there are many people outside this Chamber who are willing to provide us with excellent research and resources.  As I sat in my office last night, I received an email containing a briefing paper on the Bill from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission, I will read some of it into the record.  For me, it crystallises all the issues and flaws that are inherent in this legislation.  The ICCL paper states at the outset:</p> <blockquote> 	1. Survivors challenged the Final Report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation in the High Court by arguing that the Commission failed to adhere to the legislation that established it, and that their rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached.  A settlement was reached whereby the State consented to a declaration that the Commission acted in breach of statutory duty.  A statement was also agreed which recognised that &quot;survivors do not accept the accounts given in the Final Report... as a true and full reflection of the oral and documentary evidence they gave&quot;.  This is followed by a list of 64 paragraphs which can no longer be relied on.  The State has expressed that the Redress Scheme is a part of the measures being used in &quot;responding to the report&quot;.  ICCL is concerned that the Redress Scheme is therefore based on a report which the State itself agreed was flawed. <br /><br />2. The Final Report omitted survivors' testimony and drew conclusions that do not align with survivors' testimony. For example:  	a) There was &quot;no evidence&quot; that the women who gave birth were denied pain relief (Executive Summary, para. 245) and that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; [these are the words of the commission report] that at the time of adoption women thought &quot;their consent was not full, free and informed&quot; (Executive Summary, para. 254).<br /><br />b) Mothers &quot;were not 'incarcerated' in the strict meaning of the word&quot;<br /><br />c) Certain evidence was &quot;merely the product of a creative writing class&quot;.  </blockquote>  <p>This is the atmosphere in which we are seeking to promulgate this legislation.  The ICCL's report is a damning one.  On the proposed independent review, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	On 2 June 2021, it was reported that the vast majority of evidence given by survivors, those who gave evidence to the Confidential Committee, was effectively not considered for the Final Report.  This led to the proposal from the Department of Children of a review of survivor testimony.  However, [the Minister] recently announced [and this was quoted in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, thanks to the work of Elaine Loughlin and Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta] that this would not proceed due to &quot;significant legal complexities&quot;.  These have not been adequately identified.<br /><br />Problems with the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill 2022<br /><br />4. [The Bill] omits over 40% of survivors, including children who spent less than six months in an institution and those who were boarded out.  The six-month requirement is arbitrary and permits no consideration of context: a child resident for 180 days receives &euro;12,500.  A child resident for 179 days receives ... [nothing at all].<br /><br />5. The Bill makes it more difficult for survivors who resided in an institution at a young age to claim compensation.  Whereas the General Scheme of the Bill [which the committee considered] allowed child survivors to claim a payment if they were, <i>or had reasonable grounds for suspecting they were</i>, residents ... the Bill only allows a child to claim who &quot;was resident&quot; [very specific language] ...  For children who may have no documentary evidence of their residence, this sets the standard of proof too high.<br /><br />6. The Bill provides no compensation for forced and illegal adoptions, forced labour, unlawful vaccine trials... </blockquote>  <p>Deputy Funchion has referred to the vaccine trials that took place, an issue that has been raised by all Opposition Members.  We want clarity in respect of GSK.  We have been very adamant about that.  It looks to me like GSK has been let off the hook.  Respectfully, the Minister and the State have not adequately addressed the issue of the vaccine trials.  It is a sword of Damocles hanging over us and it needs to be addressed.</p> <blockquote> 	6. The Bill provides no compensation for forced and illegal adoptions, forced labour, unlawful vaccine trials, abuse as an adopted child, and death.  Nor does the Bill provide compensation for discrimination whether based on gender, disability or race.  The latter issue of systemic racism in institutions was recently highlighted as a serious gap in this Bill by UN Special Rapporteurs.<br /><br />7. The term &quot;work-related payment&quot; used by the Bill ... does not adequately describe lived experiences.  It should properly be described as &quot;forced labour&quot;.<br /><br />8. The levels of payment provided by the Bill in respect of the &quot;work-related payment&quot; are inadequate.  They must correspond to the wages that survivors should have earned at the time and be linked to the average industrial wage.<br /><br />9. The Bill does not count a &quot;temporary absence&quot; of 180 days or more ...  There is no room for context.  A survivor may have excellent reasons for having left the institution and returning.  For example, a survivor may have escaped for 181 days before being caught and returned.  That period of 181 days could not reasonably be separated from their time in the institution. </blockquote>  <p>This is the language we are dealing with.  This is the context in which the Bill is being put before us.  This is how serious it is.</p> <blockquote> 	10. The enhanced medical card proposed in the General Scheme has been replaced by health services without charge and is available for anyone resident for 180 days ...  This residency requirement is arbitrary and should be removed. </blockquote>  <p>We are all <i>ad idem</i>in the Opposition on that point.  The timeframe of zero to six months is just too arbitrary.</p> <blockquote> 	11. Survivors resident outside of Ireland are entitled to a payment of &euro;3000 instead of health services without charge ... This figure is far too low and is not reflective of the value of the services available to those receiving health services without charge. <br /><br />12. Survivors have called specifically for trauma-informed counselling and therapies.  This is not provided for in the Bill.<br /><br />13. There is no requirement in the Bill that those charged to administer the Redress Scheme must be qualified for the position and be subject to ongoing training in international human rights law and trauma-informed responses to gross human rights violations. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister says this legislation is grounded in human rights law.  That is open to interpretation and critique.  The idea of putting deciding officers within the Department itself is something we will deal with on Committee Stage because it requires further interrogation.  We in the Labour Party are not convinced it is the right way to go.</p> <blockquote> 	17. Additionally, the Bill states that a survivor will be entitled to no compensation where they have &quot;received an award from a court or settlement in respect of an action arising out of any circumstances relating to the same period of residence in the institution&quot; ... This provision does not take into account the possibility of a Court awarding a survivor a lower amount of compensation than they would receive under the Bill.  Moreover, court proceedings may not necessarily be directed towards the State, yet the Bill precludes such an individual from later claiming compensation from the State. </blockquote>  <p>Again, this is a serious flaw in the Bill and we will seek to amend it.  I anticipate, however, that our amendments will be ruled out of order because of the rules that apply in regard to such amendments.</p> <p>We asked the Minister to reconsider that very provision in section 27 of the Bill, paragraph 3.  I contend that will have to be dealt with.  Payment rates under Head 11 should be amended to remedy the failure to offer payments to all survivors and to compensate adequately those who received payments in line with, <i>inter alia</i>, the current personal injuries guidelines and other comparable schemes.  This includes PTSD payments.  Under the guidelines moderate PTSD equates to compensation of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;35,000 whereas serious PTSD equates to &euro;35,000 to &euro;80,000.  The Bill does not require that free legal aid be made available to all applicants in circumstances where legal aid is likely to be required in applying for compensation, reviewing or appealing a determination and in swearing an affidavit that could be required of them.  This should be provided for.  That is the position of the Irish Council of Civil Liberties on this Bill, all of which I agree with.  It is a perfect crystallisation of the issues that we are dealing with here.<br/><br/>In regard to our attempts to amend the Bill to reflect the thoughts and aspirations of the many people who have been in contact with us we will now seek to put forward an amendment in regard to seeking a report on the operation of the scheme.  In putting forward that amendment we will seek to highlight the flaws in this Bill on the basis that we will seek the report asking whether and to what extent persons engaged in the management, administration or operation of relevant institutions should be permitted or required to contribute to the cost of making payments under this Act because that highlights the flaw in regard to parties which were not party to the redress scheme, and again GSK looms large in our thinking there; whether the 180 days&rsquo; residence requirement provided for in section 13(1) and section 13(4) should be amended or repealed; whether the scheme should be extended to make provision for recognising persons who were boarded out as children, as relevant persons; whether there is a need to provide for additional institutions in Schedule 1 of the Bill, because we feel it is not an all-encompassing Bill in that regard; and whether the requirement imposed on applicants by section 27(3) should be removed.<br/><br/>Section 27(3) says: &quot;An applicant who receives a payment under subsection 1(a) or the personal representative of a person in respect of whom a payment was made under subsection 1 shall not institute civil proceedings and shall discontinue any other proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the applicant against a public body that arise out of the same or substantially the same circumstances as the circumstances to which the application concerned related.&quot;  That is basically saying that if you get money under this scheme you have no recourse to any other; that in order to sign the bottom line to get your money, redress and compensation you are disbarring yourself from any further action on the same issue.  That is essentially what, as I understand it, the Minister is saying and has prescribed in this legislation.  The Irish Council of Civil Liberties, as I have already said, is speaking to this point.  A number of solicitors have been in touch with us who are concerned about the perception that this Bill creates, that people will not have access to the legal advice to which every citizen is entitled on any matter of law before them, particularly in circumstances such as this where people will need advocates.  As Deputies we will act as advocates for people.  However, I am not a lawyer.  There will be times when people will want to interface and may seek to take further action, as I think should be their right, in civil proceedings.  They should not be proscribed from doing that.<br/><br/>I will speak specifically to the human rights element of this in regard to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  The Minister speaks to the fact that he took on board, if I am interpreting him correctly, the paper that was published by the IHREC.  I will quote again from the IHREC.  Its advisory paper stated: &quot;the Commission of Investigation report was limited in terms of the institutions&quot; that it covered.  I have said that already.  In the past, the exclusion of certain institutions in Ireland has created a barrier to seeking recourse to any meaningful reparation for survivors, despite having been subjected to serious harm.  The paper continues:</p><blockquote>	Recent research from Queen&rsquo;s University identifies the difficulties of relying on previous investigations to inform the scope of reparation&rsquo;s schemes and which resulted in excluding certain institutions:  	 <blockquote>	&ldquo;Refusing redress for these victims or basing redress on the same assumptions and availability of evidence already collected through investigations, creates a hierarchy of victims, silencing those at other institutions and compromising the efficacy&hellip; of the redress scheme overall.&rdquo; </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>That is a glaring point that has not been addressed in this Bill.  We cannot have that hierarchy.  For too long on this island there has been a hierarchy of victims.  We can have no more of that, I respectfully contend.  Mr. Spicer, a solicitor who corresponded with us, stated that the Minister quite worryingly seems to indicate that it would be sufficient to have the staff in his own Department handle the many thousands of inquiries.  This is not only impractical in terms of the logistical capabilities of having a handful of staff handling tens of thousands of calls.  It lacks basic independence and it would be entirely inappropriate for the Minister&rsquo;s own staff to be advising service users on their rights, commenting on whether they should apply to the scheme, helping our community to weigh up the pros and cons of the scheme or anything else that the community needs help with in terms of putting their applications together.<br/><br/>Given the experience of survivors in regard to the commission&rsquo;s report, those people, who we represent, are now expected to interface with the Minister&rsquo;s Department and to have confidence in that process.  They do not have confidence.  They want to be able to deal with somebody who is verifiably independent.  Mr. Spicer continued to state that the community cannot be led with their hands held by the State to accept this redress without independent legal advice forming part of the decision-making process should the applicants so wish.  This scheme has to operate with complete transparency and fairness.  Part of that process is the right to consult with a chosen and trusted legal representative not only on the scheme itself but also in consideration of the individual&rsquo;s own lived experiences and balancing that with the provisions in the scheme.  Applicants therefore must feel that they can voice their concerns and be given feedback in a confidential setting with their trusted legal representative.<br/><br/>I understand the Minister&rsquo;s genuine attempt to formulate a scheme here but the legislation before us as it is constituted does not deal adequately with a whole raft of issues that remain outstanding.  I hope the Minister will be of a mind to introduce amendments to his own legislation on Committee Stage which would deal particularly with section 27 and section 3 in regard to the right to further civil proceedings if an applicant so wishes, where they are deemed to have already received compensation or redress.  I also believe strongly that if the issue of the zero to six months is not dealt with then the legislation disregards so many people.  Previously I asked of the Minister, on the record of the House, what analysis had the Minister and his Department officials done on the number of people in the zero and six months group who could potentially form part of this scheme and whether that was quantifiable.</p> <p>If it was, what would the additional cost of that have been to the scheme?  There has been a weight of evidence given to us on this already, which the Minister will be well aware of.  It is too arbitrary to exclude from the scheme people who were resident for less than six months.  Again, I am respectfully asking the Minister to please reconsider that.  It seems that the reason for it is that perhaps some analysis has been done on the cost of this and it was such that the Government decided it would be too costly to add that onto the &euro;800 million budget line that has already been assigned to this.  Therefore, it has taken an arbitrary decision.  We will revisit many of these issues on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It follows years of activism by survivors of mother and baby home institutions to get the recognition and redress they so badly deserve.  The critical need for this legislation has been recognised by all political parties, all stakeholders and all groups.  I welcome the work the Minister and his Department have done on this legislation and on making it such a key priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  We have heard the testimonies and the horror stories.  That is evidence of Ireland's long and dark history of illegal and forced adoptions, and we must shine a light on that dark corner of Irish history.  Babies were taken from their mother's arms, children grew up with no knowledge of their origins or family history, and young women were cruelly institutionalised.  For so many of those women, it is not history; it is their present.  Still today, they are enduring the trauma they suffered at the hands of the church and the State at such an early stage in life.  For many people, that suffering has had a profound impact on their health, their well-being, their ability to work and their ability to lead an ordinary life.</p>  <p>  I do not know what financial price can be put on that level of trauma.  How do we repay a woman who had her child taken from her and illegally adopted, perhaps never to be seen again?   How do we repay a child born into such harrowing circumstances, who grew up without all of the information they should have had about who they are?  I do not know how we quantify that.  In reality, we know that no amount of financial redress will ever remedy the unspeakable damage and abuse that so many women and children suffered.  Even the largest sum of money would pale into insignificance.</p>  <p>  However, I know this legislation aims to help through the financial redress and access to medical cards and the support that these women and their children born into institutions will get.  We know that many women who were institutionalised in mother and baby homes are growing older.  They have lived long lives and some have poor health.  We simply cannot make them wait any longer for financial redress.  That is why it is critical we ensure redress is given as soon as possible.  These women and their children, who are mostly adults now, need our support.</p>  <p>  This legislation will mean that all mothers who spent time in a mother and baby institution will receive financial redress, with the amount of redress increasing based on their length of stay.  All children who spent six months or more in an institution will receive financial redress based on their length of stay.  An additional work-related payment for women resident in certain institutions for more than three months who undertook what might be termed commercial work will come into play.  An enhanced medical card will be available to everybody who was resident in a mother and baby home or county home institution for six months or more.</p>  <p>  I take issue with the exclusion of those boarded out and children born in mother and baby homes who spent less than six months in these institutions.  I know that in every scheme and every policy we have to set parameters, but I find that six-month parameter hard to justify.</p>  <p>  I was recently contacted by someone born in a mother and baby home who spent less than six months there.  This person&rsquo;s life has been greatly impacted by that cruel entry into the world, and they are so hurt that they will not be included in this scheme.  They feel excluded again.  All I can do for that person is agree with them and take this opportunity to urge the Minister to please keep this aspect of the legislation under review.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister and the State on taking responsibility for the provision of redress.  However, I also want to put on the record that it is so disappointing and so frustrating that religious institutions will not be contributing towards redress.  Religious organisations that have apologised and accepted their responsibility for the unforgivable trauma and abuse inflicted on mothers and babies will not be contributing to the redress.  That is angering for many people.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister&rsquo;s intentions in this Bill are only good.  The Minister and his Department have not been set an easy task, but it is one they must fulfil.  I thank him for his leadership and dedication to ensuring that happens.</p>  <p>  I would like to end with a line from correspondence sent to me just this week by a survivor, who wrote, &ldquo;Protecting, valuing and recognising trauma of survivors and victims now, properly and compassionately would heal some pain.&rdquo;  Perhaps nothing was done to stop it happening then, but something can be done to ease the damage now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700034#KK00300"><p>I have had many emails and phone calls from survivors of mother and baby homes over recent weeks.  The survivors are understandably angry about some of the provisions of this Bill.  While we in Sinn F&eacute;in support the introduction of a redress scheme for survivors of mother and baby and county homes, it must be one that it is inclusive and based on human rights and equality standards.</p>  <p>  There are serious concerns in regard to the exclusion of children who were resident in these homes for less than six months.  People feel it has been deliberately formulated to exclude approximately 24,000 survivors, mostly consisting of these children who were resident for less than six months, and that the Government&rsquo;s plan is all about reducing costs and liability.  It should be about creating equality, fairness and ensuring all survivors are adequately compensated for any time spent in one of these horrific institutions.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I spoke to a man who was born in one of these institutions.  He spent a short time there before being adopted to a family in the west of Ireland, where he had a happy childhood.  He learned in later life that he was adopted.  When he went looking for his mother, he found she had died the previous year.  He has since connected with her wider family, but feels cheated out of the chance to know his mother.  He rightly blames the State, which was complicit in his forced adoption.  I also spoke to this man&rsquo;s son, who told me feels an intergenerational sense of loss, shame and anger.</p>  <p>  The consequences of the State&rsquo;s action and inaction run deep.  In 2013, former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, apologised to the Magdalen laundries survivors.  A couple of sentences stuck out of his speech.  He said the value of any sincere apology is always found in the actions that follow.  He went on to say that the last thing survivors need is inadequate apologies from more men in positions of power.  They deserve justice, genuine contrition from the church and State and complete and unreserved redress.  Those were his words, not mine.  That is what they deserve.  However, this Bill falls far short.  It is a further abuse of the survivors and their families who have already suffered too much.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister please show some compassion and widen the scheme, increase the compensation and remove the legal waiver, which the UN has also called for?  Give these people what they deserve.  They have suffered enough and it is time to act now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700034#KK00400"><p>The scale of abuse, terror and cruelty experienced by thousands of women, children and infants in mother and baby homes is almost unimaginable.  This includes unexplained infant deaths, disappeared children, illegal adoptions, incarceration, forced labour, illegal medical experimentation and emotional, physical and sexual abuse.  Both the church and State have responsibility for these abuses and their legacy.  The religious orders and pharmaceutical companies must be held to account and pay their share.</p> <p>The extent of harm cannot be quantified.  There is the stigma that followed people all their lives, the psychological impact of losing the parent-child bond, the weight of never knowing what happened to your child and the intergenerational trauma.<br/><br/>No redress scheme could adequately compensate survivors but the Government's proposed scheme is shamefully minimal, exclusionary and insulting.  Despite the wishes of survivors and the recommendations of UN human rights bodies, it seems the Minister is determined to push ahead with deeply deficient and even offensive reparation.  With no evidence basis, and purposely going against clinical experts and survivors, people who spent less than six months in homes as children are excluded.  People who suffered illegal adoptions or medical trials or were boarded out will get nothing.  More than 24,000 people will not be eligible.  Those whom the Minister deems worthy of compensation will receive as little as &euro;5,000.  For many people, it is not about the money but that cannot be used as a defence for such an insultingly low figure.<br/><br/>This disgraceful scheme is being done in the name of the Irish people, yet I have not met one person who is not outraged by the Minister's plans.  There is still time to do the right thing, that is, to enable all survivors to access redress and to hold the church and pharmaceutical companies to account.  It is difficult to catalogue the defects in the scheme but its overarching philosophy is to award as little as possible and to grant that to as few people as possible.  This principle is obvious in the Bill but some of the particulars were reported by Jennifer Bray in <i>The Irish Times </i>earlier this year.  Documents from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform warned that extending the scheme would, &quot;create a significant precedent regarding claims from many others in society who may feel they are also entitled to some form of redress or recognition payment based on any length of residency or attendance in an institution or other setting&quot;.  That is the reality behind this scheme; the true priorities.  It is clear the Minister either has a lack of will or capacity to overrule those priorities.  There is a general feeling that he was left holding the bag but is he willing to put his name to this?  As he seems to have decided it is good enough to stand over, he must be held accountable.<br/><br/>Another tactic used is to claim the Minister is going beyond the deeply flawed commission's report.  It has obvious and painful inaccuracies that basically absolve the church and State of responsibility, blaming society instead.  This is blatantly untrue and it is disgraceful that the Government is willing to cling to this as the definitive record.  The Minister initially committed to providing an independent review of the testimony given to the commission.  In August, survivors learned from the <i>Irish Examiner</i>that he was abandoning that plan.  In December last year, we had the High Court declaration that the commission had wrongly denied eight survivors their statutory right to comment on many draft findings.  The commission is unwilling to explain its methodology and findings at Oireachtas committees, as it knows full well that its conduct and report is indefensible.  Its recommendations are arbitrary, ill-founded and punitive.  When the Minister says he is going beyond the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, I hope he realises how hollow and disrespectful those words are.<br/><br/>There are several major issues in the Bill that ignore the wishes of survivors, the views of human rights experts and the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  First, there is the purposeful exclusion of whole categories of survivors.  This is manifested in two ways primarily: people who as children spent less than six months in institutions; and then disregarding whole categories of abuse, such as forced family separation and illegal medical trials.  The disregard for those who were born and spent time in mother and baby homes is highly immoral.  It is disgusting that people are being denied any form of recognition because of what are, frankly, ignorant and hurtful statements from the Minister and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Ignoring all psychological and developmental evidence, the Minister claimed that &quot;children who were in for less than six months would not have been aware of their experiences, would have been too young to remember their experiences&quot;.  Besides being a reprehensible statement in this context, it is also factually inaccurate.  That the Minister for children is disregarding the central role of the first six months of a child's life for their development is wrong on so many levels.  When the Minister announced the scheme last year, more than 30 clinical experts wrote to him stating that childhood trauma has the greatest impact early on in childhood.  These experts pointed out that there is no threshold of time linked to this trauma and, as a result, having an arbitrary period of six months' exposure is simply that, arbitrary.  All children who were subjected to this cruel system deserve acknowledgement and redress.  That is the bare minimum.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform dismissed the experiences and trauma of this group of survivors because they would likely have gone on to live &quot;comfortable and contented lives&quot;.  Not only is that just made up, it is wholly ignorant of all we know about mother and baby homes and the trauma and stigma that followed people all their lives.  The exclusion is based on a dehumanising position that shows this Government has no interest in evidence or lived experience.<br/><br/>The disregard for the wishes of survivors further demonstrates this point.  The Minister commissioned the Oak report.  He presented it as a chance for survivors to have their voices heard in shaping the redress scheme.  It is especially callous to ask survivors for their input, only for him to then reject it.  Survivors participated in good faith and shared their experiences and opinions, only for the Minister to ignore them.  That is unforgivable.  The consultation was just a tick-box exercise for the Minister and the Department.  The lives and experiences of survivors are just a bureaucratic exercise to be thrown aside.  I will quote sections of the report to ensure they are on the D&aacute;il record and so that the people can understand how the Minister is simply ignoring survivors.  The executive summary states:</p><blockquote>	Many survivors stated that the recommendations were inappropriate, that eligibility criteria were arbitrary and lacked an acceptance of the realities and conditions in the homes. ... The largest proportion of written submissions stated that all mothers and babies who resided in mother and baby homes should be eligible for redress, regardless of the duration or year of their stay and regardless of whether children were accompanied or unaccompanied by their mothers. </blockquote> <p>On the same page of the report, there is a direct quote from a survivor:</p><blockquote>	I think it is disingenuous of the government to place an arbitrary six months redress restriction on residents.  From a neurobiological perspective the damage done to an infant is catastrophic.  It is a cop-out not to include human rights.  The State has failed us... </blockquote> <p>It is in there in black and white.  There is no ambiguity.  The survivors are clear.  Clinicians are clear.  The evidence is clear.  The recommendation of the children&rsquo;s committee was very strong on this issue, based on our engagement with survivors, their advocates and human rights experts.  We required that: </p><blockquote>	The six-month residency requirement must be removed.  Anyone who was resident in one of the institutions should be entitled to a payment, regardless of time spent therein.  </blockquote> <p>When I and others put forward amendments to remove this deeply insulting exclusion, will the Minister defend it each time?  Will he claim giving people access to their personal information is all they wanted every time?  More worrying, will he use the money message excuse to rule us out of order?The six-month exclusion has to go.  It should never have been there in the first place.<br/><br/>The second way the Government is excluding survivors is by dismissing abuses, most prominently forced family separation and illegal adoptions, the practice of being boarded out, forced labour and illegal medical trials.  Here, the Government has cobbled together different and equally pathetic excuses to deny any form of restitution for the harm caused by the State, the church and pharmaceutical companies.  The flawed commission&rsquo;s findings are used as a rationale.  Individuals are being told that the experimentation to which they never gave their consent - one the most basic tenets of medical science - is a matter for them to take up with the pharmaceutical companies, as if the church and State did not facilitate them</p> <p>This group must be included in the scheme and the State should pursue the pharmaceutical giants.<br/><br/>Adopted people and the survivors of forced family separation, one of the worst crimes imaginable, have been neglected in this process.  They were not included in the terms of the commission, meaning there is no official recognition and they have yet to receive a proper State apology.Recently in the Seanad the Minister gave an attempt at an apology, with a handful of survivors invited.  The whole incident revealed the Government&rsquo;s priorities rather than meaningfully recognising the abuses and crimes involved.<br/><br/>The OAK report, as I mentioned, stressed that all survivors should be included.  The principle incorporates these groups but in case there was any doubt, it is specifically stated in the executive summary that:</p><blockquote>	eligibility would be further extended to include those subjected to coercive family separation outside institutions or who were illegally adopted/fostered/boarded out without adequate supervision and vetting.  To do otherwise...would undermine the legitimacy of the scheme and fail to deliver a survivor centred response focused on the nature and effects of the harm suffered by the survivors. </blockquote> <p>The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, aware of the Minister&rsquo;s treatment of survivors, firmly supported them in its recommendation that the scheme should recognise all rights violations and all harms perpetrated in the institutional and family separation system, including but not limited to, those identified by the OAK report.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has strongly called for a broadening of the scheme as recognition for the range and scale of abuses in these State-run or State-financed institutions.  In addition, there is a mountain of recommendations from UN human rights experts that the Government is ignoring, hoping that the average person is not aware of them.  I can only list some of the many findings.  A joint letter from six UN special rapporteurs in November 2021 said that as illegal adoption may come within the legal definition of trafficking in persons, it is critical that the redress scheme &quot;establishes a process for effective investigations and ensures access to effective remedies to all victims, without exception&quot;.In July, the UN Human Rights Committee called for the state to recognise fully the violation of human rights of all victims in these institutions and provide redress.  In September, UN human rights experts called for redress for victims of racial discrimination and systemic racism in Irish childcare institutions.  This point is important and often overlooked.  Misogyny, classism, racism and other forms of discrimination were inherent in these cruel systems.  Women and children from poorer families were often treated worst, children with mixed heritages were abused and Travellers and disabled people were also targeted.<br/><br/>An important part of transitional justice is recognition.  It is truth telling.  It is not just memorialisation and it needs to be in the legislation.  The IHREC was clear on this, as were others.  The legislation should outline the range of abuses and human rights violations.  These should be listed and every survivor should be compensated.  The scale of people currently excluded from the scheme is shocking and the amount of abuse not recognised is shameful.<br/><br/>The next major issue is the disgracefully low compensation.  We know for some survivors it is not about money but about acknowledgment and some help with living costs and medical expenses.  All the UN bodies have called for proper compensation.  The Oireachtas children's committee, based on engagements with survivors and others, has called for an increase in the payment amounts, for Health Amendment Act, HAA, medical cards, tailored, trauma-informed counselling supports and for legal aid to enable survivors to seek independent advice at every stage.  Some survivors will get as little as &euro;5,000 which is truly pathetic.  While no form of redress could adequately compensate survivors, that cannot be used as an excuse to grant paltry amounts.  It is a pathetic excuse and the Minister knows it.<br/><br/>A legal waiver remains under the terms of the general payment or work-related payment in section 26.  The UN Human Rights Committee, UN human rights experts and the children's committee have all called for the removal of legal waivers.  Those who apply for redress should not be gagged or restricted from taking separate legal action.  Again, it is an attempt to control survivors, to prevent them from even thinking of seeking more redress than the small amounts the Minister has decided they can get.<br/><br/>Another significant issue is the lack of interim payments.  Again, this is another matter survivors were very clear on.  The OAK report states that the most commonly held view in relation to financial recognition was that &quot;an immediate interim ex-gratia, common experience payment, should be paid as urgently as possible&quot;.  This was particularly the case bearing in mind the older age profile of survivors who it was thought should be prioritised, as well as those suffering serious illness or other extreme circumstances.  Not only was an interim payments system the obvious and right thing to do, the Minister has had this report since May last year, so for 17 months he has done nothing on this vital issue.  Unfortunately, the cold reality is that some people have already passed away and never received any form of compensation due to this inaction.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the matter of accountability.  This is something that survivors and the public want and that UN committees have asked for.  Why are the Church and pharmaceutical companies not being  held accountable?  The Minister is apparently in negotiations with religious orders to contribute to the cost of redress.  This should not be a subject for negotiation.  The Government should be seizing assets.  These orders profited from crimes including forced labour and child trafficking.  We have laws to rightly seize the proceeds of illegality.  If a gang carried out these crimes there would be no hesitation but because it is the Church, Government parties would not dare.  The conduct of these so-called Christian organisations is shameful.  If the religious orders had any credibility they would hand over assets in contrition.  Their hypocrisy is obvious.  Furthermore, the Government is making no effort to hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable.  Never mind any form of legal culpability, we have basically given up on the idea that anyone will ever be prosecuted for these crimes.<br/><br/>It is clear that from its conception this scheme was not designed with the preferences of survivors or human rights standards in mind.  It was shaped by financial concerns and the Government&rsquo;s philosophy of doing just enough to look good and just enough for the headlines.  This Bill intentionally excludes over 20,000 survivors.  It willfully ignores human rights violations and crimes and it ignores the Minister's own consultation and numerous UN human rights bodies.  It is frankly disgraceful and insulting.  It is another stain on how Ireland has treated a group of people who have suffered countless abuses, people who have suffered enough.  The Minister knows it and his colleagues know it.  This is clear from the number of Government speaking slots that no one turns up for.  Many were eager to speak on the eviction ban and energy Bill but where are they today?  There has been just one Government speaker, who criticised much of the Bill.  Last week there were no Government speakers.  They know this is a hollow, offensive scheme but will they vote for it?  I am calling for a vote of conscience on this controversial Bill.  I know many backbenchers are deeply uncomfortable with it.  If the Minister is so confident he is doing the right thing, he should allow a free vote.<br/><br/>Many survivors have spoken out already while others, understandably, are just too tired.  They have been worn down by the State and by successive Governments for years, including this one.  Along with others on the Opposition benches, I will do what I can.  I will be putting forward amendments to address the most egregious aspects of this Bill at every stage.  I have no doubt the Minister will disregard them, just as he has disregarded survivors and human rights experts but at least the will of the people will be presented.People want justice for survivors.  They want a proper scheme that recognises the harm caused.  The Government certainly does not represent Irish society on this.  It will be on the record that at least there were some public representatives who spoke up.  It is not too late.  The decision is the Minister's.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700037#NN00100"><p>We all know that this State has a very long history.  We had a society that was built around not giving adequate powers or protections to women and, beyond that, actually oppressing them.  I accept that a significant number of legacy issues have fallen into the Minister's in-tray.  I assume that others did not want to deal with them.  We are at the point of redress and we all accept and support the need for a redress scheme, particularly for those who spent time in mother and baby homes.  It is fair to say we are dealing with a cohort of people who have been absolutely failed over many years.  Even in latter times we have heard about the testimonies not considered, the leaks and all the other issues which just heap pain upon pain.  The fact is that we are dealing with a huge cohort of people who feel they have been betrayed and left to one side by the State.  The fact is that a considerable number of people - I think it is in or around 24,000, probably more - now definitely feel they are getting absolutely no element of even delayed justice.</p><p>To put this into a general framework, on the back of two motions by Louth county councillors, namely, Sinn F&eacute;in's Joanna Byrne, as well as John Sheridan, Denis Cahalane wrote up a piece about Louth County Council's historic responsibility or involvement in the mother and baby homes.  I will read out some pieces from the report.</p> <blockquote> 	Women from County Louth were placed in Mother and Baby homes throughout the country.  It is impossible to state accurately how many of the mothers and children in homes were from County Louth. ... Information on admission practice is incomplete.  Women would have been referred by clergy, medical and nursing personnel, public officials or family members. </blockquote>  <p>That was done with the women having absolutely no element of power in their grasp.  The report continues: &quot;Many pregnancies arose from incest, statutory rape, or other exploitative situations.&quot;  We have to accept that.  We have to accept that a huge number of women were absolutely powerless.  All did nothing wrong.  Many found themselves in exploitative situations because of the huge power differential that was in society.  The great and the good at best did nothing to improve that set of circumstances.  We are looking to address this.</p><p>It is fair to say that the idea of removing from the scheme those people who were resident for less than six months in these homes just does not wash.  We all accept that these people went through a huge level of pain.  That is before we start talking about the failures by the pharmaceutical companies and the clergy.  The Minister has the power to deliver what is a modicum of justice for these people, who have been too long without it.  We all need him to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700037#NN00200"><p>It is significant that quite a number of Deputies have ignored their speaking slots in respect of such an important topic.  I will leave that at that.</p><p>The Minister said in his speech: &quot;The scheme will recognise the time spent and the harsh conditions, emotional abuse and other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced by people while resident in a mother and baby or county home institution.&quot;  What is missing there is &quot;some people&quot;.  The scheme will recognise some damage experienced in some institutions and will give some money.  That is very important.  Let us look at the context of what we are speaking about.  I am glad I have extra time in my slot to elaborate a little on this.  Let us see where we have come from.</p><p>I think it was in 2012 that Catherine Corless, local human rights activist and historian, started looking into her family tree and began to discover various things.  We are extremely grateful to her.  That is ten years ago if my sums are right.  I will come back to her.</p><p>Prior to that, we had many indications from many different places that something was very wrong.  I come from a city of institutions, Galway city.  The Magdalen laundry was within a stone's throw of my house.  We had the Lenaboy industrial school for girls, and for boys we had St. Joseph's Industrial School - brothers and sisters.  I am aware of that personally: sisters here, brothers there, never to see each other again but within less than a half a mile from each other.  Then, going out to Connemara, we had another industrial school for boys, and in Clifden we had the industrial school for girls.  I have not touched on the mother and baby homes in Tuam and Loughrea.  Galway was a city and a county of institutions, like other counties all over the country.  That was part of the architecture of containment, the phrase used so eloquently by Professor Smith from Boston University, as I understand it.</p><p>The other day I read out a piece in recognition of Ireland's first Constitution.  Now, 100 years later, we are looking back on a century of containment, mostly of women but also of boys and girls and men.  Every institution was full.  For what purpose?  For a so-called morality.  Various people in society functioned as a morality police.  We talk about Iran today.  I have a great understanding of the morality police in Iran because that is what we had in Ireland, done very subtly, when it came to women.  We knew from 1997's <i>Banished Babies</i>, we knew from the work of Mary Raftery and we knew from so many people.  Most of all, the Departments, not the Minister personally, knew because the Departments have the key to all the data that are there that tell the story.</p><p>Into this, then, came Catherine Corless, courageous, determined, fearless.  She went forward and identified the inappropriate burials of 798 children in Tuam.  Let us look at what she faced.  She tried and she tried and she tried.  The response from the nuns, through Terry Prone, I have read out before.  She talked about the letter she got.  Let me be specific.  Catherine Corless published her article, &quot;The Home&quot;, in <i>Journal of the Old Tuam Society</i>in 2012.  It detailed the very poor conditions in the institutions and so on.  Not much attention was paid to that article.  Then she went forward and, between 2011 and 2013, at her own expense, got 798 death records.  Denise McNamara, in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>, published an article on 13 February 2014 titled &quot;Campaign to recognise 800 dead Tuam babies&quot;, which begins: &quot;Were it not for the tenacity of a housewife who has spent ten years researching her own family tree, the names of 798 children buried in an unmarked grave ... would be lost for eternity.&quot;  Then we had the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>'s story about a mass septic tank grave containing up to 800 babies and so on.  What was the response of the nuns at that point?  Terry Prone said on behalf of the Bon Secours Sisters to a person who was making a documentary:</p> <blockquote> 	Your letter was sent on to me by the Provincial of the Irish Bon Secours congregation with instructions that I should help you.  I'm not sure how I can.  Let me explain.  When the &quot;O My God - mass grave in West of Ireland&quot; broke in an English-owned paper (the Mail) it surprised the hell out of everybody, not least the Sisters of Bon Secours in Ireland, none of whom had ever worked in Tuam and most of whom had never heard of it. </blockquote>  <p>I ask the House to listen to what followed:</p> <blockquote> 	If you come here, you'll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried, and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying &quot;Yeah, a few bones were found - but this was an area where Famine victims were buried.&quot; </blockquote>  <p>I read that out to set the scene of what Catherine Corless and the survivors were facing at that point.</p><p>Then, of course, we had international attention.  Eventually, we got Enda Kenny and the commission of inquiry was set up in February 2015.  It was set up with limited terms of reference.  It was established on 20 February.  Interestingly, there were then seven interim reports, one of which was not published until the final report was published but with no explanation ever as to why it was not published.  That was interesting and significant as well.  Then we had the report submitted to the Minister on 30 October 2020 but which did not see the light of day.  Then it was published on 12 January with extensive coverage in a Sunday paper; a leak.  Part of that leak included comments from the Taoiseach.</p> <p>Can you imagine that, particularly when the need for trust was of the essence?  No survivor had a copy.  We then had a webinar and were repeatedly told they had copies, but there were no copies.  They were to download a 3,000-page document.  Then there was to be a report into the leak but this never came to fruition.  Different Deputies asked questions and were told that like water, the leak had broadened out.  We got all of the reports.<br/><br/>The fifth interim report is particularly significant.  You come back to the commission of investigation where the caveat was put in respect of the survivors' testimony to the effect that it was contaminated.  They were the 550 courageous people who came forward.  There was a caveat from the three wise people of the commission of investigation telling us to beware because the evidence might be contaminated.  On page 8 of the fifth interim report, it is stated:</p><blockquote>	The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary who owned and ran these institutions provided the Commission with an affidavit about burials generally and specifically about the Castlepollard and Sean Ross child burials but very little evidence was provided to support the statements in it.  The affidavit was, in many respects, speculative, inaccurate and misleading. </blockquote> <p>This is repeated on page 22.  That is the commission telling us that the affidavit was speculative, inaccurate and misleading.  I did not see that repeated anywhere in the final report.  The Minister might correct me if it was.  The commission raises the issue of Tuam and Bessborough, which distinguish themselves by having no records of burials.  The commission does rise to pose the question.  The more difficult question to answer is why the children were buried in such an inappropriate manner.  The commission goes through whether chambers were used for sewage and feels obliged to clarify that there were not.  However, it did not highlight the fact that the bodies were wrapped and placed in sewage chambers.  The commission points out that a concrete lid had to be lifted so that the bodies of those babies could be put down.<br/><br/>I do not know if the Minister has read these reports but they are there in black and white.  The fifth interim report contains the phrase &quot;speculative, inaccurate and misleading&quot;.  There is no caveat in the final report with regard to their evidence.  Instead, a premium is put on the accuracy of their evidence.<br/><br/>There is also a little on the sale of bodies to the medical department in Galway.  The report gives the price for which the bodies were sold and how the porters sold them and the doctors received them.  This matter is worth looking at.  However, I will stay focused on what we are doing today.  The Minister tells us this involves human rights.  This has nothing to do with human rights.  This has to do with a cold, calculated decision about costs.  That is what this is about.<br/><br/>I am not going to waste my time saying that the Minister has done a good job and that I believe in his bona fides because at this point.  A very faulty Bill is before us and it is concerned with cost containment instead of justice.  I find it insulting to be told that it is based on human rights principles.<br/><br/>This is probably my last time to have such time to talk about this matter.  My comments will be blunt - not on my behalf but on behalf of Catherine Corless and all the brave people who have tried to educate Deputies, taken cases to court and succeeded in getting an appendix to the report of the commission of investigation setting out that they had to go to court.  There were more courageous women in the background waiting to see it.  There was then a settlement, which is what is in the library.  Very courageous people came forward such as Clann and M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright and her colleagues.  I could name them all.  Catriona Crowe is another.  All of them helped to educate Deputies, as well as us operating on the basis of our own gut feeling and work to come forward to say that this is the time to get it right and make language mean something because language has meant nothing.  There was no forced incarceration, there were no illegal adoptions and there was no evidence of the mothers' consent not being given.  This is what is being said.  We listened to 550 people and we did not take on board what they said.<br/><br/>In addition to the leak, we had the debacle regarding the recordings.  The Minister can shake his head or he can listen and learn like we all can.  I am not an expert, but I am certainly an expert having read the material and made myself aware of what we are being told and what people have suffered.  I would say I am an expert on that at this point - only on that part.  I am not an expert on everything else.  We had the leak and then the debacle over the recorded material that was not recorded.<br/><br/>We now have this Bill and we leave out how many people.  We put the emphasis on the inclusion of approximately 34,000 people with 19,000 qualifying for an enhanced medical card for which, I am sure, they should be very grateful really.  The number of people who spent longer than six months is 14,507.  The number of people who spent less than six months is 24,149 so we have excluded the vast majority of children who were in mother and baby homes on spurious grounds that they were <i>tabula rasa</i>, nothing affected them and at the end of six months, they were still <i>tabula rasa</i>.  The Minister has done this despite the fact that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has set out that this is wrong along with the ICCL and 34 clinicians working in the area of childhood trauma.  It is simply not based on scientific evidence.  It is not based on our experience as mothers and fathers.  The Minister has excluded all of those children.  In another speech, he talked about how he cannot monetise the harm done.  That is exactly what he has done.  That is exactly what he is standing over - the monetisation of suffering in the narrowest way possible.<br/><br/>The Minister also excluded children who were boarded out.  We are going to ignore them as well even though the interdepartmental group looked at the number, which was 4,757.  All of these numbers are very specific and are easy to deal with in terms of a proper, just and fair redress scheme based on human rights.  The Minister has ignored people who were illegally adopted.  Does he remember the Marion Reynolds report that was never discussed in the D&aacute;il?  Ms Reynolds asked for her name to be taken off that report.  If I am wrong, and as I have done repeatedly, I ask the Minister to correct me.  I understand that the author asked for her name to be removed from the report because of changes made by the Minister and Department.  That report was a scoping exercise to identify the extent of illegal adoptions.  It has never been dealt with.<br/><br/>There is no redress for systematic racism despite UN human rights experts highlighting this in correspondence.  The Minister knows this - as recently as 23 September 2022.  It is discriminatory.  It does not include all relevant institutions.  Remember that the commission of investigation chose a sample number of county homes and the major mother and baby homes.  Not all homes were chosen.  The Minister is proceeding with that, although there is the option to include.  He is completely ignoring the bonding.  I will refer to an email that I will not read out, although I have been given permission.  Of three siblings, two were adopted at nine months so they will come under the scheme while a third sister who was born a few years later and spent less than nine months in an institution will not.  Imagine that family trying to explain this to each other.  The two who were adopted at nine months will come under the scheme while the third sister, who got out before six months, will not.<br/><br/>On work-related payments, those involved did not work.  It was forced labour.  The Minister knows that and I know it.  Based on all the submissions from human rights groups and survivors' groups and organisations, let us for the first time place human rights at the heart of this legislation.  They asked for four basic principles of human rights to be enshrined in order that the redress will be in context.  I looked at the Title.  It does not enshrine the basic principles of human rights, which I do not have time to go into but which have already been read out by Deputy Sherlock with regard to the ICCL.<br/><br/>Why am I saying all of this?  In 2003, the Residential Institutions Redress Board was set up.  There was a waiver, and anyone who disclosed information about an award - I include myself in this regard because I was a barrister at the time - was considered to have committed an offence.  That criminal offence is still in place.</p> <p>Fast forward then to 2013 and the Magdalene redress scheme.  Let us remember the Ombudsman's report in this regard, and that we should learn from it.  This is basically what he said.  He also referred to the maladministration.  Are these words remembered?  He stated, &quot;In order to ensure that any future restorative justice or redress schemes benefit from the learning from the operation of this and other schemes&quot; there must be guidance.  Those documents must be open, accountable and exist.  Nothing has been learned.<br/><br/>I was involved with regard to the redress scheme in 2003.  Moving forward, there was the Magdalene redress scheme in 2013.  This current scheme will probably become operational in 2023.  Something like this, therefore, has occurred every ten years in the span of three decades.  I am referring to the 30 years that I am taking out of a span of 100 years.  What have we learned?  We are still persisting with the waiver.  I pay tribute to the Minister for removing the silence regarding the amount of money the people concerned are going to get.  This is progress.  Can you imagine, though, that it has taken us some 20 years to take this provision out.  The waiver is still being persisted with despite the UN Committee Against Torture having found that the waivers imposed upon Elizabeth Coppin in the context of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and Magdalen<i>ex gratia</i>restorative schemes were unenforceable.  The UN committee affirmed the requirements incumbent on the State, but I do not have time to go into detail.  It is worth looking at that judgment in the context of the waiver being retained.  Deputies have received numerous emails on this matter.  One asked why St. Muras Nursery, Fahan, Lifford, was not included in the scheme.  I am sure we are going to get many more queries.  The aspect of boarding out has been ignored, as I said, as has the waiver.<br/><br/>Having learned nothing from Caranua, and that debacle and the misnaming of it as a &quot;new friend&quot;, a new body is being set up.  Another office is being set up within the Minister's office.  It will not be independent.  We have no idea as to how applications will be made.  Will it be an oral affidavit or a story?  There will be a review, which I welcome.  It will be carried out by the deciding officer.  Then there will the be an appeal.  Once this is heard, and just to ensure that the person concerned has no sense of the independence of the process, the deciding officer gets to tell the person the result of the appeal.  Can you imagine that in terms of a lack of insight?<br/><br/>We have also had no update on the negotiations with the religious orders or those involving the pharmaceutical companies.  The legal aid being provided is minimal in the context of two aspects, namely, the waiver and the affidavit.  The affidavit will arise where the chief deciding officer is unhappy with the documentation and requests an affidavit.  Another question on the documentation concerns the chief deciding officer having access to the archives to make a decision.  When he gets those documents, will they be made available to the applicants?  I ask this because it would be essential if justice were to be done.<br/><br/>Turning to the matter of outstanding correspondence with the Department, for a year to two I have been requesting for all the documentation that exists between the Government, the Department and the commission of investigation.  I tried to work with the Department to narrow down the scope, but I still have received no reply.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700039#PP00700"><p>I start with a reminder that the crimes committed by the State and church against mothers and children were crimes from which we, as a society, must learn.  This is not just the case in Ireland but globally.  Given the long struggle here involving the victims of the various church and State institutions that persecuted, in particular, women and children and, more specifically, working class women and children, as well as minorities, Travellers, children of mixed race and so on, it is important to see the relevance of this experience to current events in the world.</p>  <p>  In discussing the crimes the church and the State committed against women and children in the aftermath of the Irish revolution, it would be wrong not to mention the crimes being committed against women in Iran by the authorities there.  A systematic regime of denying women self-determination and rights to their bodily autonomy and freedom resulted in the murder of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, some 40 days ago because she refused to abide by the dress code of the moral police.  That is just like how we had our moral police in this country.  We thought it was okay to incarcerate women because they did not abide by certain religious rules and to stigmatise them and their children.  We still see this happening today worldwide.  This is not a situation exclusive to Iran by any means.  It is happening in Iran, though, and we are seeing a heroic struggle being undertaken by people across that country, men and women, from different ethnic backgrounds, who are coming out in protest against the brutal treatment of women who just deserve the right to be themselves and to determine who they are.  It is important to say this now because there is such a strong parallel between the history of Iran and that of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Iran, quite rightly, demands to assert its right to self-determination against the manipulation of Western powers.  For many years, those powers tried to control that state and region and install puppet regimes.  It was very similar to the way Ireland was subject to the British Empire.  Iran had a revolution in 1979, just like we had a revolution.  It overthrew the Shah and declared self-determination.  This self-determination, however, is now being denied to women in Iran.  This strongly parallels what happened after the Irish revolution.  It was a revolution of great promise to liberate the Irish people from an empire but that then incarcerated women and children for decades.  They were treated as slaves and second-class citizens.</p>  <p>  It is outrageous that the Iranian regime is doing this.  As much as I absolutely assert the right of people in the Middle East, in Iran and elsewhere, to stand up against Western manipulation in the region and the hypocrisy and double standards of some of those who wish to condemn them for various things, nonetheless what the Iranian state is doing is shameful.  It should desist and it should allow women and everybody in Iran the self-determination that people are demanding and taking to the streets for.  I feel it is important to say this and to point to these parallels.  I say this in the hope that the Iranian authorities may be listening and may come to understand that if self-determination is not self-determination in every respect, then what we end up with is what we have seen happen in this State.  This happened even after we were supposedly liberated from empires.</p>  <p>  I also draw Deputies' attention to the fact that I received a message from the Adoption Rights Alliance.  This point may have been referred to already in the debate, but I was not here earlier because I had to visit someone in hospital.  The Government promised to get people's personal information to them within 30 days.  the Adoption Rights Alliance is hearing reports, from the Adoption Authority of Ireland, at least, but I am not sure what the situation is with Tusla, that this is not going to happen.  The Adoption Rights Alliance is hearing that this will not happen.  It may instead be more like a 90-day period, and into January.</p> <p>It would be interesting for the Minister to comment if he is aware of this.  Certainly, the message I have received is of grave disappointment people are feeling after the long wait to get to this point to the effect that there are now apparently significant delays in their getting the information - their personal information, histories, etc. - that they have requested.  I ask the Minister to respond and to do whatever is necessary to remedy that situation so that the promise that people would get that information is delivered upon.<br/><br/>On the substance of the Bill, no doubt these are points that others have made.  I echo, I suspect, what others have said.<br/><br/>The Minister will be well aware of the critiques that are coming from survivors' organisations, the ICCL, the Association of Mixed Race Irish and generally from survivors of the mother and baby home institutions.  There are quite a few problems with this.  Although we are glad to be here at some level, the fact that we are here is because of the relentless, brave, heroic campaigning of survivors who were let down so badly by the church and State.  Ignored for so long, fighting on with determination, bravery and heroism, they finally forced the State to acknowledge the wrong that has been done to so many people by the church and State and insisted that they get acknowledgement, apology and genuine redress.<br/><br/>In that context, it is disappointing that the Minister has not responded to the points that were made about the completely arbitrary and unjustified basis for the 180 days' cut-off point for being in institutions.  I studied psychology, among other things, when I was in college.  One of the first things one does when one studies psychology is that one learns about children.  One learns about child psychology.  To be honest, while there are many schools of thought in psychology and psychoanalysis, there is absolutely no dispute among people who study the development of human psychology that the earliest minutes, hours and days of a child's life shape that child.  The trauma of being separated, in effect, by force, by the perverted morality that dominated the State and the thought children should be separated from mothers if those mothers did not abide by certain religious ideas and a certain twisted notion of religious morality, had an effect on those children and those mothers from the second it happened.  It will shape the psychology of children and mothers.  For many, the damage and the trauma that is done in those first hours, days and weeks will never leave them.  The idea that one can have an arbitrary cut-off where, for 179 days, there is - what was the ludicrous phrase Deputy Catherine Connolly referred to - a <i>tabula rasa</i>is nonsense.  That there would be a clean slate up until 180 days where one is not affected but that on day 181, one is a legitimate case that deserves redress is utterly preposterous.  It subverts the integrity of the apology of the State.  It subverts and undoes the integrity of the acknowledgement the State has supposedly done to suggest that it can be valued in that way.  It is nonsense that, for if a person was in an institution for 179 days, no harm was really done but that on day 180 the harm was done.  After that, we are on an escalating scale.  Even at this stage, the Minister should change that and respond to what is self-evidently the case.  The amount of time someone may have spent in an institution is not the key factor.  It is the crime that was done to all in those situations and how that impacted on people and gave rise to the trauma they suffered as a result of forced separation, incarceration, stigmatisation and all that goes with it.  I am well aware, as somebody who is an adoptee, that there are good outcomes and there are bad outcomes.  Everybody is affected, but some are affected in different and more damaging ways.  That is not something that one can correlate in some sort of mechanical way according to the number of days one spent in an institution and, quite frankly, it is insulting to suggest that one can.<br/><br/>It is also, as has been said, a matter of sadness that the Minister has not acknowledged the pain and anger that survivors - mothers and children who went through the mother and baby home regime - feel at the mother and baby home report which informs this and the failure to fully give weight to and acknowledge the testimonies of the survivors themselves.  As the ICCL points out, the Minister promised a review.  That review has not happened.  From day one, I described that report here in the D&aacute;il as a whitewash.  I still believe that to be the case.  It was a whitewash because to downgrade the direct testimony of the survivors in the way that it did, and to have an insulting summary, as was the case, which uses phrases such as &quot;no evidence&quot;, &quot;They were not 'incarcerated' in the strict meaning of the word ...&quot;, that certain evidence was &quot;the product of a creative writing class.&quot;, etc., is completely outrageous.  It is insulting and compounded the pain and the trauma that people felt.  That review should have happened.  That review and the rejection of that sort of summarisation of the experience of all those who went through the mother and baby home scheme should have been the precondition for establishing the redress Bill.<br/><br/>Another issue I am sure has been pointed out to the Minister already is that there is no specific compensation for illegal adoptions, forced labour, unlawful vaccine trials, abuse as adopted child or death, or specific provision for discrimination where systematic racism was at work.  As the Minister will be aware, this issue was highlighted by many, including the UN special rapporteurs.  The fact that the Bill provides payment in terms of work-related payment rather than acknowledging that it was forced labour - in effect, slavery - of the women who were incarcerated, is unacceptable.<br/><br/>I note that the issue of absences from the institution are not provided for where there were, almost certainly, definitely good reasons, as the ICCL pointed out, in some cases for people escaping from these institutions.  However, the period for which they might have escaped is not accounted for in the context of their residency in the institution.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the Bill referred to the fact that there would be an enhanced medical card.  That has been replaced by health services without charge but only for people who were resident for 180 days.  The choice of 180 days is completely arbitrary.  For those survivors outside of Ireland, the medical compensation is only &euro;3,000.</p> <p>This is a completely arbitrary and totally inadequate figure.  They do not get a commitment for all of the health services they need to be provided, not without charge.  The Bill also does not provide specifically for trauma-informed counselling and therapies, as survivors have called for.  The provisions of the Bill rule out the possibility of people availing of the scheme if they have already taken legal action and got a court settlement in respect of the period in the institution the Bill covers.  There was a downgrading of the requirement for the chief deciding officer with regard to advertising the fact of the redress scheme.  In particular, the Bill does not expressly require advertising abroad.  The general scheme of the Bill did provide for this.</p> <p> I am sure the Minister has probably read a lot of these so I do not need to rehearse them all.  Certainly, judging from the communications I receive, many people feel a lot needs to change and be amended in the Bill to address the concerns.  The worst thing of all is the arbitrary 180 days.  It is an insult.  It needs to be changed.  The dismissal by the mother and baby institutions report in its summary of the testimonies of survivors is a pretty deep insult.  People now feel the inadequacies in the Bill show a failure, despite apologies, to take on board the trauma, suffering and hurt people experienced at the hands of this brutal regime that did so much wrong to so many women and children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700041#RR00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I want to reference correspondence I have received from constituents regarding correspondence from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties on the legislation.  It has raised the following three particular points.  The scheme should be expanded to all survivors and the six month threshold needs to be looked at; the legal waiver, criticised by the UN which has specifically asked for its removal, should be removed; and the compensation available should be increased.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the third of these, that the compensation should be increased, with regard to provisions that are missing from the Bill.  These are with regard to the vaccine trials and the failure to be accountable of GlaxoSmithKline, GSK, the corporate successor to Wellcome which carried out many of these vaccine trials in mother and baby homes throughout the country.  GSK, the successor to those responsible for carrying out the vaccine trials on toddlers in our mother and baby homes, must stand up and be held accountable.  At this stage we will not get answers but we must have acknowledgement from GSK that what was done was completely unethical and, as a result, at the very least it should and must contribute to this redress scheme.</p>  <p>  At least 13 vaccine trials were carried out on more than 43,000 children according to the commission of investigation.  More than 1,000 of these children were in the institutions concerned.  Survivors who were literally used as human guinea pigs in vaccine trials in the mother and baby homes must receive an apology from GSK and must have this acknowledged by the company.  It should make an offer of compensation for practices that would not have been tolerated in the United Kingdom where the company was based at the time.</p>  <p>  When the mother and baby homes commission of investigation reviewed the medical records available to it - and I repeat, the records that were available to it - it concluded there was no evidence of injury to the children involved in the vaccine trials.  This conclusion was simplistic.  These children were treated as little more than human pincushions by the companies and clinicians involved due to the large number of injections they received and blood samples taken.  How can any of us be sure there was no delayed immunological impact from these formulations?  This is particularly the case if no guardian was able to tell a subsequent doctor treating the children that they had previously received an experimental vaccine formulation.  The children as adults would not be able to inform their treating doctors they were involved in an experimental trial.  Each of these children should have been contacted and provided with their medical records.  They should be contacted now.  These records, combined with their subsequent medical history, should be independently reviewed and a full and transparent report published on the conclusion of these assessments.  Only then can we honestly claim there is no evidence of injury to the children involved in these vaccine trials.  At a very minimum this must now happen.  This must be provided for in the legislation.  The full cost must be borne by GSK.</p>  <p>  The mother and baby homes commission of investigation report flagged the issue of consent and the failure to secure it.  Why is the issue of consent so important?  It is primarily because each and every one of us has a basic human right to our own bodily integrity.  There is a need for informed consent in advance of any medical procedure or medical trial.  While the particular processes and procedures were far looser in terms of the definition of medical consent in the era of these trials, the basic fact is consent was not sought despite it being a legal and regulatory requirement at the time.</p>  <p>  Without engaging with the parents or guardians of the children, a clinician could not have deemed them to be suitable for inclusion in any trial.  For example, paragraph 34.121 of the commission's report on the 1968 to 1969 measles vaccine trial states the trial should have excluded children with a personal history of convulsions or allergy, asthma or eczema or strong family history of same.  Without consent, how could any of the clinicians have ascertained this in respect of those children in the mother and baby homes?  Even at that time, consent was a standard procedure for vaccinations outside of clinical trials, at least in some of the mother and baby homes.  For example, paragraph 34.71 states the Dunboyne institute records contain completed written consent forms relating to instances where infants resident there were presented for immunisation at the public health clinic.  These consent forms were signed by either the mother or the matron.  There were no consent forms available for the clinical trials.</p>  <p>  It is also clear from the commission's report that the Department of Health itself had serious problems with the use of children in these homes for clinical trials.  There were concerns raised in the UK.</p> <p>However, paragraph 34.92 of the report states:</p><blockquote>	A Department of Health document dated 30 September 1963 dealing with this application noted that, in April 1962, Professor Meenan had asked to field-trial an Oral Polio Vaccine in Pelletstown.  In that instance, it was noted that the Department of Health had no objection to the trial itself but raised concerns regarding the selection of Pelletstown: 'While the procedure proposed appeared to be a safe one, the selection of ... [a] group to participate was open to objection and approval was not given on that occasion.' </blockquote> <p>The Department did not want clinical trials carried out on children in homes.  However, whether the Department gave consent or not did not seem to make any difference to the clinicians involved.  Indeed, paragraph 34.163 notes that permission was sought for a field trial using an oral polio vaccine on the children in Pelletstown, which was refused.  The report goes on to state that the commission took the view that there was a high probability that Pelletstown was in fact used in the trial despite the refusal of the Department of Health.<br/><br/>GlaxoSmithKline has many questions to answer.  Why did the scientific publications on the UK and Nigerian trials specifically refer to consent, yet these references were conveniently left out of the same publications on the trials based on Irish children?  Why was Ireland seen as a soft option for trials involving children in institutions?  Clearly, such trials could not take place in the UK, and that was also the case in Ireland, based on the regulatory and legal systems in place at that time.  However, because of the lack of enforcement in Ireland, GSK was happy to proceed despite knowing there was no consent, as reflected in peer-reviewed academic journals that had to have secured authorisation from GSK's predecessors before publication.<br/><br/>It is also important to highlight that these scientific publications were peer reviewed in advance of publication.  In the <i>British Medical Journal</i>and <i>The Lancet</i>, the academic publications of the British trials included an outline of the consent and confirmation that consent was obtained in line with law and ethical standards.  However, this was not the case, as I have said, in the publication of the Irish trials.  Why was this not set as a precondition of publication, when it should have been?  If it had been, and if the academics were told that they must provide consent, maybe these children would not have been exploited and those institutions would not have been used again and again for trials.  This culture of cover up went from the academic journals right up to the highest echelons in the State.  The attitude was one of brushing the problem under the carpet and it would go away.<br/><br/>Paragraph 34.153 in the commission's report states that it had been flagged to the Department of Health in 1968 that Professor Meenan had conducted vaccine trials without the authorisation of the then Minister, yet nothing was done.  When it comes to mother and baby homes, it was not just the State but reputable drug companies, academics and even academic journals such as the <i>British Medical Journal</i>and <i>The Lancet</i>that were all prepared to turn a blind eye to the basic human rights of these children, purely because they were in institutions in Ireland that were not properly regulated and monitored by the State.  There was a blatant policy of just ignoring consent where it could not be obtained.<br/><br/>Paragraph 34.122 of the commission's report states, &quot;On 5 September 1968, Dr Coffey told Dr Burland [from Glaxo Laboratories] that she had come up against &lsquo;the usual complications&rsquo; while trying to arrange to field-trial Glaxo&rsquo;s measles vaccine in Dublin.&quot;  The response from Glaxo was extremely interesting.  According to the report, &quot;Dr Burland advised Dr Coffey to liaise with Dr Hillery as 'she may be able to suggest a way in which you could overcome the problems you have encountered'.&quot;  In other words, you could get around the law of the land and the refusal of the Department of Health to sanction this trial.  There was a clear culture within the company, which has morphed into GSK, to circumvent the consent process.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that there was a clear benefit not just to GSK but also to the clinicians who participated in those trials.  The commission's report refers to direct financial payments.  At the very least, funding was provided to research facilities that would assist the researchers in securing scientific publications.  This practice, along with the scientific publication of the trials, was facilitated by ignoring basic ethical consent in vaccine trials.  All these scientific publications, those directly involved in the trials and those where funding was provided indirectly and directly by the predecessors of GSK, ensured the academics had scientific publications to their name, which secured them promotions and financial benefits as a result, as well as increasing their status within the scientific community.  This was also of benefit to the universities involved, namely University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin.  They benefited indirectly by using these vulnerable children as guinea pigs without consent.<br/><br/>GlaxoSmithKline must clarify why these experimental vaccine formulations were not placed on the market on a commercial basis.  Was it because they were not effective at preventing the diseases they were supposed to prevent?  If that was the case, it would have impacted on the subsequent immunity of the children involved in these studies.  Were the children outside of homes, either in Ireland or the UK, subjected to the same battery of needles that the children in the homes were subjected to?  There was multiple administrations of vaccine doses and multiple blood sampling procedures.  I doubt very much that any child outside of these institutions, either in Ireland or the United Kingdom, was forced into being used as a human pincushion on a regular basis to the benefit of the clinicians, institutions and GSK.  That company benefited financially from this research.  It was happy to conduct those trials, from which they benefited, without consent.  Now, it must live up to its responsibilities to these children and their families.</p></speech>

In the time available to me, I will try to address some of their queries, many of which I know we will discuss on Committee and Report Stages.</p> <p>I would like to take the opportunity to set this Bill in the context of the Government's action plan and all that Government is doing in response to the needs of former residents and the legacy of these institutions.</p> <p> Unfortunately, Deputy Connolly is not present.  She spoke with huge knowledge, as she always does, as well as justifiable and real anger, about the history of the institutions at the time and the response of the State to these institutions.  In terms of the issues she highlighted, I need to speak to how the State is seeking to respond to the issues she and many others raised.  That response is being undertaken in the context of the action plan.</p> <p> Deputy Connolly spoke about Tuam and the attempt to silence the work done by Catherine Corless.  I know from my visit to Tuam and engagement with Tuam relatives that the core ask has always been to excavate the site and allow them to rebury their relatives with dignity.  That is what the State is seeking to achieve in terms of the Bill and the work that has already been done to begin to establish the agency in Tuam.  Work will begin on the site in the New Year.</p> <p> Deputy Connolly said I or the Government had totally ignored the issue of illegal birth registrations.  I would like to put on the record that when I came into office, I had before me an audit of what had, at that point, been potential illegal birth registrations.  I published the audit.  One of the conclusions of the audit was that further research would not deliver significant additional information.  I was not happy with that as a conclusion.  That is why I asked the special rapporteur on child protection to undertake a further piece of work on the issue of illegal birth registrations.  He did so and gave me the report.  A significant number of his recommendations are contained in the Birth and Information and Tracing Act in terms of how we provide practical supports for people who find that their births were illegally registered.</p> <p> We included a provision in the Birth Information and Tracing Act that will allow Tusla to do further specialised tracing where there are files.  We know there are files with suspicious markers, and Tusla now has statutory permission to undertake further work to discover whether more illegal birth registrations have taken place.  It was important that the birth information and tracing legislation responded to the immediate needs of the 153 people identified as having been subject to illegal birth registrations in St. Patrick's Guild.  It also allows for a process to examine the issue of illegal birth information further.</p> <p> A number of Deputies, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, discussed the issue of access to information.  I want to take us back to the first piece of legislation I dealt with in this area, the database legislation.  At the time, I was accused of sealing records.  I want to talk about what we did.  We preserved a database that the commission of investigation developed.  It believed it had to redact that to a point where it would be destroyed.  I did not want it to be destroyed, so I brought forward legislation to protect it.  The database will be used in this Bill to assist survivors.  Rather than survivors having to find some information to show they were in an institution for a certain period of time, the database will prove that people were in an institution for a certain period of time.  It removes any burden of proof on survivors.</p> <p> The database is also being used by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI.  Under the Birth Information and Tracing Act we introduced recently, 4,600 people have already sought their information.  In terms of the time it will take for the information to be released, I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We provided for a 30-day initial period.  If a file is complex, the case can take up to 90 days.  A significant number of applications have come in initially, which is a good thing.</p> <p> The database the House voted to preserve in the initial debate in October and November 2020 has already been used by my Department to give more than 700 people immediate access to their files and the commission of investigation report.  During the debate on that legislation, many people spoke about their frustration, on behalf of people who gave testimony before the commission, that they could not get the information.  Seven hundred people have already received information because of a vote in the House.</p> <p> That comes back to one of the central issues that has dominated this debate, which is whether it is mother and baby institutions or other institutions and the wider issue of adoption, namely, the lack of access to information.  That is why earlier this year the House voted finally to enshrine a statutory right of access to information to birth certificates, early life and medical information and any items a parent left for people under the Birth Information and Tracing Act.  After 20 years of successive governments trying to legislate on this issue, we have finally achieved a statutory right to information.  That was a key element of the Government's response in terms of the action plan.</p> <p> We have to understand and properly reflect the history of what happened in these institutions.  That was something I was very conscious of and something that was raised with me early in my tenure.  That is why, under the action plan, we are bringing forward the national records and memorial centre.  The site in Sean McDermott Street was under a cloud of controversy for years and was threatened with being turned into a boutique hotel.  It has been transferred from Dublin City Council to the Office of Public Works so that we can begin the process of developing a national records and memorial centre where researchers and individual survivors and their families will have access to records and there will be an appropriate historical depiction of what happened in all institutions, which can act as a site of conscience.</p> <p> When I read about it in the action plan, the work on appropriate terminology did not mean so much to me.  It was only when we debated the Birth Information and Tracing Act and had a discussion on whether a mother should be referred to as a mother or a birth mother that I understood the difference it made to so many women.  I had always used the term "birth mother", but it was taken as deeply insulting to a certain number of mothers.  On foot of that, we made those changes.  That is why that research, carried out under the action plan, is so important.</p> <p> The Bill is part of the State's response.  As I have said, the concept of redress means different things to different survivors.  Different survivors have different priorities.  For some, payments are important.  For others, access to health support is important.  For some, what is crucial is the reburial of their family members and for others it is access to information.  What the State and Government are trying to do is advance all of these issues rapidly.  When the action plan was published 18 months ago and we look at what has been achieved, there has been significant progress.  I recognise so much more needs to be undertaken.</p> <p> In terms of some of the specific points, many Deputies raised the issue of engagement with religious orders.  The commission made extremely significant findings in terms of the culpability of the State and religious orders.  I have always believed, and have said publicly, that if the religious orders' apologies are to have any meaning, they have to be combined with some real and tangible actions.  That is what I have said to the orders.  I have met seven of the orders and heads of the Church of Ireland.  Negotiations are ongoing.  I do not have date for when they will end, but negotiations are ongoing and are being pursued.  I have always been clear that the need for time and to provide former residents with redress should not be delayed according to the outcome of those negotiations.  The negotiations will go on and we will provide redress under the scheme.</p> <p> Deputy Naughten spoke with great passion and power about the issue of the culpability of pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>I met with GSK.  I put to it the findings of the report in terms of vaccine trials.  I asked it to consider its response, which falls far short.  I know it provided information to people who believe they were subject to trials but that is not an adequate response given their significance - I know Deputy Naughten campaigned on this long before I was in this House - in the context of the lack of informed consent.</p> <p> Ten minutes is not enough to deal with the many significant and important issues that Deputies have raised.  I ask that the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach indulge me for 30 seconds because Deputy Funchion raised a very important point about certain solicitor firms writing to survivors to ask them to sign up and pay for legal advice.  We are aware of that.  There is no need for any survivors seeking to use this scheme to take legal advice because the scheme is not being done in an adversarial matter.  The State can provide them with legal advice in two stages.  We will make that point clear in our communications with survivors, especially in the bulletin we send out to the email list, that they should not feel pressured to sign up to a solicitor firm.</p> <p> I look forward to dealing with many of the other issues on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Energy security and the current energy crisis are having a significant impact on people's day-to-day lives.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has caused a humanitarian catastrophe and displaced millions of Ukrainian citizens.  Even before the invasion began, Russia had been reducing its gas supplies to Europe.  The invasion has triggered a decision by the European Union to phase out its dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports which has resulted in unprecedented action across the EU.  Separate to the war in Ukraine, there are challenges to the security of electricity supplies in Ireland.  Concerns over such risks have largely arisen due to the non-delivery of previously-contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of some existing plants.</p>  <p>  I will first speak to the actions we are taking at a European level before turning to national developments.  We are working closely with our European colleagues on EU legislative action to address the issues raised by the current energy crisis.  The immediate response from Europe was to reduce dramatically the import of fossil fuels from Russia through sanctions.  As of today, we are not importing coal and we are importing very limited oil and some natural gas.  In parallel with reducing our reliance on Russian fossil fuels, we have introduced three urgent Council regulations to address the supply-demand imbalance by storing gas for the winter ahead; reducing gas and electricity demand and avoiding excessive windfall profits from energy companies.</p>  <p>  The gas storage regulation agreed in June of this year requires that underground gas storage facilities in member states must be filled to at least 80% of their capacity before the winter of 2022-23.  These gas storage facilities must be filled to 90% of their capacity before the following winter periods.  Gas storage in Europe is now almost full ahead of schedule and this leaves us in a much better place for the winter that is coming.</p>  <p>  Reducing our gas demand is an important tenet of our response to the current energy security situation.  The EU's gas demand regulation agreed this August asks member states to reduce gas demand voluntarily by 15% during the winter period.  There is also a mechanism to trigger a mandatory demand reduction target of 15%.  However, this does not apply to Ireland as we are not directly connected to another EU member state.  The energy security emergency group chaired by my Department is finalising our voluntary gas demand reduction plans.</p>  <p>  Energy prices had reached such a high level that it was necessary for the EU to introduce emergency interventions to address them.  Emergency interventions include a temporary solidarity contribution based on taxable profits for fossil fuel production and oil refining, a cap on market revenues for specific technologies in the electricity sector which have not seen significant increases in costs which includes wind and solar and a voluntary 10% electricity demand reduction over the winter with a 5% reduction obligation over peak hours, which are generally between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. in Ireland.  This regulation will apply from 1 December 2022 and my Department is working on its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 October to engage in working collectively on Europe's response to the energy crisis.  The focus of the meeting was on wholesale gas prices and decisions were made on a number of topics.  The Council has asked the Commission to propose measures in a number of key areas.</p>  <p>  First is the voluntary joint purchasing of gas.  Second is a new complementary gas-price benchmark that more accurately reflects conditions on the gas market.  Third is a temporary dynamic price corridor on natural gas transactions on the main European gas exchange, the title transfer facility, TTF.  Fourth is a temporary EU framework to cap the price of gas in electricity generation while preventing increases in gas consumption.  Fifth is the fast-tracking of the simplification of permitting procedures in order to accelerate the roll-out of renewables and grids and sixth is increased efforts to save energy.</p>  <p>  More detailed work is now urgently needed on these topics and Ireland is working closely with its EU counterparts on their development.  As Ireland secures its gas mainly from the UK, some of these measures may not immediately have an impact on us.  However, they are intended to stabilise wholesale gas prices generally, which is in all of our interests.</p>  <p>  I will turn to a national perspective on energy security.  While Ireland is faced with broader security-of-supply issues, there are also national circumstances related to challenges within the security of our electricity supplies that have been exacerbated by the Russian war in Ukraine and these need to be addressed.  In April 2022, the Government published the national energy security framework which provides an overarching and comprehensive response to Ireland's energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine.  Within this document, the Government has focused on how it can support households and businesses and, in particular, those most at risk of fuel poverty and how to accelerate the country's shift to increased energy efficiency and indigenous renewable energy systems.</p>  <p>  My Department has set up an energy-security emergency group, ESEG, to co-ordinate and oversee our activities and responses with regard to the impact of the Russian war in Ukraine on energy security.  The group includes representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, Gas Networks Ireland, EirGrid, the National Oil Reserves Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Under the guidance of the ESEG, emergency exercises have now been carried out across the oil, gas and electricity sectors to prepare us for the coming winter.</p>  <p>  The CRU, which has statutory responsibility for security of supply, has a programme of actions in place to address the security of our electricity supplies.  The CRU programme includes a range of measures to mitigate risks for this winter.  These measures include a considerable amount of maintenance that has taken place over the summer to ensure that our generation fleet is adequately prepared for the winter ahead; working with the large-scale energy users that have significant quantities of back-up generation in order to access that at times of system stress; the optimisation of grid batteries, the number of which is growing, to provide greater service during times of stress; and enhancing demand-side responses through a number of measures at a domestic and industrial scale.</p>  <p>  The CRU-led programme of work on security of supply is supported by my Department and EirGrid.  The Oireachtas has already introduced legislation to support EirGrid procuring temporary generation and is currently considering further legislation to support the permitting of these key projects.  EirGrid recently published its winter outlook, which states that there is no risk of a system-wide blackout solely due to insufficient generation.  However, the system will operate at a higher level of risk than optimal this winter.  EirGrid is closely monitoring the situation and is working with conventional generators to ensure that plant performance and availability is maximised, as well as working to optimise our operation of the grid.  While it cannot guarantee that there will be no loss of power this winter, it will take every measure available to prevent that from happening.</p>  <p>  In June 2022, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, made a recommendation to the Government that a review of why emergency measures are needed to secure electricity supply over the coming winter be produced.  Mr. Dermot McCarthy is a former Secretary General to the Government and the Department of the Taoiseach who has been engaged to conduct an independent review.  The review will identify factors that have contributed to generation capacity shortfall.</p> <p>It will also consider factors that contribute to any underestimation of the risk of a generation capacity shortfall; factors associated with roles and responsibilities that may have contributed to the situation; the possible role of the growth in demand from data centres; any learnings that may be relevant to strengthen policy, capacity, governance and operational effectiveness and any further technical analysis that may be helpful.  I expect to receive an interim report of the review before the end of the year.</p> <p> In respect of the medium- to long-term outlook for energy security, my Department is carrying out a review of the energy security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity systems out to the period 2030 in the context of reaching net zero by 2050.  This review considers potential risks to both our natural gas and electricity supplies and examines a range of measures to mitigate these risks.  Detailed research has been carried out by consultants to inform this review and consider forecasted energy demand from EirGrid and Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s annual plans.  The review has identified a list of potential shocks to the energy system and a long list of potential options to mitigate these shocks.  The long list was appraised against key criteria such as the potential for alleviation of identified shocks, feasibility and consistency with climate ambition to determine a short list for more complete modelled analysis.  My Department is seeking feedback on all options, whether they are on the long list or the short list, and we launched the consultation for the review on 19 September.  The deadline for submissions is 28 October.  I will bring my recommendations on security of energy supply to Government once a review process has been completed.</p> <p> One of the essential considerations in all discussions on security of energy supply is energy demand.  There has been significant amount growth in recent years, including via data centres, and this is expected to continue to grow.  EirGrid is now considering applications for connection to the grid on a case-by-case basis and that is in line with the assessment criteria set out by the CRU in November.  The criteria include the ability of the data centre applicant to bring on-site dispatchable generation or storage, or both, equivalent to or greater than their demand.  In practice, new data centres are expected to ensure their own security of supply and thus not impact on the wider electricity system.</p> <p> In July, the Government published a new statement on data centres to ensure alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, security of supply, sectoral emissions and climate priorities.  Government policy seeks to enable the twin transitions of digitalisation and decarbonisation of our economy and society.  For this to happen, digital and climate change policies need to move in tandem.  Data centres are core digital infrastructure and play an indispensable role in our economy and society.  Data centres provide the foundation for almost all online aspects of our social and work lives, including video calling, messaging and apps, retail, banking, travel, media and public service delivery, such as healthcare and welfare.</p> <p> Members of this House will be acutely aware that the exceptionally high wholesale gas prices seen since Russia invaded Ukraine have led to an unprecedented increase in electricity and retail gas prices faced by consumers.  This in turn has resulted in a very significant increase in the number of people at risk of energy poverty.  We are keenly aware of the pressure on households facing high energy bills.  To address rising electricity costs for households the Government has introduced a new electricity payment of three &euro;183.49 payments, exclusive of VAT, to domestic electricity accounts which will total &euro;550 to be paid in the November-December, January-February and March-April billing cycles at a total cost of &euro;1.2 billion.  An extension of the 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas will remain until the end of February 2023.  Budget 2023 also introduced further measures amounting to &euro;2.5 billion to support households with rising electricity and gas prices.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has found one-off measures announced as part of budget 2023 will insulate most households from rising prices this winter.  Its research shows welfare increases in 2022 and 2023, together with the one-off measures, are large enough to leave the lowest income households better off on average than they would have been had welfare payment rates risen in line with inflation this year and next.</p> <p> In addition, we are acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs in order to protect families during this energy crisis and this has been key in the design of the new temporary business energy support scheme.  This will provide up to &euro;10,000 per business per month until spring 2023 to help meet rising energy costs.  The scheme will support eligible companies by covering 40% of the increase in their energy bills.</p> <p> Energy poverty is a key concern and my Department recently published a review of the strategy to combat energy poverty.  This was alongside a public consultation.  The consultation closed on 5 September and the responses are informing the development of a new action plan to combat energy poverty.  The new energy poverty action plan will set out the range of measures being implemented across Government ahead of the coming winter, as well as key longer-term measures to ensure those who are least able to afford increased energy costs are the ones who are supported and protected the most.  Our intention is that the new plan will be published in the coming weeks.  I have also met the CRU and suppliers on safeguards and practical ways to protect pay-as-you-go customers.  Electricity suppliers have customer supports available and their hardship funds can be accessed by pay-as-you-go goes customers in the same way as they can by bill-pay customers.  The CRU has now instructed all suppliers to put customers with a financial hardship meter on the cheapest tariff available from 1 December.  The CRU has also waived the &euro;200 gas meter exchange and site works charge associated with a customer moving from a pay-as-you-go gas meter to a credit or regular bill-pay meter for all domestic customers.  The winter moratorium on disconnections for all bill-pay domestic customers for non-payment of account will be from 1 December 2022 to 28 February 2023.  Furthermore, the moratorium on disconnections for registered vulnerable customers began on 1 October and will be a place until the end of March.  Vulnerable customers registered as reliant on electrically-powered equipment cannot be disconnected for non-payment at any time.  As part of its enhanced electricity customer protection measures announced in August, the CRU is bringing in a reduced debt burden on top-ups for pay-as-you-go meters.  The new measures mean the debt-repayment levels will reduce from 10% from a previous 25% on pay-as-you-go customers&rsquo; top-up payments.</p> <p> Earlier this year the Government rolled out its Reduce Your Use campaign to raise awareness about energy efficiency and inform people of the financial supports available for households and businesses.  The next phase of this campaign was launched recently and urges householders and businesses to ensure they are availing of supports that are in place.  The Government is asking people to stay warm and well this winter and to know that help is available if they need it over the coming weeks and months.  This campaign is research-led and current research shows people are worried about the energy situation but also that they want advice on how to make the biggest difference to their energy bills.  Some of the key partners involved in the campaign are the CRU, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, Alone and the SEAI.  As part of the multimedia campaign, an information leaflet detailing how to access Government supports and advice on how to be more conscious about energy usage will also be delivered to every home in the country starting from November.  As Members can see, the Government has taken swift and extensive action in response to the crisis and will continue to do so.  I look forward to hearing other Deputies&rsquo; contributions.</p></speech>

Ireland imports a little over 70% of the energy we use and this is well over the EU average of 58%.  Oil accounts for 45% of primary energy needs and gas for a further 34%.  All of the oil used in Ireland is imported, as is three quarters of our gas.  This highlights our massive reliance on others to keep the lights on and the economy moving.  Despite having an almost unlimited amount of renewable energy available off our coast and on our rooftops, the failure to develop this over the past 20 years has significantly contributed to our energy insecurity.</p>  <p>  Offshore wind can deliver energy independence and security for our island.  Done right, we can create jobs here, bring down the cost of electricity, radically reduce emissions from the energy sector and deliver lasting energy security.  The potential to become a net exporter of electricity and green hydrogen to Europe also offers us a huge opportunity to raise significant revenue for reinvestment in climate action.  I had the opportunity recently to travel to the Moray East offshore wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen alongside colleagues from the climate action committee.  This wind farm alone will produce enough electricity to power 1 million homes.  It is a remarkable feat of engineering and highlights the opportunity we have on this island to do the same.</p>  <p>  However, we have had a lost decade of development in Ireland.  Fine Gael took office back in 2011 and wasted a massive opportunity to spearhead the development of offshore wind over the subsequent ten years.  While Scotland was literally laying the foundations, successive Governments here did nothing.  There were no offshore auctions, no resourcing of our planning agencies, no port investment, no maritime area planning, no supply chain development, no apprenticeships; the list goes on.</p> <p>While I welcome the step change since the Minister took over, I am concerned the energy transition is not receiving the primacy of focus it requires.  Issues around planning and ports, in particular, are still not being addressed.  They are immediate pinch points for the sector and for the opportunities that present.  Having raised the matter with the T&aacute;naiste during Questions on Policy or Legislation this morning, I am not convinced the Government is taking it seriously enough or that it is receiving the requisite attention.</p> <p> The industry has set out in stark terms what needs to be done to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind farms.  It has warned that we will miss our 2030 targets if that delivery is not achieved.  Unfortunately, I do not see a similar level of concern from the Minister.  We need to see our planning agencies resourced properly to reduce the planning delays faced by offshore wind projects.  We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects but we also need decisions to be made in a timely manner.  The renewables industry has pointed out that the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks, and 69 weeks for strategic infrastructure developments, versus the statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks.  This is evidence of a broken system that must be addressed if we are to deliver the scale of offshore wind required.</p> <p> Last October, approval was given by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for an additional eight personnel for the planning authority's marine and climate unit.  Despite this, by July of this year, just three of those posts had been filled.  Others were not even advertised.  This simply is not good enough.</p> <p> Last month, we heard that just one port in Ireland, namely, Belfast, is capable of hosting the construction and installation of offshore wind farms.  If we do not invest in and ready our ports now, we will lose the jobs and supply chain business from these multibilllion euro projects to ports in Britain.  We will miss our renewables targets and our emissions reduction objectives.  I note that the four Irish ports that applied for EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility were unsuccessful.  This is concerning.  The Government must step in to kick-start the investment that is required.  We need particular and focused investment in Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Cork Dockyard.  In addition, we need to invest in our electricity grid, develop our battery storage and green hydrogen sectors and reduce the cost of producing renewable energy here.  These are the solutions to the problem in the longer term.  I urge the Minister of State to prioritise addressing them.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has been campaigning for years for our solar potential to be fully utilised.  The International Energy Agency, IEA, has highlighted that in a period of just 90 minutes, enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet's energy needs for a whole year.  While solar energy is abundant, it represents a tiny fraction of Ireland's current energy mix.  Sinn F&eacute;in published its Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill almost six years ago but little progress has been made since then to roll out solar energy in homes.  We want to see solar photovoltaic, PV, panels installed on homes, businesses, schools, sports facilities, community buildings and farms across Ireland to help to cut our carbon emissions and deliver savings for citizens and communities.  Installing an average-sized solar PV system on a home can generate 40% of the electricity needs of that household.  This is particularly important given the massive electricity costs households now face.  The MaREI Centre in Cork has found that solar panels could power a quarter of Irish households.  I welcome the Government's solar for schools initiative and would like to see the detail on it.</p> <p> Last month, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the long overdue publication of the energy security review.  The report short-listed gas storage options of strategic floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, and strategic storage onshore or offshore.  These options must be considered in the context of fossil fuel lock-in and ease of conversion to hydrogen or other low- or zero-carbon fuels.  Commercial LNG is not short-listed, but is long-listed, due to the fact such a facility could result in the importation of fracked gas and could, furthermore, become a stranded asset.  In regard to the notion of a stranded asset, I echo the call made repeatedly by my colleague, Senator Boylan, that Ireland needs to follow the example of the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Poland and probably France in leaving the Energy Charter Treaty.  It is a bad deal that potentially will leave a significant burden on Irish taxpayers if we are left with these types of stranded assets.  We have been expressing our concerns for some time about Ireland's lack of gas storage.  Currently, 93.8% of the EU's gas storage is filled but Ireland does not have any such facility.</p> <p> In the time remaining, it would be remiss of me not to refer to one of the other significant challenges facing Ireland  We need a conversation on data centres.  There has been a policy failure in this regard, including a failure in planning.  We need a real discussion on how many data centres we can manage and what our fair share might be.  Again, we have seen a developer-led approach rather than a plan-led approach.  We must look at where these centres are located, whether they are providing district heating and how they are powered.  They are putting huge pressure on the electricity grid and may potentially put huge pressure on the gas grid.  They could be powered entirely by renewables if they were prescribed to do so.  It could be a different story but it is not.</p> <p> We need a clear focus on the McCarthy review into what has led us to this point.  It is a failure of the Government to bring us to the brink of blackouts for a number of winters.  That needs to be investigated.  We have had representatives of the CRU before the Oireachtas climate committee, where they pointed to the failure of the T-4 auction.  That needs to be investigated and the committee is going to do some work in this regard.  There must be accountability.  There are question marks over the Minister of the day, the Department, the CRU, EirGrid and others in the energy landscape in Ireland.  We need accountability and lessons must be learned.  The big opportunity is in renewables.  There will be a transition to be managed and it must be done carefully and right.</p></speech>

The Government is quick to blame the war in Ukraine but, in reality, the increased demand from industry and data centres was already creating a huge strain on our infrastructure.  Ireland is the worst-prepared country in Europe for an energy crisis and the possibility of rolling blackouts this winter is a very real prospect.  There has been Government inaction on a microgeneration scheme, wind energy guidelines, simplified grant schemes and a just transition.  That is why we are facing this crisis.</p>  <p>  The energy security review was commissioned by the Government almost three years ago.  Its publication was long overdue and we now need to see action.  We did not need a report to tell us that years of Government inaction has contributed significantly to our energy security crisis.  The Government has failed to match energy supply with demand and to manage a just transition.  The biggest failure of all is the failure to develop our massive offshore wind capacity, which has left us reliant on fossil fuels and exposed to extreme volatility in the international energy markets.</p>  <p>  Microgeneration is a very deliverable solution.  If we deliver the right grants scheme, there will be significant uptake of solar panels in particular.  We need to support homes, farms and small businesses to provide their own microgeneration capacity.  It would be the gift that keeps on giving.</p>  <p>  Delivering energy security is vital to protect workers, families and communities against the growing cost-of-living crisis.  In doing so, we can create huge opportunities, especially for young people, in the form of jobs that are highly skilled and come with good pay and conditions.  Families are struggling.  Last week, I was contacted by a constituent whose level monthly contribution to the energy supplier was going up from &euro;147 to &euro;360.</p> <p>The reason they are on a level monthly payment is to avoid surprise bills.  Their response to the increase was to cancel the direct debit.  They are struggling to cope and, sadly, they are not alone.</p> <p> Small business owners are also suffering.  A member of my team showed me a TikTok from an Irish master butcher called Keith Grant.  He recently uploaded a video of his business&rsquo;s electricity bill.  It was &euro;2,500 for 25 days.  That is &euro;100 a day.  Before he has to pay for rates, rent, wages or stock, he has to find &euro;100 a day to keep the lights on.  He says that the scariest part about it is that he made every efficiency he could.  He put lights on sensors and water heaters on timers.  He is fearful that he will lose his business.  He is not alone.  I spoke to a local business owner who is giving his business until Christmas.  It is make-or-break time for him.  It is make or break for this Government, which is completely out of touch and does not understand the scale of this crisis or the urgent need for action.</p> <p> Yesterday, I mentioned energy- and water-hungry data centres.  Data centres now consume as much electricity as all of the houses in rural Ireland.  While demand for electricity has shot up, successive Governments and their agencies have failed to deliver electricity supply.  We have the report, we know what to do with it but we need to act now before its too late.</p></speech>

Over recent months, we have become much more aware of the importance of energy security following the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin and his use of energy as a weapon.  In recent weeks we have seen him target energy facilities and water supplies in Ukraine.  Putin&rsquo;s use of energy as a weapon is not just affecting Ukraine; it has sent shock waves across Europe.  Ireland has been affected, so it is timely that we are having this debate on energy security.  Energy security has become a tight balancing act between supply and demand.  The crippling cost of energy is having a detrimental impact on householders and businesses.  The market conditions for energy have been radically altered following Russia&rsquo;s illegal actions in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Aligned with this are our climate change targets, which mean we must radically reduce carbon emissions across each sector.  County Clare has a long, proud history of producing electricity.  It has more than played its part in providing energy for the entire country.  The first major energy generation project on this island to provide electricity was in Ardnacrusha.  In its early years, Ardnacrusha provided for more than 90% of our electricity needs.  To this day, Ardnacrusha still feeds electricity into the national grid.  This project was ahead of its time.  Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of accompanying the T&aacute;naiste on a visit to the plant at Ardnacrusha.  We were given a tour and an aerial overview of the development of the facility.  Following the oil crisis in 1973, the then Government decided to reduce our dependence on oil for electricity generation and started construction on the coal burning station at Moneypoint in County Clare.  This has produced safe electricity for generations and provided for up to 45% of our electricity needs.  In recent times, over the past year in fact, Moneypoint has come to the rescue of the country.  Its life has been extended and it is providing a huge amount of electricity again.</p>  <p>  The story does not end there.  A number of interested parties have been drawing up plans to invest in green energy projects based in the Shannon Estuary and off the coast of County Clare.  These plans include floating offshore wind farms, wave generators and the manufacture of green hydrogen.  These projects have the potential to be transformational.  It is important that the Government helps green energy companies to grasp these opportunities.  I acknowledge the establishment of the Shannon Estuary Economic Taskforce.  I look forward to it reporting and an action plan being rolled out to support the development of global leading green energy hub in the Shannon Estuary.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to listen to green energy stakeholders and bring about the necessary regulatory reform that would pave the way for the development of high-scale green energy projects delivering jobs and opportunities for investment in west Clare and securing our energy needs into the future.  The Moneypoint power plant site with its high-powered connections to the national grid would provide an ideal base for these operations.  I have engaged with stakeholders involved in the green energy sector.  I have met them and they have a number of specific requests particularly in the area of floating offshore wind turbines.  I ask the Minister to engage with them.  There is a need to accelerate credible projects to meet our 2030 targets.  Currently, there are proposals to deliver 28 GW of offshore wind.  The target is just 7 GW by 2030.  We need to prioritise those projects and make sure they go ahead.</p>  <p>  There are issues relating to licensing.  I refer, for example, to a foreshore licence application that has been waiting two and a half years to be signed off on.  That is just not good enough.  In other jurisdictions, such as, for example, the UK, that can be done in a matter of weeks.  There is a need for a whole-of-government development plan for the development of floating offshore wind projects.  I encourage the Government to do that.</p>  <p>  Being at the end of the pipeline when it comes to the European gas grid could mean paying a premium price for not being in a position to build up reserves during the summer months as our European partners have done.  We have climbed a mountain to secure gas supplies for this winter, but now it is time for us to make decisive decisions to secure our gas supplies, at an economical price, for the years to come.  These decisions must be made on the best scientific advice available and must not be based on ideological objections.  This summer we saw all the other European countries aim to build up their gas reserves to 100% capacity at their storage facilities.  We all know that they managed to build up their reserves to more than 85% before the gas from Russia ceased to flow due to alleged technical faults with the pipelines and a mysterious explosion in the Baltic Sea.  We have no intelligence or knowledge as to whether the pipelines will be operational next year.  If they are not, we will once again be at the end of the queue, especially if we do not have any storage capacity.</p>  <p>There have been at least two serious applications to build an LNG processing and storage facility on the banks of the Shannon Estuary. This proposal was first made nearly 20 years ago.  It progressed through the planning process at a snail&rsquo;s pace.  Investors had the foresight 20 years ago to see that Ireland was going to have a problem if it did not construct a gas storage facility.  That was then, but we are on the cliff edge now.  Will we escape blackouts this year?  We probably will, but at enormous cost.  We cannot guarantee to have energy security over the next ten to 15 years if we do not take the urgent steps now to secure our energy supplies.</p>  <p>  Another factor that needs to be examined is the feasibility of converting Moneypoint power station to gas.  If there was a safe, secure LNG base nearby on the Shannon Estuary, that would be a possibility.  Recent reports have highlighted possible shortages in our generation capacity at peak demand times and this has caused considerable concern for the elderly, those living alone, particularly those with backup power systems for medical support units based in their homes, and for those operating nursing homes and medical facilities.  How will they be protected?  I am not just talking about the risk to these networks if we have power outages for energy shortages but the damage occurring to our electricity networks following storms which seem to be becoming stronger and with more frequency every winter.</p>  <p>  We have all transferred from our old landlines to a more digital world of mobile phones and the Internet in order to communicate.</p> <p>These are vital and essential to rescue operations.  It is vital we have a backup system to power these services in emergency events.  If we have power outages, will these be managed in the same way as in the past, with different zones being at risk for rotating three-hour periods?</p> <p> Do the authorities that are advertising for vulnerable customers to contact their electricity suppliers to register their vulnerable concerns need to register with EirGrid, which manages the entire network?  What will happen to these consumers if power outages are necessary?  The Minister of State might let us know what plans are being put in place to keep us up to date.</p> <p> Has the Minister of State or any of his officials conducted any studies on the effects of not adopting winter time next week or in subsequent years on our peak hour demands between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. and whether it would reduce our overall demands for the entire winter?</p> <p> I am also picking up a fair degree of cynicism regarding the installation of smart meters in our homes.  Most of the benefits seem to be accruing to the suppliers and may even put the consumer at some disadvantage.  We may need to update the software to show the consumer their consumption in previous years to see if they are reducing or increasing it.  We might also examine the feasibility of providing this information on our bills so we can work on individual climate change targets.  At a national level, we might also provide more user-friendly graphics on our energy dashboards to show how we are meeting our voluntary targets of reducing our consumption by 15%.</p> <p> I think we were all disappointed this week by the figures on completion of retrofitting projects.  I am a great believer in the use of the carrot along with the stick.  Would the Minister of State consider a possible property tax reduction of 5% for five years for those who completed retrofitting their homes and the same for those who have installed solar panels on their homes?</p> <p> I welcome this debate, but I am afraid we will be discussing this complex subject of energy security regularly over the years ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700048#YY00200"><p>I might have to agree with Deputy Carey.  We may be dealing with this issue of energy security for quite a time to come.  This is another one of these multiple overlapping crises.  Obviously, we have energy security issues across Europe with supply, particularly gas, a situation that has been absolutely beyond exacerbated &ndash; I am not sure there is a term I could choose that would adequately explain it &ndash; by what Vladimir Putin has done by invading Ukraine.  This is one of the weapons he has introduced to this particular conflict.</p>  <p>  That is a particular issue and it has taken the European Union a considerable amount of time to show a greater level of imagination and to get to grips with the reality.  It is only now at this stage we are talking properly about windfall taxes, caps and all the measures that are necessary to mitigate the huge pain that there will be so we can keep the show afloat, which was the idea through Covid, and not accidentally give a win to Vladimir Putin.</p>  <p>  We all know we would be in a much better situation on an international basis had greater moves been made to move away from our addiction to fossil fuels and towards a greater use of renewables.  We would be in a far more sustainable place regarding emissions and the climate and we would not be susceptible to the situation we are in now.  We need the European Union to move better, faster and more quickly.  We also need Government to do what it can in relation to that.</p>  <p>  Let us also accept we have a generation capacity problem in this State.  We had an auction system that obviously did not work and we need to make sure we have something into the future that is better.  We had a problem in the sense we did not have the laws, the legislation and the capacity to be able to deliver the backup generators.  Therefore, we changed the rules and regulations.  There was a huge amount of weaknesses related to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and others and we will have them for next winter &ndash; not for this winter.  I hope we are not dealing with a severe situation regarding blackouts.  We all know the related difficulties and everyone has mentioned the dangers for those who are very medically vulnerable.  I know there are certain safety procedures put in place, but we need to look at that grouping we term as &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; and ensure we all have the necessary protections.</p>  <p>  We know the huge issues related to pay-as-you-go customers and the fact they are not protected from disconnections.  We obviously need all those pieces in place.  However, we have to recognise the absolute failures that have occurred from a point of view of generation.  We have to get that show on the road and make sure we do not continue with these sort of disasters.</p>  <p>  On making sure we have a fit-for-purpose, sustainable system, it goes without saying that the future is renewables.  It is particularly solar and, even more so, wind and offshore wind.  The huge delays were mentioned earlier.  I think it is 69 weeks with An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding major infrastructural products.  That obviously is not going to wash.  We know the Attorney General review is ongoing, but we will need, as they say, the colour of his money for whatever changes are necessary to bring our planning laws, regulations and protocols into the modern age in order that we can offer the same sort of planning infrastructure as can be offered across Europe.</p>  <p>  That is not to say there is not a huge amount that will need to be done by interacting with communities.  Sometimes, when all sorts of developments are done from that point of view, they actually have fewer objections and get to that necessary place faster.  We need to make sure that happens.</p>  <p>  We also need to make sure we are actually resourcing these agencies.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke spoke about the fact we have not filled even those positions that have been offered in the very specific climate unit in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That does not make any sense.  We need that to happen as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  There has been a shift change and we are moving in the right direction.  The problem is we are behind time and are facing into major issues.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to bring up a particular issue we have spoken about previously, that is, those using communal heating systems.  We need a bespoke solution, whether that is the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, or an alternative that provides a reprieve to those companies that is then passed on to residents.  I know the Minister of State has an interest in it.</p></speech>

It is important we recognise that a lot of time when we talk about energy security, we talk about immediate needs and the here and now.  Obviously, that is what people will be the most concerned about &ndash; this and the following winter.  However, we also need think ten or 20 years down the road for when these children, their friends and children like them are adults.  What kind of Ireland and energy security will we have at that point?  Will they get to live in an Ireland that has secure, safe and sustainable energy?  That is where we want to be going with this.  The discussions we are having today are not just about what happens in the winter coming but also the kind of future our communities, business and residents will live in.  That is something that we need to be conscious of.</p>  <p>  I only have six and a half minutes to talk and energy security is obviously an incredibly complex issue.  I will not even touch on the needs.  I want to think about it as the systemic issues that I see &ndash; not about specific things but the overarching problems we are facing.  There are three issues I want to highlight.</p> <p>The first is the level of accountability.  There needs to be a single entity in charge.  What we have seen, whether at the climate committee, in the media or in any of the debates and discussions on energy security, is the CRU, EirGrid and the Government pointing at each other and saying it is the fault of the other.  We had that at the climate committee and then we had the Taoiseach saying no one made him aware there was an issue.  The first thing we need to get on the record is that it is the responsibility of the Government to keep the lights on in this country for businesses and homes.  That is where the buck stops and that needs to be acknowledged.  The CRU and EirGrid are statutory entities set up to assist with that but, fundamentally, it is the responsibility of the Government to do this.</p> <p> The second thing is we need to acknowledge what the problem is.  There has been a failure to do so through many years.  There has been a tension between energy security, needs and planning, and trying to bring in enterprise, business and job opportunities to the country.  There has been a complete imbalance in that regard.   The focus has been far too much on bringing in certain corporations or enabling certain developments in the belief they are necessary for job creation, but then fundamentally undermining our ability to keep lights on in businesses.  That results in significant reputational damage for other businesses.  There has been an imbalance in that regard.  Since 2017, we have been warned that the grid was going to be under pressure, and that has increasingly come to pass.   We have not seen the necessary level of investment by successive governments or the required level of implementation or delivery on the grid through those years, so capacity has essentially stalled while at the same time we have had an incredible growth in demand.  The majority of that growth is coming from large energy users such as data centres.  That has not been acknowledged as a fault or flaw in Government policy to date, and that is important.</p> <p> In addition, we need to look at what those big problems are and turn them into the solutions.  There are a number of data centres that have incredible generating capacity.  Many of them can produce their own energy.  In the interests of the immediate energy security of the country, I ask the Minister - I do not know whether this has happened yet - to ensure the CRU or the Department speaks to the data centres, particularly the big ones, to find out whether they have capacity that can be made dispatchable to the grid to assist as a short-term measure.  There is infrastructure in place and that is something that is worthwhile doing.  It may prevent the need to build or create additional generation.  In the context of the capacity and problems of data centres, those centres will account for 28% of electricity usage by 2030, which is a considerable challenge.  We are aware the consumption has already been a challenge.  My party and I do not believe that was managed properly, unfortunately.  A year and a half ago, we tabled a motion seeking a temporary moratorium on data centres until all this was sorted out.  Unfortunately, the Government did not agree and we are now suffering the consequences of that.</p> <p> Another issue that has been highlighted in the EirGrid all-island capacity statement this year is that while data centres will account for 28% of electricity demand by 2030, electric vehicles and heat pumps will amount to 13% by 2030.  It will go from 2% to 13%, which is quite an increase and will represent a significant proportion of electricity demand.  The Social Democrats has repeatedly made the point to the Government that there is a need to invest now in solar.  Every house in the country should be generating its own electricity that would assist with and mitigate any of the demand risks that will come from EVs or heat pumps.  EVs can act as batteries on an individual home basis.  We ask the Government not just to come out with phrases such as "rooftop revolution" but to drive a rooftop revolution, put the money behind it and make sure people can afford to do it.  We believe the Government should pay, especially for those who would meet the criteria for the warmer homes scheme.  The Government should roll these schemes out quickly through entire estates.  An estate of houses could be done in a matter of weeks.  The Government should get it done.  It would help people this winter and it would help the grid in ten years' time.  The Government needs to focus on solar.  I hope the Minister will bring that back to the Department.</p></speech>

I welcome Deputy Whitmore's family and their friend to the House.  It is fantastic to see young people having an interest in politics.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister back to the House.  Obviously, he was undertaking important Government business elsewhere.  We are here to discuss the extremely serious issue of Ireland's energy supply.  Unfortunately, the ten minutes I have been allocated are not enough to go through the issues in that regard.</p>  <p>  One problem is that there is an ideological difference within the Government in respect of the best solution to this problem.  As a person in my 20s who, I hope, will live a long life, I can comment on what the future will look like when it comes to the climate and the environment, but I understand that we have a lot of work to do to make the transition to green energy possible and to do so in a sustainable way while trying to get there as quickly as we can.  In saying that, however, there needs to be a recognition that gas is an exceptionally important fossil fuel.  It is immensely consequential to power generation in this country but, as a country, we are hooked on international sources to supply our gas.  I find it hypocritical that, as a State, we are happy to import fossil fuels from dictatorships and autocratic governments around the world but, when it comes to our own supply of energy, we are not granting licences at the rate we should be, given the crisis - not an emergency but a crisis - we could encounter in the coming months.  Despite some of the commentary on this issue, the environmental ramifications of that issue have not been fully taken into account.</p>  <p>  I come from an agricultural background.  Every litre of milk that comes from cows in this country to be processed for skimmed milk powder for export is brought to driers, all of which are gas-powered.  Industry that provides hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country is heavily reliant on gas.  As a country, we are not allowing the exploration of existing gasfields or issuing licences for new test wells to be drilled to establish what is off the shores of this island.  I appeal to the Minister to find the good sense to tackle this issue.  I am dumbfounded as to why it has not been done already.  We need to think about what could happen if there is a crisis on the Continent over a lack of gas supply because, although there is strong camaraderie within the European Union, when it comes to supply we are competing against some of the most industrial economies in the world.  They do not have the potential security of supply that Ireland could have if the Government were proactive about exploring what is off our shores when it comes to gas.  This is the great risk.  I do not want to fail to express this concern today when there is the potential for a major crisis to erupt two years or two months from now, possibly as a result of an exceptionally cold winter in Europe, with resulting strong demand for gas for heating in addition to the manufacturing needs of economies such as Germany and other strong industrial economies on the Continent.  In such a situation, Ireland could be left high and dry.  We are connected to the gas network of the United Kingdom but, from my perspective, it is just not good enough that we are not making best efforts to establish what is off the shores of the country.</p> <p>What also needs to be called out is the utter hypocrisy of some of what has been included in the Government review about the potential use of the Kinsale gas field for gas storage.  Are we now saying we are fine with gas being brought in from abroad and stored by being pumped into the ground but are not happy to allow a licence for exploration for gas 30 or 40 nautical miles east or west of the existing gas field to be granted?  I would like the Minister to give some thought to that and respond to me on it in writing.  It is something that had to be said.</p> <p> There are so many energy issues that do not make sense, given the crisis in which we find ourselves.  In terms of industry, for example, people are crying out in Cork for the installation of private energy infrastructure for energy generation on site.  This is particularly the case when it comes to renewables but ESB Networks is tying itself up in regulatory knots. In my view, this suits the company from a revenue point of view, when it comes to the provision of private wire.  It is my understanding that there are only six weeks in the year when it accepts applications for that system.  I know the Minister is working on this but quite frankly, if we end up in a situation where we have blackouts -  please God, that will not happen and I know work is being done to try to avert that - then the CEO and senior management of ESB Networks will have exceptionally serious questions to answer.  I want to warn them that the Oireachtas, if it has good sense, will pursue this particular issue.  It is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age, when we have so much discussion about and potential investment in renewables that the network operators of our electricity grid, EirGrid and ESB Networks, are not allowing ease of access for those who want to put in place their own energy generation systems on site.  I refer to what are described as large energy users, LEUs.  </p> <p> In terms of the demands on the grid, we have to understand that as time goes on, the demand for energy is probably going to continue to grow.  We have a growing economy and population.  In that context, the current rate of progress with regard to offshore wind is not in any way acceptable.  I am very hopeful and am putting a lot of faith in the review into ways to improve the planning process in this country that is due to be published by the Attorney General .  It is absolutely essential that we deal with the ongoing issues when it comes to the granting of permission for offshore wind projects in this country.  In this century, it is possibly one of the greatest economic opportunities for the State to invest in.  We were world leaders in this area during the Celtic tiger period but have slipped dramatically down the rankings as the years have passed.  We have watched other countries grow and expand their offshore industry, which could potentially contribute billions of euro to the economy.</p> <p> I also want to call into question the status of the EirGrid interconnector.  The need for such an interconnector has been discussed at length for more than three years.  I want to make an observation rather than a criticism.  After all, we are in a Chamber where debate and free speech is welcome.  We have heard some strong contributions from the Opposition today criticising the Government about a lack of energy generation in this country.  However, the point must be made that the main Opposition party had many activists involved in protests against the establishment of the Corrib gas field ten or 15 years ago. </p> <p> I ask Government to take a look at different sectors and identify what it can do to improve their circumstances.  It must also deal with the backlog at ESB Networks which is not providing enough private wire for the provision of on-site renewable energy generation by LEUs.  That must be dealt with urgently.  I also want to very clearly communicate to the Department that the unknown blockage when it comes to the granting of licences for exploration for gas off our shores needs to be dealt with because it is quite hypocritical that we are happy to import gas from abroad but not to drill for it off our own shores.  From a security point of view, we are putting our economy and society at risk by not doing so.  I speak from the perspective of short to medium term solutions to the problems facing us, including growing political instability across the world.  I fully believe that one day we will achieve our targets for reductions in the use of fossil fuels in this country but we have to be realistic about the process of getting there.  What I see at the moment, I do not like.  Industry is furious.  People working in renewable energy companies are sharply critical of the slow pace of development in Ireland.  There is a serious urgency around the planning reforms that will be published next week.  I hope the Minister has been engaging diligently with the Attorney General on this work and that we will see further work being done to expedite the process, in addition to some of the steps that have been taken already.</p> <p> I also want to acknowledge the fantastic work that was done through the budget to relieve some of the pressure on people and on business.  Small businesses, in particular, are under extraordinary pressure.  The household credit of &euro;600 will make a difference to households this year but I also want to make the case for businesses like supermarkets and butchers, some of whom have contacted me in the past few days.  They would have quite large energy bills and, in some cases, their bills are well in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.  They have seen drastic increases in the cost of gas and electricity and their profit margins have been utterly destroyed.  We need to be very mindful of the knock-on consequences and damage this could cause, particularly in rural Ireland where the situation for business and enterprise is already quite delicate.</p> <p> I would appreciate the Minister responding to me on these issues.</p></speech>

When one looks at the housing crisis, the pressure around accommodating Ukrainian refugees, the mismanagement of our health system and various other issues, it is not surprising that the Government has failed to plan in advance in relation to energy security.  The  Government has failed to deliver the necessary power stations to deliver significant generation capacity through renewables and gas storage facilities.  It has been clear for years that our energy demand would increase substantially.  The war in Ukraine has made it painfully clear how poorly developed we are in terms of energy security.  However, we are much more fortunate than many of our EU partners.  We have very little dependence on Russian gas.  Our gas comes from the North Sea in Britain and the Corrib gas field.</p>  <p>  Energy demand has shot up by 12% in the past five years and this Government's red-carpet policy towards data centres has fuelled much of this demand.  It is staggering to think that data centres now consume as much electricity as every house in rural Ireland.  Since 2016 EirGrid has been warning of an increasing tightness between supply and demand but the Government spent six years not listening.  There was a clear failure to put a plan into action in order to be prepared for what we are now facing.  The energy crisis has clearly exposed the failings in the Government's approach to energy, including the rampant privatisation of our energy sector, with State assets such as Bord Gais fully sold off.  Now we see record profits being reported by the likes of Bord Gais in the middle of this crisis.  The windfall profits of energy companies should be going back into energy development, into developing secure and sustainable energy in communities across the State.  Instead, these profits are lining the pockets of shareholders while ordinary workers and their families are struggling to pay huge energy bills.  </p>  <p>  The ESB has been at the core of secure electricity generation to every corner and community in this State.  For many years, our energy prices were among the lowest in the EU until the ESB had to set prices higher to encourage competition in the market.  As a result, electricity prices have gone from being among the lowest to now being among the highest in the EU.  </p> <p>This is a State-owned company making record profits in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.  It is hard to believe.  Just like in housing, the energy market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for workers.  We have already seen moves in EU states such as France to bring energy companies back under State ownership.  To put an end to the price gouging we are currently experiencing, we need to see this Government take proactive steps in energy development and not wait until the last moment to react.</p> <p> Achieving energy security can create massive opportunities for communities across the island, especially for young people, in the form of highly skilled jobs with good or very good pay and conditions.</p> <p> Working families across the State need to feel secure coming into this winter.  Across the State more than 200,000 households are in electricity arrears.  Thousands of families are being pushed to the limit paying these bills.  This is a clear result of failure by this Government to plan for our energy security.  Many people using pre-pay meters are given no choice by their landlords, and now some are being left to ration their electricity.  I hear from constituents that the process of switching from pre-pay is effectively impossible.  They wait over an hour to try to speak to an operator only to be suddenly disconnected.  Most people do not have the free time to sit around waiting for over an hour in the hope of speaking to someone.  It is simply not good enough.  Workers and families need to feel safe and secure during this coming winter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700051#BBB00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on energy security.  My interest in this area was particularly heightened following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la some years ago to reject applications by ESB to co-fuel peat and biomass at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  That decision brought forward and cliff-edged the decarbonisation of Bord na M&oacute;na by some eight years.  Its impact on Offaly and the region was and is severe.  It forced me at the time to ensure that the Government ring-fenced carbon tax revenue and contributed to a just transition fund to assist with fuel poverty-proofing.  It also meant that the peat regions of Ireland would be included in the then coal regions transition fund initiated by the EU together with the national development plan, which matched that funding last year, totalling &euro;170 million.  Efforts are ongoing to ensure that such funds can have the effect required and desired.  As a representative in the area, I personally will continue to insist that the body charged with administering those funds, namely the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, will have at its heart a commitment in agreement with Offaly County Council's proposal that recognises the areas and counties most impacted by this acceleration and by job losses and their impact on the local economy.</p>  <p>  Our country's energy security, provision and potential today are, unfortunately, far removed from where they should be.  Yes, of course, many will be quick to say that our commitment to renewable energy resources is succeeding and that 40% of our electricity generation comes from renewables.  That may well be the case but it is predominantly by virtue of land-based wind provision.  What happens when that wind blows excessively?  There has been inadequate battery provision to store the excess.  When the wind does not blow, with little or no battery storage, as I have alluded to, the system relies on coal and gas.  Much of the plant charged with that responsibility is outdated and expensive to maintain, and the wholesale energy market is then heavily weighted in favour of those providers.  That ensures that prices are excessive and studies have been provided to prove that.  That was the position in advance of the unfortunate war in Ukraine, which has created further pressures, obviously.</p>  <p>  What, then, of the original promises and commitments that were made relating to the type of provision we expected to see in respect of solar energy; the farming community's commitment and the potential there that is yet to be realised; industry; and community schemes, which are also untapped in the way envisaged initially?  All of that, I am afraid, reflects poorly on the Department, EirGrid and the CRU.  We know that when auctions for renewable projects were held over the years, some were won but not followed through and provided.  In 2016 four specific auctions were won, but in 2021 they were reneged on and only fines were paid, with our grid being the one to remain challenged, with the loss of that 450 MW, not to mention the 200-plus MW in respect of Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  As I said, that ensured that the grid remained challenged.  It ensured that the wholesale market was further deprived of fair and relevant competition, ensuring high prices for business and consumers.</p>  <p>  Another failure, unfortunately, can be laid at the doors of those within the Department, EirGrid and the CRU, again before the war in Ukraine became a reality.  Following the failure to meet energy provision targets, there was a realisation in 2021 of the need to provide for winter 2022.  It was what could be described as a mad scramble for energy provision to meet this winter's demand.  EirGrid bought land in Huntstown for a reported &euro;10 million.  The Planning and Development Act was amended in June 2021 to allow semi-State providers not necessarily to have to apply for planning permission, which again contravened and contradicted the sort of competition that would have been expected in that marketplace.  There were talks of the ESB providing emergency generation at North Wall.  That was abandoned despite the making of a &euro;10 million down payment, a fact which is yet to be fully contradicted, highlighted or relayed before either House or any of the committees here.  That stalled because a competitor challenged the questionable process in the High Court, with the conclusion amounting to the reality that there was a failure to provide the extra power, the extra potential, that was required to meet the demands we are now witnessing this winter.  That too, I am afraid, is a failure on the part of many within the Department, EirGrid and the CRU.  We are now aware that EirGrid is procuring and purchasing up to 650 MW for winter 2023, supposedly relating to sites at Huntstown, Tarbert and Shannonbridge.  I assume that those sites are gas-fired but I am yet to be made aware of what they are.  I estimate, based on consultations with those in the know, that the cost to the State in respect of that provision will be a further &euro;800 million.  This would never have been necessary had the 450 MW auctions materialised.  That is not to mention the excessive end price faced by the consumer or, as I said earlier, the issue of the reliance on outdated plant and machinery and the maintenance of that and, therefore, its impact on the price as well.</p>  <p>  That is just a snapshot of the performance of the Department, EirGrid and the CRU.  I know that many look to blame the likes of data centres and that they are a sort of bogeyman when it comes to the reasons our energy security is so strained.  If, however, we want to continue to attract high-value corporation tax receipts from high-tech companies, we must have storage capacity.  We committed to be in a position to have that capacity many years ago.  The Minister will be well aware of that commitment.  He made it himself during his previous time in government.  Our infrastructure capacity too could have made better progress.  The north west, for example, is badly served.  Again, that is a combined failing, like it or lump it, on the part of the Department, EirGrid and the CRU.</p>  <p>  I have been raising these issues for a number of years with the Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers of State who took questions and Topical Issue matters about these issues when raised.  I have been in touch with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for the past two years or so.  I will copy this contribution and others made and other information relating to what I am saying to Mr. McCarthy, whose investigation is ongoing, as alluded to by many speakers earlier.  What do I hope to expect or what should emanate from that?  I hope, first, that our ambition relating to offshore wind is greatly enhanced, as great as it might appear to those in the know, by many multiples of the 7 GW it is thought will be provided by 2030.</p> <p>The idea that we could have a brand new industry the size of the current Irish economy - over &euro;300 billion in three decades - must be exciting and challenging.  However, based on the performance to date by those in the Department, EirGrid and the CRU, I hope there would be a complete overhaul of the processes, procedures, planning and personnel if we have any hope of realising the tremendous opportunity that exists there.  I thought the day of passing the buck to regulators was over in the context of the Financial Regulator and the commitments we got from that office back in the mid-2000s but it would appear that it is not with regard to this issue either.  During the course of many of the debates to which I have alluded, I was informed that the regulator says everything is in order.  </p> <p> I hope the McCarthy report and the report commissioned by the Attorney General with regard to the Planning and Development Act will allow the Government to make the bold decision of recognising the fact that the processes and procedures cannot accommodate what needs to be done in this country - even with the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority being put in place.  A seven-year wait from the time of recognition or inception to delivery should not be allowed to continue so some bold decisions must be made.  We know efforts to rectify planning arising out of many failings 40 years ago have resulted in stifling and curtailing residential development in the form of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all that has emanated from it in recent times, let alone the failure to have a statutory time period for it to make a decision.</p> <p> The issue of judicial review is stifling residential and commercial permissions and permissions in agriculture with regard to Glanbia and the Banagher plant.  The judicial review process is getting in the way of development at a time of crisis in residential development and the provision of energy.  Major infrastructural benefits that could accrue from the development plan will no doubt be held up by those processes.  It is incumbent on Government on receipt of the McCarthy report and the report from the Attorney General to set out to this House how it will amend those processes and procedures within the Planning and Development Act to such an extent that there will even be a sunset period by which the current system must be set aside to allow these developments take place to allow housing to meet the demands of the programme for Government and the demands of those we have the privilege of representing.  On foot of the failures associated with our previous commitments regarding the provision of security and the war in Ukraine, and the huge additional pressure that places on price, competition and the provision of energy, it must be addressed by virtue of those two reports, which might be the most important reports this Government might receive in its lifetime.  The Minister has huge responsibility to face that head on and make very bold decisions that can realise the ambition of an industry that can give us &euro;300 billion - the size of our economy today - given the potential for offshore energy, particularly on the west coast.</p></speech>

Throughout those years, successive Governments have failed to manage energy supply and demand resulting in where we are today.  We are faced with a heightened risk of blackouts this winter.  As Mark Foley, CEO of EirGrid, said in recent times, this is another avenue this Government has led us down - another avenue that leads to uncertainty for households and businesses across the country.  What we have seen over the years is poor policy that has failed to increase supply in line with the projected increase in demand for energy.</p>  <p>  That poor level of foresight led the Government earlier this year to introduce in a rushed manner the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022.  The purpose of this was to give EirGrid the necessary powers to procure directly 400 MW of power to hold for this coming winter and the two subsequent winters.  It will not provide for what we need this winter.  The Government would have been better off planning for the future, particularly when initial concerns were raised with it.  Instead we are playing catch up and are encountering the obstacles that always arise when implementing something of this nature.  The problem is that because of this situation we have been walked into through this lack of preparation, any obstacles will have a profound impact on the immediate response that is needed.  We have increased coal and oil use at Moneypoint and Tarbert and we are still short around 280 MW when it comes to meeting demand.  The unscheduled obstacles that have presented themselves include legal challenges to EirGrid's effort to directly procure 200 MW in advance of this winter.  This is where leaving everything until the last minute leaves us - unable to manage our way through the problems that always arise.  </p>  <p>  We hear a lot about renewables and our ability to be self-sufficient, yet offshore wind has not been tapped into in any way that is significant while our planning system is beset with problems, the consequences of which we are seeing.  We need to see a Government that seizes the opportunities to make us self-sufficient in energy while also providing for a young workforce.  If our energy sector was working properly, there would be huge benefits for our young people, who would have the opportunity to take up well-paid jobs in a sector that would protect our planet and protect our energy security.  Community energy generation has an important role to play in our energy future and I would advise the Government to plan accordingly and not to wait until the next warning comes because that has already arrived.</p></speech>

I want a categorical commitment from the Minister that electricity supply to homes around this country will not be cut if there is a tightening of supply this winter.  We have a perverse situation because of the fear that has been instilled in people.  Older people are forking out &euro;1,800 to buy back-up diesel generators in case their electricity supply is switched off.  The Government and the CRU are causing this panic, particularly among older people and those who are even more vulnerable - people with medical appliances such as those used for dialysis.  The reality is that if supplies are cut this winter, it is to secure supplies for high users of electricity.  This is immoral and we need a categorical commitment here this evening that this will not happen.</p><p>I have made my views known in this House regarding speculative data centres <i>ad nauseum</i>and I will not go into the subject tonight but I will revisit the issue of data centres and the opportunity they can now provide.  Let me make it crystal clear.  If electricity supply is cut to homes and families around this country this winter, we need to see resignations - resignations at Government level and resignations from the regulator.  The reason this would happen is because of the failure to deliver on key initiatives such as this rooftop revolution we have been promised.  All of us, including the Minister, know the reason this has not happened is because of the industry bigotry blockage against rooftop solar.  As the Minister knows, I went against the departmental and industrial advice to sign Ireland up to a legal obligation to start micro-generation from June 2021.  I did that because I knew that it would not happen here unless there was a legal obligation at EU level to make this happen.  That was to happen from June 2021.  As of last month, just one energy provider in this country is actually paying for rooftop solar micro-generation that is being supplied to the grid.  That is sending a message to people that their energy is not wanted.  If we want to make that happen and encourage it, yes the bulk of it will happen through self-consumption but people need to be paid for the excess.</p> <p>This is within the control of the Minister and the regulator.  Tomorrow morning, with the stroke of a pen, they could ensure people were paid.  This needs to happen.  It is the legal obligation.  We are going to have a perverse situation where the European Commission will fine Ireland for not implementing a regulation mandating that people who have rooftop solar panels should be paid for excess electricity generation.  This is at a time when we have a shortage of electricity.</p> <p> Speaking of the bigotry blockages that exist, another one concerns the whole area of natural gas.  As the Minister is aware, when I was the Minister, I directed that a report be completed on the future of the Kinsale gas field in advance of legislation that would have to be enacted by this Parliament to decommission that gas field.  When we got the briefing from the Minister's Department in December 2020, I asked for a copy of this report.  I was told it was imminent.  The legislation came through this House in the spring of 2021 and we did not have this report.  As the Minister is aware, I asked several times for this report.  Last spring, a year later, the Minister told me it was imminent.  We eventually got the report.  It has now gone out for public consultation.  Regarding spending on this process, the Department has estimated that it would require major investment.  The south-west Kinsale reservoir was operational and storing natural gas until April 2017.  We are the only EU member state that has no capacity to store natural gas and we need this type of capacity in the medium term.  We must put this required investment into gas storage in the Kinsale gas field off our coast.</p> <p> Last month, my colleagues and I brought forward a motion on the area of energy security.  In that motion, we proposed the drafting and enactment of legislation to address the current supply deficit with an energy emergency measures in the public interest Act, which would have a sunset clause of 36 months.  This legislation would do several things.  It would ban any threat to turn off the electricity supply to domestic customers and critical social infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes.  This must happen.  The legislation would also ensure that we would reopen the capacity to generate the 250 MW of electricity available to us in the midlands power plants in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge.  These should be used to burn biomass.  To facilitate this happening, we need to suspend the licensing regime for the thinning and felling of forestry to facilitate the use of brash to fuel the midland power plants with biomass.  This should be done rather than this biomass being exported to fuel power generation in other parts of Europe.  We also need to direct that data centres and other high-demand electricity customers use their emergency backup generators when electricity is in short supply.  They must all run their generators once every 24 hours.  Why not ask them to run them between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. to take pressure off our electricity grid?</p> <p> We need to, temporarily at least, repower the Derrybrien wind farm.  Any profits from doing that should be ring-fenced for the local community and go towards a local environmental benefit fund.  The Government needs to acquire, through Gas Networks Ireland, a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal to be located either in Cork Harbour or the Shannon Estuary.  It would be ensured that the sourcing of fracked gas would be banned for that facility.  It should use compressed LNG that can be imported from other parts of the globe where it is in surplus supply.  This could be used in the short term as a temporary reservoir to reassure people across this country that the lights will not go off this winter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700053#DDD00200"><p>I welcome this debate and the publication of the report.  It is an incontrovertible fact that our ambition in respect of climate transformation creates risks that we must plan for.  This certainly helps us to do that.  It is equally incontrovertible, however, that the more successful our climate strategy is, the less dependent we will become on imported fossil fuels and all the unsavoury sources that some of those fuels must come from.</p>  <p>  One of the difficulties in the present debate, fuelled by the failure of the last renewable electricity supply scheme, RESS, auction, is that we have distorted the debate about what is important for Ireland and how we can be successful in this regard.  In particular, I deplore the casting of data centres as the villains of the piece.  The reality is that data centres have contributed to a 9% increase in demand over five years.  This should have been capable of being delivered, but the failure of the RESS auction and to generate energy has distorted this situation.  It is commonplace now, though, to hear people in this House pretending that data centres are something to abhor.  The reality is they are the backbone of the digital revolution that brings streaming to our mobile phones, makes remote working possible, frees us from unnecessary journeys and makes our systems smart and enhances our capacity to do things in a better way.  This digital revolution is also central to Ireland's lead in the digital economy, which we have successfully developed over a significant time.  This is not something we should lightly cast aside, nor should we cast aside those at the heart of this as villains in the unfolding challenges we see in the energy market.</p>  <p>  Indeed, in the long term, we have a huge capacity for offshore energy generation.  We also have a competitive advantage in managing data centres because of our climate.  Let us also not forget that data centres are in the electricity trading system under EU rules.  They are not part of the carbon dioxide emissions that we need to manage down through direct policies.  This aspect is done through the trading system which ensures data centres are located in the places where it is most efficient to do so.  To some degree, therefore, we are distorting this debate because we are seeking to forget about this important distinction in EU policy and to pretend that we are ones to make decisions on data centres solely in domestic terms.  In reality, under the provisions of our EU carbon dioxide obligations, it is recognised that data centres, like other things, should be located in the most carbon-efficient locations possible.  In the long term, ours is just such a country, with our offshore capacity for energy generation.  This is not to mention the investment we have made in developing a digital lead.</p>  <p>  I find today's report a challenging read.  At one level, its message is simple.  It states that the mitigation options in an energy security strategy should be such that there is no chance of increasing gas dependence.  From that perspective, this rules out any commercial element because of the risk those companies would want to exploit the gas for commercial purposes.  The report also rules out all options but storage, renewables and stand-by capacity.  It fails, however, to deal with the risks and costs of disruption.  It also does not fully delve in how we should rank the various options it gives the green light to.  It sells us short in allowing us to make the sort of decisions we need to make.  I turn now to those in the House, and this does not include me, who are suspicious of the decision to end gas exploration.</p> <p>The argument for that in this report is less than convincing.  It simply states that further gas exploration could risk more gas dependence.  It could at one level but, at the same time, we have to have regard to the risks it might mitigate and to the fact that it does not have to involve a cost to the State.  We need a more mature debate on this.</p> <p> I welcome that a significant concentration on demand flexibility is being built into this measure.  Demand flexibility is one of the features of data centres.  It should be, as others have said, part of our long-term approach to energy security.</p></speech>

I am glad he referred to data centres and the simplistic narratives we hear about them.  I heard many of them while following the debate in my office, although they were not made by anybody in the Chamber now.</p>  <p>  On the idea that we have failed to develop offshore wind, while I agree we have had a lost decade or 15 years, I wonder what the contributions of some Government and Opposition parties have been on that issue in the past ten or 15 years.  I am tempted to look back and I suspect if I did I would not see any of the type of debate we see now that it is increasingly apparent that we can and should develop an offshore wind industry.  This should have been talked about for a long time and I suspect it has not been.</p>  <p>  Speaking of simplistic narratives, there is a simplistic narrative with respect to the need for liquefied natural gas, LNG, and fossil fuel storage in this country.  The energy security review published in September makes clear that it does not support a commercial LNG storage facility and I subscribe to that view.  There is an alternative vision, one which was criticised during the week by the Irish Academy of Engineering.  As an engineer, I believe the academy's comments do a disservice to the profession.  This is the profession that 100 years ago conceived of the idea of the Ardnacrusha power station, which did so much to take this country from a subservient colony to a country that stood on its own two feet and was brave and ambitious.  I dare say the Irish Academy of Engineering, had it existed back then, would not have supported the ambition of Ardnacrusha.  It stated the energy security review was technically flawed and unrealistic.  I wish it had the vision of Thomas McLaughlin more than 100 years ago and the Cumann na nGaedheal Government back then, which had vision and pursued this project vigorously, committing 20% of the State's resources to building it.  Ardnacrusha did so much for us.</p>  <p>  The vision we have is an alternative to fossil fuels.  It is that we electrify as much of our economy as possible through renewable electricity and use hydrogen and derivatives as a means of storing the excess renewable electricity we might generate.  We have vast potential off our east, south and west coasts.  This is not a technically flawed and unrealistic vision.  There is no technical barrier to it.  It is a challenge of economics, planning and, most important, vision.  The Government is embracing that vision and we can achieve it.  It is about using hydrogen for energy generation when renewable power is not being generated.  It is about building up battery storage capacity across the system and maximising the potential of demand response.  It is about increased interconnection with our neighbours in the UK, France and Belgium.  It is also about pumped storage.  I was glad to see the Silvermines project listed as vital in the energy security review.  This vision is realistic and technically possible.  It is not technically flawed.  We have to embrace and pursue it.  If we do, we will create a better country, economy and planet.</p>  <p>  Much has been made of the challenge with solar.  We will see a solar revolution in this country, notwithstanding the slow start.  Many countries in Europe, in particular the UK, were first off the blocks with solar ten or 12 years ago.  We will catch up and we will see a 450% or 500% increase in solar installations in this country.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet to address the capital acquisitions tax challenge with solar whereby landowners who use more than 50% of their land to develop a solar farm must pay back the 90% relief they received in capital acquisitions tax.  This should have been addressed in the recent budget and it should be addressed as soon as possible.  I have not heard a rationale for this rule, which does not make sense.  For as long as it in place and for as long as there is uncertainty about his, we will see large swathes of land that have potential for solar development locked out and landowners will not get involved.</p></speech>

We have a serious crisis, which is concerning to families and businesses throughout the State that are already grappling with the costs of their electricity.  Many small businesses have closed their doors.  They have given up because they have been unable to meet the costs of electricity and utility bills.  Only last week, I heard of one business in Portarlington, County Laois, a fish-and-chip shop that has been operating in the town for many years, which reluctantly closed its doors because of this situation.  It is very serious and will have a detrimental effect on the local and national economies.  It will destroy businesses and cripple ordinary families throughout the State.  Something needs to be done.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister intervened with any of the electricity companies and, if so, will he brief us on that?  It is my understanding that this is part of his remit.  In other countries, ministers have been proactive in intervening directly with electricity companies.  It is galling for businesses and families in this State to hear the ESB made profits of &euro;390 million in the first six months of this year, while families grapple to put food on the table and must decide between fuel or food.  That is wrong on every level.  Action, not fine words, is needed from the Minister.  I call on him to do just that.</p>  <p>  The situation we face is very concerning.  I am one of only a few Deputies in this House who have attempted regularly to bring the Government and the general political conversation on energy back to reality and away from the hyper-utopian vision that has characterised the debate in recent years.  What are we to make of all of this talk about how wonderful the budget was because it marginally increased the fuel allowance?  That should have been done years ago.  I know many people, particularly pensioners, who were struggling and did not meet the threshold.  The Government does not deserve a pat on the back for this measure.  It should have been done years ago but the Government dragged its heels.  Its decision to finally marginally increase the fuel allowance is certainly not something that deserves fanfare or applause.</p>  <p>  As the Minister well knows, we are in this situation because the Government has opted to maintain its pursuit of a reckless and nonsensical net zero carbon strategy.  This strategy is not only reckless, but obscenely expensive.  We can talk now about rising costs as a result of international factors and how this is all the fault of Mr. Putin, which I accept to a certain degree.  However, it was not Mr. Putin who closed our power plants.</p> <p>It was extreme green ideology.  Two power plants are closed and I am asking for them to be reopened.  One is in Shannonbridge and the other is in Lanesborough.  These plants could be fuelled on biomass.  Farmers could be incentivised to grow biomass.  This would be practical, but I suppose it is too realistic for the Minister.  He tends to go with the reckless options all of the time that pose difficulties and challenges for families and businesses throughout the State.  They are impeding progress and setting us back instead of moving us forward as a country.  The Minister is creating obstacles and setting us back.</p> <p> Let us be clear.  When it comes to comes to costs being imposed on Irish families in the realm of energy and its related carbon reduction policies, nothing can compete with the estimated cost of the low carbon development Bill passed by the majority of the House.  I along with only nine other Deputies opposed the Bill.  At that time I highlighted that the IMF had estimated the cost of implementing the policies in the legislation to be a staggering &euro;180 billion at a minimum.  How does the Minister explain this to the families and businesses that are struggling today?  How does he justify it? I would love to know how he justifies the &euro;180 billion cost of his legislation and his crazy ideas.  Where were all Deputies who now complain about energy security?  When the Bill came before us they were nowhere to be seen.  We warned about the dangers of ruling out viable alternatives such as LNG, oil or gas exploration.</p> <p> The majority of Members of the House have chosen to support and pursue an exclusionary energy policy the has made our fragile energy security even weaker than it already was.  There is an urgent need for reality to break through in the debates we are having with pragmatism, common sense and reality.  We cannot persist in denying the exploration of indigenous resources.  We cannot leave two power plants in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge closed when we face such energy insecurity.  Ireland needs to be self-sufficient when it comes to energy.  Now more than ever the Minister needs to take this on board.</p> <p> It is absolutely ironic that while we have little or no storage capacity in the State, we have endless stores of detached and deluded political rhetoric.  This is one thing there seems to be no shortage of.  We need to change course immediately.  We need energy security.  We need to make sure that Ireland is energy sufficient when it comes to this issue and that we are not left in a state of crisis because we are already entering such a state.</p></speech>

There are three aspects that we need to consider among others.  The immediate key security issue is energy being used as a weapon of war.  The Russian Government as long ago as the summer of 2021 started to turn off the gas supplies to Europe in preparation for the war.  It is clear now its aim was to reduce the storage in the European system prior to the war starting.  That started a spike in prices as early as summer 2021.  This is continuing.  We have gone from a situation whereby Russia provided 40% of European gas to it providing 10%.  This is driving up the price of gas and electricity and all sorts of security risks come with this.  I will not set them out here but the Government has taken a series of measures to try to protect our people in the budget last year and again this year and in the energy credits we are providing.  The second of four electricity credits will be paid next week.  They have been well rehearsed and I do not need to expand on them.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect on another key aspect of this, which is what is happening in the EU, particularly in the European Council of Ministers.  It met again this Tuesday and will meet next month.  These emergency meetings have been central to our response.  There has been a range of measures to try to reduce demand and set mechanisms such as inframarginal pricing so we can get a windfall tax and some of the money unfairly going to the energy industry can be brought back to householders.  As late as this week there was agreement on common purchasing arrangements, changing the benchmarks on how we price gas and putting in circuit breakers so if the price is very volatile we try to take it out of the market.  This includes plans for the storage of gas.  This is one of the reasons, along with a warm winter and relatively low demand in Asia, we have seen some of the extreme prices that we saw this summer coming back down.  The real security risk is likely to be when we have to refill our gas storage for next winter and potentially the winter after that.  While the prices have reduced significantly in recent weeks, we cannot expect that the security crisis has passed.  It has not.  No one can predict what will happen in this war.  I cannot remember which Deputy - perhaps it was Deputy Nolan - said that we do not have gas storage on our island.  We have never had it.  We have never seen the need for it because we were connected, and still are, to what we see as a very secure energy supply through the Kinsale gas field, the Corrib gas field and the connection to the UK and Norwegian gas fields.</p>  <p>  The CEPA study, which we have completed and published, comes at a very timely moment, particularly after the two explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in recent weeks.  It is right for us to look to develop storage as a backup security system.  We should do so in a way that can be future proofed and help us as we develop offshore wind and convert it to hydrogen to give us the capability of also storing hydrogen and shipping it via pipelines.  In future we could be a source of security for our neighbours with gas coming from our system.  It is complex and it is not something we can develop for the immediate crisis this winter.  The report sets us in the right direction on we can and should do.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of time as it is very tight to cover the various aspects of this.  Another element of security is our electricity system.  Deputies are correct to say we are in a tight situation between generation and demand.  We have to be very careful how we get through the next two to three winters.  I would say to Deputy Naughten that the cause of this goes back many years.  It goes back to the middle part of the previous decade particularly, and the difficulty that existed then as we switched from an electricity system dependent on dispatchable baseload generation, all of it fossil fuel, towards a renewables-oriented electricity system.  In this regard, the actual investment and financing of fossil fuel generation became difficult because everyone knew it would not get priority dispatch as wind would be at the centre of our system.  Therefore, people wondered why they should invest in fossil fuel backup when they did not know what the running hours would be.  This was the reality throughout Europe and the world in the new renewable electricity system that was evolving and was where all the money was going.  It took some time through 2016, 2017 and 2018 to devise a new capacity auction system to fit this new reality.  This is why the auctions only occurred in 2018 to provide further backup generation capacity, which we needed, as everyone could see.  Those actions did not deliver.  We have rehearsed this in the House on numerous occasions.  This was largely because some of the equipment that was expected to be able to deliver it was not available from the original equipment manufacturer.  There was also the issue of the planning system being as slow as it is in this country.  The ESB was not able to get its project through the planning system in time to meet the conditions set out in the auction.</p> <p>As has been said, Mr. Dermot McCarthy will be reviewing all that and coming up with further recommendations as to how we structure our system for this reality.  However, that was the centre stage of the problem we had, which has now been addressed by the Government procuring and purchasing emergency generation capacity.  We had a debate about this in the Chamber last night as the emergency legislation was put through the House.  We still have to be very careful, due to high prices, the climate and meeting demand, to do everything to reduce our demand wherever possible.  We must be careful in terms of the peak hours, in particular, because that is when the plants that generate the most expensive power and use the highest amount of fossil fuel run.  This is in addition to the purchase of additional equipment and other auction systems.  Everyone here who made the case for solar, battery and pump storage and the use of additional renewables, such as onshore and offshore wind, are absolutely right.  That is what we are committed to delivering and developing.</p> <p> We will manage to get through this difficult crisis.  In switching to renewables, far from being reckless, as Deputy Nolan put it, I would argue it is the sanest, safest, cheapest, and best option for the Irish people.  Any independent analysis will show that it is the cheapest source.  We have the strongest resources, in which we have real capability and expertise.  The financing and entire energy system, other than the Irish Academy of Engineering it would seem, understand that this is the direction in which the world is going.  The European Union and all its legislation, all the investment house, as well as the United Nations climate system and so on, are saying this is way to go.  This is where the modern, new energy economy is going.  We can and will be good at it.</p> <p> Deputy O'Connor and others have asked why we are not more open to further oil and gas exploration.  There are a variety of reasons for me saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this.  First, it does not provide energy security.  We have gone out 160 times and struck gas three times.  All the easy sites have been checked.  The odds of finding something more is 100:1.  It costs &euro;100 million a pop to do a drill.  It is lunacy.  It is not security.  Second, on a climate basis, we have to stop extracting, exploring and developing new fossil-fuel gas supplies.  If we use the existing proven reserves, the world will burn to a cinder and that we have to stop.</p> <p> I am not sure who raised the Kinsale gas field.  It may have been Deputy Naughten who said that we should use the Kinsale gas field as storage.  I do not agree.  The proposals set out in the CEPA study, about an onshore facility that can convert supplies to hydrogen, are better.  A significant volume of cushion gas would have to be used in the Kinsale gas field to give it the pressure needed to use it as a strategic store.  That would be incredibly expensive, as well as technologically difficult, to deliver.</p> <p> What do we need to invest in?  What is key is the grid; the interconnection to other countries; the smart meters that help us use power in clever ways; the transmission grid, which we need on our island; and the new transmission grid, which we will develop to tap into offshore energy.  That is not sexy or exciting or the centre of huge public debate.  As Deputy Leddin said, it is easier to blame data centres for the source of our woes.  The centre of our success and security will be in creating a balancing system between variable supply and variable demand, by combining our renewable supply and variable demands together, in addition to ensuring interconnection with other countries, north-south as well as east-west.  That is the centre of our security strategy and is the best way forward for us, and it is what I am committed to delivering in our time in government.</p></speech>

For 60 years, the rail system has been starved of investment.  Unlike other countries, Ireland did not see a future for rail.  It perceived that the future would involve a transport system based on private cars and, to some extent, city and intercity buses.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the Government has invested in rail, and Irish Rail is building up its capacity to develop a pipeline of new projects.  One of the critical elements of expanding and turning around the six-decade decline of rail in this country is rail freight.  I was very happy to see some clearance on the Limerick to Foynes line happening in the past week or two.  This 41-km-long line was built in just nine months in the mid-19th century, and I wonder how they did that.  It is good to see the line being cleared now.  All going well, it will be reopened for freight purposes at least.  We would like to see it opened to passenger rail standard and the building of a number of stations along the line in the coming years in places such as Raheen, Patrickswell, Adare, Askeaton and, indeed, in Foynes.  It also complements the ambition to develop our west coast renewable-energy resources.  It is a good project that chimes very well with Government policy.</p>  <p>  Another project the Minister is well aware of is the western rail corridor, which has been talked about for a long time.  Phase 1 of the corridor was the Limerick to Galway leg.  Phase 2 goes north from Galway towards Tuam and Claremorris, connecting to Westport and Castlebar.  I believe there is significant potential for rail freight in the west of Ireland.  This project would support rail freight and the development of the rail network.  I was in Tuam last Saturday.  I took the train as far as Galway and got the bus to Tuam, where about 250 or 300 people, from all parties and from none, attended the gathering.  Various presenters made the case for the reopening of the western rail corridor.  A critical piece of that argument is rail freight.  Since then, I have been speaking to business owners in the west who said they would use the rail network.  They would have a clear use for rail freight if the infrastructure existed.  This is a critically important project but there is a wider question about the future of rail freight in this country.  It seems to me that there is a lot we can do to shift much of the freight, which is carried using road haulage, onto the rail system for transit within the country and for export.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700056#GGG00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for the chance to answer the question.  It is timely due to last week&rsquo;s meeting about the issue of the western corridor and the significant development of the clearance of some of the Foynes line, which I hope is a harbinger of a significant revival, not just of rail freight in our country but for the city of Limerick and surrounding region.  The Shannon area task force will come forward with an important report.  I hope and expect that it will support this type of development and capture the sense of where our future is going.</p>  <p>  This is important for a variety of reason, which I will set out.  First, the national planning framework is correct.  We need better balanced regional development.  We are lopsided on the east coast.  While I am a Dublin Deputy and a Dublin citizen, Dublin will not thrive if Ireland is imbalanced as a country.  We need to develop our other cities so there is counterbalance, which will help solve our housing problems, as well as bringing a whole range of difference benefits.</p> <p>In order to do that, we need to make sure that our cities outside Dublin have the right transport infrastructure.  The all-island rail review, which Arup is assisting with, is due to be completed shortly.  It will come forward with significant recommendation which will also steer us in this direction.</p> <p> It is true that rail freight has been run down strategically and deliberately over many years.  It will be difficult to reverse that.  There are major advantages to the road haulage system, investment in the road network in the intervening period and the fact that distances in Ireland are relatively short.  We face disadvantages and challenges, but if we think about where this country is going in a zero-carbon future, I believe there is a role for the return of rail freight at scale in a variety of different ways.</p> <p> Shannon Foynes is a critical element of that because with the development of the offshore wind industry we discussed earlier, it will come onshore in the likes of Shannon Foynes.  That is likely to be the location place of new industries which use that clean power and converted hydrogen and ammonia.  It makes sense for us to have the best transport infrastructure to port locations where this development is going to take place.  That is why the Shannon Foynes line is important.  We need to be quick and give a clear signal in that regard by reopening the line.</p> <p> It is not just about Shannon Foynes.  The Deputy is correct.  We have to consider the entire rail network.  I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy further south-east.  There is a closed rail line that could be reopened in order to connect Wexford and Waterford ports.  The Waterford to Limerick line is currently underutilised.  We have to ask ourselves whether we abandon or restore and revive it.  I believe the latter is where we should go.  </p> <p> Taking such a perspective on what might be called an Atlantic rail corridor, running from Waterford to Limerick and up the west coast, with spurs to Shannon Foynes and Cork Harbour, would connect our deep water ports where the new offshore wind energy industries are going to develop.  It also makes sense in that regard to continue the line by connecting from Athenry to Claremorris and Ballina and all points in between.  That would start to bring us an integrated network.</p> <p> In terms of where we might locate inland rail rate rail freight ports, we could have load on load off container terminals with rail connections to the quayside transporting containers to inland rail marshalling yards.  To my mind, that would be a very viable rail freight opportunity for this country.  There would be lower carbon emissions and it would be less expensive in a variety of different ways.  It would be a real signal that the benefit can be not only a freight line, but as we start to revive and build up a real capability it has the potential to be a residential or metropolitan rail system for the Limerick region.  It would be part of four lines that are currently underutilised.  It would turn the city's development around and help it to thrive.</p></speech>

I am happy to hear him expand on the vision for rail freight and for rail in general.  It is a very coherent and important vision for us to follow.  It chimes incredibly well with the policy agenda and ambition of the Government.  It is generally shared these days across the political spectrum.</p>  <p>  I was happy to hear the Minister mention the potential of the south east.  Our colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, will certainly welcome the Minister's words on Wexford to Waterford line.</p>  <p>  I want to mention the situation at Dublin Port.  I understand there is a plan to move the rail freight operation back from the quay.  This could be a retrograde step.  A number of people have expressed concerns about it and have said it could impact the future of rail freight in this country if that happens.  All our ports should have enabling rail right up to the quayside so that there can be a load on load off facility.  That is true of Dublin Port.  Rosslare is a similar example, where rail was pulled back from the quayside there a number of years ago.</p>  <p>  I am happy to hear the Minister mention the Limerick network.  Limerick city is unique in the Irish context as a regional city because it has four rail lines going in and out of it.  We need to think about Limerick differently to how we think about Waterford, Cork and Galway because it has infrastructure that if we were to build is from scratch would cost billions of euro and probably would not develop.  The infrastructure is in place; we need to upgrade and developer it and see it for the asset it is.  I look forward to seeing the Moyross train station built under the Pathfinder project in the next number of years.  It should be the first of many new suburban rail stations around Limerick and Clare.</p></speech>

Dublin Port has argued that it could not run the rail lines which it currently does the quayside but instead shunt containers by truck from the port to the Sheriff Street area.  Irish Rail has argued that has huge disadvantages and needs the area for its operations, and that once there are double or several movements things become very expensive.  I tend to agree with Irish Rail.</p>  <p>  We are going to go with railhead to the quayside in Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Shannon Foynes, why would we exclude the largest port in the State from a similar strategy and create, in effect, a disconnected network?  We will have to wait at the what the Arup report said.  As the Deputy knows, it comprises independent engineers.  Let us see what it delivers.</p>  <p>  Over 90% of the roll-on roll-off haulage in Ireland comes through Dublin Port and is driven through the port tunnel.  I was on the M50 on the morning in question, and it was gridlocked.  There was an accident and I was on the road for an hour with trucks sitting in the same gridlock.  The benefit of having a balanced system with the development of Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Wexford, as well as other ports, is that we can get that balance in the system and are not putting all of the pressure on Dublin.  </p>  <p>  With regard to Limerick and investment in rail, it will take time to turn the city back to how things worked throughout its history.  For five decades, we have ignored rail lines and run them down.  As soon as we opened the Ennis line, it exceeded all expectations.  People want to use public transport, but we have not provided it.  We have had too much emphasis on other methods of transport.  We have to view this as a long-term investment.</p>  <p>  The State failed to do develop Limerick sufficiently well.  The Buchanan report made recommendations in the 1960s.  We have nowhere near the population Limerick was expected to have.  When we invest in rail lines we have to think in terms of 50 and 100 years.  We need to think of a Limerick twice its size, which is what it should be, in order to be the capital of the mid-west and continue as a successful manufacturing, trading and education centre.  In order to do that, we need to invest and think big and at scale.  The four lines need to be metropolitan services with electric battery trains running at a regular frequency in order that as the city grows, which it needs to do, it will do so along rail lines rather than along roads.  If it grows along roads, not only will that not work for climate, the mathematics will not work.  There will be too many cars and gridlock for everyone.

At the heart of Finglas village are the ruins of the old St. Canice's church, with its ancient graveyard beside Barrack Lane.  Despite being at the heart of a busy modern suburban town, framed by housing estates and a dual carriageway leading to the M50, the old church and its grounds and graveyards are full of trees, greenery and birdsong and a haven for wild animals.  The old church offers visitors a surprisingly quiet and tranquil place of repose.</p> <p>Entering the grounds of the old church is like stepping back in time.  Around and within the ruins of the church are various types of ancient burial places, including a burial vault and table and box tombs.  The old graves are marked by a variety of grave markers, including headstones, iron crosses and obelisks, many of which are too weathered to be read.<br/><br/>The old church was, according to tradition, built on the site of St. Canice's monastery, which itself was built in the 10th and 11th centuries.  Records show that the church was used in 1657 but it is clear from other records that it was established much earlier than this.  There is ample evidence of a Viking site having been established nearby.  In fact, the remains of an adult Viking female were discovered in 2004, along with Viking artefacts that are now on display in the National Museum of Ireland.  Located just outside the walls of the graveyard are a number of ancient wells that were buried during the construction of apartments nearby.<br/><br/>Some noted celebrities are buried in the graveyard of the church, including Eliza Wollstonecraft whose niece, Mary Shelley, wrote <i>Frankenstein</i>as well as the graves of bishops and archbishops.  A grave of particular interest inside the church mentions Captain Edward Spencer, whose family is buried there and who was related to the Spencers of Althorp through his second wife and thus, is related to Lady Diana Spencer, Princess of Wales.<br/><br/>In addition, the grounds of the church contain the Nethercross from where the barony in which Finglas parish is located gets its name.  According to legend, this cross was buried by the parishioners as Cromwellian forces approached the village.  The cross remained buried until it was rediscovered by the Reverend Robert Walsh in the early 19th century.  It is believed to be approximately 1,000 years old and is the only high cross in Dublin.  Unfortunately, the Nethercross is now quite weathered, which makes it difficult to see the intricate carvings that once adorned it.  The people of Finglas want the cross preserved and protected in its present location in the graveyard.<br/><br/>A major study of the old church and its grounds was carried out by 7L Architects on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Dublin City Council, DCC.  A comprehensive report was issued last April which outlined a conservation management plan for the church and grounds.  To conserve these magnificent ruins properly, the church needs to be roofed and have its walls completed and the church needs to be returned to public.  A museum to house the history of Finglas and its environs would be a fitting way to preserve our local and national history for future generations.</p></speech>

It was established in 2020 under the July jobs stimulus package and had an initial fund of just over &euro;1 million.  I am delighted that the grants awarded under this scheme totalled &euro;6 million for 2022, including a grant to St Canice&rsquo;s, which indicates the success of the fund over the past few years.  The community monuments fund invests essential capital in our valuable archaeological heritage and helps owners and custodians of archaeological monuments to safeguard them into the future for the benefit of communities and the public.</p>  <p>  Part of this funding is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians and community groups for the care, conservation, maintenance, protection and promotion of archaeological monuments and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access over the past few years of the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  The impacts of climate change on our monuments is increasingly evident.  With increased weathering and severe climate events, the repair cycle on built heritage is likely to become shorter.  Increased maintenance and repair will be key to building resilience in our monuments, to enable them to withstand the effects of a changing environment.  The CMF plays a key role in mitigating the effects of climate-related events at our national monuments.</p>  <p>  The core aims of this fund are the conservation, maintenance, protection and presentation of archaeological monuments.  It enables conservation works to be carried out on monuments which are deemed to be significant and in need of urgent support.  It also builds resilience in our monuments to enable them to withstand the effects of climate change and it encourages access to monuments and improves their presentation.  In addition, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage encourages projects to incorporate a traditional skills training element.</p>  <p>  The community monuments fund has three streams.  Stream 1 offers grants aimed at essential repairs and capital works for the conservation and repair of archaeological monuments.  Stream 2 offers grants for development of conservation management plans and reports and detailed specification of works that are aimed at identifying measures for conservation of archaeological monuments and improving public access.  Stream 3 offers grants for enhancement of access infrastructure and interpretation, including virtually and online, at our archaeological monuments.  St. Canice&rsquo;s graveyard is a national monument in the ownership of the local authority.  I am pleased to confirm that it was awarded a grant of just under &euro;30,000 in 2021 and a further award of &euro;85,000 in 2022.  It is important that be recognised.  I have no doubt an application for further funding will be made in the year ahead.</p></speech>

I appeal to the Minister of State and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to talk to DCC about the need for further funding.  A substantial amount is needed for this property.  If it were not for local people who look after this, such as the Lynch family who have done decades of magnificent work on the graveyard, Finglas tidy towns, volunteers and the Finglas historical society, the graveyard would be far worse off.</p>  <p>  I would love for someone to look at this graveyard.  The church is a magnificent building that needs to be preserved and in working order for the people.  It would work as a museum and would be an ideal place to anchor a museum for the history of the area, not just for the people of Finglas, but for those around.  We saw what happened with the Nethercross, which was a very big, symbolic cross at the time Cromwell was coming through Finglas.  Residents buried the cross to hide it from him, which shows how important the Nethercross and this building are.  The graveyard is steeped in history.  One can see it and feel it.</p>  <p>  Finglas deserves better.  It deserves respect and the church and graveyard deserve to be brought back to life in a meaningful way.</p></speech>

I am glad that the Deputy recognises that funding has been secured.  I did not realise that earlier.  Some &euro;115,000 was allocated over the past two years to recognise the importance of the monument on which I have no doubt the Deputy wants to build.</p>  <p>  The CMF helps to progress heritage projects throughout the country to ensure that heritage is protected as a community asset and made more accessible to complement the work happening in the community.  Locals such as the Lynch family are making that happen.  It is fitting that the fund is there to support such work.  The measure also allows steps to be taken under the climate change action plan with regard to our archaeological heritage and creates employment for many small businesses, skilled conservation specialists and tradespeople involved in heritage-related construction activity. </p>  <p>  Significant funding to the tune of &euro;115,000 has been awarded under the CMF for works at St. Canice&rsquo;s graveyard over the past couple of years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, hopes to announce details of the scheme for 2023 in the coming weeks and departmental officials would be happy to accept an application for funding of further works at St Canice&rsquo;s.  It is important that the application process be tracked.</p>  <p>  I express my sincere thanks to the local authority staff, the local community and those in the National Monuments Service, all of whom work diligently to ensure the success of this fund.  I encourage all custodians of national monuments to consider putting together applications for the fund for 2023.  The Deputy may talk to the committee to make sure it gets ready for the application process that will open in the near future.</p></speech>

In short, it is not working for the people who need it the most and therein lies the problem.  I and many colleagues in the House see the homes that need to be made warmer and more energy efficient are being refused the assistance needed because of the nature of the house, the manner in which it was built or certain features that make it ineligible.  Ability to pay is another aspect of this but I will leave that until later on.</p>  <p>  This issue relates to stone-built structures.  There are many such homes, houses and cottages throughout rural Ireland.  They were generally built prior to the 1950s and many long before then.  They are not that uncommon, yet judging by the response these households have had to their inquiries about retrofits, one would think they were a rare occurrence that never entered the minds of those who developed the scheme.  They are generally so old because they were built to last.  They were also built to adapt to the heating methods of the time, that is, open fire and back boiler heating.  Such homes are usually lived in by elderly people, some parents or grandparents, who have stayed in the family home all their lives.  They have been refused the help they need.  A householder in my constituency was refused on the basis the works that can be carried out would not get their building up to the regulation required, so they are left at that.  They are essentially excluded.</p>  <p>  These homes can have very thick walls.  I grant that presents its own set of challenges but why was this not planned for when rolling out the scheme?  When I raised this via a parliamentary question, I was told these structures were characterised as "traditionally built" buildings and that due to the nature of the mortar used, and issues of vapour trapping and so on, they are more complicated to insulate.  That is fair enough but why was this not taken into account when the scheme was being prepared?</p>  <p>  If these people are to wait until the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage prepares a new technical guidance document, which is what I have been told, then they are to be put at the back of a very long queue.  The scheme has not been well-prepared.  It is discriminating against those with meagre means, and sidelines those who do not have the means for a full refit.  That is the truth of it.  These households typically heat their homes with turf and timber and are now being told that they cannot do that.  The Government devised a scheme suited to those with the greatest means and not those in greatest need.  Homeowners such as those I mentioned, as well as people living in energy poverty and in greatest need of help, are being left behind by the scheme.  What is the Government doing to ensure these households will be attended to when the report is finished and that they will not be left at the back of the queue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700059#KKK00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for giving me the opportunity to give him an update on the Government's supports for home retrofit.  In order to hit our targets we need to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 and install 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by the end of 2030.  This represents about 30% of our housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide.</p>  <p>  The national retrofit plan was published last November as part of the climate action plan and it sets out how the Government will deliver these targets.  The plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key pillars: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance.  Recognising that the achievement of our climate action plan targets will require a step-change in the pace and scale of delivery of Ireland's residential retrofit programme, earlier this year the Government approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  These initiatives have resulted in a significant increase in demand and delivery under Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, schemes.</p>  <p>  Older, stone-built homes, by which I mean those generally built until around the 1940s, usually fall into the category of "traditionally built" buildings.  Traditionally built homes and buildings are considerably more complex to retrofit.  The term "traditionally built" generally refers to those buildings built with solid walls, which often have a lime- or earthen-based render finish.  This was the dominant form of building construction in Ireland until the second quarter of the 20th century and includes stone-built dwellings.  The primary difference between traditional and modern construction is the way that moisture is managed.  Traditional materials and construction techniques allowed for the natural transfer of heat and moisture.  Solid masonry walls therefore relied on their thickness to cope with atmospheric moisture by being sufficiently thick that drying out took place before external moisture reached the inside of the building.  This means standard retrofit solutions are often not suitable for use with traditional buildings as they can lead to adverse and unintended consequences for the building fabric and the health or well-being of the occupants.  Energy-efficiency upgrade solutions appropriate to such materials and methods are needed in these cases.  As an example, a stone wall with lime-based mortar will need a lime-based plaster render to remain vapour permeable.</p>  <p>  A significant proportion of homes and buildings that will need to be retrofitted fall into this category of "traditionally built".  While these homes can be eligible for SEAI support subject to the scheme eligibility criteria and terms and conditions being met, uncertainty about what retrofit treatments are allowable or appropriate has contributed to a limited amount of whole-house energy-efficiency upgrades on these buildings.  For example, a householder could get a house's attic insulated but not the walls, if the SEAI terms and conditions cannot be met.  Government fully agrees it is essential that we have both the standards and supports in place for the retrofitting of all types of housing to ensure that the principles of universality and fairness underpinning the retrofit plan are met.</p>  <p>  As set out in the plan, a new guidance document focused on energy efficiency in traditional buildings is being developed to support the proper upgrading of such buildings.  This guidance document draws on expert multidisciplinary advice and expertise and will also include case studies.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is taking the lead on this project, which will also involve experts from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the SEAI.  The guidance will show that for many traditional buildings, a BER of B2 or above can often be achieved in a way appropriate to the building.  It is hoped the guidance can be completed by the end of the year.  Once available it is intended the guidance will form the standard underpinning any SEAI supports for the renovation work of traditional buildings.  Any relevant, available SEAI retrofit grants or supports will align with the best practice guidance when it is published.</p></speech>

I appreciate the figures the Minister of State just rolled out to me.  That is what we get every time we have a Topical Issue debate.  I appreciate the Government wants 500,000 homes with a BER of B2 but I am talking about the homes that are generally the ones losing the most heat.  They are likely to be occupied by the elderly in our communities who need the retrofitting more than the owners of a mansion down the road who, because they can afford &euro;50,000, can then get another &euro;50,000 from the Government.  I am talking about the homes that are being left behind.  Sometimes I think the way these schemes are put together has more to do with the need for the Government to look as if it is doing something rather than the plight of people living in these inefficient homes.  That is not what this scheme, or any other, should be based on.</p>  <p>  The Government often speaks of the importance of our built heritage but that built heritage needs specific measures.  The Minister of State mentioned stone walls with lime-based mortar will need a lime-based plaster render - so be it.  If that is what it takes then that is what should be done to ensure these homes are brought up a level of efficiency where they are not losing heat.  Will the Minster of State review the scheme that has been rolled out and devise a way to implement it such that the scale of work that can be done is not determined by a person's ability to pay but the level of need?  As I said, the level of need is high as most of these buildings are cottages in rural areas occupied by elderly people.  They have lived all their lives there and these homes are being left behind by this scheme.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to revise it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700059#KKK00500"><p>I will take the Deputy's comments to the Minister and discuss this with him.  I take the Deputy's point there is a real problem for these stone houses.  As he says, they are likely to be lived in by people who could be in energy poverty, people who are older, people in remote locations in rural areas and so on, and this needs to be addressed.  That is why the guidelines are being worked out.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy acknowledged, these houses are different and they need different treatment.  We need guidance for the people who are carrying out the retrofit work.  We had experience a decade ago of retrofit work being done by people without sufficient guidance.  They tried to put in the insulation or do the work and we ended up with buildings that did not improve in energy rating.</p>  <p>  In this case we have a specific problem about moisture and the risk of it being locked in and houses being damp, and so on.  One can insulate very heavily and end up in a situation where one is trapping moisture within a house.  That work on the guidance must be done and it is expected it will be complete by the end of the year.  I will mention it to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I accept where the Deputy is coming from on this, though I want him to accept the Government's plan for retrofit allocates the majority of the funding for retrofit of housing to initiatives with zero cost to the homeowner and targeted specifically at people either living in local authority housing or on welfare payments.</p> <p>The majority of the more than &euro;350 million funding for this year and the more than &euro;500 million for next year will be targeted at people receiving 100% grants.  This is an energy poverty measure and it needs to be targeted.  One of the primary duties of the Government is to keep people warm in their homes in the winter, particularly those who are having difficulty paying for heating.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700060#LLL00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for attending this debate.  I hope we can all agree with the intention behind this Bill, which attempts to progress an issue on which work is long overdue.  The aim of the Bill is to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 to provide a right for minors over the age of 16 to consent to mental health treatment and to provide for related matters.  We simply want to give 16- and 17-year-olds the same legal right to consent to mental health treatment that they have to consent to physical health and dental treatment.  The Bill aims to rectify this disparity in law.</p>  <p>  This change has been recommended by many, including the Law Reform Commission, the HSE, the report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 and others.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Oireachtas committee's report on its pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft heads of Bill to amend the 2001 Act also includes a recommendation on this issue.  There appears to be real cross-party agreement on this but we need the change to be a priority.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in understand the urgency of this change, which is included in the programme in the Government.  We are willing to work with Members on all sides of the House and to take on board any suggestions to strengthen the Bill.</p>  <p>  This is a progressive mental health Bill that acknowledges and supports our young people and will bring much-needed reform to the capacity and quality of youth mental health services.  In general, parity between the treatment of mental health and physical health is something we all must aim to achieve.  In my county of Wexford, the latest figures I have received show there are 19 young people waiting more than a year for mental health treatment.  The only out-of-hours mental health care for children and adolescents is provided through an acute hospital setting.  Mental health issues do not go away at 5 p.m. on a Friday and they cannot be put on a waiting list.  We have a long way to go yet in providing the quality of services our children and young people need and deserve.</p>  <p>  This legislation is also about destigmatising mental health treatment.  It recognises that mental health issues should be treated like any other health issue.  By working together, we are showing the Oireachtas is a place in which issues around mental health and mental health conditions can be discussed from a position of empathy and care.  It is important to clarify that the Bill does not take away any protections from vulnerable young people.  Capacity legislation provides protections for vulnerable adults and those protections should also apply to 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>  <p>  The Bill goes a long way to protect one of the most fundamental principles of any civilisation, which is the right for people to be who they are.  By ensuring the freedom to consent to or refuse treatment, we can play a role in tackling the many facets of so-called conversion therapy.  For too long, the criminalisation of sexual orientation and the associated exclusion of individuals existed in our country.  As a State, we have a responsibility to our citizens and especially our young people, whose protection must be a priority.  It is shameful that conversion therapy is still legal in this country.  One can only imagine what it must be like to have therapy used, emotionally or physically, to cure or repair a person's sexuality.  This is debased and sordid and it must be challenged and confronted in the strongest possible terms.</p>  <p>  We must recognise and acknowledge that the Irish people have come a long way in their progressive thinking and their desire for equality in the way we live our daily lives.  The result of the referendum on same-sex marriage was testament to that.  In this Bill, we, as legislators, have an opportunity to bring about what I believe is the will of the people, which is to protect young people from the harms of conversion therapy until it is banned in law once and for all.  The Bill provides an opportunity to bring ourselves into line with the principles of Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which concerns the right to be heard.  We cannot in all conscience shy away from what needs to be done and what should have been done a long time ago.</p>  <p>  I thank my colleague Deputy Ward for his outstanding work on this Bill, Senator Warfield for his work on the Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018, former Senator M&aacute;ire Devine, who campaigned on this issue for years, and all of those who have contributed to the debate.  I hope the Minister of State and Members will accept what we are trying to do in this Bill and will work with us to progress it through the House.  To do so would be the essence of a good republic.  As Thomas Jefferson once said: "The care of human life and happiness ... is the first and only legitimate object of good government."</p></speech>

It corrects the anomaly whereby minors aged 16 and over have the right to consent to treatment in general healthcare but do not have similar rights in consenting to mental health treatment.  The Bill brought forward by my colleagues, Deputies Ward and Mythen, will ensure a minor aged over 16 will be recognised before the law and will be able to make informed decisions about his or her mental health treatment.  The existing difference in approach is clearly discriminatory in that it views those with mental health issues as being somehow incapable of making informed decisions.  This approach only adds to the stigma many feel around mental health and to their feeling of exclusion in society.</p>  <p>  Accepting that minors over the age of 16 are perfectly capable of making decisions about their mental health treatment, as this Bill aims to do, will help to change the misconceptions and barriers that can arise as a result of a lack of understanding by others of those with mental health issues.  It will also help to change the way people judge those who have such issues.  Young people with mental health difficulties can articulate their own vision of the services they need.  They are increasingly able to make informed decisions about their treatment and other matters in their daily lives.  There is no doubt that the needs of people with mental health disorders could be better understood and their rights better protected.  This Bill addresses one such situation.  Young people should be able to play an active part in the process, including the planning, development, monitoring and evaluation of their treatment.  The Bill will change the existing legal position whereby it is not the minor aged 16 or older but his or her parents with whom the right exists to consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment for that minor.  This welcome change can only have a positive impact on the well-being and mental health of those young people.  It will give them more confidence and will be important for their self-esteem.</p></speech>

Too often, Ministers are not in attendance for debates.  I thank Deputies Ward and Mythen for introducing the Bill and former Senator M&aacute;ire Devine for the work she did on it during her time in the Seanad.  Its purpose is to introduce a level of parity between the ability of young people aged 16 and 17 to consent to mental health treatment and their existing ability to consent to treatment for their physical health.</p>  <p>  For too long in this country, mental health has been seen as something that is secondary to physical health.  The result of this kind of attitude is a level of service that is insufficient and not readily available in our communities when it is needed.  It has led to a service that has ultimately left many people to fend for themselves when all they need is support and treatment.  The aspect we are discussing today concerns enabling young people of 16 and 17 to consent to appropriate treatment.  It makes total sense.  I know many people of that age who are active campaigners for appropriate mental health services for their age group.  Unfortunately, many of them have been at the coalface of insufficient services or been in scenarios in which they were the ones who needed the treatment but found they were spoken over rather than spoken to.</p>  <p>  One such campaigner in my constituency, Charlotte, has brought to my attention the issues she faced when seeking support and treatment.  While I am aware this Bill cannot address all the deficiencies within our mental health services, I want to give voice to her concerns and experiences.</p> <p>At times she did not feel listened to or treated as appropriate for her age.  She and the young people she speaks to want to see a mental health service that adapts to the type of patients that present.  Then there is the manner of how a person in a crisis situation is supposed to present in an emergency department.  At Tipperary University Hospital there was meant to be a room solely for the purpose of people presenting with a mental health issue but nobody I have spoken to has ever been in that room.  There is no liaison psychiatrist for children in my HSE region.  It is hard to imagine, but there is none.  These are just some of the issues that young people are campaigning on.  I commend them on that and will continue to support them in their efforts.</p> <p> When introducing this Bill in 2021, Deputy Mythen noted that it was meant to be about the rights and protection of young people, the right to be heard and how this needed to be expressly stated through legislation.  He said that this was what this Bill would do.  This Bill may help to lay the groundwork for more focused effort being made to tailor services to properly take account of young people's needs and, just as importantly, their insights.  It is time young people aged 16 and 17 have autonomy to consent to and avail of appropriate mental health treatment while not taking away any existing protections for vulnerable young people.  Young people have plenty of insights to give into how the system should work.  It would be hard to say that they should not have the capacity to consent or otherwise.  I commend my colleagues on introducing this Bill and thank all who worked on it so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-27a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102700061#MMM00200"><p>I commend Deputies Ward and Mythen on introducing the Bill before us today and on their continuing interest in and their focus on improving our mental health services and legislation.  I thank Deputies Brown and Ellis for being here tonight.  On Thursday nights we do not see many people here, so I thank them for their interest.  I have no problem coming in here at any time to discuss mental health and I appreciate that they have stayed here tonight to discuss it and the constructive way in which they have addressed this.</p><p>I am happy to be here discussing the Mental Health (Capacity to Consent to Treatment) Bill 2021.  The principal aim is to ensure that a child of 16 or 17 years of age can consent to any mental health treatment without the need to obtain the consent of his or her parents or guardians.  We are all 100% in agreement on that.  That needs to happen. </p><p>At the outset, I would like to say that the Government supports the aims of the Bill wholeheartedly and has declared its intent to make such a change in the general scheme to amend the Mental Health Act published in July last year, which is the basis for the mental health Bill.  That Bill is currently being drafted and will be included in priority legislation in the next session after Christmas.  The Bill is already well in progress.  It is a very large Bill with more than 120 heads.  Much of the drafting is already complete.  I believe the general scheme of the Bill I will bring forward in January, for which I hope to have Members' support, will address this matter in a more comprehensive way.</p><p>Based on a number of issues with this Bill, as drafted, which I will presently discuss, the Government is opposing it.  I agree completely with what the Deputies are trying to achieve.  We have so much work done on it in regard to in the new Bill that is coming forward, so that is the reason. </p><p>The amendments proposed in this Bill should be addressed as part of the wider, comprehensive reforms of the Mental Health Act, as set out in the general scheme, which will be the basis for the new mental health Bill.  The Deputies' Bill recognises that while legislation provides that a child is someone under the age of 18, there needs to be recognition in legislation of the fact that a young person of 16 or 17 years of age should be presumed to be able to make his or her own decisions where his or her mental health care is concerned.  In this regard it is already the case that a child of 16 or 17 years of age has the right to consent to any surgical, medical or dental treatment.  This provision is contained in section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  That section also covers any procedure undertaken for the purposes of diagnosis and any procedure, such as administration of anaesthetic, which is ancillary to treatment.</p><p>However, as the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 pointed out, there has been ongoing uncertainty as to how the 1997 Act interacts with the provisions of the 2001 Act.  In other words, it is not clear whether a young person of 16 or 17 years of age can consent to his or her mental health treatment under section 23.  The expert group recommended that legislative clarity be provided for to ensure that there will be no difference for a young person of 16 or 17 years, who should be able to consent to mental health treatment on the same basis as physical health treatment.  This is also a recommendation of the youth mental health task force, which reported in 2017, and it is this gap that Deputies Ward and Mythen and their colleagues seek to address in the Bill.</p><p>We all recognise the importance of modernising our mental health legislation and ensuring our approach to young people and capacity is in line with evolving international human rights standards.  The findings of the expert group and the youth mental health task force serve to underline the importance of this work.  In all cases the best interests of the child or young person should be of paramount importance, so too in all cases must the views and will and preferences of the child or young person be taken into account whenever a decision is being made about him or her.  It is generally accepted that the evolving capacity of young people means that, when a young person reaches the age of 16, he or she should automatically be presumed to have the capacity to make decisions about his or her own care and treatment.  This is the principal aim of this Bill and it is also one of the principal aims of the mental health Bill.</p><p>I would now like to take some time to discuss the specifics of the Bill before the D&aacute;il today, the aim of which I fully support.  The Bill, as written, does not provide for an amendment to section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  It is not clear from the amendments proposed in section 3 of the Bill whether young people will be able to consent to mental health treatment outside of treatment provided in an approved centre or treatment provided by a healthcare professional other than a consultant psychiatrist.  It would not be desirable for a situation to arise where a young person can consent only to certain kinds of mental health treatment or only in specific settings.  The general scheme to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 includes a specific provision to amend section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Act to specifically include mental health treatment.  This will ensure that young people can consent to mental health treatment on the same basis as physical health treatment.</p><p>The Bill starts from a position that presumes that all young people over 16 years of age have the capacity to consent to treatment.  However, the Bill does not include a mechanism for healthcare professionals who have reasonable doubts as to the capacity of the young person to carry out a capacity assessment.  The issue of capacity to give a valid consent may arise in any given case.  Just as an adult may not be competent to give a valid consent, a young person of 16 or 17 years may not be competent either to give that consent.  This may give rise to a situation where a young person who lacks capacity to make decisions about himself or herself cannot be treated when he or she refuses to consent, and where it is not possible to get parental consent.  That is one area we would be concerned about.</p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and its amending Bill currently being progressed through the Oireachtas do not apply to individuals under 18 years of age, so it would not be possible to rely on the provisions of that Act to assess the capacity of 16- and 17-year-olds.  To address this issue the mental health Bill will include provisions to task the Mental Health Commission with introducing a code of practice in regard to capacity assessments for young people akin to the assessments and supports available to adults under the Assisted Decision-Making Act.  The Bill before us to today does not remove any provisions in the existing Mental Health Act and continues to make reference to consent granted by a parent or guardian.  Clarity is needed on how the existing provisions of the Act would interact with the amendments in this Bill, particularly where consent is concerned.  For example, what would happen in a situation where a child refuses but a parent consents, or <i>vice versa</i>?  It would require very careful consideration to ensure the intent of the Bill is retained where the existing provisions of the Act remain in place.</p><p>The presumption of capacity for young people aged 16- and 17-years of age to consent to mental health treatment is a priority for the Government and is set out in the programme for Government.  As I said, it is included in priority legislation for the next legislative session.  We are all in agreement as to the importance of ensuring that 16- and 17-year-olds can consent to mental health treatment on the same basis as physical health.  We are all in total agreement on that point.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to set out briefly the ongoing work of my Department on the now concluded review of the 2001 Act and the development of a mental health Bill, which will address the issues raised in this Bill, and will be based on the published general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001.</p>  <p>There are numerous general changes in the Bill that will positively affect children, such as the revision of the criteria for detention to ensure treatment forms the basis for all cases of involuntary detention, and the expansion of the Mental Health Commission's regulatory powers to regulate all mental health residential facilities - that is not there currently - beyond approved centres and eventually all community mental services.  However, today I would like to focus on the changes proposed in the general scheme that are specific to children and young people.</p> <p> The mental health Bill will introduce a set of guiding principles for children adapted from the principles recommended by the expert group and from those contained in the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018.  These guiding principles will retain the best interests principle as the primary consideration in the care and treatment of children, as is obligated by our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Similar to the Bill before us today, the guiding principles will provide for the presumption of capacity for all young people over 16 years of age and for young people aged under 16 years to ensure their views, will and preferences are considered when making a decision about their care and treatment.</p> <p> In line with empowering young people to make their own decisions, the Bill will provide for an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to state explicitly that young people aged 16 and 17 should be able to consent to treatment for mental health on the exact same basis as physical health.</p> <p> The Bill will provide for an overhauled approach to admission of young people to approved centres, particularly in cases when a young person over the age of 16 lacks the capacity necessary to consent to their own admission on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, the young person will be able to be admitted with the consent of his or her parent or guardian, but would be admitted on an intermediate basis, where his or her continued admission and treatment would be reviewed by the District Court after a period of time if the young person is still not able to consent.</p> <p> The intention of the Department is that the same principles that apply to capacity in relation to adults would generally apply to young people aged 16 and 17, even if the process is different.  To address this issue, the Department has provided for the Mental Health Commission, which is also the home of the Decision Support Service, to make codes of practice in relation to capacity and its assessment.</p> <p> The revised approach to admission, which takes into account the capacity of each young person and respects the importance of consent, is also mirrored in the revised approach to treatment.  The Bill will provide for all young people over 16 years of age to consent to or refuse treatment.  When a young person has been deemed to lack capacity to make decisions, safeguards will be in place to ensure treatment can be given with parental consent or by application to the court.  The Bill will also introduce additional safeguards for children and young people, including: access to information for all children and young people detailing their rights; information on their admission and treatment and other relevant information in a form young people can understand; the very important introduction of an individual care plan for all children and young people receiving care in an approved centre; and the introduction of defined powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to children, emphasising the need to protect the rights of the child or young person.</p> <p> A priority for this Government is ensuring appropriate and accessible mental health services for children who need them, especially those in emergency situations.  I would like to speak briefly about some of our services.  In this year's budget, I managed to secure significant additional funding for our mental health services, notwithstanding competing priorities overall, and a record allocation of &euro;1.2 billion has been provided for mental health services in 2023.  Mental health services for children and young people are one of my key priorities - I know they are the Deputies' as well - and they are prioritised within the mental health budget.  Examples of service initiatives under budget 2023 for mental health include: reducing the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and primary care psychology; implementation of the Maskey report on CAMHS, of which 16 of the 35 recommendations have already been implemented; new accommodation for mental health teams; progressing clinical programmes, such as eating disorders, adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and self-harm; developing out-of-hours supports and crisis resolution teams; funding to open the new central mental hospital at Portrane; &euro;750,000 to commence a new initiative to fund counselling psychology trainees; additional funding for the Traveller health plan and implementation of the mental health actions of the plan; and additional suicide crisis assessment nurses, known as SCANs, to improve early intervention and crisis support in primary care settings to ease pressure on emergency departments and waiting lists.</p> <p> Last month I was also pleased to announce a new role to support my continued focus on youth mental health, namely, a youth mental health lead at assistant national director level within the HSE.  This is a dedicated new post that will act as a focus for youth mental health within the HSE, as well as a liaison across education, youth, justice and with Tusla.  Funding for this post is included in this year's budget and recruitment is due to commence immediately.</p> <p> I am satisfied that the HSE is working to provide the best possible service within available staffing resources and it has my full support in this regard.  I would also like to take the opportunity, once again, to thank Deputies Mythen and Ward and all of the members of the Sub-Committee on Mental Health, particularly Senator Frances Black in her role as Chair, and the committee secretariat for the extensive work they put into the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme.  Many hours have gone into it.  The report and its recommendations will be closely considered in the final Bill.</p> <p> In concluding, I again thank Deputies Mythen, Ellis and Browne for being here tonight and introducing the Bill.  Notwithstanding my opposition to this Bill proposed, we are in agreement that the principle of the changes being proposed needs to be made and I am certain that this can be achieved in the mental health Bill as part of the suite of changes planned in the Bill to bring a person-centred, human rights-based approach to our mental health legislation.</p></speech>

We are a little bit disappointed that the Bill is not being supported.  However, we also recognise that it is not about who brings forward the Bill, rather, it is about consent and the right of consent of people aged 16 and 17.  That is what it is about.  We will work together on this.  I am glad the Minister of State accepted the principle that we put forward.</p>  <p>  We look forward to the Bill in the next session, with Christmas being so close.  As I said, it is more than overdue.  We can all tell tales about what happened to people in our own areas.  This is an important issue for us.</p>  <p>  As I said, we are glad that the legislation is coming through.  We accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s observations, which are valid.  However, as I said at the very start, it does not matter who brings forward the Bill, once it is passed.</p>  <p>  I thank my colleagues, Deputies Ellis and Browne, for being here and, of course, all of the other people who were involved in the background.  It was a lot of hard work.  I understand that it is a very difficult and an extremely complex issue.  It is an issue that involves parents, guardians and so forth.  It is important that we all work together on this.  We see the damage this can do.  I have seen the damage it has done in my community, where people do not have the right to choose and sometimes are forced into doing things they should not be doing.  We see that they wind up in all sorts of trouble.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State.  We look forward to working with her on the Bill.  If we can be of any help at all, that is what we are here for.</p></speech>

We are completely in agreement with the principles he established here tonight.  I thank my official, James Kelly, who has been working non-stop on this Bill for the past two years.  There are 120 heads.  It is complicated and much legal advice had to be sought.  As I said, it is at the drafting stage and it will be priority legislation.  I look forward to the Deputies' co-operation.  I thank the Members for the good work that was done in the pre-legislative scrutiny stage as well.</p>  <p>  Obviously, we all want this mental health Bill to be the best it can possibly be to support people who have mental illness.  There is not a family in Ireland that has not been touched with mental illness.  Having the conversation tonight was important.  The more we talk about mental health, the more it lessens the stigma.  I thank the Deputies and the Acting Chairman for their time.</p></speech>
