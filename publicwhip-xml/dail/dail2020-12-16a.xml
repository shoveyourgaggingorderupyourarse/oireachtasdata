    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600003#A00200"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Agreement between Ireland and the Danish State on the establishment of a framework for the statistical transfer of energy from renewable sources for target compliance purposes under Directive 2009/28/EC, signed and done at Dublin on 1st December, 2020, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4th December, 2020. </blockquote> <p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  Under the 2009 renewable energy directive, we are committed to achieving 16% of our energy demand from renewable resources by the end of 2020.  Notwithstanding the good progress that has been achieved, especially in renewable electricity, projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, indicate that a shortfall of between 3% and 4% is likely by year end.  In order to ensure compliance with the directive, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has negotiated international agreements with Estonia and Denmark to purchase statistical transfers for 2020.  Following Government approval in late November, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, signed both agreements in Dublin earlier this month.  They will enter into force, subject to ratification by the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This mechanism is part of the European architecture under the 2009 renewable energy directive designed to allow member states to meet their targets.  While it was not our preference to achieve compliance via this mechanism, we have, unfortunately, exhausted all alternative options for compliance through other policies and measures.</p> <p> Ireland is not alone among member states which will fall short of its binding renewable energy targets.  Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands have all concluded similar arrangements in recent years.  As to costs, the State will pay &euro;37.5 million to Estonia for the purchase of 2.5 TW hours of energy and &euro;12.5 million to Denmark for a volume of 1 TW hour of energy.  In total, the State will procure 3.5 TW hours of renewable energy at a cost of &euro;50 million this year.  While the Government acknowledges that this is a significant cost to the State, it is nevertheless important to point out that the funds received by both Estonia and Denmark will be used to accelerate deployment of renewable electricity in their jurisdictions, in line with their national energy and climate plans.  Both of the agreements are with EU member states with which Ireland shares a common commitment to taking robust climate action in accelerating the roll-out of renewable energy to supply our grid, heat our homes and move our people as part of an integrated transport network.  Like Ireland, Denmark and Estonia are small countries with a strong European identity and these agreements will strengthen future co-operation between Ireland and its fellow EU member states to tackle the climate emergency and put citizens at the heart of the climate transition.  </p> <p> Since coming into office in June, this Government has overseen the first auction under the transformational renewable electricity support scheme.  This will see a major upscaling in renewable energy projects connecting to the grid from 2021, with, for the first time, solar energy and community-owned projects supplying homes across Ireland.  The programme for Government provides that a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy is essential to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels.  The Government is committed to rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  The climate action plan included a commitment to 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030, up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of solar energy.  The programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind development to 5 GW by 2030.  </p> <p> On sustainable transport, the climate plan has a target of 936,000 electric vehicles to be on the road in Ireland by 2030 and also includes a range of actions to support the uptake of electric vehicles.  </p> <p> I welcome the launch by the European Commission last week of the sustainable and smart mobility strategy, which lays the foundation for how the EU transport system can achieve its green and digital transformation.  To give a flavour of some of the ambitious actions contained in the strategy, by 2030 at least 30 million zero-emission cars will be in operation on European roads, 100 European cities will be climate-neutral, high-speed rail traffic will double across Europe, automated mobility will be deployed at a large scale, and zero-emission marine vessels will be market-ready.  </p> <p> It is important for Ireland to demonstrate its commitment to meeting renewable energy targets and sustainable transport commitments in support of the wider aspirations of the European Green Deal.  The forthcoming climate action plan next year will further step up our ambitions with the necessary actions to ensure the cross-government effort that is required is being implemented and monitored effectively.  I look forward to hearing the contributions from Members on this important issue and I thank the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="09:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600004#B00300"><p>The EU renewable energy directive of 2009 set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demands from renewable sources by 2020.  Due to decades of inaction in this area, we are set to miss this target.  The SEAI predicts that between 12.5% and 13.2% of our energy requirements will be met from renewable sources this year.  There are many reasons for this failure but the actions of the previous Fine Gael-led Administration deserve particular criticism.  We have proof positive today that its climate rhetoric was not matched by climate action, although we did not have to wait until today to find that out.  Sinn F&eacute;in and other progressive voices have been beating that drum for some time.</p><p>This transaction is not just bad news for our environment and international climate obligations, it is also bad news for Irish taxpayers who are set to foot a bill of &euro;50 million.  To be clear, we have failed to meet reasonable and fair energy transition obligations.  A reduction of in and around 1% year on year since we agreed to these targets was required but we could not even manage that.  Statistical transfers for target compliance purposes is a convoluted way of saying we are here to agree to pay &euro;50 million in fines for missing our renewable energy targets for 2020.  To meet our binding obligations on paper, we now have to buy credits from Denmark and Estonia to make up for the State&rsquo;s failings in this area.  My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, put it well when she said that this is like modern-day indulgences.  For &euro;50 million, we get a piece of paper and absolution.  </p><p>When we look at this from the perspective of opportunity cost, we might reasonably consider what could have been done with &euro;50 million.  How many homes could have been retrofitted?  How many solar panels or heat pumps could we have installed?  How many sustainable energy communities could we have supported?  Those opportunities have now shifted to Denmark and Estonia.  </p><p>It should also be noted that we are paying a higher premium to Estonia, at &euro;15 per megawatt hour, than to Denmark, at &euro;12.50 per megawatt hour.  Estonia is getting a better return on its investment.  With the EU and climate, the profit motive must always apply.  These countries have committed to spending this money to further reduce their own emissions, which is welcome.  Had we made different choices, we might have been in their position.  Irish taxpayers are big losers in this and we are paying a high price but it is important to acknowledge that we are not the biggest losers.  The biggest losers here are the poorest people on the planet, those who are living at the coalface of the climate crisis, and of course the planet itself and its flora and fauna.  No amount of statistical transfers and economic wizardry or commodification of the climate crisis can distract from that.  </p><p>If this is about money, then we have to agree that it is a complete waste of money.  It is an indictment of Government policy and an even greater indictment of Government inaction.  To add insult to injury, previous administrations have actively blocked solutions brought forward by Opposition parties in this area, including by my colleague, Deputy Stanley.  His Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 would have allowed small-scale production of electricity through solar and wind energy production.  It provided that excess electricity produced by small-scale microgenerators, whether households, farms, small businesses, local schools, community groups or the GAA, could be fed into the grid and that this would be paid for.  In doing so, it would have provided for energy self-sufficiency and a small return for individuals.  That was a win-win scenario but, instead, we are moving at snail&rsquo;s pace.  Deputies need not take my word on this as the issue has been well reported on <i>Noteworthy.ie</i>and by various groups.</p><p>We need a step change in approach.  We also need to move away from the carbon credit approach and drive down our overall emissions in real and measurable terms.</p> <p>Paying &euro;50 million does not help our environment.  Paying &euro;50 million will not build more wind farms in the Irish Sea and increase the State's renewable energy capacity.  This &euro;50 million of taxpayers' money is lost today.</p> <p> I conclude by encouraging a step change in the State's approach to offshore wind energy.  In a parliamentary reply to me recently, the Minister stated that the State does not directly own or operate, or plan to own or operate, any such resources.  We have massive offshore wind potential.  It is imperative that it is not privatised - that it is not a case of moving from big oil to big wind or paying our way out of this crisis.  We need to start taking our climate obligations seriously and match the rhetoric with action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600005#C00200"><p>The Minister of State's statement this morning hit the right tone at the start.  It was regretful and there was even a hint of contrition at the fact that we are a laggard in terms of meeting our climate change targets within the European family.  She mentioned that we are not alone and that Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands are also in a similar boat.  We may not be alone but we are in a minority - a sorry minority - of countries that are falling way behind.  While the Minister of State's statement hit the right note in that regard, in the sixth paragraph she stated that it is important to point out that the funds for Estonia and Denmark will be used to accelerate deployment of renewable electricity in their jurisdictions in line with their national energy and climate plans.  To be honest, that actually compounds the shame of having to pay &euro;50 million in Irish taxpayers' money to make up for the shortfall in our own targets.  Not only will that money leave our shores where it could be invested in decarbonising our economy and improving our renewable energy resources, it is going to countries that are already miles ahead of us so we are going to fund them to go even further in terms of their own renewable energy resources.  Fair play to them, as they are ahead of us.  This will probably not permeate down to the man and woman on the street - the people who will come to our Zoom clinics and contact our offices.  If we tried to explain this to the ordinary man and woman on the street, they would be shocked that we are paying this amount of money in penalties that will go to the best boys and girls in the class to allow them to become even better.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Rourke raised a fundamental point at the end of his contribution.  The renewable energy that is coming on stream will not be State-owned.  It will be privatised so we will be going from big oil to big wind - I hope we can find another phrase.  This is where we are going.  The Government needs to tell us how much of the renewable energy coming on stream will be siphoned off for other multinational corporations such as those running data centres that are entering into prepaid contracts with companies that own wind farms to siphon off up to 15%, 20% or 25% of the energy created in order to power data centres, which are huge carbon emitters and very poor in terms of creating jobs.  There is a structure here that will only get bigger and will be bad for the worker, the economy and the Irish taxpayer because we will continue to pay these exorbitant penalties to countries that are doing things far better than us.</p>  <p>  Another related element in terms of carbon emissions is transport.  I am moving away slightly from renewable energy generation to the emissions from our transport sector.  We went from level 5 to level 2.  I know Deputy O'Rourke from Meath and Deputy Whitmore from north Wicklow travel to Dublin.  I bet they had similar conversations as I did coming as I do from north County Dublin - "janey mack, travel just absolutely shot up overnight when we left level 5."  Everyone was back in their cars heading into cities for work or shopping.  Our air quality is disgraceful having gone back to 1980s levels when smog was a fact of life in Dublin and our major towns.  Traffic is back.  Unless we go back into level 5, traffic is back to the worst levels and has been for the past number of years.  It was sold by the Government as some indicator that the economy was recovering and everyone was back to work.  It is great that the economy was recovering at a particular point but we are all in cars with the target of 2030 for everyone to be driving electric or hybrid cars coming down the tracks.  I asked the Government in a parliamentary question whether there are any plans for a scrappage scheme supported by the State to allow the hundreds of thousands of people who own diesel or petrol cars to scrap these cars and over the course of the next five, six or seven years get an electric or hybrid car in an affordable way.  The answer to my question was a flat "No" so the Government is not really interested in tackling this at either a micro or macro level, as is proven by this.  I am really concerned that in 2021, we will all be here again talking about the next statistical transfer and the next piece of accounting sleight of hand, which is shameful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600005#C00300"><p>This week marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement by ourselves, the EU and 193 states.  It would have been really nice to have been able to celebrate this anniversary and for us to be able to stand tall as a nation and say that we had taken our climate obligations seriously, met the relatively low targets that had been set for us and shown leadership in this regard.  Instead we are here to approve a paper exercise - a sleight of hand that essentially is just us pretending we have met the targets.  We refer to it as a statistical transfer but the reality is that it is a certificate of a failure that will cost us &euro;50 million.  This figure of &euro;50 million could and should have been spent on our public infrastructure - our own green infrastructure.  Instead it is winging its way to Estonia and Denmark to enable them to invest in their public infrastructure.  I note that the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications yesterday said that it was a positive thing and that this money was going over to these countries, which would invest in their green infrastructure.  It is not positive.  We need that money here.  We have targets to meet and we need to make sure we are investing in the areas in which we should be investing.  It is ridiculous that instead of investing in our own public services, we are investing in the public services of a different country.  It is a huge amount of money.  As we attempt to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, there are so many areas where we could focus that money.  Our environmental organisations are crying out for more funding.  We can imagine what they could do with &euro;50 million.</p>  <p>  The money could also go towards our much-needed retrofitting of homes.  To put it into perspective, &euro;50 million could retrofit between 1,500 and 2,500 homes in this country.  It could have purchased 5,000 solar panels for schools across the country.  Environmental groups such as BirdWatch Ireland and the Irish Wildlife Trust get approximately &euro;15,000 per year in State funding and here we are sending &euro;50 million to other countries.  Instead of us using this money, it is going to another country to reward it for its good behaviour and progress on developing renewable energy.  It is a real slap on the wrist for us - a slap in the face actually for those environmental organisations that need money to do the great work they do.</p>  <p>  This is not something we will be able to vote against today but it offers us and the Government an opportunity to reflect on the mistakes of the past Government so that they are not repeated and that Ireland's capacity to generate renewable energy and meet any subsequent targets successfully, including the programme for Government target of 70% renewable energy by 2030, is boosted.  Unfortunately, we are so far behind that it is likely we will struggle to meet the target in ten years' time.  In 2018, compared to other EU countries, Ireland had the second largest gap to the 2020 target and the second lowest share of renewable heat of any EU member state.  Because heat is a large share of final end use, Ireland's low share of renewable heat is the main reason we failed to meet our 2020 renewable energy targets.  The Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, also predicts that with regard to onshore wind expansion, Ireland will struggle to reach its national target of 70% electricity from renewable energy by 2030.</p> <p>According to the IWEA, this is due to existing barriers to planning and grid connections that are yet to be resolved.  The decisions of past Governments have led us to where we are.  Past Governments, for example, decided to only allow onshore wind to compete in the support scheme they had set up and not facilitate offshore wind and solar.  Hence, we are top-heavy when it comes to wind and we are lagging far behind in the areas of heat transport and solar energy.</p> <p> How many bad decisions that we are now beholden to have led us here?  How much in time and effort do we have to make up for past mistakes?  How can we ensure this Government does absolutely everything necessary to make up for that missed time as well as progressively develop our renewable energy sector to meet current and future targets?  It is time to take this issue of our climate obligations both nationally and internationally seriously; paper exercises will not cut it any longer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600006#D00150"><p>It is a bit of a shock to the system that we must pay out &euro;50 million for nothing.  What I mean is there is no return to us.  We are paying &euro;50 million to two other countries, namely, Denmark and Estonia, for the privilege of having a piece of paper to say we met our requirements.  As has been said, &euro;50 million is a lot of money.  The main thing I will say is that is this year; it is 2020.  What will we be paying out next year?  We need to look at this in a sobering way to see exactly what we are doing and, more appropriately, not doing.</p>  <p>  It has been pointed out that &euro;50 million could do many things in this country.  I believe, however, it is much deeper than just the cost alone.  We must examine why we are so far behind and why we are not able to get our offshore wind onto the agenda.</p>  <p>  The authorities in our port in Galway will tell the Minister of State one of the big issues we have is foreshore licenses, which can take years, and there is no timeframe by which a person will receive one.  We must also make sure our maritime planning is set in a way that it is conducive to getting offshore wind energy under way.</p>  <p>  Like the Minister, I am from the west of Ireland.  We know the potential of the Atlantic for us and for the west of Ireland to develop a proper offshore wind energy industry.  It should be the game changer for the region.  To make it the game changer, however, we need to make sure and move fast to ensure we tidy up the archaic way we give licences and, in particular, foreshore licenses.  Places such as Galway Port and Shannon Foynes Port should be the cornerstones of the development of offshore wind in in this country.  We need to do that.  Both ports are doing their best to develop but they are being stymied by reams of regulation.  Much of it is EU regulation this country has transposed in a way that makes it almost impossible to work in.</p>  <p>  I suggest that is the starting point for us today.  It has cost us &euro;50 million to pay for the sins of this year.  What do we need to do?  We must make sure that people who want to take on offshore energy are in a position to be able to do it quickly and in a way that produces the results for us.  We talk about it being privatised.  I believe we need to have a shareholding in the private enterprise that is and will be carrying out this work.  We need to make sure there is a dividend for the State.</p>  <p>  We also need to shake up the whole area of retrofitting of houses.  A person who is in fuel poverty and who applies for a grant for a house is told he or she must wait two years before getting the house inspected.  There is therefore a huge problem regarding how we do our business, which is manifesting itself when we must pay money to another country to help them develop what we should be doing in our own country.  It is a wake-up call.  We need to do it and we have the potential to do it but we need to move fast.  Many people will say we cannot do this and that.  It is time, however, for a change of attitude to make sure we get people in place to get things done, and make sure we develop our offshore wind, public transport, electronic care fleet, autonomous cars and all these areas to have a vision for the next 20 or 30 years, and realise that vision by making sure we put in place the necessary measures to allow the development to happen.  There is great potential in this for Ireland; we are well positioned.  The west of Ireland has clean water and a clean environment.  We need to harness that potential and start doing it now.</p></speech>

This &euro;50 million was for 3,500 gigawatt hours of renewable electricity because we are missing our agreed target by between 3% and 4%.  Our overall target was 16% and because of our inability to reach our targets, we are buying gigawatt hours on paper.  Our target was previously 20% but had to be lowered because we were already significantly behind with renewable energy.</p><p>For me, this is a good example of our wasteful political policies.  We are always reactive rather than being proactive.EU member states such as Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and others are making millions from countries that are missing their targets yet we continue.</p><p>In an <i>Irish Independent </i>article of October 26 last, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is reported to have said: &quot;It's with real regret that we are not spending &euro;50m to meet the target.  Instead we are going to have to purchase those credits for not meeting it.&rdquo;  These targets were set ten years ago.  It is not like we have not had time to put the renewable energy infrastructure in place.  If only we were proactive and prioritised our capital spending.  He went on to say, &quot;It shows that these European directives, both on renewables and climate emissions, have real teeth.  They do require us to act.&quot;</p><p>In her speech, the Minister of State said the forthcoming climate action plan next year will further step up our ambitions with the necessary actions to ensure the cross-Government effort required to implement and monitor it effectively.  Denmark and Estonia can clap their hands and wait for that money to come.</p><p>Is it really surprising that we are being held accountable for meeting the climate action targets we agreed?  I suppose it is not unusual that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, might be stumped by this, considering the Government has form in signing up to UN conventions, etc., and not bothering to adhere to all of the commitments.</p><p>Climate actions are serious.  The school strikes last year put this firmly on the political agenda but what is lesser known is how financially costly the Government&rsquo;s inaction is for the Exchequer.  Interestingly, an article dated January 27, 2020 by <i>GreenNews.ie</i>stated, &ldquo;Lack of climate action will cost the state over &euro;7 billion by the end of this year, the Green Party has said in the lead up to the general election.&rdquo;  What the Green Party says in the lead up to a general election, however, and what the Green Party does in Government seems to also be a case of missing targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600006#D00300"><p>I listened with interest to the Minister of State's presentation this morning.  I am slightly bemused by the commitment in the programme for Government and the lack of action on it to develop offshore energy.  Obviously, a large amount of the renewable energy we are purchasing from Denmark is offshore energy.  Perhaps, people have had the opportunity to see television documentaries on it or see them in person.  One can even see huge amount of offshore energy as one arrives in Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to forgive my ignorance, but I am not aware of any similar offshore energy projects in Ireland, nor am I aware of any particular projects that the Government is advancing.  I am aware of Moneypoint power station in Clare, which is beside the sea.  I received a response to a parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago and since then, the Government has announced that the lifespan of the power station is to be further curtailed and I do not see any plan to replace it.  It needs to be replaced for the economies of Clare and Ireland but with what are we going to replace it?  Moneypoint is situated on the coast, on the Shannon Estuary.  It has two large networks that leave it and cross the country in arcs, one going to the north of Dublin and the other to the south of Dublin.  It is, essentially, irreplaceable in terms of the national network.  I would have expected a greater degree of urgency than has been seen to date to develop offshore energy and to research tidal and wave energy.  The estuary is a relatively shallow basin and has some of the highest waves and tides in Europe, along with the Bristol Channel.  I am not an expert in engineering, but I would like to see State-sponsored research into that as a matter of urgency and not something that comes up as a footnote in a debate around Ireland not fulfilling its renewable energy commitments.</p> <p> I would welcome something real coming out of this morning's debate.  I accept the Government finds itself in the position it does, that we are not meeting the renewable energy targets and must do something about it in the short term.  However, if we continue the way we are going now, we are going to be back here in ten years' time with exactly the same story.  I want a task force to be set up to look at the reality that renewable energy is going to have to come out of Moneypoint.  It has to be a part of the story.  The Government is not going to be able to build a pylon network of the sort that is traversing the country, coming from Moneypoint.  We all know the pylon difficulties across the country.  There are pylons there.  Moneypoint is situated right on the coast.  That is an advantage that the Government needs to take cognisance of and move forward with a degree of urgency that I have not seen to date.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies have rightly remarked on the significant costs to the State associated with these agreements and what an equivalent investment of &euro;50 million would have achieved in retrofitting our housing stock, or in education or public health.  The solution to avoiding future costs for statistical transfers or other such measures is not to reduce our climate and energy ambitions, it is to accelerate delivery across all Departments and State agencies concerned.  The Government's Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill will establish a 2050 climate neutrality objective in law and place all relevant climate plans and strategies on a statutory footing.  The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets and related sectoral targets will be set, with every sector contributing, ensuring that we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on the transition to a climate-neutral economy and society.  Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this Government and future Governments to take sustained climate action.  The Bill also provides appropriate oversight by Government, a strengthened climate change advisory council and a significantly strengthened accountability and oversight role for the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies commented on the enormous opportunity from offshore renewable energy.  To progress our commitment of having 5 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030, the Department is developing the terms and conditions of the offshore renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.  The offshore RESS will be the means for supporting offshore wind developments via a competitive, auction-based framework.  The competitive element is required under the state aid clearance for the scheme in order to achieve our renewable energy ambitions at the lowest cost to consumers.</p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will shortly be publishing a public consultation on microgeneration.  It will seek stakeholder views on a microgeneration support scheme which will, in time, provide an export tariff for excess electricity produced by homes and businesses.  The proposed scheme will be aligned with the requirements of the recast renewable energy directive 2018 which has to be transposed by June 2021.  The scheme will offer homes, businesses and farms an opportunity to earn some money for excess electricity produced.  However, it is important that people first reduce their energy demand through energy efficiency measures, such as retrofitting and measures like it.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and an annual reduction of 7% in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, including through maximising the amount of renewable energy on the grid.  Future advances and system flexibility, storage technologies, including batteries and green hydrogen, as well as regional and international interconnection, will enable high levels of renewable electricity on our grid.</p></speech>

that the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many peoples' mental health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness and substance use disorders;<br /><br />&mdash; that many mental health organisations have reported significant increases in the use of their online and telephone services due to a broad range of issues impacting young people, which include anxiety and depression;<br /><br />&mdash; the share of health funding allocated to mental health in recent years ranged from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent, while in 2019 it was at 6.3 per cent, but will fall dramatically to 5.2 per cent in 2021, despite an expected significant rise in demand for supports and services in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; that current Government policy is completely failing to achieve the Sl&aacute;intecare objective of 10 per cent of health monies being allocated to mental health, even though that recommendation is below international recommendations;<br /><br />&mdash; that it is incomprehensible for the mental health share of the overall health budget to decline, at a time when demand for the services has never been greater, and as Ireland faces the implementation of the mental health strategy &lsquo;Sharing the Vision &ndash; A Mental Health Policy for Everyone&rsquo; that was launched just a few months ago;<br /><br />&mdash; the immeasurable and long-lasting impact of the restrictive lockdowns, and lack of an exit strategy, especially on older and vulnerable people, who are experiencing severe social isolation and loneliness;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Irish mental health services are grossly underfunded, and this has been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; the very significant impact on health and well-being from the Covid-19 virus and the associated lockdowns;<br /><br />&mdash; the drastic impact of the Covid-19 virus, Government policies and associated lockdowns on other patients due to postponed medical treatment or check-ups;<br /><br />&mdash; the drastic impact of the Covid-19 virus, Government policies and associated lockdowns on cancer screening services, with many cancers going undetected due to the suspension of cancer screening services; <br /><br />&mdash; that the hospital and long-term care system in Ireland has suffered from significant under-investment for many years;<br /><br />&mdash; that the entire public health system itself is another area that has suffered from many years of chronic under-investment;<br /><br />&mdash; the tremendous and Trojan efforts made by all front-line workers, particularly healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide an adequate remuneration to student nurses, who have been doing incredible work during the pandemic, while facing the same Covid-19 risks as any other healthcare worker, with the same bills, but receiving nothing in return;<br /><br />&mdash; the powerful solidarity with family, neighbours and fellow citizens which emerged in every community, despite the often mixed and confused messaging of the Government;<br /><br />&mdash; the complete failure of the Government to put in place a seamless replacement service to the European Union (EU) Cross Border Directive (CBD) for patients who wish to avail of treatments in Northern Ireland, and the grave impact this will have on the State&rsquo;s already crumbling healthcare system;<br /><br />&mdash; that Irish households and businesses have experienced very considerable economic disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; that Government&rsquo;s policy on restrictions has exacerbated or created a deeper urban-rural divide, by insisting on the ongoing closure of small rural pubs and confining people to a two kilometre or five kilometre area, with little access to any services in many rural areas;<br /><br />&mdash; the continual closure of small rural pubs has left hundreds of rural villages decimated and exacerbated rural isolation and loneliness;<br /><br />&mdash; that the restrictive lockdowns, without a proper social and economic exit plan on reopening the country, will cost tens of thousands of jobs to be lost;<br /><br />&mdash; that the economy has been hit here much harder than necessary, due to the lack of any cohesive system of testing and contact tracing;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Covid-19 pandemic has again highlighted the complete lack of adequate services, such as public transport, broadband and school transport in many rural areas;<br /><br />&mdash; the lack of Government support to Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who are unable to obtain cash flow from the pillar banks, despite the European Central Bank making approximately &euro;9 billion available to Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector, to support enterprises during the Covid-19 pandemic; and<br /><br />&mdash; the complete failure of the &euro;2 billion Governments Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (Covid-19 CGS) due to SMEs being unable to access it, due mainly to:<br /><br />&mdash; stringent restrictions;<br /><br />&mdash; high interest rates being charged; and<br /><br />&mdash; exclusion of many small businesses from accessing the scheme; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to:<br /><br />&mdash; provide additional funding of at least &euro;250 million or a 25 per cent increase, to begin to fund the mental health fall-out from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately allow rural pubs to re-open, while adhering to all public health guidelines, in order to save businesses, protect rural employment, support rural towns and villages and provide a safe place for rural dwellers to meet and socialise responsibly, in order to combat the impacts of rural isolation and loneliness;<br /><br />&mdash; publish a clear, transparent and concise exit strategy from this virus, so that everyone can begin to plan for the future and know that there is light at the end of the tunnel;<br /><br />&mdash; provide all healthcare front line workers with a Christmas bonus payment;<br /><br />&mdash; end the exploitation of student nurses and pay all final-year interns the same rate as healthcare assistants, increase and expand the clinical placement allowance for all other students, and provide full health and safety protection to all students, including payment if they have to go on Covid-19 related leave;<br /><br />&mdash; implement an emergency programme to clear the backlogs in screening and treatments due to postponed medical treatments or check-ups;<br /><br />&mdash; again, put an alternative scheme in place to ensure a seamless transition to the EU CBD from 1st January, 2021;<br /><br />&mdash; implement measures to fast track cancer screening services and procedures;<br /><br />&mdash; implement an internationally acceptable, cohesive system of Covid-19 testing and contact tracing;<br /><br />&mdash; agree to a debate and vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in January 2021, on the implementation of the regional and rural development, which is underpinned in the Project Ireland 2040 plan;<br /><br />&mdash; offer tangible supports to Irish small and medium sized businesses by forcing Irish banks to lend to businesses at interest rates comparable to other EU countries (as opposed to the current rip-off rates being charged &ndash; despite, the banks obtaining the funds at rates as low as minus one per cent), in order to support cash-flow until the Covid-19 pandemic passes; and<br /><br />&mdash; immediately examine, simplify and reduce the interest rate on the failed &euro;2 billion Government Covid-19 CGS aimed at SMEs, and consider removing the pillar banks from the administration of the funds, while extending the scheme until the end of 2021.&rdquo;  </blockquote>  <p>The Rural Independent Group has brought forward this motion because we believe a major deficit exists in terms of the negative impact of the Covid-19 restrictions.  We are all acutely aware of the national financial costs but those costs at the macro level have been repeated endlessly.  However, at the micro level, at the level of communities, local enterprises and access to health services, a serious gap has emerged.  I accept entirely the Government has to respond to an unprecedented social and economic event.  I accept that some helpful supports have been put in place.  However, in that response and in that focus on the larger picture, we have lost sight of how these restrictions have cruelly impacted on the lives of ordinary people.</p><p>One of the starkest examples of this is in the area of health.  We know that more than 300,000 cancer screenings have been delayed by the Covid crisis which forced the suspension of services and reduced screening capacity.  I am aware of a man who was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer during the pandemic in March and who could not get a hospital transfer for months.  There are many more like this constituent.  We need to examine the measures being put in place and, more importantly, the serious impact they are having on people, in particular in terms of people&rsquo;s health and well-being.</p><p>Across screening programmes for breast, cervical and bowel cancer, the national screening service planned to screen 433,100 people this year.  However, the suspension of services when Covid-19 struck in March has meant that just one third of this annual target was met by the end of September.  BreastCheck and Bowel Screen were more than 70% behind 2020 targets while CervicalCheck was 33% behind the target.  This is why our motion identifies the devastating impact that Covid-19 restrictions are having on the service users of the healthcare system and on small businesses, including rural pubs which have been abandoned.</p><p>As we know, my constituency of Laois-Offaly was hit badly because we had to endure an additional lockdown that caused significant economic and social damage.  The reimposition of stringent lockdown measures happened despite the NPHET epidemiological modelling advisory group having clearly stated there was little evidence of widespread community transition in the midlands counties.There was, however, some evidence of clusters at certain locations, including in food processing plants.  On this basis, it was difficult to see why the Government even considered locking down the counties of Laois and Offaly.</p><p>I completely accept we need to monitor and react quickly and effectively.  We should also, however, have acted proportionately and with a targeted response, not a widespread blanket imposition of lockdown measures for entire counties.  After this lockdown was lifted, I said the people of Laois-Offaly had been through an extremely challenging few weeks.  The general air of uncertainty, as well as the sense the measures were entirely unwarranted in the first place, left many people feeling frustrated upset and deeply annoyed.  Thanks to the amazing community spirit in both counties, however, along with a single-minded determination to continue demonstrating responsible behaviour, our counties came through with pride.  I repeat my praise today for the people of Laois-Offaly for their patience and their civic commitment.</p><p>However, it is not feasible to go on sending entire counties in and out of lockdown with the kind of Lanigan's Ball approach we have seen to date.  I reiterate that pubs in rural communities, which have taken every measure possible and which have invested in additional measures to ensure their premises were safe, have been treated shamefully.</p><p>Our motion also refers to the need to simplify and overhaul the &euro;2 billion credit loan guarantee scheme in order that small businesses can access this scheme more effectively.  I have raised this issue on several occasions with the Minister for Finance.  Following the publication of the Government's July stimulus plan, it was clear the reaction to the plan from some of the economy&rsquo;s major sectors was an indication that a substantial revision would necessary sooner rather than later.  This turned out to be true, as we have seen with the difficulties associated with the operation of the credit guarantee scheme.</p><p>In July, I accepted the plan represented a major delivery of support to SMEs and that, in itself, is progress that we could all welcome.  However, I was also deeply concerned that sectors like tourism and hospitality did not receive the kind of targeted supports in VAT reductions they had sought.  That pointed to a concerning lack of insight around deeply this sector has been impacted by the crisis.  I would encourage Government to look at this closely to protect jobs, in particular in midlands counties which are undergoing, as I call it, an unjust transition because we are facing 1,000 job losses in Bord na M&oacute;na by the end of this year.</p><p>There were other aspects of the July stimulus plan like the expansion of the restart grant and the extension of the commercial rates waiver which were welcome.  Again, however, there have been problems with these too.  With respect to the restart grant, I was repeatedly contacted by small businesses which had been waiting to receive the grants in September, despite initial claims that all applicants would receive payment within two weeks.  I was contacted by several local bed and breakfasts which were left waiting for this payment and only received it recently.  I directly engaged with the office of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, thankfully, this issue now appears to have been resolved and people have received the payment.</p><p>However, my point is that this issue clearly signals the kind of gap that exists between the supports that exist on paper and the supports people are actually receiving.  This, in turn, has made enduring the Covid restrictions even more challenging and difficult to bear for many in the small business sector.</p><p>In terms of the wider suite of measures associated with the credit guarantee scheme, I made the point some time ago to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that one of the conditionalities associated with SMEs and farmers accessing the funding was that they would have to contact a participating Irish bank.  This meant that it was then up to bank to make the necessary assessments and decide whether it was prepared to offer a loan to the SME or the small farmer.  From what I could see, the banks required SMEs availing of the credit guarantees to be of &ldquo;good financial standing and commercially viable&rdquo;.  This was extremely alarming and an instance yet again of where a serious gap emerged between the impact of Covid-19 and the State&rsquo;s response as mediated through the banks.  Again, the banks in this country have far too much control.  They are let do as they please and come up with any conditions they like.</p><p>It is abundantly clear from recent and historical experience that when we leave it to the banks to determine what commercially viable means, trouble inevitably follows for the small farmer and small business man or woman.</p></speech>

It is an important motion referring to the many difficulties people have experienced during this Covid crisis.  In many cases, people have been overlooked during this pandemic.  We need to be cautious about and respect the dangers of Covid-19 which is what rural communities have tried to do, in particular my constituency.</p> <p>I want to look at issues and areas where there have been serious failings during the period of Covid-19, especially for people with mental health issues.  I mention the stress Covid-19 has caused and I want to look at the services.  In a report I looked at recently I saw that mental health services are receiving less funding than they were last year, at a time when they need increased funding because, unfortunately, we have situations of suicide in every constituency, which far outnumber the deaths from Covid-19 on some days.  It is a sad and difficult time for people.  More finances should be pumped into those services.</p> <p> I will also look at the cancer screening services, which have been mentioned, and the difficulties people have encountered.  In general, it has been very difficult for people to get appointments in clinics.  Covid-19 has been used as an excuse.  I was on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response in the first months of the Covid-19 crisis and there was much discussion there about nursing homes, the lack of funding for nursing homes and the lack of funding for community hospitals.  I could name quite a number of hospitals.  The State is administering the funding for community hospitals.</p> <p> People in Clonakilty Community Hospital passed away due to Covid-19.  I looked at reports which had for the past numbers of years condemned certain parts of the hospital, not the hard-working staff.  Unfortunately, there was a failure by the State to provide funding to bring it up to HIQA standards.  It was written in black and white prior to the pandemic and HIQA stated there was an issue with overcrowding in some of the rooms.  Unfortunately, those reports are there and they have a legacy.  No action has been taken by the State or the Department of Health and people have been left in these rooms, which left us in unfortunate situations.  The State has to stand up and look at its historical actions on community hospitals and on Clonakilty Community Hospital.  The State has to put it right now and not wait.  The unfortunate thing I see in community hospitals is that now people are not being allowed in.  Fewer people are being allowed into the community hospitals so more beds are being closed instead of bringing them up to a modern standard.</p> <p> I also spoke at great length about tourism at the beginning of the pandemic because I could see that in communities where there was a great amount of tourism, people were very worried.  I called for rapid Covid-19 testing in our airports from the word "go" but unfortunately that fell on deaf ears.  The airport officials, the Government and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said it was far too dear.  They are all trying to run with these tests now but they should have been in place from the word "go" so that when people flew into our country, at least they would have had a Covid-19 test and people would feel far more relaxed.  They should have certified and implemented that.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for being here; I appreciate that.  People wanted to worship in the churches.  We are one of only three countries in the world that closed our churches.  The Minister has amazing power because it had not happened for a couple of hundred years in Ireland that the churches were closed to the public.  That caused great hurt.  Churches that could hold 500 people were not allowed to hold four or five people.  Some churches are bigger than this place and we have no problem in meeting here but we have an issue with people going to worship in their churches, regardless of what religion they are.</p> <p> I refer to the marts.  When we raised the levels recently, people could not go to marts.  A mart is like an open shed.  Some marts were putting in all sorts of spacing measures in place so that the buyers alone could go in and they were not allowed in.</p> <p> The mortgage moratorium was very welcome but unfortunately that is gone.  I am meeting publicans, in particular, and many other business people and they are trying to do a deal with the banks but the banks have no interest in doing a deal now.  Their businesses are closed, which is incredible.  I will take the Minister for a spin around Dublin this evening and he will see where the hundreds and thousands of people are in this or that place.  I do not want to be pointing the finger but pubs that would have two, three or four people in them most days are not allowed to open.  It is scandalous.  They have not been able to earn a brown cent and now the banks are looking for their money.  These people are stressed to the living last as to where they will get the money.</p> <p> I have talked about student nurses and the unfair way they have been treated during the Covid-19 crisis.  They were at the front line working hard and they were treated horribly.  We were standing up in the D&aacute;il clapping them.  Clapping is not good enough.  We need to deliver.  The registration fee for nurses of &euro;100 was not even withdrawn to give them some break.  We have been down on people and there are many issues that need to be discussed but my time is up.</p></speech>

Anywhere they were required, they did their level best and did Trojan work.</p>  <p>  I have to say to the Minister that people have been dying from things other than the coronavirus.  People with cancer and people with hip and knee difficulties and so on have been left behind to suffer in pain.  In time the tale will be told of the damage and neglect that has been meted out to these people.  Elderly and sick people in their homes have by and large been left to their own devices because GPs could not go to their homes.  In severe cases, all people could do was to go to the accident and emergency department.  Even people who had paid for private healthcare have been neglected.  They could not access the services they had paid for and rightly deserved to get because the public hospitals took over the private hospitals.  They were left behind.</p>  <p>  The cross-border directive is in serious jeopardy.  Deputy Michael Collins and I are at our wits' end because we do not know what will happen after 31 January.  It was so important to keep that system going to ensure that people did not lose their sight or that they would not continue to suffer in pain.  It seems that the Taoiseach is not interested in keeping that service going.</p>  <p>  I mention mental health and suicide among middle-aged people and loneliness.  A recent damning report by the Mental Health Commission cited major deficiencies in the level of mental healthcare for patients in Kerry and it is getting worse rather than better.  The Minister and the Taoiseach said the Government would provide more district beds and beds for people who needed to go into hospital.  What it has done is close down beds in our district hospitals.  In one public nursing home in Killarney, the Government has closed 27 beds and they are still closed.</p>  <p>  School transport and the 50% rule really came to light in Kerry.  The Government did not give people the service and the way it was done was that people who always had tickets to go to the secondary school did not get tickets until recently and not all of them have their tickets yet.  Even college students in Killarney were disenfranchised.  They could not go to Tralee because Bus &Eacute;ireann put on another run from Dingle to Killarney and Tralee.  However, Bus &Eacute;ireann did not have drivers to continue the school bus going to the Institute of Technology Tralee from Killarney and it left 18 to 20 students standing on the side of the road for several days.</p>  <p>  Rural pubs have been closed all year.  The owners of those pubs are suffering mentally and financially because of that.  I mention the people who used to frequent those pubs, including the people from the hills and glens of Kerry.  Many of them have not seen a pint since last March and it could be next March or farther on before they get one.</p>  <p>  How is it that farm inspections are still taking place?  They are taking place on behalf of all the agencies, even though when farmers or business people want something, the reason given for not helping them is that no one can come out to help due to the coronavirus.</p> <p>However, the enforcement officers and inspectors can go out.  The banks are using the coronavirus to safeguard themselves.  Many young people who are rightfully entitled to and who want to put a roof over their heads, and who should be lauded for that given what is happening with the social housing list, are being ignored by the banks.  Even though we as a nation bailed out the banks, they are ignoring the young people who want to access a mortgage for the purpose of putting a roof over their heads.  That is a disaster.  The Government will have to call them aside and ensure people get what they rightfully deserve.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the very positive responses from many colleagues to the vaccination strategy that was launched yesterday.  I also thank colleagues for their ongoing advocacy regarding the importance, safety and efficacy of vaccinations.</p><p>It is safe to say we have had a challenging year as we battled with this global pandemic.  It has been a year marked by awful tragedy for many who have lost loved ones and have not been able to mourn for them in the way that we need to in our culture.  It has been a year marked by sickness for many more people who have been seriously debilitated by Covid-19 and a year in which many of us have experienced feelings of despair, frustration and awful loneliness.  </p><p>Against this difficult backdrop in the midst of a global pandemic, the people of Ireland have shown great fortitude, great resilience and great solidarity.  As we come to the end of the D&aacute;il term and prepare for Christmas, I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of everyone right across the country this year for everything they have done.</p><p>Regarding this debate, I have tabled an amendment to the motion, which I hope colleagues from all parties and none can support in a show of political solidarity.  It notes that we the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledge the extraordinary solidarity, determination and resilience shown this year by communities and citizens in Ireland's fight against Covid-19; the widespread support and adherence to public health measures by the public, communities, voluntary organisations and people in workplaces; and the critical contributions of workers and volunteers right across society, including in healthcare, education, childcare, justice, the voluntary sector, retail, distribution, utilities, hospitality and many more.  </p><p>The amendment also asks that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes the enormous human, societal and economic costs of the pandemic, including, most tragically, 2,134 lives lost to Covid-19 this year and nearly 77,000 confirmed cases; the adverse impact of Covid-19 on existing hospital waiting lists, as Deputies quite rightly spoke about; a significant impact on mental health and well-being and the need for a corresponding increase in mental health services and supports across Ireland; an increase in isolation and loneliness for many people due to the impact of Covid-19 measures; the closure of many viable businesses right across Ireland and the devastating impact on particular sectors including the arts, hospitality, tourism sport and many more; and an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.5% with nearly 72,000 more people unemployed compared to last year.  </p><p>The amendment further notes that thanks to the collective efforts of people, Ireland has currently has the lowest 14-day and seven-day incidence rates of Covid-19 in the EU; our hospitals, including critical care facilities, have not been overrun because to Covid-19; and Ireland has had the biggest fall in Covid-related deaths of any European country between wave one and wave two.  </p><p>The amendment also notes the supports put in place, including fiscal support of more than &euro;25 billion, including in the form of direct taxation and expenditure measures; the recent public service pay deal, which is heavily weighted towards those on lower incomes with a headline increase of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants; weekly payments valued to hundreds of thousands of euro for people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to help cushion the population from sudden income shocks at a cost of nearly &euro;5 billion; essential financial supports provided to community and voluntary organisations and social enterprises to enable them to continue to provide essential goods and services on a local level for communities across the country - this is in the form of the &euro;4.2 million Covid-19 emergency fund and the &euro;45 million Covid stability fund, as well as a &euro;5 million innovate together fund and a range of other rural investment schemes being provided by Government; protective measures to ensure ongoing provision of healthcare, including &euro;4 billion to protect, reform and expand health and social care services and implement universal healthcare in budget 2021; and measures to protect the elderly, vulnerable groups and those experiencing loneliness and social isolation, including significant funding for mental health services, with that budget increasing to nearly &euro;1.1 billion next year.  </p><p>Finally and importantly, the amendment affirms D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann's support for vaccines.  It welcomes the plan to approve and roll-out vaccines for Covid-19 in Ireland in early 2021, or based on news we got yesterday, perhaps in the last few days of 2020.  It notes and applauds the success of the HSE and patient advocates in reversing the fall in uptake of the HPV vaccine, which helps prevent cervical and other cancers and is saving many lives.  It notes the achievements by patients such as Laura Brennan, a powerful advocate who died in early 2019 and whose advocacy will have saved many lives.  Laura used her voice, selflessness and courage to advocate for the life-saving HPV vaccine and to help people make informed choices.  Her advice to get the full information about vaccines from reputable sources is as important today as it was when she gave it in 2018.</p><p>I know Deputies will play their part when it comes to public health and information about vaccines.  I reiterate my thanks to them for their support and advocacy on their own behalf and on behalf of the their parties to date on this issue.</p><p>It has been a dark and difficult year in more ways than we can count for people right across our country.  I am hopeful for what the coming year, 2021, will bring.  I am immensely proud of what Ireland has achieved during the year in what has been a very tough period.  Right now, we have the lowest 14-day and seven-day incidence rates of Covid of any country in Europe.  Many of our nearest neighbours and friends are having to tighten restrictions over Christmas due to a surge in infections.  Our thoughts are very much with the people of Northern Ireland.  We have all seen the news of some of the issues they are having to deal with.  </p><p>As a nation, we took decisive and proactive action and put in place level 5 restrictions for a period of six weeks in late October but the thanks for that does not go to the Government or to us in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but to the people who backed that advice, got behind those measures and implemented them.  What we have seen are the results of everybody's efforts.  The daily case rate fell from 1,200 to 250 and the 14-day incidence rate fell from nearly 310 to just below 80.  According to modelling from NPHET, this action by the Irish people has led to the prevention of tens of thousands of cases, the prevention of between 800 and more than 2,000 hospitalisations and the prevention of many deaths.  Thanks to what people have done through the year, through the level 5 restrictions and through the past few weeks in sticking with the level 3 restrictions, hundreds and men and women will have dinner with their families on Christmas day who otherwise would not have.  I immensely proud of our nation and how we have responded to make that happen.</p> <p> We learned valuable lessons during the first wave.  We ensured that nursing homes got the supports they needed.  We carried out serial testing in high-risk areas and we have expanded our testing and tracing scheme.  These are just some of the actions we have taken.</p> <p> We all know that the challenge is far from over, but the promise of vaccines brings hope and light at the end of a dark year.  The gains made in reducing transmission were hard won and will be hard to maintain, but as we have shown right from the start, Ireland is more than up to the challenge.  We will continue to mind one another and keep one another safe, and we will emerge from this time in our history as we entered it - together.</p></speech>

We are discussing the roll-out of a vaccine.  I am not anti-vaccine, but I want the public to be given information so that if people have concerns and questions, they can be addressed.  People should not be dictated to or threatened into taking the vaccine.  I have publicly stated that, when the vaccine is available to me, I will seek medical advice from my own GP on when the right time to take it is.</p>  <p>  Our main problem is the information that is being provided to the public.  In recent weeks, Christmas lights were turned on in the Minister's constituency in Greystones.  During a lockdown, he tweeted that they were being turned on to make people come to the event he was promoting.</p></speech>

However, when people have questions about the vaccine or they have concerns because they have suffered from depression, anxiety or so on, the Government tries to push something on them and is using the media to shove it down people's throats like a police state.  Ireland is a free country and people are entitled to ask questions about what is going into their bodies.  I am not anti-vaccine, but I am a curious person and I would like to know and understand what I am taking and to welcome it.  That is what the message needs to focus on.  There is an old saying, "You will get more with honey than with vinegar."  The Government should wake up, see that and not treat people as if they were uneducated.  All they have are simple questions to feel good about taking the vaccine.  It is okay to be scared and to ask questions.  Stop penalising people for doing that.</p>  <p>  I have been saying since the start that the pandemic has shown the lack of broadband in rural Ireland.  "Rural Ireland" means what is past the Red Cow roundabout.  There are 544,000 homes in the national broadband plan's intervention areas.  In Limerick, 21,231 houses have no broadband.</p>  <p>  The pandemic has shown us that we do not have transport systems.  If I want to go to my local shop, which is 1.7 km from my house, I have to cycle, walk or drive.  If the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, had his way, we would all be walking or cycling.  If I want to go to a supermarket, the nearest one to me is 7.3 km away.  The next supermarket is 19 km away.  The next one is 15 km away from my house.  If I want to get a bus to Dublin, someone must drive me to it because there are no parking facilities at bus stops in rural Ireland.  There are students in my area who attend college in Limerick.  One student's parent must drive her 7 miles to get the bus to Colbert station in Limerick city.  She must then get another bus to reach college.  If she has to be in college for 8 a.m., she must get up at 6 a.m.  Is it the same for anyone in the cities where there is transport?  It is not.  The Government is shoving every cent that is collected in rural Ireland into cities' infrastructure.  It is not investing in rural Ireland.  Mine is a household of six people and four cars, plus the cars I have through my business as a self-employed person to go to work.  I have no alternative but to use my vehicle.  I pay 52 cent or 53 cent in taxes to the Government on every &euro;1 of fuel.  The Government then puts that money into the cities.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the Government was trying to get people into towns and villages where there was infrastructure.  I have been roaring from the rooftops since joining the D&aacute;il that Askeaton has been looking for a sewerage system for 30 years.  People cannot build in Oola because its sewerage system is at capacity.  The council has 25 houses to build in Kilfinane, but six of them in a housing estate have to be connected to private systems inside the houses themselves to make up the numbers because only 15 of the houses can be connected to the sewerage system.  The Government is stopping many voids from being rebuilt in our areas because of conservation issues.  We cannot get our young people into villages and towns.  Social housing cannot be built in our areas because there is not enough infrastructure.  The Government is saying that it will encourage people to go to towns and villages and that this will be great, but there is no infrastructure.  I know this because I have been in construction all my life and the people phoning me day in, day out are saying that they have no services.  To get a taxi from my house to the city costs &euro;50.  Where would someone go in Dublin for &euro;50?</p>  <p>  Look at the big picture.  Who will put the food on the Minister's table when he goes home this evening?  The milk, the bread, the beef or, if he is a vegan, the lettuce or whatever he is on.  Rural Ireland puts it there.  It is about time the Government woke up and invested in rural Ireland.  Why does the Minister think there are 23 Independents from outside Dublin?  It is because the Government has forgotten rural Ireland and to invest in it.  It does not know how to invest in rural Ireland.  Why does the Minister not ask someone who knows?  I have lived and worked in rural Ireland all my life.  I know rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will turn to the issue of mental health.</p> <p>We mentioned the pubs.  They are not wet pubs; they are traditional pubs.  We have no post office in my area.  They closed down our creamery.  We have one shop, O'Gorman's, in Granagh, and one public house, The Rock Bar, also in Granagh.  That is where I live in rural Ireland.  We have a hall, a national school and a church, but each one of those is 2 km to 3 km away from me.  Beyond that I have to go to Adare, Newcastle West or Killmallock, which involves making a journey of 20 km.  They closed every pub in Ballingarry.  Those were the only outlets people in rural Ireland could go to have a social life.  We are not talking about sessions but somewhere to meet their neighbours because the Government has closed everything else and it has not invested in anything else.  That is what rural Ireland is about.</p> <p> I am proud to have been born in rural Ireland, in Limerick, and I am proud to have worked in Limerick all my life.  The Minister might start investing in Limerick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600012#K00200"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in this debate.  There is no disputing that Covid-19 has turned our society and our economy completely upside down.  It has brought great difficulties and has asked many hard questions of the people.  In particular, it has put pressure on healthcare and medical workers.</p>  <p>  I want to talk briefly about student nurses and midwives because they are one group who have experienced the sharpest edges of this pandemic.  This is a timely opportunity, therefore, to remind people of what this Government has done over the past two weeks.  Only two weeks ago, Government Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted against giving nurses a fair wage despite the essential role they have played during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Deputies in my constituency, Deputies Darragh O'Brien, Alan Farrell and Joe O'Brien, voted against paying student nurses and midwives.  However, just five days later, the same Government managed to find &euro;12 million to restore pension payments for retired taoisigh and the same Ministers who were in office during the financial crash a decade ago.  On top of that it has decided to increase the pay of political party Whips in the D&aacute;il, an increase the Sinn F&eacute;in Whips have declined.  This is a shocking insult to student nurses and midwives who do highly skilled work in challenging conditions.  They are the glue that holds our healthcare system together.  Without them, the healthcare system simply could not function in the way that it does.  Many student nurses and midwives across north County Dublin have been working around the clock to provide essential healthcare to our community.  Rounds of applause and kind words do not pay the rent.  The Government has badly let down our student nurses and midwives.  That is unacceptable.  The comparison between having money for retired taoisigh and Ministers but refusing to pay student nurses and midwives shows where this Government's priorities truly lie.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister and his Government to put in place a safe and secure system to allow the immediate family members of the players and coaches partaking in the ladies' and men's all-Ireland football finals to attend the games this weekend.  Sinn F&eacute;in has previously called for this to be done for the hurling and camogie finals as well as the men's and women's FAI Cup matches.  I cannot imagine how disappointing it must be as a parent to be told that while restrictions in many other sectors are being eased, one cannot stand in a massive and almost empty 80,000-seater stadium and see one's child play on what is one of the most important occasions of his or her life.</p>  <p>  The issue of wet pubs or traditional pubs has been raised.  The continued closure of these traditional pubs and small rural pubs, and pubs in working-class areas in particular, without proper compensation for those businesses has devastated the pub trade.  On top of that, insurance companies have refused to pay up on business interruption claims from some businesses, in particular pubs that have seen their business drastically affected by the public health restrictions.  I call on the Government to deliver additional support for those pubs that have been closed for almost a year and will be under enforced closure over Christmas which, under normal circumstances, would be their busiest time of the year.  Fair is fair.  These businesses have been under lock and key and they deserve to be helped through this time.</p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to raise briefly with the Minister the case of Aer Lingus workers and their social welfare entitlements, that is, their short-time work support payment to which they are entitled.  Those workers have been providing the necessary and relevant forms to their employer to sign with the details of the reduced hours they are on.  However, Aer Lingus has not been accurately or properly sending that information to the Department of Social Protection or to the Intreo offices.  Instead, for reasons that I believe now need to be investigated by the appropriate agencies, it has been putting the wrong information on the forms telling the Department that the workers have been working full hours when their hours have been reduced to 30% in some cases.  Some of the workers whose claims have been assessed have been denied their payment in the wrong.  The incorrect information relayed by the company has resulted in them not getting their payments to which they are clearly entitled.  Those workers are genuinely concerned about what is happening.  I ask the Minister to join the T&aacute;naiste and, please, have this matter investigated.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister and his Government to review the ban on music and dancing at weddings.  The reaction from couples getting married to this most recent decision has been one of extreme disappointment, bearing in mind that these are people who have postponed their wedding day again and again.  They have scaled them back again and again but feel the ban on music and dancing is very mean-spirited.  I urge the Minister to review that, please.  All these couples want is to have some sort of celebration on what we hope - and I often say to my husband that I hope - is a once in a lifetime event for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600012#K00300"><p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this important motion.  We have listened to all the praise here for student nurses, healthcare staff, services workers, childcare workers, people who work in the area of mental health, small and medium businesses and those who run the traditional pubs, yet there is very little support for them.  People have contacted my office in the past couple of months, but particularly in recent weeks, who say they are getting zero services.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis is escalating but I want to speak about the local businesses and the local pubs.  I met about 48 publicans a number of weeks ago and, for the record, we adhered to the social distancing rules.  I listened to all sides of the story.  Some owners can afford to open but are not allowed open.  Some cannot open because of the restrictions.  I acknowledge that there are certain payments in place but many of the pub owners I met are over the age of 66, and because they already get a payment, they have been cast out on the side.</p>  <p>  It may not be fair to single out one local business, but when the lockdown restrictions came in, the La Trattoria restaurant in Midleton cooked more than 3,500 dinners which volunteers and staff delivered to people who were under house self-isolation.  They should be acknowledged for doing that.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to start thinking outside the box and show some empathy and a bit of balance, as previous speakers said.  In particular, he might give people in the pub trade a choice in terms of what they can do.  Musicians are suffering badly as a result of the restrictions, and weddings were mentioned earlier.</p>  <p>  I had many inquiries from expectant mothers whose partners were not allowed go into hospital with them.  What should have been the happiest time of their lives was very stressful.  I welcome the recent announcement on that.</p>  <p>  While we seem to be moving in the right direction, and we can put up the red flag, we have to take a case-by-case approach to the restrictions and be empathetic.  There is a perception that if we open the pub doors, everyone will run into them.  I do not believe that will be the case.  What is hurting people more than anything else, regardless of their age or the demographic they come from, is the lack of choice.  People are not being given the choice, which is the most important aspect.  In a few months we will be a year under these restrictions.  We have to take into account all the decisions being made, whether by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Government or NPHET, but we have to be conscious also of the mentality, the stress levels and the pressure on people who cannot get access to health services or whatever.  As I said, we should take everything case by case, be empathetic, think about the choices we make and how they affect people but also about how we can give people the opportunity to choose to do what they know is right for them.</p></speech>

I spoke to a lady who brought her elderly father to an accident and emergency department last weekend.   After waiting in a chair for eight hours wearing a mask, he was seen after midnight, was kept in and is still in hospital.  He has not had any visitors, he has received bad news and his family has not been allowed in to see him.  I ask Deputies to imagine getting a cancer diagnosis and having no family member to provide comfort.  Everyone is distraught and it is inhumane.</p>  <p>  I have consistently said in this House that we need to find a balance between mental and physical health.  I have met with many groups that advocate for older people over the last few weeks and they are saying the same thing: we need to consider the mental health of our older people.  Sadly, I am aware of an elderly person who committed suicide recently.  We are at the end of it when it comes to that.  I also know several older people who have been saved because of the intervention of groups like Older Voices Kildare and HOPE(D) in Newbridge.  On many occasions, I have raised HOPE(D) on this floor.  This organisation does the very best it can.  The HSE sends clients to HOPE(D) and yet it gets no funding.  I feel this needs to be looked at and I ask the Minister to do something about it.</p>  <p>  Everyone knows this virus has affected our older people disproportionately but the effect on their mental health is less widely known.  Loneliness is a killer.  People who feel lonely are 64% more likely to develop dementia than those with an active social life.  I thank those who care for our older people.  We need to ensure our carers get what they deserve and they need to get it without having to jump through hoops.  The form for the carer's allowance is 40 pages long and it is an onerous task to complete it.  We need to ensure those in the caring profession, as a minimum, receive a living wage.  Finally, I implore the Government to do the right thing and pay student nurses and midwives and offer no more excuses.</p></speech>

It is important to have this discussion.  Like everyone interested in sport, I am enjoying the GAA championship.  Credit needs to go to the GAA for having managed to organise a championship in a year when there are so many challenges.  There are over 60 recognised sports national governing bodies, NGBs, under the umbrella of Sport Ireland, all of which have elite sportspeople.  Many such sportspeople have contacted me to express their concern that they cannot compete while the GAA has been able to.  There is a sense that there is one door into the Minister with responsibility for sports for the GAA and another door that all the other sports have to squeeze through.  The Olympics are coming next year and many of those who will be competing are not able to compete, train and practice.  Undoubtedly, this will impact their preparations.  Basketball, tennis, athletics, hockey and many other sports feel they are getting shafted by this Government.  It should not come down to who is the best at lobbying.  It should be decided on the basis of science and decisions should be determined by evidence-based information.  If that information is available, it must be communicated to the various sports clubs and NGBs.</p>  <p>  The GAA is a fantastic organisation and does wonderful work around the country at many levels, including community level.  It does so much good work around mental health issues and, of course, sport itself.  However, there is a sense among many other sports that the GAA is getting preferential treatment.  I understand that some Olympic athletes may be considering travelling abroad in order to get the competition they need.  Olympian Rob Heffernan highlighted recently that athletes going to the next Olympics cannot train and the Government does not consider these Olympians elite athletes.  Therefore, they cannot compete in various competitions that they need to.  They have world-class facilities in Ireland and that needs to be addressed.  All sports should be treated equally, including hockey, tennis, basketball and athletics.  The Government needs to widen the definition of what is elite.</p></speech>

People are finally looking forward to going out socialising with family and friends.  The long-awaited controlled environments that the Government has announced for people to go out and meet in are welcome.  Realistically, this will not be possible for many ordinary people because having to pay for a substantial meal will limit or completely stop them from going out to socialise with family and friends.  Wet pubs or traditional pubs being closed means most ordinary people, many of whom have been badly affected financially by the Covid-19 crisis, do not have the resources to go out for a number of nights with family and friends.  They will have to pick and choose.  With the time restrictions in restaurants, this is completely unfair.  It means people who are well-off with money in the bank can go out for their wine and cheese and fancy meals seven nights a week if they want but ordinary families and people who want to socialise with family and friends will be limited or restricted because they do not have the money.  Does the Minister think it is fair that the Government brought this in?  We have to look at everyone&rsquo;s right to socialise with their family and friends in a safe environment and in an affordable way.  People are struggling this year and it feels like this Government is penalising ordinary people.  Many people just want to go out with their friends to have a chat, maybe to have a drink and to relax but they are not able to do that.</p>  <p>  We have to think of the publicans who have been closed for almost a year.  I know many publicans in my community who are devastated, as are their families, by what has happened to them.  The unfairness they feel is palpable.  It is frustrating for them to have their doors locked and to know that their regulars who came in for a chat and to socialise are locked out.  While those with money in the bank can go out as often as they want, ordinary people cannot.  I do not think that is fair on ordinary people or publicans.  Sinn F&eacute;in has supported this Government in the public health measures but we think it needs to be balanced because people need to be respected.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</p></speech>

I searched closely with my own eyes and did a word search online because I could not find the word "vaccine" in it, which I found shocking.  It calls on the Government to "publish a clear, transparent and concise exit strategy from this virus, so that everyone can begin to plan for the future and know that there is light at the end of the tunnel".  The rest of us in Irish politics for the last number of weeks, particularly the last two weeks, have been talking about the vaccine, how it will be rolled out and how the list will work.  These are real practical questions.</p></speech>

Deputy Danny Healy-Rae had his chance.  I have only a few minutes and this is an important point to make because this is the light at the end of the tunnel.  That there is no mention of the vaccine in this motion is very telling.  While they may protest that they are not anti-vaccine, they are.  That they do not mention the vaccine in a two and a half page motion on all things Covid is an indictment of where they stand on this fundamentally important issue.</p> <p>Deputy McGrath is chuckling at what I said.

I commend the Minister on mentioning the memory and work of the late Laura Brennan, who was a true hero in this country and deserves to be commended and remembered in the House as often as is appropriate.  It is appropriate to remember her at this time.</p>  <p>  Is the Rural Independent Group serious about wanting to get out of the tragedy that has been the Covid pandemic?  The rest of us are.  We may have different ways of doing that and query or question what the Government is doing, but we all agree that, throughout the world, the provision of a safe vaccine to all people in an efficient way is the only true way of getting out of this. </p>  <p>  We have all experienced pain and been hurt by this pandemic.  This motion tries to exacerbate the urban-rural divide.  I am delighted that Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned that rural Ireland begins outside the Red Cow roundabout.  I happen to live outside of the Red Cow roundabout.  I have not been able to go to my local pub which does not serve food, and I miss it.  No pub should be unable to reopen when all of this ends.  I hope there will be support from Government so that my local pub will be able to reopen and, when it is appropriate and public health allows, I will be able to go for a pint with my brother-in-law or a friend.  I miss the pub.</p>  <p>  It might come as a surprise to some rural Deputies that I miss going to mass.  I have not been able to go to mass.  This is not just an urban-rural issue.  The Deputies to whom I refer will not hold that ground.  It is absolute nonsense.</p>  <p>  Broadband is an issue in my constituency, as well as within the canals of Dublin and the centres of all major cities and towns in Ireland.  These issues cut across the breadth of Ireland.  To have a false dichotomy and an urban-rural divide being stoked by this group every time its Members take to their feet on an issue does a disservice to the major issues in this country such as trying to get out of the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  I speak to a plethora of issues.  I again have to raise the issue of Aer Lingus workers.  Their management are signing forms for short-time work which are totally inaccurate in terms of their experience during the crisis.  It has to be asked whether this is a concerted effort to try to time out the entitlement to short-time work.  I hope it is not and that this issue will be brought to the Minister for Social Protection and the Taoiseach.  There has generally been goodwill from this and the previous Government and most people on this side of the House to try to ensure that any workers who have been adversely affected, and there are hundreds of thousands of them,  get the supports they need and are entitled to the benefits that are available.</p>  <p>  There are issues in respect of people who are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and who were working for companies which availed of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, over the summer and then transferred to the PUP.  They do not have enough entitlements to receive the Christmas bonus.  These people have, in essence, been on State support since March.  The TWSS is administered through Revenue and the PUP is the responsibility of the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which means people have fallen outside of the criteria for the Christmas bonus.  Can that be examined, even if the bonus is paid after Christmas, allowing for administrative delays?</p>  <p>  We reiterate our call for a vaccine and the efficient roll-out of same.  Health professionals are backing this vaccine.  They have said so publicly.  If Deputies open their ears, they will listen to and hear them.  In early June I met Professor Luke O'Neill of Trinity College when we were at a stage that we were discussing the efficacy of face masks.  It is incredible to think that that conversation was being had.  Now their efficacy is accepted by almost everyone.  Not everyone who signed the motion believes in wearing face masks.</p>  <p>  In my meeting with Professor Luke O'Neill he showed me some data on the different scientists, companies and universities that were working on a vaccine.  He said nothing like this has happened in human history.  Almost the entire resources of science have been dedicated to this.  It is no surprise that the vaccine has been brought forward relatively quickly.  Unfortunately, it has not been quick enough for the thousands of people who have died, have contracted the virus and have suffered deeply or are suffering from the effects of long Covid.</p>  <p>  There was footage on yesterday's news from hospital wards of the people who are still on ventilators and receiving emergency treatment.  That footage is still powerful because people are still dying and are still in intensive care.  A way out of this is to support the vaccine and answer any hesitancy with facts from medical professionals and scientists.  Unfortunately, the motion, for all its words, does not include those words and that is a shameful omission from a motion that is supposed to cover everything that is important in respect of Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600014#M01000"><p>It is very hard to understand what this motion is about.  There are lots of words in it and it comprises two and a half pages.  It makes 24 different statements about different aspects of the impact of Covid on the country.  Many of those statements are valid enough.  The motion calls on the Government to do 12 different things.  To use the word "omnibus" understates the motion.  Everything seems to have been thrown into it, including the kitchen sink.</p>  <p>  It is a poor use of time.  The 24 statements in the motion are divided between issues in respect of mental health, the vast majority of which are absolutely valid.  We had a very good debate here last week on this, which was a very good use of Private Member's time by the Regional Group.  We discussed the significant impact of Covid on the country's mental health and well-being, the fact that our services have been underfunded and that we need additional funding.</p>  <p>  What strikes me about this motion is that it has plucked a figure of &euro;250 million out of the air for mental health services.  I have no idea where that figure has come from.  Last week we discussed the shortfalls in funding for mental health which have been clearly identified by people working in the area and in funding which was promised by Government.  There is no reference to that in the motion, which brings into question the credibility of some of the claims that are being made.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of statements being made about the impact of Covid on our health service.  There is no doubt that there has been a significant impact on our health service from Covid.  Many procedures, operations and elements of the health service have, unfortunately, been put on hold.  There are major problems, and we are storing up problems for the future with those delays.  Last week we discussed this issue very carefully in the Joint Committee on Health.  Witnesses from the cancer programme came before us and explained very clearly what the approach now is.  To suggest that there can be an urgent programme to clear all of the waiting lists for screening is not realistic.  None of this is based on evidence.</p>  <p>  Part and parcel of the health statements in the motion concern the need to fund Sl&aacute;intecare properly.  That is absolutely true and I would like to hear more from the Rural Independent Group about having a proper public health service and funding and implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare programme fully, but I am not sure that many of its members have been vocal on the need for a proper public health service.  They have taken different approaches.  Again, there is a lack of consistency in that regard.</p>  <p>  The third element in the motion is the whole question of rural Ireland.  I completely agree with the point made by Deputy Duncan Smith that this is a false dichotomy.  Those of us who represent Dublin constituencies and other urban constituencies are pretty fed up with this carry on and putting on the poor mouth.</p>  <p>We have serious problems with poverty and a lack of investment in infrastructural projects, mental health problems and problems with local businesses in urban Ireland also.  It would be much better if we worked together to address the whole issue of disadvantage and exclusion throughout the country, whether those people who are excluded and disadvantaged are living in urban or rural Ireland.  I have often thought I would love to have the time or somebody to do a piece of work to identify where the funding is going.  I have no doubt the arguments about rural Ireland always losing out would not stand up to any scrutiny if we were to examine closely where various pots of funding go.  There have been various Ministers who have seen it as their purpose in life to allocate funding to rural Ireland solely and not take into consideration disadvantage in urban areas.  This is a false argument.  It really takes us nowhere to keep banging that drum.</p> <p> I want to devote time to developments overnight on the shocking situation in Northern Ireland.  Last night, at one hospital in Northern Ireland 43 patients were waiting in the emergency department for beds and outside that hospital 17 ambulances were lined up with patients in them and doctors had to come out and treat them in ambulances.  It is a shocking indictment of the political system in Northern Ireland that this situation has been allowed to develop.  In the context of all that evidence on the soaring levels of Covid and the increasing number of people having to be hospitalised and admitted to ICU that a decision was taken at political level that the area be opened up, that businesses be opened up and that pubs and restaurants operate is a shocking indictment.  There are big questions about the lack of leadership from the health Minister and members of the Assembly.  They have let down their people very badly in their failure to address this and there are many lessons that could have been learned from the Republic in this regard.</p> <p> It is very clear that what happens in Northern Ireland impacts significantly on the Republic of Ireland and particularly those counties around the Border.  One of the elements I want to express concern about again is the failure to introduce any control on travel by people in Northern Ireland through Dublin Airport.  Yesterday, in reply to a parliamentary question, I received the figures with regard to people coming through Dublin Airport.  They are hugely down, with a 90% reduction on what we would expect at this time of the year, but relatively significant numbers are coming in from Portugal and Spain.  The follow-up has been weak enough and, unfortunately, this has been the case from the beginning.  There was not a strategy to eliminate Covid and lessons were not learned from countries that have been successful in doing this with regard to travel.  The reality is we continue to allow the Dublin dodge to go on where there is no follow-up whatsoever on Northern residents who are going in and out of Dublin Airport.  This is a real difficulty.  It causes a huge threat to public health safety in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  It has been a huge failure of the Government and something that desperately needs to be addressed.  We are facing into the Christmas and new year period, and there will be a lot of travel back and forth from the North to Dublin and elsewhere over the Christmas period.  There will also be a huge amount in the new year period when so many people go off to the sun or go off skiing.  We need to address this loophole that exists in the Dublin dodge.  I strongly appeal to the Government to take action before it is too late.</p></speech>

We are all responsible Deputies and we will ensure we promote the vaccine.  I do not accept lectures from the same party that lectured us about water charges.  Neither do I have huge criticism of the motion but I am glad to see that it mentions the student nurses and why they should be paid.</p>  <p>  I want to raise more generally the idea that, as Winston Churchill famously said after the Second World War, never let a good crisis go to waste.  When we google this expression, we find one business magazine gives the following explanation. "In challenging times one must question the accepted reality because things are going wrong, rapid answers are needed and the solution may well be found outside the usual compass."  This has been what we have been doing since February or March, finding solutions outside the usual compass and passing legislation at rapid pace.  This has included very extraordinary legislation that we would never have accepted in normal times.</p>  <p>  We do not seem to be able to accept in normal times that a group of workers, all 1,200 of them, who were cast out of their jobs in an unusual way and unusual times by Debenhams, are now being told to go back to school.  The settlement given to them last night to allow a fund of &euro;3 million to re-educate them, give them career guidance and start their own businesses was the most insulting answer to the most proud group of working-class women I have ever met in my life.  They are reeling at the idea that the Government could answer their 250 day struggle in this way.  It would have escalated were we not in extraordinary times.  There would have been marches of thousands of workers up to the D&aacute;il every other day of the week were it not for the lockdown.  This prevented the Debenhams workers being able to generalise their dispute to other groups of workers, such as the Arcadia workers who will be similarly impacted.  This does matter and we have to raise it.  In these extraordinary times, the Government could have gone outside the normal compass and allow the preferential creditors of Revenue and the Department of Social Protection to give the Debenhams workers their two plus two but, no, it is giving them &euro;3 million to go back to school.</p>  <p>  Tonight, we will be voting for some extraordinary legislation that is also being pushed through by never letting a good crisis go to waste.  A total of &euro;50 million will be transferred to Estonia and Denmark to buy fantasy energy that does not exist to acknowledge our failure to invest in renewable energies.  The investment limited partnerships Bill on which we will be voting is allowing us to collude with the structures that will see massive tax evasion globally.  We are speaking about trillions of dollars.  However, we cannot find a measly &euro;13 million to see the Debenhams workers have their full redundancy payment.</p>  <p>  What we need to do take the &euro;3 million the Government is offering to SOLAS which, by the way, outsources all of the education to private firms and is pushing up the cost of even getting a Safe Pass for a construction site and hand it over to the Debenhams workers to give them a Christmas after 250 days picketing and being treated in the most abysmal way.  This is not because they were made redundant like many others but because their redundancy should have fallen within protective legislation that should have been implemented under the Duffy Cahill report but is still sitting on the desk of the T&aacute;naiste and is not being given priority.  This tells us difference between how the Government sees the very wealthy, elite and tiny 1% who control all of the finances-----</p></speech>

They have been limited in the action they can take because of the Covid restrictions despite the fact their company used Covid as a cover to sack them by email, despite the fact they were forced to picket in a level 5 lockdown and despite the fact their campaign has been a litmus test for how workers are treated in a period of Covid.  I want to make some brief points.  The workers demand was for two plus two.  They did not receive one penny extra above the statutory in the offer they received last night.  Instead, a fund of &euro;3 million for education and training, of extremely limited value, was offered to a group of workers, many of whom are coming to the end of their working careers and working lives and many of whom are already in training.</p> <p>I echo the call from the shop stewards for that &euro;3 million to be put into a cash offer and put towards topping up the workers' redundancies.  In Cork this morning, the workers have unfurled a banner in Patrick Street that states, "The Taoiseach has let us down badly".  Never was a truer word spoken.  In September, they were offered &euro;1 million above the statutory redundancy.</p></speech>

The workers have been hemmed in by the Covid restrictions.  There would have been many more people on mass pickets if it were not for the Covid restrictions.  It is shameful for Revenue to state, as it has in the past week, that it will not surrender one penny from the redundancy pot and for the Department of Social Protection to state it will not surrender one penny for the redundancy pot, with the result that the workers do not get a penny on top of the statutory redundancy.  The Taoiseach and the Government will not just walk away without what has gone on being exposed.</p></speech>

I pay my respects to the 2,134 people who have lost their lives through Covid and acknowledge the suffering that all their families have endured this year.  The 76,766 people who have contracted Covid have also suffered a great deal.</p>  <p>  We have to acknowledge what people have done to try to contain this virus and pandemic.  It has been an enormous sacrifice, with many aspects of life, rural and urban, greatly affected by it.  Our mental health services have been disrupted no end.  I ask the Minister to take on board that mental health services urgently need to be brought back to normal, as do disability services, which, through nobody's fault, have not been given proper consideration throughout this pandemic.  I acknowledge, however, that efforts are being made to reinstate these services.</p>  <p>  As for the health service, I get many calls from people on waiting lists.  I received a reply from the HSE the other day stating that the audiology service in Galway has a waiting time of 80 weeks for appointments.  That is totally unacceptable and we need to do something about it as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  Our schools - national and secondary - have been a beacon of light.  School secretaries have made enormous efforts and their call for equal pay needs to be properly addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  In Claremorris, the principal of a school has been left out to dry.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, might talk to the Minister for Education to see whether they can help the man in question, rather than leaving him out to dry.</p>  <p>  Another issue that arises in my office relates to the cohesion of the message on restrictions and how it is delivered.  I ask that the HSE, along with all Departments, have a common message that is more readily available for people when they seek answers to questions.  While I commend all the work carried out by the staff of the Department of Social Protection, one issue needs examination, namely, that of people over the age of 66 who have been left with the PUP.</p></speech>

That is roughly half the number of people who have died from Covid-19 in this State.  That figure far exceeds the proportion of people who have died in nursing homes internationally.  According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25% of Covid deaths internationally have occurred in nursing homes.  In this country, the people most vulnerable to the illness were left most exposed.  After the first wave of the virus passed through the nursing homes, we in Aont&uacute; called for the Government to investigate what happened in these homes.  In large part, we wanted to ensure this would not happen again.  Unfortunately, however, the Government refused to do this.</p>  <p>  On 19 October last, as the second wave started to pass through nursing homes, a case was detected in the Nightingale Nursing Home in Galway.  These were the first cases detected.  Over the next days, two staff members were left to care for all the residents of the nursing home, which begged the HSE for help.  On 22 October, "Today with Claire Byrne" broke the story of a nursing home in Galway where the majority of staff and residents had tested positive for Covid-19 being left without the necessary assistance by the HSE.  I raised this matter in the House on the same day to see whether the Government would do anything to ensure the nursing home received the assistance it needed.  In the middle of my contribution, the Minister for Health accused me of lying.  He stated: "That is a flat-out lie."  His statement did not just call into question my credibility, which is neither here nor there, but also that of the doctor who had raised the concerns and the researchers and producers of the "Today with Claire Byrne" programme.</p>  <p>  My office submitted a freedom of information, FOI, request to the Minister's office.  I now have my hands on a copy of an email sent to the Minister shortly before the matter was raised.  The documents paint a shocking and bleak picture with regard to the communication standards within the HSE.  The email, from the office of the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, stated that the HSE had been trying to source staff to support the nursing home since the Monday of the week in question but that, despite contacting all the agencies the previous day, it had been unable to source any agency nursing staff.</p>  <p>  Six months after the first wave of coronavirus swept through the nursing homes, and after hundreds of deaths had occurred in those homes calls from parties such as Aont&uacute; for an investigation into what had happened during the first wave, we know from the lack of communication within the HSE that it was no further along in October in dealing with the emergency in nursing homes.  That is a shocking indictment of what is happening in the HSE.  My worry is that it is very likely there will be another wave of Covid-19 before the vaccines are rolled out and also very likely that it will affect nursing homes.  I have no confidence, eight months after coronavirus first emerged in this State and after two waves of the virus, that the HSE is better prepared to ensure the necessary staff can be provided in the case of an emergency in a nursing home to ensure an outbreak of Covid can be tackled as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Given that the Minister received this email from the HSE in the early afternoon of 22 October, I ask him to apologise to the House and to correct the record to ensure the integrity of the doctor in question and the integrity of the researchers for the radio show in question is upheld.  I ask him to ensure the truth of what happened in the Nightingale Nursing Home is recorded in the Official Report.  Everything I said in that debate was true and the Department of Health knew that at the time.  It is shocking that these details about nursing homes have emerged and that information travels faster from a nursing home to a doctor, a radio show, a Deputy and the Minister responsible than it does within the HSE.  Some of the details in the response I received to the FOI request show that the Minister complained about this and that it took a month for the HSE to respond to him.</p> <p>It took one month for the HSE to respond to him.  In another report, a staff member of the HSE sent an email two days after the outbreak saying that he thought that the outbreak happened in a nursing home in Galway.</p></speech>

I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion.  I am conscious that I am making my contribution in the context of 2,134 deaths, 77,000 confirmed cases and we are still in the pandemic.  I pay tribute to the people of Ireland who have led us, as they usually do and politicians follow.  I hope that we have learned to take transformative action from Covid, although I have no belief that we have because I think we are heading back to where we were.</p>  <p>  I am not sure of the venom expressed by the Labour Party, in particular some of the comments of Deputy Shortall, in regard to this motion.  I think the motion draws our attention to many things that we need to talk about.  We should have had this debate for an extended period of time.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will know, Covid has affected many segments of society in a most uneven and unequal way.</p>  <p>  I refer again to respite services, which have not been resumed, as one example which has not been mentioned at any higher level.  Surely, at this stage in the 21st century, given that the Minister is taking pride in the reduced figures over the 14 and 17-day period, and rightly so, we should be able to take steps that will give respite, and for carers equally and so on.  My time is limited and I intend to stick to it.</p>  <p>  I am taken by surprise at some of the comments on the motion.  I welcome that it seeks a full debate on the implementation of the regional and rural development plan, which is underpinned in Project Ireland 2040.  I have the privilege of representing Galway West, which includes a very big rural area as well as a city, and I see the divide.  I say that not to intensify the division but to highlight it so that we can work together.  We cannot continue to build cities out of all proportion in an unsustainable manner and not look at what is happening in the rural areas.  I fully support that.</p>  <p>  Covid put a spotlight on our health service.  Decisions were taken that had to be taken, but they were based not on what was in the best interest but on the fact that our health service was so bad.  We failed to prioritise nursing homes and many other vulnerable segments.  Unfortunately, we are still doing that.</p>  <p>  Many things are said in the motion but I do not propose to go into them.  In the one minute I have remaining, I want to focus on mental health.  It is clear that it has never been given the status it deserves.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will make a difference in that regard.  Last week or earlier this week, I quoted figures from the Mental Health Commission and from the inspector, who apparently did a themed report on this some time ago and referred to it again.  Life expectancy is reduced by 15 to 20 years because of the medication being taken.  That is just one aspect where the physical health is completely ignored.</p>  <p>  I want to finish on the vaccines because comments have been made here about them.  This motion calls for an exit strategy and a comprehensive plan.  Clearly, that includes vaccines.  To ensure there is maximum uptake of the vaccines, we need maximum transparency and accountability.  Unfortunately, that is completely lacking in relation to the vaccine strategy we have signed up to with the companies and so on.  If the Minister of State has any influence, I ask her to please ensure we are given full and factual information and, more important, to assure us that the regulatory authority on whom we will be dependent is fully resourced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600017#P00500"><p>I endorse all of what was just said by Deputy Connolly, in particular her final comment.  We are always being told to listen to the medical experts.  The medical experts have been very clear that vaccines do offer great hope in the future, but they do not offer a silver bullet now.  We need to have a lot of other measures in place and to continue to look at what we need to do now.  I am slightly perplexed by the criticisms of this motion.  I thank Deputy Nolan and her colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion, which I am happy to support.  I do not think it is an either-or situation and I do not think anybody is suggesting that it is.  Measures need to be taken now.  We need to look at what we can do now to mitigate further deterioration of the situation.</p><p>I am perplexed by the reluctance to look at antigen testing.  I am not suggesting, and never have, that antigen testing is a silver bullet or a panacea, but it could, and should in my view, be looked at as a great assistance.  People are going to socialise more at Christmas, more than we would like and, perhaps, more than they should.  I do not understand the logic of not providing people with antigen tests so that they can test themselves to see if they pose a risk.  The only positive reason that I have heard against this is that people will behave recklessly if they test negative.  The logic for the refusal to distribute or legalise condoms in Ireland in response to sexually transmitted diseases was that people would behave promiscuously.  That argument failed a long time ago, yet that same logic is being deployed now against antigen testing.</p><p>I was appalled to read in the newspapers that the owner of a bar who was carrying out antigen testing was arrested by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I wish it to be very clear that I am not criticising An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for enforcing the laws that this House facilitated the Government in making, which are idiotic laws.  I am criticising the laws and not the enforcement of them by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is the duty of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the laws of this State.  Furthermore, bars in Dublin which provide so-called substantial meals have offered not to serve the meals where people make a charitable donation instead, but they are being told they have to serve the meals.  I ask the Minister of State to explain, please, how it is safe to allow only a small proportion of bars in this country to open when this means those bars will be more crowded.  Will she please explain to me the logic that because there are kitchens in those bars and properly accredited chefs - it is important that chefs are properly accredited and that there are standards - that somehow provides safety from the transmission of Covid?  I accept it may provide safety from food poisoning.  These bars have kitchens from which food is served that people do not eat and so it is thrown in the bin yet the people cannot make a donation <i>in lieu</i>of it and bar owners who want to carry out testing to make sure that everybody within them is safe to the greatest extent possible are being arrested.  It is idiotic.  It is asinine.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  The substantial meal as a response came from the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, last July.  It is straight out of &quot;Darby O'Gill and the Little People&quot; to believe that tourists would come to Ireland and be safe from Covid if they ate a substantial meal.  It is idiotic and it will not work.  We need to look at more scientific measures, such as antigen testing.</p><p>On nursing homes, we are told that some studies are being carried out on antigen testing.  I do not understand the antipathy to antigen testing in the Irish health system.  I do know there are vested interests in NPHET, who should not be there because it undermines the role of NPHET.  If I had a relative in a nursing home, I would undergo daily testing in order that I could visit him or her.  The Government response is that it is going to look at it and we should not worry ourselves about it.  Meanwhile, the people in the nursing home are getting only visitor per week, which is inadequate and inhumane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600017#P00600"><p>I thank all of the Deputies for some useful inputs today.  The Minister outlined the comprehensive supports the Government has put in place to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and society.  He also outlined the Government's national Covid-19 vaccination strategy.  I can assure the House that the Government is fully committed to supporting people during this challenging  time and I would like to set out in particular some of the important measures that have been put in place to protect the elderly, vulnerable groups and those experiencing loneliness, mental health difficulties and social isolation.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has presented significant challenges for people's mental health, as many individuals have experienced increased stress, anxiety fear or panic.  Supporting positive mental health and well-being is a priority for Government and me, particularly during the current pandemic.</p> <p>We have responded rapidly by reconfiguring existing services and putting additional services and supports in place.  HSE community services moved rapidly to provide in-person specialist services, where it was safe to do so, and to augment this with expanded telehealth services, so as to continue to provide mental health supports to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p> To ensure oversight of the performance of mental health services in responding to Covid-19, the Department of Health worked with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE to develop a risk management framework for residential facilities to identify structural and operational issues and address them, and to track and contain infections within residential and acute units.  The framework reports regularly and infection rates in our facilities have remained low overall.  In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach has established a cross-Government group to support vulnerable persons.  Departments with lead policy responsibility are represented on this oversight group, including the Department of Health.  Vulnerable groups, such as mental health service users, have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and there is a continued need to co-ordinate cross-Government support to these groups of people.</p> <p> The Government has invested significantly in the enhancement of mental health services and the budget now stands at &euro;1.076 billion.  The increase of &euro;50 million secured in the budget will fund an additional 153 staff in enhancing community mental health teams, including CAMHS with 29 new staff.  It will also fund clinical care programmes, including in the areas of dual diagnosis, bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution.  Some &euro;15 million will be allocated to Covid measures, including the provision of extra mental health beds as required.  At regional and local levels, many mental health services have responded throughout the pandemic by implementing innovative practices such as the introduction of a community assessment hub in Cork.  This hub provides direct access to mental health assessment and support seven days a week, reducing the need for people to present to emergency departments. </p> <p> We do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and the subsequent demand on services.  The HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports.  The Department and the HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises.  This is the case, for example, with MyMind, which is a HSE partner NGO providing increased levels of online counselling sessions throughout the pandemic.  It provides counselling in 15 different languages.  Additional funding of &euro;2.2 million has been provided for 2020 to ensure we can meet increased demand through MyMind and a number of other providers.</p> <p> Awareness-raising campaigns that promote existing mental health services have been launched, including through national and local radio campaigns and through the dissemination of leaflets to schools across the country to assist children, young people and adults in finding appropriate supports where needed.  In addition, as part of the HSE&rsquo;s psychosocial response to Covid-19, counselling supports are available to staff impacted by the pandemic.  Local support structures are in place in each CHO and these supports are also available to section 38 and 39 workers.  The programme for Government gives a clear commitment to continue investment in mental health services, as resources allow.  Mental health remains a core aspect of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19.  It is important to note that specialist mental health services have continued to operate at between 85% and 90% of pre-Covid levels.</p> <p> Many comments were made today about older people, and rightly so.  Older people living in nursing homes are among those who have been most adversely affected by Covid-19.  Residents are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings.  The many challenges arising from the management of Covid-19 in nursing homes are identified in the Covid-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel: Examination of Measures to 2021 report, which was published in August 2020.  The expert panel&rsquo;s report includes 86 recommendations in total and there is a robust oversight structure in place to ensure their implementation.  The oversight team reports regularly to me as the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people.  Some highlights of early key progress include the extension of the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, until June 2021, with up to &euro;92 million available in 2020 and up to &euro;42 million available in 2021.  We also have enhanced public health measures, including the provision of staff accommodation when required; support to nursing homes through 23 HSE Covid-19 response teams; provision of PPE free of charge to nursing homes; and serial testing of all nursing home staff on a fortnightly basis. </p> <p> Earlier this month, updated visiting guidance for long-term residential care settings came into effect.  This new guidance outlines an updated definition of "critical and compassionate circumstances", which provides that, subject to risk assessment in each case, people living in nursing homes may receive up to one visit by one person per week under levels 3 and 4 of the framework and up to one visit by one person per two weeks under level 5.  It also notes that every practical effort should be made to accommodate an additional visit on compassionate grounds during the period of a major cultural or religious festival or celebration of particular significance to the resident, such as the Christmas and new year period.  People have been very upset about the fact that they have not been able to see their loved ones, but 32 nursing homes have open clusters of Covid and in the past seven days a further five nursing homes have developed Covid clusters.  Unfortunately, while we are doing very well as a country we cannot take our eye off the ball as regards nursing homes.  We have to be very vigilant to support our older and more vulnerable people.  However, it is important to note that around half of our nursing homes remained Covid-19 free this year and many nursing homes that experienced a Covid-19 outbreak managed very well.</p> <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I welcome the prioritisation of older people under the vaccination strategy as they have been the most affected by the pandemic.  I encourage everyone who is in a position to do so to avail of the vaccine as early as he or she can.  This is such an important step on our way back to normal life.  I will be working, through my officials and the HSE, towards the reopening of day services in the new year.  However, we must remember that this is just the first step and until enough people are vaccinated we must still remember to follow all the infection prevention and control advice to ensure that services that are operating can continue to do so in a safe way. </p> <p> Covid-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of people who are in homelessness and in addiction.  They are a group of people with complex health needs.  The HSE has established the Covid-19 Dublin homeless response team and has appointed a HSE clinical lead.  The team co-ordinates the response to the virus for the homeless population across the whole of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive area.  Socially excluded groups in congregated settings received priority action in terms of detection, case management and contact tracing.  A fast-track flexible approach was used for complex cases in these communities.  The HSE produced Covid-19 guidelines for homeless and vulnerable groups and this provides general advice about preventing the spread of Covid-19 in homeless settings and other vulnerable group settings, including direct provision.  In Dublin, more than 1,000 additional beds were provided and 400 additional beds were put in place in other local authorities nationally.</p> <p> Looking to the future, the Government has taken significant steps in response to Covid and, as I have outlined, this includes vulnerable people, older persons, and people with mental health difficulties.  The Government's response is reflected in the countermotion the Minister has put forward and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle might allow me to digress slightly on another issue.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don iar-Sheanad&oacute;ir, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, agus Mairead McGrath agus Valerie Ward in our office and our support team for bringing this comprehensive motion forward.  I make no apologies for it.  They did that with our input and oversight but we take responsibility for what is in the motion.  I will take no lecture from the Labour Party or the Social Democrats about our motion.  I thank Deputy Connolly for her wise words and for being so mild, accurate and praiseworthy.  We are entitled to bring this motion forward and to deal with it in our own time.  Others have plenty of time to bring motions forward too.  The Labour Party has an obsession.  The former Minister, Deputy Kelly, AK-47, thinks he is still Minister or Taoiseach or Robocop.</p> <p>He was lecturing us all about masks and then he goes out on those loose without one.  He is some man to lecture; Deputy Duncan Smith too.  The Labour Party cut the widow's pension and the women's pensions and they were never forgiven for it.  I think their anger and anxiety is about the 3% the Labour Party is languishing on in the polls under Deputy Kelly.  I will say no more.  We have our rights.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for protecting our rights here, always.</p> <p> I praise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the front line services - not slapping them on the back - and the community groups which have risen up and done so much.  The community garda&iacute; in my area of Cahir and Clonmel, Sergeant Ray Moloney and Sergeant Kieran O'Regan and all the community responded the first and second times and are doing now it again, and they will do it next year when they have to, and they always do.</p> <p> The HSE and the Department of Health are dysfunctional at best, are ignorant of the views of politicians and do not want to know.  Miche&aacute;l Martin can lap it up because he set them up and has failed to disband them since.  They are totally out of control, and they have no respect whatever for politicians as we saw during the week in Carrick on Suir.  He can wax in it.</p> <p> The whole situation has been handled idiotically and illogically from start to finish in my county from Sceich&iacute;n an Rince down to Carrick-on-Suir and up to Roscrea.  The HSE and the Department of Health are doing things in the middle of the pandemic that they wanted to do for a long time, namely, disband and close all the rural small hospitals.  All our Deputies, and I thank them for their contribution and support, mentioned what has been happening in their constituencies.  We are under sustained attack.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her husband well on a personal level.  I did not realise until yesterday that he has not been well.  I would not want to say anything that would hurt or offend them.  However, our service in St. Brigid's District Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir has been taken away.  The Minister of State went on the radio, talking like Maggie Thatcher - it is out, out, out; finished; gone.  We had that before from people and where are they now?  The Dean Maxwell home in Roscrea at the other end of the county has been attacked.  I attended a meeting yesterday with senior HSE officials who were rude and disrespectful to public representatives.  They just said this was happening and would be closed as a long-stay facility.</p> <p> I support Councillor Michael Smith from Tipperary County Council and ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Health to meet with him and Councillors Kieran Bourke, Dinny Dunne and Eddie Reid, Catherine and all the nursing staff and doctors associated with that wonderful institution of St. Brigid's in Carrick on Suir.  It has to remain open.  The Government cannot blame Covid, Chernobyl or any issue like that that suits to put a cloud over things and remove a service that has served so many people in the Minster of State's county as well as mine.  I ask for a commitment that she will meet those people and listen to them.</p> <p> Illogical things are going on.  There are farm inspections being carried out.  Hill sheep farmers are expected to round up sheep whether they have 500, 5,000 or 15,000.  When we want to get information from the Departments, it is so slow.  I support the staff in social welfare and all the Departments trying to help, but if a person wants anything on the schemes, it is very slow, especially when staff in Departments are working from home, yet people are going on farms for inspections.  I have said that they should use technology like drones.  What we need is support for the farmers and the communities.</p> <p> Teachers are in schools with classes of 30.  I have an email from a teacher whose son is a type 2 diabetic.  She says he has had flu three times in the past month, with open windows in schools.  We are forcing the schools to stay open.  What happened to the teacher in Claremorris is nothing short of intimidation.  What happened to the police in Cavan was nothing short of intimidation.  The Garda&iacute; have to do their job, yes, but there are ways and means of doing it.  Honey is better than vinegar.  They need to talk to people - n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile - and bring them with them.  That is why the Government has failed spectacularly.  That is why we are calling for the things in this motion.  Money is being thrown at problems but is not reaching the right people.</p> <p> My figures on mental health were questioned.  I thank Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill who did the research.  The Department of Health allocation for mental health in recent years ranged from 5.7% to 6.3% while in 2019 it was 6.3%.  It will fall dramatically to 5.2% in 2021.  Those are the Department's figures, if Deputy Duncan Smith wants to know or if anyone else questions it.  The Minister of State has responsibility for mental health.  We know the crisis that already exists there.  To go back to Tipperary, St. Michael's need beds.  On three fronts, the Department is attacking us in Tipperary.  Tipperary people  are a proud people, as I have said before.  They will rise up in the spirit of Kickham, Dan Breen, Sean Treacy and, indeed, our footballer that died in Croke Park on Bloody Sunday, Michael Hogan.  We will do that.  We will not take this kicking around from the HSE and unelected, unaccountable mandarins.</p> <p> I have long said there is evidence that the PCR tests are not accurate.  Why has the Government such spite against the antigen tests?  A publican who is doing his best to keep his pub going and keeping it Covid free with antigen tests had to be arrested.  I do not know what is going on.  We are creating a climate of fear.  It is back to the days of Russia and Communist countries: do not talk to people, do not engage and do not crowd.  I do not want anyone to crowd.  I want people to respect hygiene and for people to be careful and mind their elderly, but people with Covid were put into the nursing homes and caused its spread.  There is still a problem with nursing homes.  I salute every nursing home and the gallant efforts they made to keep it out, but the HSE and Department of Health put Covid into the homes.  It is The Hague the Government should be brought to for crimes against humanity.  That is what should be done with the former Minister, Deputy Harris, and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and their officials.  They put people with Covid in the homes and abandoned them.  There are many cases of it.</p> <p> I have raised many issues here.  Thankfully we have worked through some of them, including dancing.  T&aacute; na daoine ag rince ar&iacute;s i Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  We can dance again and we will soon be able to do a reel for the Ceann Comhairle.  We have not lost all the talents.  The musicians have been vilified and petrified and the funding has not got down to them.  The is lots of funding for some who are suave at grant application forms, but the money has not gone down to the ordinary man in the van.  They are in Tipperary by the spadeful and I am sure they are in the Minister of State's constituency too.  There is Mad Patsy in Carrick-on-Suir - the Minister of State will know him well - Fran and Muriel, Trudy Lawlor, who entertained us on "The Late Late Show" the other night, and Paul Lafford.  These are brilliant people who have all been denied the right to work.  This motion was our attempt to have a proper debate.  We have had no debate on the vaccines.  There will be a small bit of a debate this evening.  We looked for extra time.  Our group will have six minutes.</p> <p> Our group gave our two hours today to this serious motion on something that has had such a wide impact across a wide range in society.  We are looking for a multidisciplinary strategy for an exit.  We must keep the businesses going.  The publicans have been vilified and destroyed.  Small pubs were given the horrible name of wet pubs.  I asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland about it at the arts committee but it said it did not give them the name.  I asked it who came up with the &euro;9 meal and it said it did not.  Who is codding who?  It is a case of round the kitchen and mind the dresser but we do not get the truth.  We have to get the truth.</p> <p> None of our people in the Rural Independent Group are anti-vaccine.  We have huge concerns about the lack of debate and transparency, as we saw yesterday.  There is no sign of a scheme to support people who experience side-effects and get ill, as happens with all vaccines.  That has not been discussed.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said it had been discussed at Cabinet and there was some report.  Why is that not out?  Why is it all push, push, push, push?  How dare Deputy Kelly take it up himself and do the Ceann Comhairle's job to write to all of us, putting a letter in our pigeonholes, demanding that we sign up to his vaccine policy.  I wonder if he has a vested interest in the vaccine policies.  He must have something because he gets up here and he talks about nothing only a vaccine.  He needs some kind of injection to get off that topic and look after the people of Tipperary.  That is what he needs.  How dare he?  The cheek of him; the arrogance of him.  I did not reply to him.  I will not be intimidated or bullied by any other Member in the House.  It is a democratic country that we live in and we will make up our minds with the advice of our doctors, consultants and specialists.  I have underlying issues myself.</p> <p> We must bring the people with us and we have not done so.  We have left them behind.  I mentioned the publicans.  There are also the people who were denied going to mass and the people denied their rights.  I mentioned the schoolchildren who are blown out the window while the Department bullied a teacher to open up again.  That teacher and the board of management did a service to the people and decided to close the school because of fear.  I am telling the Minister of State that the marches will continue in Carrick-on-Suir, and she should meet the group of Councillors Dunne and Bourke, their teams, the staff, including Dr. John Flanagan, and the people there.  She should meet Councillor Michael Smith and the team from the wonderful Dean Maxwell in Tipperary town.</p> <p> The Government needs to stop this bullying and intimidation through the wiping away of our services by the HSE.  It has been caught napping here, being unable to deliver and respond to this pandemic.  It cannot respond to the winter flu.  The HSE and the Department have lost 500,000 flu vaccines and now they want to administer 8.5 million vaccines.  I have no faith in them whatsoever.  We have a lot to sort out.  We have a lot to get fixed up.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well in her stint in the Department but, by God, this will take movement.  They need to listen to the people, and the fact that they are unelected and unaccountable is shocking.  We are elected by the people for the time being and I value that and respect the mandate, but these people can come in, and we had to sit and listen to them yesterday evening.  Eight senior officials came into that Zoom meeting - I struggled to get on with technology - to tell us it is over and we are not having any more long-stay beds in the Dean Maxwell nursing unit.  The Minister of State told us this last week and then went on the radio, to add insult to injury, to say that it is closed, gone, finito, forget it, they are going putting diabetic services into it.  There is a monstrosity of a primary health centre in front of it, half-empty, but-----</p></speech>

We have a generation whose lives have been defined by this housing crisis.  When the Taoiseach came to power six months ago, he said that his Government would be the Government to sort out housing, but that promise has fallen flat.  Rents remain sky-high, houses remain unaffordable and the council waiting lists still heave with applicants waiting for years on end.  At the sharpest end of this crisis, the number of people using homeless services has increased.  We know that the true level of those experiencing homelessness is at least 20% greater than official Government figures would show.</p>  <p>  We are facing into 2021 and people are asking where the ambition is.  Where is the sense of purpose from the Government to fix housing?  Where is its sense of urgency to change the direction and to turn the tide of this crisis?  People do not see it because it is not there.  Ordinary people are paying the price.  They pay it by forking out obscene rents to landlords, by living in the box room of their parents' house, and by still not being able to afford a deposit despite saving every single available euro.  Far from fixing housing, the Government is making the same mistakes that got us into this mess in the first place and it is doing it with its eyes wide open.  It is making mistakes that will ensure more children call a bed and breakfast home, more families face the prospect of homelessness and more young people will give up on ever owning their own home.  The Government's lack of ambition was seen again on Monday when the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, re-announced his cost rental plan.  A total of 350 units was the best he could do, 50 fewer than promised in the budget.  Meanwhile, the Government persists with its belief that &euro;380,000 is affordable for a three-bedroom house.</p>  <p>  It is not enough just to build houses; we have to build houses that people can really afford.  The Taoiseach seems to have serious trouble understanding what actually is affordable for ordinary workers.  That is because his idea of affordability is linked not to public need for decent housing but to the need for profit.  I think he is afraid to do the right thing because he does not want to upset developers and landlords.  We only have to look at the fact that the direct spend on affordable housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies in 2021 will be a miserable &euro;35 million.  Meanwhile, the Government puts &euro;1 billion into the pockets of landlords by subsidising social housing tenants in the rental market.  The Taoiseach is truly in an ideological cul-de-sac.  At the centre of the Government's housing failure is the absence of its long-promised affordable housing plan.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, first promised that the plan would be published in September.  Then it was promised for after the budget.  Then it was promised for some time in the autumn.  Now the Minister is saying he will bring this plan forward to the Government soon, whatever that means.</p>  <p>  That is not good enough.  People now are crying out for action.  Fianna F&aacute;il had four years to prepare for the housing Ministry.  A group of officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been working on an affordable housing policy for two years.  The Taoiseach has been in charge for six months.  My question is clear, it is simple and it is this: where is that affordable housing plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600020#S00700"><p>If I may, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to take the opportunity briefly to wish Deputy McDonald and all Deputies in the House a very happy festive season and a safe one.  This might be my last opportunity to speak.  I wish a happy Christmas to the Ceann Comhairle and his team, the superintendent, the head ushers and the entire team here who have kept our national Parliament operational during a global pandemic, a once-in-a-century event.  The voice of Parliament is central to our parliamentary democracy.  I genuinely want to thank all of the staff and all of the team here for enabling it to happen - albeit in the convention centre as well as the D&aacute;il - under really significant restrictions for them, including putting their own health at risk in terms of the cramped conditions in Leinster House, which was never built for a pandemic.  I just want to thank all and sundry for that help and assistance to enable Parliament to operate.  I wish everyone, with their families, a safe, peaceful and happy Christmas.</p>  <p>  On housing, I say to Deputy McDonald that Fianna F&aacute;il has hit the ground running and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has hit the ground running.  In the very first month, in the July stimulus, for example, funding was provided to being back 2,500 voids.  These were houses that were in disrepair within local authority ownership.  We said that we were not going to waste a moment and that we would give money and funding to local authorities.  That has worked and those 2,500 houses will be occupied by the end of this year.  There has been tremendous progress in regard to that specific initiative alone.  The Minister has exemplified this practical and get-down-to-work approach.</p>  <p>  In regard to the budget itself, the largest ever budget for housing in the history of the State has been provided.  The largest and most ambitious social housing programme in the history of the State has been provided for.  Some 12,750 social houses will be provided next year.  That is separate from the housing assistance payment, HAP, process. A total of 9,500 of the social houses will be new builds, with the remainder in terms of leasing.  That is a very significant provision.</p>  <p>  Affordable rental has been committed to and it is now going to happen.  The first will be Enniskerry, which was conceived of many years ago and is now coming on stream.  Deputy Kelly would have been piloting it at the time.  It is coming on stream now, with others.  In fairness to the Minister, he has got it going and it will happen.  Sinn F&eacute;in has voted against affordable housing in this D&aacute;il on numerous occasions.  It voted against the first-time buyer's grant, for example.  A total of 19,500 people have benefited from the help-to-buy scheme or the first-time buyer's grant.  This has enabled them to afford to buy houses.  The Deputy voted against that every time.  Her party consistently voted against it.  Under its scheme, any couple earning over &euro;75,000 would be out of the equation and would not be able to participate in the proposals it put forward.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency legislation will be brought to the Government very shortly.  The Minister has worked very hard to develop the shared equity scheme, and fair play to him.  The draft heads of the Bill for that scheme are ready as well.  The Deputy also mentioned HAP, which has been with us for nearly a decade now.  The bottom line is that this budget had to provide for additionality in terms of the HAP scheme in order to provide housing for people.  The Deputy voted against that and has consistently done so.  If her vote had succeeded, it would only have exacerbated the plight of the housing crisis for many people out there who need assistance and who need help.  The Government has provided up to &euro;3.3 billion in this budget to enable us to deal with all aspects of the housing problem.  In particular, in regard to homelessness, there has been a reduction in homelessness figures, down to 8,600 compared with more than 10,400 last year.</p> <p>That number will fall further by the end of the year.  Critically, there have been 6,000 exits from homelessness this year.  That is considerable movement out of homelessness.</p> <p> Finally, I refer to the Planning and Development Bill 2020.  Perhaps the Deputy can confirm she will vote for it this evening.  This will extend provisions to protect tenants from homelessness until next April.  That is important legislation.  The Minister has been active across the board.  He has worked with all the NGOs and approved housing bodies on the homelessness question.  I have said to the homelessness and housing sectors, particularly the approved housing bodies and local authorities, that we will deliver.  We want them to improve their capacity.  The real challenge facing our housing efforts next year will be the capacity to build houses.</p></speech>

Not only is he trying to explain away the housing crisis, he is trying to live in an extraordinary world of make-believe where there is no crisis.  However, the crisis is real.  I have rehearsed previously with the Taoiseach the fact that average rents in Dublin are now above &euro;2,000.  The average rent nationwide is now above &euro;1,400.  I have said to the Taoiseach very directly that his idea of an affordable price for a modest family home does, &euro;380,000, does not tally with reality.  I have challenged him before and I challenge him again.  We will continue to challenge the Taoiseach until we see real delivery on housing at pace.  That means building houses to scale, building affordable homes and building public housing on public land.  That is what is required.</p>  <p>  We also need a moratorium on evictions into homelessness and real and substantive rent control.  Those are the measures the Taoiseach and his friends in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will not take.  They have not come off the path of allowing housing policy to be led by developers, landlords and vested interests.  It is for the haves.  The Government is now facing into 2021 with no coherent plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600021#T00300"><p>That is just empty rhetoric and nonsense.  Housing construction is not being led by developers.  I have said repeatedly that 18,000 houses will be built this year if we can get there.  Covid-19 has had a negative impact.  More than half of those houses will be built by public initiative.  Next year, 12,750 houses will be socially delivered.  Some 9,500 of those houses will be built by local authorities or approved housing bodies.  The old political ideological mantra that housing policy is being led by developers is a complete untruth.  It is not.</p>  <p>  We need more houses built by the private sector, the public sector and approved housing bodies.  It is time for local authorities to bite the bullet where particular schemes are concerned.  They should take ideology out of the room and get some housing schemes delivered.  Perhaps Deputy McDonald could commit that her party will stop objecting, as all parties should do.</p>  <p>  I agree that this is a crisis.  It is a crisis for many young people and many homeless people.  I have always said it is a crisis.  It will take some time to get to the bottom of it.  We can only collectively deal with it if we take ideology out of the room, allow mixed-development schemes to go through and stop constantly objecting.  Sometimes particular local issues can arise, but there is a consistent thread here - if a development does not fit in Sinn F&eacute;in's particular ideological prism it will not happen.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to loosen up in terms of affordability.  That party's strictures exclude many people who desperately need help and support.  Deputy McDonald has not addressed her consistent opposition to the first-time buyers' grant, from which 19,500 people have benefitted.  I really would like her to confirm that she will vote for the legislation the Minister is bringing through the House this evening. </p></speech>

Dr. Gabriel Scally, whom we all know well, said that if Northern Ireland was a football team, it would be in the relegation zone and the directors would be bringing in a new manager and coaching team.</p>  <p>  It is deeply concerning to see ambulances parked in rows outside hospitals with the engines left running.  The National Health Service, NHS, is at breaking point.  The scale of the crisis in Northern Ireland is a situation we have never seen before.  I am deeply concerned about how the Executive there, composed of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, is dealing with this issue.  We have reached a point where instead of playing politics, trying to be on both sides of many arguments, bickering and dithering, our Government needs to state very clearly that the Executive's way of dealing with this crisis is not working and is having a huge consequence for the rest of us on this island.</p>  <p>  The infection rate in Northern Ireland is now four times the rate in the South.  The difference in infection rates is alarming.  Cork and Kerry have 14-day incidence rates of 25 per 100,000 and 30 per 100,000, respectively.  In Northern Ireland, the local government districts of Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Causeway Coast and Glens and Mid Ulster have all had 14-day incidence rates of 300 per 100,000 in recent days.  In Mid and East Antrim the figure is more than 500 per 100,000.  The people of the North have been let down.  There has been a knock-on effect on our Border areas and further afield.  The 14-day incidence rate in Donegal is the highest in the State at 225 per 100,000.  My colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, has made serious representations on the situation in County Louth, where the rate is at 175 per 100,000.  Cavan and Monaghan both have rates above 100 per 100,000.  </p>  <p>  We need action.  The Taoiseach and the Government must make it very clear to the Executive, which does not have experience in making hard decisions, that it is going to have to change tack and quickly.  I ask the Taoiseach to express his solidarity and that of all of the people of this jurisdiction with the workers and people of Northern Ireland, who are trying to deal with this issue.  He should also express his deep unease with the strategy imposed by the Sinn F&eacute;in-DUP Executive in Northern Ireland.  From our jurisdiction's point of view, this will have very negative consequences.  He should offer whatever help is possible from our jurisdiction.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Netherlands closed down before Christmas.  Germany has done the same.  The positivity rate in Northern Ireland is about 9%.  It is not clear that testing there is at the same level as here.  The numbers have been worrying for quite some time.  There are now significant issues in emergency departments.  In a week or ten days this may manifest itself in a shortage of beds.  It is important to say that we are in solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland, who are going through a very difficult time right now.  There will a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on Friday, which will be held virtually because of the Covid-19 situation.  We will work with our colleagues on the Northern Ireland Executive.  Any assistance we can offer will always be available.</p> <p>There has been ongoing contact between clinicians in the two health systems either side of the Border, and my understanding is that the Minister of Health, Robin Swann, will bring proposals to the Executive.  I think he has led well throughout this crisis.  He has had to deal with a challenging situation.  The Northern Ireland Executive is a multi-party Executive like our three-party Government here, and that creates its own challenges.</p> <p> This also illustrates the exponential growth of this virus once it gets to a certain critical level.  We in the Republic need to take note of what is happening in the North in how we behave as individuals and collectively.  We should wear masks indoors and in crowded outdoor situations.  Social distancing, washing our hands and proper etiquette are still as important as ever.  From next Friday people will be allowed to go home.  People will want to meet their grandparents and parents.  To enable people to do so safely, all our behaviour from now on matters.  Every contact matters.  Once the virus gets to a certain level, it transmits very quickly thereafter and grows exponentially.  We have a strong testing capacity; nonetheless we must be very vigilant now because what we are witnessing in Northern Ireland could happen here if we allow things to get out of control, which we will not do.  We have had a period of severe restrictions for six weeks.  At the Council of the European Union meeting last week I met prime minister after prime minister who told me his or her country was shutting down and bringing in more restrictions, while I was saying we had partially reopened because of that six-week restriction.</p> <p> I take on board very seriously what Deputy Kelly has said.  It is a matter of grave concern.  The Border counties in particular are a worry for us.  The numbers are higher in our Border counties than in the rest of the country.  We are considering how we can provide greater supports and protection and whatever measures we have to take in the Border counties.</p></speech>

I am also aware that there is a North-South Ministerial Council meeting coming up.  I raised this matter for that reason.  I think the whole of Ireland was shocked by the pictures they saw last night.  They reminded us of various times in our past when we had to send up our fire service to help out.  We need a number of things.  The Taoiseach needs to make it very clear to the Northern Ireland Executive that, from the point of view of performance, it needs to do much more.  It needs to make hard decisions in the next 24 to 48 hours because the impact of this is not limited to Northern Ireland but will be here, across all the Border counties and further afield.  I ask the Taoiseach to make that very clear.  He might share with us the form of assistance he is thinking of when it comes to helping the people of Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, what additional measures or help can we give to our Border areas to help them?  Finally, do we have a plan - one is referred to in the roll-out that was announced yesterday - to ensure that once vaccinations start, and it is hoped they will start in this jurisdiction before the new year, we will have a co-ordinated approach across both jurisdictions as to how we will ensure consistency in the roll-out in order to help those Border areas in particular?</p></speech>

There are political sensitivities here, and one must always be mindful that whatever initiatives the Northern Ireland Executive takes, they are the Executive's initiatives.  It has to own them and be comfortable in bringing them forward, even if that means further restrictions.  It is to be regretted that we have not had complete alignment in respect of restrictions over recent months, but that is as it is.  I am very mindful of the fact that the Northern Ireland Executive is responsible.  It will have to deal with the situation as it presents itself and the advice it gets from Northern Ireland's chief medical officer and Minister of Health.  The Government will meet weekly to keep an eye on the situation.  NPHET and our officials will meet weekly to keep a constant monitoring and evaluation of our situation in tandem with what is happening in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Kelly's point about alignment, particularly in the counties either side of the Border, is well made.  Clearly, the evidence shows there are particular pressures because of the high incidence rate in the North, but we want to work in solidarity.  Very often if one comes at such things externally and tries to tell people how they should do things, one gets a very quick response, so I do not advise that.  We will work in solidarity, and any help we can give we will give.</p></speech>

When this scheme was introduced, it was a very good scheme and helped a lot of businesses to stay afloat.  However, I now have some cases coming to me in which, when Revenue did some checks, it found that some businesses did not fully meet the criteria in the sense that their turnover is supposed to be down by 25%.  In a number of these cases, when the businesses did their projections they had no business in March.  They looked at all the options and looked at the scheme that was in place.  They decided that in order to keep the loyalty of the employer and the employee intact, they would go with the TWSS.  In one case, the owners of a company took out an overdraft to look at other options to try to create business, which they did.  Their online business grew substantially in the meantime, leaving them in a position whereby their company was down 17% or 18%, rather than 25%, on turnover.  As a result of all of this, when Revenue checked up on the company in recent weeks, it asked it to repay all the TWSS it got.  If this is the way we are doing business, we will drive these small businesses out of business in a very short time.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at this with the Minister for Finance and consider how Revenue is looking to recover this money.  These businesses have never defaulted.  The sole purpose of what they did was to keep their business going and to keep their employees employed, but they are now being penalised harshly for that.  They are not looking for anything for nothing; they are just looking for perhaps a graduated refund of some nature because they still have a loss in their business.  There now seems to be a tactic of trying to get this money back before the end of this year.  I think this will put a shiver down the spine of every small business if it is trying to remain in operation through next year.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at this and give me his comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600022#U00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I reassure him that there is no tactic or strategy here to try to claw back revenue or anything like that.  That is not motivating any actions on the part of the Revenue Commissioners at all.  As the Deputy will be aware, between March and August 66,500 firms received payments under the TWSS.  This amounts to approximately one third of all employers from 2019.  Over 664,000 jobs have been directly supported over the period, and many more indirectly.  The whole objective was to protect the viability of businesses and the jobs within those businesses and to enable them to come through this Covid period intact.  That remains the objective of the scheme.  It was originally meant to be in place for 12 weeks but was then extended until the end of the summer.</p> <p>Then we moved into the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, phase.  As a result of the novel situation around the reopening of the economy in the summer, we had to close down again.  Changes were also made to the scheme to allow additional flexibility for employers.</p> <p> In terms of the issues the Deputy has raised, he is correct that the subsidy was targeted at otherwise viable employers.  As he stated, they are people who have never defaulted before.  They had to demonstrate a 25% reduction in turnover during the second period of 2020.  It was administered on a self-assessment basis whereby employers make a declaration to Revenue as to their eligibility for the scheme.  Such declarations are subject to compliance checks by Revenue to ensure that the considerable sums given to employers under the scheme were in accordance with the provisions set down in legislation.  Employers had to be able to show to the satisfaction of Revenue that the negative disruption led to a minimum of 25% of a decline in actual or predicted turnover.  Considerable guidance was issued on the scheme, including Revenue's expectation that any employer availing of the scheme should be able to produce supporting documentation in respect of certain criteria if and when requested to do so, the overall principle being, of course, that Exchequer funds are targeted at genuine cases that meet the criteria.  As with any area of tax compliance, it is very much in the interests of businesses to review their own behaviour and approach Revenue to resolve matters voluntarily before compliance action is taken.</p> <p> The temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, is under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners, who are independent of Government in the administration of the scheme.  Revenue has continued to work with employers and to take a practical and pragmatic approach to the administration of the scheme while also ensuring that it is fairly and consistently administered across all employers and in line with legislation.  That said, the example and illustration raised by the Deputy is an interesting one in terms of an initiative taken by the employer who probably was not in a position to predict how well the online part of the business would go and is now in difficulty.  I will raise the issues with the Minister for Finance who may, in turn, present them to Revenue just to evaluate the scheme, ascertain how frequent these issues are and what is the rate of such cases.</p></speech>

The important thing is that when these businesses were availing of the scheme, Revenue stated that it did not consider that any business needed to take professional advice or assistance in proving to the satisfaction of Revenue that the criteria were met.  It was stated that Revenue would validate some employer eligibility for the scheme but, in so doing, it would adopt a reasonable, fair and pragmatic approach in considering whether the criteria had been met.  That is the underlying issue here.  These small businesses did everything in good faith.  They exceeded the projections they made because the owners of the business rolled up their sleeves and looked around to see where they could get business.  They found the business online and took out an overdraft to finance what they were doing.  Now they find they are being penalised horrifically.  It is something that needs to be addressed rapidly.</p></speech>

There needs to be an evaluation of the scheme, how it worked and its effectiveness.  I have no doubt that it has been very effective in terms of supporting many businesses.  As I stated, more than 66,500 firms received a payment under the TWSS, supporting more than 664,000 jobs.  If the Deputy can submit the details of the cases to me and the Minister for Finance, that would assist in any evaluation,  There genuinely is no motivation here to target or undermine people who applied in good faith under the scheme, given the situation in which they found themselves at the start of what has been an unpredictable global pandemic that no one could have anticipated.  I do take the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that Brexit will impact on many businesses.  While much preparation has been made for that impact, not knowing is the hardest pill to swallow right now.  Agriculture will be hard hit.  A recent Central Bank report stated that beef and sheep farmers will be the most economically vulnerable.  It states that up to one third of farms could be forced out of business because of Brexit.  The fishing industry will be most affected.  The biggest shock of all is to see Michel Barnier negotiating with senior British officials and offering 18% of fish or more in a Brexit deal with the UK.  I have asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in the past two weeks whose fish Michel Barnier is offering but I have not received an answer.  We all know it is Irish fish that are on offer, but there is no Irish Minister negotiating on our behalf in these talks with Michel Barnier as more and more rights in terms of Irish fish and waters are being thrown away, like successive governments have done for decades.</p><p>My question relates to Brexit and all those in this country who are suffering from pain or the nightmare of going blind.  In October, I asked the Taoiseach about the cross-border directive.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, about it in the past two weeks.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about it last Thursday.  All of them stated that an agreement is in place for taking cancer patients from Donegal to Derry and an agreement for taking cardiology procedures from the North to the South will be in place, which is great news.  In reply to me last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste and leader of Fine Gael stated, &quot;I cannot give as clear a reply as I would like [to the question on the continuation of the cross-border scheme] because some of these issues are still being worked out.&quot;  He continued, &quot;we are trying to put alternative arrangements in place to maintain the <i>status quo</i>when it comes to cross-border healthcare&quot;, but this has not been worked out yet.</p><p>More than 5,000 people availed of the cross-border directive last year for cataract, hip and knee procedures among others.  I or any other politician would totally agree with the statement of the Taoiseach that these procedures should be carried out here in the Republic, but that is not happening.  Belfast or Blind bus No. 64, organised by me, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, Councillor Ben Dalton O'Sullivan and Councillor Danny Collins, will leave Cork on Sunday.  It will be full of people desperately trying to get to the North before 31 December because no one knows whether any type of cross-border scheme will be in place by 1 January.</p><p>Will people in this country, be they from west Cork or Donegal, who are in dreadful pain because they are in need of a hip or knee operation or who are going blind and in need of a cataract operation and cannot wait for three to five years for surgery, be able to contact a private hospital in Belfast from 1 January to have their procedure carried out and then be reimbursed by the HSE?  In other words, are all the necessary arrangements in place or is the Government still negotiating a new cross-border deal?</p></speech>

He is aware these questions are supposed to be about just one topic but he managed to get fish and the cross-border directive into the question.  I do not know whether it is blind fish that are being caught off the coast.  Can the Taoiseach deal with this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600023#V00600"><p>First, on Brexit, we have been working very hard to avoid a no-deal Brexit.  The Deputy is correct in stating that the western regions and the Border counties in particular would suffer very severely from a no-deal Brexit, and farming would be very negatively impacted in terms of dairy, beef, sheep and all agricultural products.  The impact would be very severe.  As for fish, it would potentially be disastrous if there was a no-deal Brexit, because it would mean an immediate hit.  Therefore, Michel Barnier is negotiating on behalf of 27 member states.  I am sure the Deputy knows that.  There are not 27 member state ministers on the negotiating team.  He knows that.  I do not know why he says what he says in the way he says it in terms of ministers.  We have all fed into that process, of course, and the negotiating team know the Irish bottom line in relation to fisheries and what we are trying to achieve here.  We are endeavouring to avoid a no-deal Brexit.  Doing so is in the best interests of Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the other member states of the European Union.  It is the common-sense and logical thing to do to avoid a no-deal Brexit.  I would appreciate if the Deputy would confirm that it is his view also that we should avoid a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the cross-border directive, it was a European Union directive.  I would like the Deputy to acknowledge that the reason it is coming to an end as a cross-border directive under EU legislation is because the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union.</p> <p>There is no appetite in the Northern Ireland public health system to continue the scheme.  We have to develop a scheme unilaterally.  Essentially, two private hospitals in Northern Ireland provide these services.  Last year, there were 7,800 applicants.  More than 7,300 accessed care there with almost 98% of these patients accessing care in Northern Ireland.  The remainder accessed it in the UK.  That is the overall position.  Irish patients predominantly travel to Northern Ireland to access healthcare under that directive.</p> <p> The total value of the reimbursement was &euro;16.6 million.  That was the taxpayers' outlay in this regard, which is why I and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, have approved funding for developing our capacity in the Republic to deliver more orthopaedic and cataract operations, in particular.  We are protecting a range of cross-border healthcare measures even as the UK leaves the European Union, such as the treatment abroad scheme and the European health insurance card, for example, where there will be equivalence for Northern Ireland resident citizens.  The cross-border treatment directive is different from those schemes.  We are working on the issue and it will be continued administratively in the early months of next year.</p></speech>

However, people are suffering from the worry of losing their eyesight.  They are contacting me and other politicians to find out if they can access cross-border care of a different type from 1 January next.  There is no point saying they may for a month or two or that it might or might not be in place.  It is quite simple.  The Taoiseach says there will be extra resources to have these procedures carried out in the South, which is 100% commendable, but it might not happen in places such as Cork.  It might be a year or two before these surgical areas are resolved.</p><p>In the past week a Fine Gael Senator in south-west Cork said that this is resolved and that people can go to the North.  How is it that he has information?  He told the <i>Southern Star</i>newspaper I was scaremongering, that this is resolved and he asked what was wrong with me now.  His leader has not said it is resolved.  The Taoiseach has not said it is resolved, but that the Government and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, are working on it.  Will there be a cross-border scheme next year?  A seamless transition is what we are seeking.  I am not suffering from any of these illnesses, but I am asking for the people who are in need of these surgeries.  Will there be a seamless transition from the current scheme?  I acknowledge the UK is leaving the EU, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that an agreement can be achieved, but this is the concern we have this year.  I would appreciate if this could be resolved in the coming days for the 7,000 people who will require surgeries next year, or is it resolved?</p></speech>

Essentially, officials in the Department of Health are giving detailed consideration to the implementation of a unilateral cross-border directive type of arrangement.  It cannot be the same because the UK is no longer in the European Union and it does not have to reciprocate.  The cross-border directive gave entitlements to citizens to go into other European countries, get treatments and for those to be reimbursed afterwards, if the public health system here could not provide them.  That falls when the UK leaves.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that approximately 7,700 have availed of the scheme.  We do not want people shut off, particularly those in the Border counties where it is used to a greater degree.  There will be a unilateral type of scheme or arrangement which will provide that Irish residents can continue to access services provided by private health service providers in the UK post the end of the transition period.  We will continue on an administrative basis and then underpin it with legislation.</p></speech>

Last night, they received proposals from the chairman of the Labour Court.  Those proposals are massively disappointing for the workers and will be very little comfort to them.  Many of the workers spent years working for Debenhams and they have protested for 251 days to get a fair and reasonable redundancy settlement.  They are worn out, exhausted and heartbroken.  The manner in which this dispute has been handled by Debenhams and also by KPMG and the Government does none of them any credit.

There was a meeting yesterday between a number of Deputies, the HSE, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  This is a very passionate issue.  There is a state-of-the-art public nursing home in Thurles and a new one is being tendered in Nenagh, but we must also provide one in Roscrea.  This is the most important issue for the people of Roscrea at present because many of their loved ones have been in that nursing home.  It is due to lose its long-stay beds because of a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report which will deal with a number of nursing homes in the forthcoming year and a half.  If a proposal is put forward in the national development plan, which is being reviewed, to fund a new public nursing home either on the current site or on another site, will the Taoiseach consider it?</p></speech>

When will the Taoiseach change the law so the Debenhams workers and other workers in such situations are properly protected?</p></speech>

It is hoped that the review will be completed before the end of the year.  I would caution though, that the review in itself may not be a panacea for what happened in the Debenhams case.  Clearly, it is not directly applicable to Debenhams.  The area I am most interested in is to see what prioritisation can be given in a liquidation scenario where there are sustainable and clear collective bargaining agreements?</p></speech>

The failure by the Government to ensure justice for these workers is appalling.  I remind the Taoiseach that he said he could not put money on the table because it would set a precedent.  A sum of &euro;18 million is owed to the State by Debenhams.  The Taoiseach did not mind setting a precedent when it came to bailing out banks to the tune of &euro;64 billion.  There was no moral hazard there, and no worry about the implications, but when it comes to workers who have worked for decades, who have done nothing wrong, and who are entitled to the two plus two agreed with Debenhams, we cannot underwrite them.  We cannot guarantee to give them what they deserve, which is what even now the Government should do, and then it should pursue Debenhams.  The Government is just standing idly by while saying there is nothing it can do for these workers, who are the most decent people one could imagine, and who have worked for this company, which has betrayed them cruelly.</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na currently has stocks of milled peat and a proportion of it was earmarked for the horticultural sector.  Recently, it has become apparent that Bord na M&oacute;na has diverted a lot of peat to export markets.  As a result of the curtailment in supplies, the horticultural industry is losing its crucial raw material of milled peat.  This is endangering their business and has serious implications for sustaining jobs in the sector.  In Tipperary alone, this current policy will damage and adversely affect 19 horticultural outlets, six major growers and put at risk 480 jobs.  I ask the Taoiseach to review the use of peat in the horticultural sector.  Its use in this sector does not involve pollution and can in fact go beyond the status of carbon-neutral and become carbon-friendly.</p></speech>

As he is aware, there was a High Court judgment in 2019, which reaffirmed that commercial peat extraction, absent planning permission, constitutes unauthorised development and the onus is on operators to first regularise their past activity via the planning system.  I do not say that necessarily applies here.  Planning permission can then be secured before any recommencement of harvesting can take place.  There are issues in terms of continuing to extract peat.  In late November, the Government approved &euro;108 million for Bord na M&oacute;na's large-scale peatlands restoration project, which will create and support 350 jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na and contribute to Ireland's target of being carbon-neutral by 2050.  Commercial peat extraction is subject to a dual-consent process requiring planning permission.  Sites of more than 50 ha require an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></speech>

Could he organise a Zoom meeting to deal with the issue of a ring road for Tipperary town?  The motorway is coming at some stage but there are road works in the town which will cause bedlam for two more years.  I urge the Taoiseach to meet this group.  They are enablers.  They want to be positive.  They are working with Alison Harvey's task force, but we need joined-up thinking here.  We badly need a ring road.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has committed to meeting the group as well, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  They need the Taoiseach to engage.

Since then, we found out that the entire western seaboard was disproportionately affected by the State's response to Covid-19.  What is the plan to support aviation and tourism across the mid-west and the entire west next year?  What is the plan for Shannon Heritage?  The two sites that have opened are closing on 3 January.  It is planned to open the sites again in April, but Shannon Heritage remains in the Shannon Group with a commercial mandate and the sites ill fit a commercial mandate because while they generate money, they generate money more broadly in the economy than they do within the group itself.</p></speech>

They tell us that we have to do it.  I know of one girl in Killarney, among several others, who bought an electric car.  She lives in a housing estate.  She has asked for a kerbside charging point because she has a lead coming out of her letter box which crosses the public footpath.  She is afraid that she will be liable if someone trips or something happens with the lead on the public footpath.  The council indicated it would provide a grant of &euro;10,000 for the kerbside charging point, but the overall cost would be &euro;26,000.</p> <p>The council could not make up the other &euro;16,000.  The killer point for this customer is that she would have to pay &euro;5,000 every year, &euro;2,500 of which is a standing charge and &euro;2,500 for a service contract.  On top of that she must pay the provider for whatever electricity she uses.</p></speech>

On Monday, out of 85 pupils due in, only seven turned up.  The Department and the Minister's handling of the challenges presented by Covid-19 in that school is wholly unacceptable.  I commend the huge collective effort by the board of management, the principal and teachers, the parents' association and the parents in ensuring the health and well-being of the children in the Claremorris area.</p>  <p>  Nobody disputes the public health advice but removing the collective autonomy of all the local decision-makers without proper consultation is not acceptable.  The heavy-handed approach by the Department must be replaced with local and effective engagement.  There is no other way to deal with this matter in a meaningful way.  The people of Claremorris deserve better.</p>  <p>  The effectiveness of the interface between the HSE and the Department must be examined.  The anxiety levels of the children in Claremorris is having an impact on their health and well-being.  Is there a better way to do this?</p></speech>

There must be a system.  We have all deferred to public health advice.  There is and should be local engagement between principals and public health personnel, and that improved in particular after the Hallowe'en break when the Minister with the HSE implemented a new system to bring about closer collaboration between principals and public health teams.</p>  <p> We must ultimately defer to public health guidelines.  We will continue to engage as cases like this emerge and re-evaluate how advice is given.  We cannot have a position where every school will make its own decision.  Nationally, and from a societal perspective, we want our schools open and children back in school safely.  We will evaluate what has happened here and if protocols must be amended or refined, that is fine.  The public health personnel had not recommended that the school should close.</p></speech>

This week, Sinn F&eacute;in councillors on South Dublin County Council delayed construction of 19 new build social homes in Clondalkin.  The site is 100% public and the proposal is for 100% social homes.</p>  <p>  At first glance it appears Sinn F&eacute;in was delaying these homes unnecessarily after extensive public consultation by one month to allow for further informal consultation.  However, tweets yesterday indicate it is Sinn F&eacute;in's intention to delay these units not for a month but for months on end by linking this practically shovel-ready site to a whole other site with no drawings, design, permission or public consultation done.</p>  <p>  This is a prime example of Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to housing; it is delaying the building of homes to keep the housing crisis on the agenda.  Will the Taoiseach work with his Fianna F&aacute;il mayor in South Dublin County Council to ensure he does not pander again to Sinn F&eacute;in next month and in order that we can deliver these much-needed homes?</p></speech>

I am not aware of the local position and I do not know why Sinn F&eacute;in is opposing this plan or the rationale behind it.  I am not <i>au fait</i>with the specific details of every scheme and this particular one.  We are in a position where we need houses built.  The biggest challenge facing us over the next 12 months is not funding, resources or ideology as we are committed to both public and affordable housing, cost-rental and many other forms of housing.  The issue will be the capacity to get supply up, schemes built and homes delivered to people who need them.</p></speech>

There were 160,000 people who needed support from St. Vincent de Paul last year and 50,000 of those people were in food poverty.  Food poverty means the most basic need is not met in this rich country, where politicians, judges and former taoisigh get regular pay rises.  There is no doubt the figures will be worse this year.</p>  <p>  This is just one charity and there are countless charities, with every one representing a failure of the Government to provide the basic needs of our people.  Poverty costs us &euro;4.5 billion per year.  The Government argues its hands are tied on gold-plated pensions and top-tier pay rises but are its hands tied when it comes to poverty or children having to go to bed hungry or living on handouts on paper plates on cold streets?  Are the Government's hands tied or is its heart closed to this suffering?  What is the Government going to do about poverty in this country because charities cannot pick up the pieces forever?  I would like a straight answer.  Poverty is real and it is pushing hundreds of thousands-----</p></speech>

The social protection budget is unprecedented in its scale.  It is an enormous provision that is necessary to help people in very difficult financial positions right across the board.  The budget was particularly strong in measures targeted at those most vulnerable to falling into poverty.  The expansion of the schools meals programme is an example, along with increasing child dependant allowances.  To be fair to the Ministers for Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Humphreys and Michael McGrath, they worked to ensure funding was targeted to prevent those groups most likely to fall into poverty from falling into poverty.  That will continue to be our focus.</p></speech>

We currently have no gas storage in Ireland and we are 100% dependent on Britain for gas imports.  Kinsale gas field is finished and there is a major decline in production at Corrib.  There are now reports that EirGrid is experiencing difficulties dealing with peak electricity demand because of a lack of capacity.  With an increase in renewable energy and the phasing out of peat and coal, what is our plan to back up the resilience of renewable power production?</p>  <p>  I understand there is a tender to spend up to &euro;250,000 on yet another security of supply report but there are already many recent reports, including from Government agencies and State-owned companies such as Gas Networks Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, etc.  These reports point to the need to have another source of gas supply and storage.  A floating liquefied natural gas terminal has been recommended as a cost-efficient and clean solution.  Will the Taoiseach explore with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the setting up of a floating LNG terminal in Cork?</p></speech>

People with disabilities were and still are more negatively impacted by the pandemic than those without disabilities.  Many were forced to isolate or cocoon at home which has had a very serious emotional, physical and financial impact on them and their families.  Many are not in a position to participate in the so-called new normal involving social distancing, the wearing of masks and regular hand sanitising.  This negative impact has lasted for ten months now and it is critical that it is not allowed to last one moment longer than absolutely necessary.</p>  <p>  In England the registered Covid-19 death rate for people with disabilities is four times higher than the general population and people with a learning disability are dying from Covid at a much younger age than the general population.  I do not think we have the equivalent figures for Ireland but I ask that people with disabilities be considered in the context of the vaccine plan.</p></speech>

I accept that people will engage in politics from time to time but it is not a very nice form of politics to play that sort of line.  The national immunisation advisory committee recommended to NPHET a particular sequencing for who should get the vaccine first.  It recommended that older people in residential settings should receive it first.  People with underlying conditions are high up on the priority list and that includes people with disabilities.  Clinical decisions will be made, with the input of GPs, to determine the type of vaccine to be administered to people and when they should get it.  This is not about politics or about the Government wanting to discriminate against one group or another.  The national immunisation advisory committee has advised on the sequencing and the document is live.  Hopefully the vaccines will come quickly and we will see a ramping up of vaccinations in the country.  I want to assure people in the disability sector that there has been no singling out or premeditated decision to leave out one group and include another.  That is not the way this works.</p></speech>

The HSE warned that it did not accept the closure of this facility because it increased the risk of unnecessary presentations being made to acute hospitals.  If the facility at Blackpool is not reopened by 31 December, SouthDoc will be in breach of its service level agreement.  SouthDoc receives more than &euro;7 million from the HSE under that agreement.  I have asked about this for the last three weeks on the trot and have been raising the issue since March.

The committee operates in accordance with established guidelines for Cabinet committees and substantive issues are referred to the Government for discussion and approval.  The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of the programme for Government commitments on housing and related matters.  Significant work is under way on the implementation of these commitments across Government Departments and agencies, including through regular discussion of these matters at meetings of the Government.  </p>  <p>  In addition to meetings of the Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I regularly meet Ministers, including the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to discuss particular issues.  Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Government has introduced a range of measures to address housing issues.  Budget 2021 provides over &euro;3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes next year, including funding for 9,500 social homes to be built as part of the overall delivery of 12,750 social homes next year.  A total of &euro;40 million was allocated through the July stimulus package to support local authorities to bring voids back into productive use and over 2,000 households will be accommodated this year as a direct result of this initiative.  The budgetary provision will also fund other important housing supports and services relating to homelessness, Traveller accommodation, regeneration and programmes to upgrade existing housing.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has introduced a number of legislative measures to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants.  Over the coming months, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will introduce legislation to put the Land Development Agency and the new affordable housing measures announced in the budget on a legislative footing.</p></reply>

I reciprocate the Taoiseach's good wishes and wish him, his family and all his colleagues the best.  The winter weather is very much with us, as we have seen and felt over recent weeks.  In recent months, there has been, unfortunately, a sharp rise in the number of homeless people on our streets passing away.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage does not seem to compile figures on the number of such deaths nationally but we know that the number of deaths in Dublin this year is more than 50, in comparison to 34 in 2019 and 35 in 2018.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House why we do not have national figures?  As the Taoiseach will now, concerns have been expressed in his own city of Cork and in other areas.  Why do we not have national figures?</p>  <p>  Any death is obviously a tragedy, no matter where it happens, but this sudden and sharp rise is really worrying.  Some people believe it is in some way related to Covid-19 and people avoiding hostels and support services because they are afraid of getting sick while others believe it is down to a rise in addiction and overdoses.  To be fair, it is probably a lot more complex than that.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm that we will get national figures and that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will investigate this rise and why it is happening now?  What actions are being taken, outside of those we already know of?  Has this issue been discussed at the relevant Cabinet committee?  Will the Taoiseach confirm what sort of new supports are being put in place?</p></speech>

They have faced four attempts by two different vulture funds that bought the complex to evict them using loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Acts.  They tried to increase the rent by 60% at one point, they then used substantial refurbishments as grounds for eviction and are now using sale of the property for that purpose.  They failed to evict ten tenants and are now trying to evict eight instead to circumvent the Tyrrelstown amendment.  This is the shocking, cold and ruthless logic of a profit-seeking vulture fund.  I was in the offices of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with the tenants on Monday.  Some of them are in there today.  There is a similar case in Rathmines, an area with three Government Deputies, in which a number of tenants were successfully evicted by vulture funds after fighting this eviction for a year.</p>  <p>  Why does the Government not close these loopholes and legislate to prevent this kind of vicious and ruthless profit-seeking logic at the expense of tenants, all of whom pay their rent?  These are working people who will now face eviction in the teeth of Christmas and in the middle of a pandemic.  Does the Taoiseach not think that is obscene behaviour which the Government has a responsibility to prevent to ensure that decent ordinary people who pay their rent are not dumped out on the street by vulture funds?</p></speech>

The question is whether they will be genuinely affordable.  Will young people and people on low and even average incomes be locked out of the market?  I saw an interesting snippet on the RT&Eacute; news recently.  A company in Castleisland, County Kerry, built 70 houses.  As the company had difficulty retaining a workforce in the area, it sold 20 of these houses to its workers at cost price.  This cost of &euro;150,000 was reckoned to be more than &euro;30,000 below the market valuation for such a house.  That is a little indication of what can be done when the profiteering is cut out of the situation.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of public land down in the docklands, including lands at the old Ford plant, at Kent Station which is counted as part of the project, at Tivoli Docks and at Camp Field.  I could name many more.  Imagine what could be done if we built public housing on public land, including social housing, council housing and cost-price housing that is genuinely affordable for young people and people on low and middle incomes.  Instead, the Land Development Agency is talking about a 60:30:10 mix.  Some 60% is to be sold at private market rates, which will inevitably mean that significant numbers of people will be locked out of the market.  I ask for the Taoiseach's comments on that and for his position on the idea that public housing should be developed on this public land instead.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has stated by way of response that unprecedented levels of resources are being targeted at the issue of homelessness.  I suggest that it is the level of homelessness itself that is unprecedented.  The State still does not fully recognise or record the scale of this issue.  We know that the number of people experiencing homelessness is at least 20% higher than the number recorded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We also know that there are more than 1,700 adults and children in direct provision, non-State funded emergency and transitional accommodation, and Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges.  The State does not include these people in its homelessness figures, which is inexplicable.  Will the Taoiseach consider moving responsibility for the management and publication of homelessness figures to an independent body such as the Central Statistics Office or the Housing Agency?</p>  <p>  I also ask Government parties to support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's Homeless Prevention Bill 2020, which places a legal obligation on local authorities and State agencies to put in place a homelessness prevention plan before a family becomes homeless.  This will require enhanced and targeted resources from central government but it is absolutely essential.  Government must enable local authorities to end the use of congregated dormitory-style accommodation, to expedite the expansion of the Housing First model, and to introduce adult safeguarding reviews across our services.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly, who put the original question, raised the issue of the deaths of people availing of homelessness services.  That is a deep concern which is being taken very seriously by Government.  It is important to note and respect the work of those in the homelessness services who have cared for these individuals and who were their friends.  The impression that the majority died alone on the streets is inaccurate and unfair.  It does a disservice to the work, care and companionship of those working in the sector.  I know that was not the intention of Deputies.  To give an example, Mr. Pat Doyle of the Peter McVerry Trust recently spoke of a homeless man who used the trust's services and who died of cancer in his own-door accommodation, having been cared for by the trust.  That type of care is the hallmark of the trust's work.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the HSE have jointly commissioned a detailed review of all recent deaths in homelessness services.  In reference to the point the Deputy made on data collection, the Department of Health recently requested the Health Research Board, HRB, to undertake a study to collect data on deaths among people who were homeless at the time of death.  The HRB is undertaking a one-year feasibility study to collect these data from coroners' records.  Each case is different and there is a complex story behind every one.  We should respect that.  It is important to avoid speculation or simplification and get a clearer picture, based on evidence.  I believe that is what Deputy Kelly sought in his questions.</p>  <p>  It is also crucial that the Government lives up to its duty to protect our vulnerable and to tackle homelessness in our cities and our towns.  The homelessness figures are still too high but they have decreased by 17% year on year.  Some 6,000 people exited homelessness this year.  I do not accept what Deputy McDonald has claimed is the real figure with regard to homelessness.</p>  <p>  With regard to the docklands in Cork, there is a lot of private land in this area in addition to the public lands.  A master plan is required.  I am more interested in getting things happening there, getting capacity and getting houses built.</p></speech>

Specifically, the division assists the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality and the associated senior officials' group established to oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality and public services, including matters relating to arts and culture, children, justice, policing reform and community safety, disability, social inclusion, gender equality, direct provision, the Irish language and sport; the Cabinet committee on education and the associated senior officials' group established to oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in the area of education and further and higher education; the Cabinet committee on health and the associated senior officials' group established to oversee programme for Government commitments in the area of health, including implementation of health reforms, including Sl&aacute;intecare and the development of mental health services; and the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 and the associated senior officials' group established to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of Covid-19 and to oversee the cross-government response.</p> <p> A policing reform implementation programme office forms part of the division.

The practice is ripping off people.  Yesterday, we published legislation to deal with this.  We ask the Government to engage constructively with this legislation to deal with dual pricing, not just in the insurance market but across a range of entities relating to bills for communications service providers and other utilities.  It is completely unacceptable and needs to be outlawed.</p>  <p>  As part of the Bill, we are also proposing to create a regulatory standard for customer service.  We all know about the scandalous way that Eir and Vodafone treat people.  We are trying to push this agenda on very quickly.  Will the Government engage with the legislation by supporting it, amending it or whatever?  It is needed in a timely fashion to deal with dual pricing and the lack of customer service across a range of utilities where people are being totally ripped off and treated shabbily.</p></speech>

This December will be the tenth Christmas for the O'Farrell family without Shane.  As the Taoiseach will know, the circumstances that led to his death have been very well voiced in the D&aacute;il and Seanad in recent years.  In 2018, the D&aacute;il voted in favour of the immediate establishment of a public inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell and this was followed by a unanimous vote to the same effect in the Seanad in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Instead of acting on the instruction of both Houses, the previous Fine Gael-led Government announced the establishment of a scoping exercise.  Nearly two years have passed, and completion of the final report has been delayed for the fifth time.  When announcing the establishment of the scoping exercise the former Minister for Justice and Equality committed to the completion of an interim report within eight weeks on the commencement of the exercise.  The family noted that the Guerin report took weeks to complete.</p>  <p>  We are coming up to Christmas.  The efforts of the O'Farrell family have been nothing short of heroic.  They have the majority support of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We need a public inquiry into the death of this young man.  We all support that.  When the Taoiseach was on the Opposition benches, he led the charge in calling for that inquiry.

I would appreciate an answer on that because it is happening in the teeth of Christmas.</p>  <p>  On public sector reform, the Government has thrown a considerable amount of mud into people's eyes in response to the demands of the student nurses and midwives to be paid for their work on placement, to be respected for the role they played during the Covid pandemic and not to be financially punished with the shocking fees they must pay, meaning they are actually paying for the privilege of being exploited.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's explanations to date have not responded to this point.  The majority of the student nurses and midwives are saying they will leave when they finish their training because they have been treated so badly in their four years and because they are facing into an understaffed and under-resourced health service.  The two things are directly connected.  They regard their exploitation and non-payment as students as a precursor of what they will face afterwards and, of course, that is the truth.  That is why the nurses went out on strike last year.  Our health service is in a perilous state and our healthcare workers' morale is on the floor.</p>  <p>  That is why the Government should stop repeating this nonsense that it will somehow compromise their education to remunerate them during their training.  It should remove the burden of fees from them.  It would actually allow us to recruit and retain these student nurses and stop them flooding out of the country when we desperately need them to stay and work in our health service.</p></speech>

It is taking this money to pay itself, and to pay for lawyers - in some cases for court actions taken against workers - for security, leases and warehouses where it has stored the goods that it smuggled out in the dead of night in order to cheat the picketing workers.  If the Government had intervened after 50 days, as opposed to 250 days, it would have saved the vast bulk of this expenditure.  In my opinion, that money should have been used to top up the workers' redundancy.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that it was a serious mistake on the part of the Government not to have a serious intervention at a far earlier stage?  Does he accept that those moneys could have been saved if that had been done?  Even at this late stage, the &euro;3 million that has been set aside for upskilling and training, not the most appropriate for many of the workers who are already in training and some already at the very end of their working careers, should be put directly in to top up the redundancies, as the shop stewards have demanded and asked for.</p></speech>

On several occasions, the Taoiseach met Shane's parents, Lucia and Jim, who are among the most inspirational people one could meet.  They are now facing their tenth Christmas without their beloved son, Shane.  As Deputy McDonald said, they have been seeking justice for Shane and for the wrongs perpetrated on their family to be addressed.  The previous Government announced a scoping inquiry, which has been subject to several delays.  The most recent information is that the retired judge intends to complete his report by, I believe, 21 January.</p>  <p>  On behalf of my neighbours, the O'Farrell family, and the wider community in Carrickmacross, I ask the Taoiseach to liaise with the Minister for Justice to ensure that the outcome of the scoping exercise is published and completed by that date in January so that we can move on to the implementation of the resolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad for a full public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Central Bank for its report which did not pull any punches.  It is not acceptable for the insurance companies to conduct their affairs in this manner.  We will constructively engage with the Labour Party on its legislation and on the customer service dimension and the necessity of public utilities to give optimal service to customers along with transparency in everything they do.</p> <p> Regarding the case of Shane O'Farrell, I have met Lucia, Jim and the entire family on a number of occasions.  I pay tribute to Deputy John McGuinness, who has been with the family on their long journey, and Deputies Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, along with the other Deputies in the House who have raised these issues consistently.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Justice and I am anxious that the scoping inquiry be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible, so that we can then take a decision regarding an inquiry in the context of the output of the scoping inquiry, its analysis and recommendations and whatever additional information and guidance it will provide us with.</p> <p> On the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett regarding vulture funds, he will have seen that I did not get a chance earlier to respond because my time was short.  I will engage with the relevant Ministers on that issue.  Any behaviour of a nature which deprives other people of their rights is unacceptable.  I will pursue that issue in respect of the legal framework governing the management of estates and complexes to ensure that people's rights are not transgressed and that there is no exploitation of any loopholes in a ruthless and inhumane manner.</p> <p> On the point made by Deputy Barry, liquidations happen, unfortunately, and liquidators get appointed.  They work within the law and sometimes within the framework of the High Court.  Governments cannot intervene legally in how a liquidator might undertake its business.  In this case, the Government did not wait for 250 days, as the Deputy implied.  The Government has taken an interest in this case from the beginning.  We have always been very clear though that there are, unfortunately, legal constraints in respect of, for example, the liquidation process itself, and the Revenue having to fulfil its legal frameworks in getting its revenue back from all employers.  The Department of Social Protection must do likewise to ensure the Social Insurance Fund is properly funded.  There are no easy ways to circumvent those laws.  It is dishonest and disingenuous to suggest that there are because there are not.</p> <p> The Government provides statutory redundancy in all situations where private employers fall down, whether it is a liquidation or whatever the circumstances.  The Government, therefore, has actually stepped up the plate here.  It is extraordinary and probably a feat of the propagandistic strengths of the Deputies that they have created the impression that the Government has not done anything.  It is actually the opposite.  It is the private sector which has failed here.  The State, through statutory redundancy, put forward &euro;13 million for the workers-----</p></speech>

I think I have dealt with the case of Shane O'Farrell, which was raised by Deputy Carthy.  I have dealt with the issue of the student nurses on a number of occasions now.  There is a review, which we want, and there is engagement between the Minister and the unions on this matter regarding the allowances.  Fourth-year students are paid, as the Deputy knows.  Regarding the first and second-year students, what I said yesterday and before that still applies.  The Deputy has studiously ignored that for his own good reasons.</p>  <p>  My view is that in the second wave of the pandemic there has been nowhere near the same impact on hospitalisation as there was in the first wave.  The Deputy cannot say that the health service is under-resourced.  An incredible level of resources has gone into the health service this year - &euro;4 billion, of which &euro;2 billion was for Covid-19 and &euro;2 billion for additional services.</p></speech>

More than 800 people participated online, comprising a broad range of civil society, community, sectoral and political representatives from across the island of Ireland and in Britain.  In budget 2021, the Government announced the shared island fund, with &euro;500 million to be made available to 2025, which will be ring-fenced for shared island projects.  The shared island fund provides significant new multi-annual capital funding for investment on a strategic basis in collaborative North-South projects which will support the commitments objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Our priorities for such investment are set out in the programme for Government and include working with the Executive to deliver key cross-Border infrastructure initiatives, including the A5, the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water Bridge, and cross-Border greenways, including the Sligo to Enniskillen greenway; working with the Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on the island, including, for instance, examining the feasibility of high-speed rail connections; working with the Executive and the UK Government on new investment and development opportunities in the north west and Border communities, including co-ordinated investment at the University of Ulster's Magee campus in Derry; and supporting a North-South programme of research and innovation, including an all-island research hub.</p>  <p>  The Government is working actively, in partnership with the Executive through the North-South Ministerial Council, on these cross-Border investment projects, which are part of our shared island commitments in the programme for Government.  Progressing these projects will be a key focus of our discussions at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary on Friday, 18 December.  I look forward to continued constructive co-operation between the Government and the Executive to deliver these important investments for the island.  I have also had constructive engagement with British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the Government's shared island objectives and commitments, and I have made it clear that we are happy also to engage on an east-west basis as we take this work forward.</p>  <p>  As part of our shared island initiative, the shared island unit in my Department is developing a comprehensive research programme, working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and other partners.  My Department has also asked the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to prepare a comprehensive report on shared island issues in 2021.  This will provide valuable input from economic, social and environmental partners.  An economic assessment of a united Ireland does not form part of the work of the shared island unit.  As I have said before, our shared island initiative does not preordain any constitutional outcome under the Good Friday Agreement.  Our focus is on working with all communities and traditions to build a shared island and shared future.  I am aware of comprehensive work undertaken by the ESRI, and Professor John FitzGerald, on the economic implications of a united Ireland.</p>  <p>  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives of the unit.  On 22 October, I launched the shared island dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on all aspects of a shared future on the island.  The first of the shared island dialogues took place online on 26 November on the topic, New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement.  More than 80 young people from across the island, representing different backgrounds and interests, participated in the event and put forward their ideas for a shared future.  The dialogue is available online and the key themes and concerns raised by young people will inform how we progress the shared island initiative.</p>  <p>  The dialogue series will continue on this basis over the next several months and will focus on important issues for people on the island in the years ahead, including the environment, health, education and economy, and on key civic concerns that are addressed in the Good Friday Agreement, including identity and equality.  Throughout the dialogue series, we are seeking as broad a range of perspective and experience as possible and the active inclusion of voices that have been traditionally been under-represented in the peace process, including young people, as well as women and new communities on the island.</p></reply>

It clearly sets out a mechanism.  Those of us who want to see Irish unity need to convince others that it is in their best interests, that we will all be collectively better off in a united Ireland and that we will be able to reach higher to meet the challenges that face our country.  The Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that he wants to see a united Ireland at some point in the future.  I put it to him, therefore, that he has a responsibility, along with those of us who share that aspiration, to convince others that it is in their best interests.  That means we have to talk about it.  We have to talk about all of the challenges that unity will bring, but also the benefits it will bring.  It is my firm belief that a united Ireland makes economic sense, that we will be better off and that we will have the capacity to make all of the people of our country, North, South, east and west, better off.  To do that, we need to gather the information because there will be some who will contend otherwise.  I do not understand the Taoiseach's reticence and reluctance around carrying out an assessment of the economic benefits and challenges, if there are any, of Irish unity.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach step up to the mark?  This is the big, national conversation of our people.  This is the generation who can deliver a united Ireland.  I am asking the Taoiseach to be part of that, as opposed to being part of the barrier to it.</p></speech>

The scenes in the North last night of ambulances lining up outside hospitals and massive overcrowding in the emergency departments because of Covid-19, frankly, had fairly alarming echoes of what happened in Italy early this year.  That is a warning.  Already, there are signs that in Border counties the high infection rate is spilling over.  The parties in the Executive and the Government here should reconsider the importance of pursuing, on an all-island basis, a common, united strategy of eliminating community transmission, rather than the neither one thing nor another approach which is inevitably going to lead to further spikes and lockdowns.</p>  <p>  I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a motion tabled by Solidarity-People Before Profit calling on the World Trade Organization, WTO, to follow the request of India and South Africa to waive intellectual property rights and patents in relation to the sharing of vaccine technology to the world's poorest countries, 25% of whom we are informed today will not have access to the vaccine by the end of the year, which could completely undermine the global vaccine programme.  </p></speech>

Next year, we will mark a century of the partition of our island.  My God, we know the heavy cost that has been carried by our people, North and South, for that disastrous, catastrophic event.  We have an opportunity now to heal and rebuild and we need to plan for that.</p>  <p>  I encourage the Taoiseach to raise again the issue of an all-island approach to Covid-19.  Like everyone else, when I saw the ambulances lined up I was shocked and worried about the situation in the North.  It was more reminiscent of times where we have seen ambulances lined up in hospitals in places such as Limerick.  It is a reflection of the fact that we have under-resourced health services, North and South, and that this virus hits and when it hits, it hits hard.  We are in real and imminent danger.  I think we agree that the optimal approach is an all-island, harmonised approach.  Deputy Alan Kelly might be interested to know the Executive is a five-party Executive.  The decision-making is complex and politics can, and has, entered the equation but I would encourage the Taoiseach, as I have before, to encourage others to leave the politics at the door when we are dealing with this virus.  This virus does not care about borders; it certainly does not care about green or orange.  It is a real and imminent threat to all of us and the best way to keep everyone safe is to keep each other safe on an all-island basis.</p></speech>

I know how the agreement can evolve.  It has always been a regret that the Deputy's party at different times sought to undermine that agreement.

He was, in my view, referring to what happened to Louis Mountbatten and two young boys who were murdered at Mullaghmore and to others.

As far as Covid-19 in the North is concerned, I have left politics outside the door in all my dealings with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  I respect the two jurisdictions and I respect there are two chief medical officers.  I am not sure Deputy McDonald has always left politics outside the door in relation to that issue because she sometimes sought to blame the Republic.  In more recent times, there has been a more consensual approach in terms of the issue.  What is happening in the North in terms of the incidence rate there, the impact on hospitalisations and the impact on ICU is difficult and concerning.  As we see it, if one does the modelling, the numbers could increase from where they are now and result in a more severe impact on hospitalisations and ICU.  We have to stand in solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland in relation to this challenge they now face, to do everything we can to be of assistance and to remain vigilant in respect of our own situation here.  What this demonstrates, as I said earlier, is the exponential rate at which this virus can grow.</p>  <p>  The European Union is committed to the COVAX initiative and to helping those countries that are not in a position to afford the vaccines.  Ultimately, there will be a surplus of vaccines in Europe in the latter part of the year.</p> <p>The WHO has its initiatives and they should be funded more effectively because we need a global elimination of the virus, and some countries are not where the more advanced countries are.  We support, and have been supportive of, the various initiatives that have been designed to provide vaccines to the least well-off across the globe.  We will continue to do that.</p> <p> On the all-island front, our chief medical officers are working together, our clinicians have been sharing advice and both health systems have been sharing advice and observations.  I said earlier that we will have a meeting on Friday.  We are concerned about the high rates of Covid in the Border counties as well.  The virus does not respect borders but there are two political jurisdictions, an Executive in the North and a Government in the Republic.  We will engage with the Executive to see if we can collectively get the incidence down on the island of Ireland.  We are at different stages of the virus now.  The fact that the different levels of restrictions have not been aligned over the recent months has proved challenging.  The six weeks of level 5 we initiated here worked in getting numbers significantly down.  They are not as low as we would have liked but they are the lowest in Europe.  We are entering into the Christmas period with the lowest numbers in Europe, which is something we should acknowledge.  However, we have to be very vigilant and wear our masks.  We have to socially distance and every contact matters.  We must protect our loved ones, especially the elderly, our grandparents and parents.  That has to be our objective in the Republic. </p></speech>

Mr. Guerin provided his report in May 2014, and following a meeting with Mr. Kenny, Alan Shatter resigned from the Government.  Mr. Shatter made clear in resigning that Mr. Guerin had not asked to interview him, as he would have expected if his intention was to reach conclusions about Mr. Shatter's approach with regard to issues raised by Sergeant McCabe.  Mr. Shatter commenced proceedings for a judicial review of the report.</p>  <p>  In February 2019, the Supreme Court found that the conclusions regarding Mr. Shatter in the Guerin report were outside the scope of the terms of reference of the review and were arrived at without an invitation to Mr. Shatter to express his views.  The court granted a declaration that the conclusions in the report in respect of Mr. Shatter were outside the scope of Mr. Guerin's terms of reference.  The court also emphasised that it was far from critical of Mr. Guerin's conduct in carrying out the review in the prevailing circumstances.</p>  <p>  It is important that the decision of the Supreme Court is properly reflected in the information placed before the House.  Therefore, as a matter of propriety and fairness, I recently placed a redacted version of the report in the Oireachtas Library with those paragraphs which the Supreme Court found were outside the scope of the review removed from the text.  The revised report is accompanied by the full texts of the Supreme Court's judgments to contextualise the matter.</p></speech>

I also attended a meeting of the Euro summit.  We began as usual on Thursday with an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli.  In his contribution, President Sassoli stressed the urgency of having the recovery plan and multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which were agreed by European Union leaders when we met last July, in place and accessible from the new year.  We also paid tribute to Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, the former President of France and a committed supporter of the European Union, who passed away on 2 December.</p>  <p>  The agenda for our meeting was particularly full and included a number of complex and far-reaching issues, such as Covid-19, climate action and the European Union's relations with Turkey and the southern Mediterranean.  We also needed finally to sign off on the &euro;1.8 billion package that includes the European Union's budget for the next seven years and the recovery fund we agreed at our meeting in July.  This is a vital tool to support the EU&rsquo;s economic recovery and the green and digital transformations.  I pay tribute to the German Presidency for brokering that agreement.  We also, of course, took stock of the state of play in the Brexit negotiation.  In my contribution today, I will address Covid-19, climate action, the multi-annual financial framework and recovery package, and Brexit.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address security and external relations issues in his concluding remarks this afternoon.</p>  <p>  As the House will be very aware, Covid-19 continues to pose a major challenge across Europe.  In many member states, cases are continuing to rise and a number of countries have announced further restrictive measures this week.  At our meeting, we took the opportunity to share information on the situation in our respective countries.  It is fair to say that a number of leaders expressed serious concern as we approach the holiday season.  While it is enormously heartening that vaccines are expected to come on stream in the weeks and months ahead, it remains essential, as I said earlier, that people continue to abide by public health recommendations and rules.  There can be no letting down of our guard.  This is the case across Europe, where winter holidays and other activities remain a cause of concern.</p>  <p>  Our discussions also focused on the authorisation and roll-out of vaccines.  We were encouraged by European Commission President von der Leyen&rsquo;s presentation in this regard.  We agreed to continue to co-ordinate on vaccines, including on vaccine certificates.  The Commission&rsquo;s work on vaccines is a clear example of the European Union responding to citizens' needs and supporting member states' efforts to combat the pandemic.  The European Union will continue its efforts to contribute to the international response to the pandemic, including through the COVAX facility.  We must continue to ensure that nobody is left behind.  With a view to better managing future pandemics, we agreed that the European Union should promote ways to reinforce international co-operation, including through a possible international treaty on pandemics within the framework of the WHO.</p>  <p>  It is clear that even when vaccinations are rolled out and restrictions ease, it will take considerable time for economies to recover across the European Union.  The European Union budget and the recovery fund will help to drive this recovery, as well as supporting the green and digital transformations.  The agreement we reached in our long meeting in July was historic.  For the first time, we agreed to allow joint borrowing, given the scale of the challenge the pandemic presents.  Following our agreement, the German Presidency engaged constructively with the European Parliament to secure its consent for what had been agreed.</p> <p>These discussions reached a positive outcome in November.  This was a significant achievement and at our meeting last week we expressed our appreciation to Chancellor Merkel.</p> <p> Some member states, however, were concerned that the instrument to give effect to rule of law provisions departed from what had been agreed by leaders in July.  Most member states, Ireland included, did not believe that this was the case.  However, the conclusions that we adopted last week make clearer the circumstances in which the measures might be invoked and on that basis all member states were prepared to give the package, as finalised with the Parliament, their support.  Ireland firmly supports the rule of law as a core value of the European Union and will support the objective, proportionate and effective implementation of the conditionality mechanism for the budget.</p> <p> This agreement now enables the Council and the European Parliament to formally adopt the MFF and recovery package and the 2021 budget for the EU so that it can take effect at the start of next year.  As well as ensuring crucial funding for Europe&rsquo;s recovery from Covid, it also paves the way for the roll-out of important new programmes, such as PEACE PLUS, and the Brexit adjustment reserve.</p> <p> We had long and difficult discussions on climate action that went through the night.  It could have been a record that one meeting went on for 23 hours.  However, I am pleased to be able to report that the European Council agreed to endorse a binding EU target of a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 of at least 55%, compared with 1990 levels.</p> <p> This weekend marked the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, and I very much welcome the strengthening of the EU's existing 40% reduction target.  At the meeting I conveyed Ireland's strong support for stepping up our ambition at EU level.  It is a crucial step on our path to a climate-neutral EU by 2050.  This enhanced EU target will be submitted to the UN by the end of the year.  We also agreed to raise our climate ambition in a manner that will drive sustainable economic growth, create jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for EU citizens, and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the EU economy.</p> <p> What was agreed last week was an increase in ambition at EU level.  The specific implications of this for each member state will be worked through next year, taking account of considerations of fairness and solidarity, and member states' specific national circumstances.  Over the first half of 2021, the Commission will be bringing forward a suite of proposals in its "fit for 55" package.  Some member states wished to see greater detail in last week's conclusions.  Most, however, preferred to leave greater detail until the Commission has completed its work on impact assessment in particular.  Our discussion was long and detailed, but I am pleased that it was possible to bring everyone on board and the EU will now notify this new target to the UN by the end of the year.</p> <p> The European Commission has now been asked to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the achievement of this new level of ambition.  By the middle of next year, the Commission will publish its package of proposals, which will be accompanied by an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at member state level.  Leaders will return again to this issue and adopt additional guidance in advance of the Commission bringing forward its proposals.</p> <p> The summit began on the day following a dinner in Brussels between President von der Leyen and the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.  On Friday morning President von der Leyen provided an update on the then state of play.  At that point, the two sides remained far apart on the remaining open issues of level playing field, fisheries and dispute resolution, and had agreed that the negotiation teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues.</p> <p> While the prospects for a deal were not strong, I recalled to other leaders the extent of what was at stake for Ireland, for the EU, as well as for the UK.  I took the opportunity also to welcome the agreement in principle reached between the Commission vice-president, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, and the UK Secretary of State, Michael Gove, on all issues related to the protocol.  The two weeks which led up to that agreement illustrate what can be done when negotiating teams knuckle down with a commitment and a political will to get agreement.  It is to their credit that they managed to iron out some of the genuinely difficult issues around the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol emanating from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p> I welcome that this week both negotiating teams continue to make every effort to bridge the remaining gaps, with a view to reaching a deal that will ensure fair competition and workable arrangements on fisheries.  I hope that, with creativity and political will, it will be possible to get a deal across the line.</p> <p> President von der Leyen confirmed that the Commission was proposing a set of targeted contingency measures which will ensure basic air and road connectivity in the event of no deal, as well as allowing for the possibility of reciprocal fishing access by EU and UK vessels to each other&rsquo;s waters during 2021.  This is a reminder yet again of the need for us all to prepare for the changes that 1 January will bring, even in the case of a deal.  It is particularly important that this message of preparedness gets home to many of the small to medium-sized enterprises across the country, whether there is a deal or no deal.  No deal would be much more severe on our economy but a deal on the future relations between the UK and the EU would still mean significant change and a significant burden of documentation, form-filling and customs declarations.  Revenue has said we will go from 1.5 million to 20 million customs declarations per annum.  This will have significant implications, including an impact on hauliers and on the need for capacity.  Significant work has to be undertaken by all State agencies - there must be very good co-ordination across the agencies and there must be a team-based approach between Revenue and all the Departments, including those with responsibility for health and agriculture - to prepare for Brexit and its aftermath, particularly in the first week of January.  It will be challenging and difficult.  Every company that trades with or through Britain must be sure to double-check its compliance regime.  Those involved must be sure that their customers and those they engage with, on both sides, are fully aware of the implications of Brexit generally.  Preparation is absolutely essential.  </p> <p> On Friday, there was a meeting of the Eurosummit in inclusive format, that is to say, including all 27 EU leaders.  We were briefed on economic developments by the president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, and by our Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in his capacity of president of the Eurogroup.</p> <p> We welcomed the agreement reached in the Eurogroup on the reform of the European Stability Mechanism.  This includes the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund which will now be introduced by the beginning of 2022.  This is an important step towards strengthening economic and monetary union and banking union.  I wish to pay warm tribute to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for navigating and facilitating what is a very important agreement for banking stability into the future, from a Europe-wide perspective.  The Eurogroup will now work to prepare a more detailed work plan on all outstanding elements needed to complete banking union.  The president of the ECB outlined the Central Bank's approach to the continuing impact of Covid-19 on economies across Europe and the likely position going into 2021, and gave guidance to member states on our respective economic policies and frameworks.</p> <p> Our discussions last week were not always easy.  EU leaders expressed strong views, in particular on the MFF, on the recovery fund and on climate, but we kept talking and we found agreement.  The negotiations on climate were particularly difficult.  Differences of these kinds between EU partners are not a sign of weakness.  Our strength lies in our ability to hold discussions, even when they are difficult, and to reach common ground from which we can move forward together.  As a challenging year nears its close, I draw real encouragement from the progress we made last week.  We have laid a solid foundation for strong co-operation in 2021.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the Council, Charles Michel, on their very constructive engagement with the Government and with this country and for being mindful of the issues we have across all the matters under discussion, particularly the Brexit situation, where they have shown very commendable interest and continued commitment.  I look forward to the debate, after which the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will report on our discussions on security and external relations issues.</p></speech>

It has been said many times in this House that we have reached crunch time or the endgame in Brexit negotiations.  All of those moments were indeed critical and they were important junctures in Britain's Tory-induced withdrawal from the European Union.  However, here we are, in the final days of 2020, on the final straight.  While there has been a great deal of pessimism recently, it now seems there is a growing sense of optimism that a trade deal can, in fact, be done.  We need a fair, workable deal and it is good that both sides have committed to keep talking.</p>  <p>  I have always said that there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in said from the start that Ireland is uniquely exposed to the economic and political fallout from Brexit.  For this reason, we argued the need for special arrangements for our country in any agreement reached between the EU and Britain.  Early on, this perspective was met with some resistance by those in government, but I am happy to say that it gradually became the unified position of the D&aacute;il.  I have no doubt that this unified approach played a major part in ensuring that Ireland's position was understood and taken seriously.  Special arrangements for Ireland are now encapsulated in the Irish protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  Those protections were hard won and I am glad that a guarantee has been cemented as regards the implementation of the protocol.</p>  <p>  However, it should also be said that the protocol is far from perfect.  It represents the bare-minimum protections we need, namely, a commitment of no return to a hard border and protections for our all-island economy.  It should also be pointed out that protections needed for Ireland go far beyond trade and economic concerns.  The diminution of citizens' rights along with the preservation and, indeed, strengthening of all-Ireland co-operation are issues that will require further scrutiny as part of the work in upholding and defending the Good Friday Agreement.  There is clear political agreement on the Irish protocol.  However, the implementation of some measures contained within the protocol is dependent on the realisation of a wider trade agreement.  There can be no switching off on behalf of the Government as the pressure now ratchets up.</p>  <p>  Progress on the level playing field is welcome, particularly when it comes to protecting against divergence in standards into the future.  We could not accept a trade deal that would see the North exposed to a low-wage, deregulated Tory economy.  A final trade deal must also be good for the Irish fishing industry.  Any loss to the catch will require a renegotiation of how the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is applied to Irish waters.  A no-deal Brexit would not be a good outcome for anybody, to put it mildly, including Britain.  The chance of the ratification of an agreement by the end of this year has truly narrowed and the prospect of a no-deal interregnum in the new year is now very real.  The fault here, let it be said, lies squarely with the Tory Government.  Boris Johnson wasted months playing games with his Internal Market Bill instead of engaging in substantive, good-faith negotiations.  Businesses are on tenterhooks wondering what they will face in January and how best they should prepare as they wait to find out.  The very last thing that business and industry needed was another layer of confusion.  Support and advice to businesses will have to be intensified over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  We have had four long years of Brexit talks laced with Tory Machiavellianism and disregard for Ireland.  We must always remember that the British Government is dragging the people of the North out of the European Union against their democratic wishes.  It is clear that the ultimate answer to Brexit is Irish unity and the removal of the problematic British Border on our island.  It is absolutely essentially that the Government starts planning for orderly, peaceful and democratic constitutional change and for the reunification of Ireland.  That conversation is now under way right across the island and beyond.  Everyone who calls this island home needs to be part of that discussion.  I know that a referendum on unity will happen in the not too distant future and I, for one, look forward to that moment when people will have their say.</p></speech>

With the dual challenges faced by our country through the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, Ireland merits consideration of a fairer allocation of funding than that envisaged at present.  As things stand and as we are all aware, Ireland will contribute more to the fund than we will receive.  When this is coupled with reports that the EU Brexit fund introduced to assist the worst-affected member states with the impact of Brexit is being coveted by EU leaders, ostensibly to compensate for the potential loss of fishing income in the event of a less than equitable deal on fishing but primarily as a means to influence domestic politics, we need to become much more assertive about our needs.  The French President, Mr. Macron, stated on the fishing issue: "I'm not giving my piece of cake away."  The Government needs to ensure we are not left waiting on the periphery once more, hoping to pick up the crumbs.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding concerns over the distribution of funds, I welcome the agreement between all EU member states on the EU budget and the multi-annual financial framework, albeit that this agreement was reached through the fudging of the need to deal with the serious concerns relating to the actions of the Hungarian and Polish Governments.  In effect, whatever way we choose to proclaim it, the EU, as an institution, was held to ransom by the vetoes of both Hungary and Poland, both of whom are allies of Fine Gael in the European People's Party in the European Parliament.  The failure to find the means to address this issue comes at an ongoing cost, namely, the continued erosion of the liberal values of the European Union by the Hungarian and Polish Parliaments.  Just last Monday, the Hungarian family affairs Minister, Katalin Nov&aacute;k, posted a video on social media which claimed there is no need for a woman to have the same salary as a man.  On Tuesday, the Hungarian Parliament approved a series of amendments to the Hungarian constitution that further erode the rights of the LGBT community there.  We cannot allow the erosion of the liberal idea of Europe to be sacrificed for the sake of expediency.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a few comments on the situation regarding Brexit.  At this stage, until we learn otherwise, we must work with the proviso that we are facing into a no-deal Brexit.  Warnings from Irish road haulage industry leaders indicate that the anticipated disruption and obstruction that will arise as a result of new customs and import controls at points of entry to Ireland in the aftermath of Brexit will have catastrophic consequences and will potentially bring the haulage industry to a standstill.  Reports suggest we are facing into a period of unprecedented disruption for the movement of goods.  Indeed, there have been calls for the immediate introduction of a single entity - a national traffic body - to provide the on-the-spot decision-making that will be required to deal with the potential chaos that may emerge.</p> <p>With half of all goods leaving Dublin Port heading to Holyhead, reports of the lack of preparedness in Wales are very concerning.  In the past week the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee has expressed huge concerns over the absolute lack of preparedness at Welsh ports.  With barely two weeks to go until we reach the deadline, decisions are still awaited on the placement of inland border control facilities away from Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke.  The British Government is sleepwalking towards the precipice of disaster and is dragging Ireland with it.</p></speech>

I hope we can revisit that.</p>  <p>  Normally we would now be talking about the detail of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the EU's recovery and resilience facility.  There is no doubt that we will have opportunities to do that in the future.  In normal circumstances we would be talking at some length about the climate action agreements which were hard-won at the European Council.  I welcome the new emissions reduction target of 55% and the commitment to a climate-neutral Europe by 2050.  The Taoiseach was right in saying that consensus is often arrived at after 23 hours of discussion.  However, that consensus often comes at the lowest common denominator.  A reasonably ambitious target has been agreed in this instance.  We will need to see the detail of how we can play our full part in achieving it. </p>  <p>  As I said, these are the things we would normally be talking about but for the unique situation with Brexit.  I want to spend my remaining three minutes dealing with that.  In passing, I must comment on Deputy McDonald's claim that Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the unique situation of Ireland set the tone for everybody.  That has been an absolutely unanimous view of all parties in this House from the beginning.  I remember going to meetings with leaders of European socialist and social democratic parties to win people over to prioritising that above all else.  This has been an achievement across all groupings.  We can be very pleased with this. </p>  <p>  This morning the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told the European Parliament that there is now a path to an agreement.  We have found a way forward on most issues, but some remain.  She particularly instanced fisheries as an unresolved issue.  In all the stakeholder forums I have attended from the very beginning of this process it was the settled position that we would not leave fisheries to be the last item.  We wanted to address it before the trade talks were concluded.  It will be a failure if we allow that to happen, but it looks as though fisheries may be the final unresolved issue.  I am not suggesting that the level playing field issues are entirely resolved, but a pathway to resolving those issues seems to have been found.  Hopefully they can be worked out. </p>  <p>  I am an optimist, and I have repeatedly said that I expect an outcome to be arrived at.  Rational decision-making ultimately prevails.  Most people who go into negotiations do so on the basis that their interlocutors will ultimately act on the basis of reason and rationality.  However, we live in an era when rational decision-making cannot be depended upon.  Even now we cannot be certain that the Johnson Government will support any final deal, however damaging and upsetting to the British economy the alternative will be.  We must continue to plan.</p>  <p>  In that context, I have said for more than two years that our first test on 1 January will concern our ports and our ability to export and import goods.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State will attest to that.  I have been extremely critical of what I can only describe as the complacent attitude of the Department of Transport towards this matter.  It has not been proactively looking for alternative direct links.  These links have not been found because of proactive decision-making on the part of the Government or State agencies.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, testified before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs this morning.  Rather, it happened because commercial decisions were taken.  It is almost in spite of State agencies and the Department that direct linkage will be significantly increased from January.  I am not sure it will be enough.  </p>  <p>  We have seen some of the disruption that may arise.  If fisheries is ultimately the sticking point and fishermen are excluded from their traditional fishing grounds, which are now claimed by the United Kingdom, I can see no way that there will not be disruption at French ports.  We must be absolutely prepared for that eventuality.</p></speech>

As we have heard, the President of the European Commission stated this morning that there is now a path to an agreement.  The path may be very narrow but it is there, and it is therefore our responsibility to continue trying.  The British Prime Minister also told the House of Commons this morning that he hopes the EU bloc will "see sense" and do a deal.  We would say the same about him.</p>  <p>  In the past few days all sorts of new issues have arisen.  We have been told that the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, tried to tear up the rule-book and negotiate bilaterally with France and Germany.  It was a good try, but that was something to which the EU was never going to agree.  We were told that negotiations might not conclude before the end of this month, leaving everyone, including the European Parliament, in limbo for the first few weeks of January.  We were told that 97% of the deal has been agreed and that the issues in dispute remain the same; the level playing field, fair competition, governance and fisheries.  </p>  <p>  Before dealing with these issues I wish to say a few words about the Northern Ireland protocol.  As we know, agreement has been reached between Michael Gove, MP, and Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efƒçoviƒç on the implementation of this protocol.  The offending clauses of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill 2019-21 have been withdrawn.  As a result, Northern Ireland will effectively remain in the Single Market and customs union and EU rules will prevail as regards food and agricultural produce generally.  In addition, Northern Ireland producers will have tariff-free and quota-free access to the EU market.  This is good news for Northern Ireland producers and producers on this side of the Border.  It certainly has implications for unionism and the future of the union itself, but that is a matter for another day to which I will return at a later stage.  What has been achieved is a triumph of Irish diplomacy and should be acknowledged as such.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the level playing field and fair competition, the EU is right to insist on common high standards.  Globally, the EU has been at the forefront of bringing about high social, employment and environmental standards, climate change measures, fair competition regarding state aid, various taxation initiatives and high consumer standards.  A non-regression clause, whereby standards in existence in the UK as of 31 December 2020 remain in place, would be sensible.  However, the EU will inevitably move on in these areas, and it will always be ambitious.  A ratchet clause, whereby the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods if any increased standards are not met, would also make sense.</p> <p>It is best, however, to leave those issues to the negotiators, and I wish them well in their endeavours.</p> <p> As for fisheries, the British Government's decision to have Royal Navy gunboats on standby to protect UK fishing waters in the event of no deal is a little disturbing.  It is a throwback to the middle of the last century, when the world was made up of nation states which were often in conflict with one another.  Britain talks about sovereignty and taking back sovereignty but has failed to realise, or does not want to realise, that we now live in an interdependent world in which multilateral diplomacy prevails and nation states agree that pooling sovereignty is in their best interests.  I note that Commission President von der Leyen said this morning that, in all honesty, it may not be possible to get agreement on the fisheries issue.  That is something to be concerned about.</p> <p> I am pleased that the German Council Presidency has brokered a deal to resolve the impasse in respect of the multi-annual financial framework and the &euro;750 billion Covid recovery fund.  Poland and Hungary have removed their threat to veto the deal.  No doubt their antics will come back to haunt them at some stage in future negotiations.  This deal must not result in any diminishing of the EU's resolve to deal with rule-of-law issues in these countries.  Separately, I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to come forward with more information as to how Ireland will access the EU Covid recovery fund.  Work is continuing in this area, and we need to receive details on this as soon as possible.</p> <p> Like other speakers, I welcome the agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% before 2030.</p> <p> The Government was wise to base budget 2021 on a no-deal Brexit.  I note that a &euro;5 billion support fund for sectors worst hit by Brexit has been established.  Irish food and dairy exporters could certainly tap into this fund.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is working on a package, having regard to the final outcome when it becomes available.  We need to see the details of that as soon as possible.</p> <p> Consumers also need to be aware of Brexit.  It could lead to higher prices and difficulties with online shopping, delivery delays and the availability of products in our supermarkets.  Consumers will have to be prepared for this, and every effort should be made to promote Irish and EU products in this context such that work in that regard can continue.</p> <p> I noted what the Taoiseach had to say about Covid-19 vaccines, in particular the availability of these vaccines throughout the world, especially in poorer countries.  EU leaders, I understand, also discussed the global efforts against the pandemic and restated that the EU will continue to contribute to the international response, including via a COVAX facility for guaranteeing affordable and fair access to vaccines for all.  I think Irish people would agree with that, having regard to our philosophy of promoting human rights throughout the world, and I welcome the European Council's decision in that regard.</p> <p> I also note that the Council spoke at its meeting about EU-US relations.  The EU, I understand, looks forward to working together with the United States to reinforce the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, tackle climate change, enhance the economic recovery, co-operate on digital and technological matters, strengthen mutual trade, address trade disputes, reform the World Trade Organization and promote multilateralism as well as peace and security.  That is certainly a change.  We look forward to the incoming United States Presidency.  When I say it is a change, I mean it is a change from the point of view of the United States.  I look forward to developing all these concepts in the new world order, so to speak, as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take up office.</p> <p> The Council has a long meeting, and a lot of issues were discussed, but there was generally an acceptable outcome to its deliberations.</p></speech>

I fully agree that we face huge challenges in the agrifood sector and fisheries for exporters and importers and, if there is no deal, households, who could face increases to their bills of more than &euro;1,000 per year.  In the Government's comments to date there has been no comment as to how it would assist households in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  Plans to assist businesses have been announced, which is welcome, but there have been no plans to assist households.  It is in this context of preparations and readiness that it is remiss of the Government not to have carried out a form of national audit of Brexit readiness or preparations.  This is being done in the UK, for example, and it has shown up huge and very concerning gaps in its preparations.  Given the risks we face, I cannot understand why the Irish Government has not done this.  Yes, there have been plans and the omnibus legislation, but there has not been an independent assessment as to where there may be gaps.  We have seen in recent weeks that areas where we were given assurance that there would be no issues have now emerged as key concerns.  We were told not to worry, that Irish trucks would be green-laned at French ports, and then we find out the French do not have the technical capabilities to do so.  We have growing concerns being expressed by the Irish Road Haulage Association.  The plans and the aspirations in our preparations are all well and good but they should be tested independently ahead of 1 January, before problems arise.  That is very important.  It is also regrettable that the Government has refused to facilitate questions and answers on Brexit readiness and preparations, which I have asked for, this week in the D&aacute;il.  Yes, there will be statements on this, but we do not need more statements.  We need questions and answers so we can raise these matters directly and specifically and get answers to them.</p>  <p>  As we approach the final hurdle in the Brexit negotiations, it is worth taking stock.  There is probably one area where the UK Government has succeeded in its strategy.  It had wished to run down the clock on these negotiations to get to this point, at which only a minimalist deal is possible.  It has succeeded in running down the clock but has failed in its attempts to provoke rows over the internal market Bill and its stated attempts to breach international law.  It has failed in its negotiating tactic to try to gain additional leverage through those tactics.  It has failed in its attempts to divide and conquer and negotiate separately with different EU leaders.  The EU leaders across the board, with one exception, have been steadfast in not engaging with Boris Johnson on this.</p>  <p>  Fisheries is now left in the balance.  This is not where the European Union negotiators wanted to be.  We wanted fisheries to be agreed long before this point.  It is worth remembering that while the EU wants access to UK waters for our fleet, the UK needs and wants tariff-free access to the European Union market to sell its fish.  It will not be able to sell all the fish caught in UK waters, so there is the grounds for us holding firm and strong on that, and at this point I would urge that is done.  Fish do not know borders, and as far as fish conservation and sustainability are concerned, it is very important a deal is struck in close co-operation.</p> <p> I welcome the historic agreement relating to a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.  It is very important that we play a full role domestically in achieving that reduction.</p> <p> The rule of law provisions which have been hard fought for by the European Parliament in particular are significant.  They mark a shift in attitude by the European Union.  There is a risk that the provisions are not strong enough and are, in fact, more of an anti-corruption tool than a rule of law measure.  We could do with stronger sanctions in this area.  We need to defend from attacks on press freedom, civil society and the LGBTI+ community anywhere in the world, but especially in the European Union.  I am concerned that the comments of the Taoiseach on this issue have not been strong enough.  I note and acknowledge the strong comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on the issue.</p> <p> In conclusion, I note the significance of the milestone in terms of the EU getting to the point of collective EU debt issuance.  It is very significant.</p></speech>

The five conclusion headings from the post-meeting communiqu&eacute; were the multi-annual financial framework for 2021 to 2027 and the next generation EU recovery plan, Covid-19, climate action, security and external relations.  The statement of the Taoiseach and the communiqu&eacute; itself report progress on most of those headings.  That, in itself, is positive news.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, speak in the same vein subsequent to the summit.</p>  <p>  The communiqu&eacute; notes that the Council paid well-deserved tributes to the former French President, Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, who passed away on 2 December.  It referred to him as a driving force behind the European project who played a key role in creating the European Council.  It is a fitting tribute to a good European statesman and politician and one to which I think we should refer during this debate in a positive vein as well.</p>  <p>  On item 1 relating to the finances of the EU, we should welcome the fact that the Council made progress on finalising the finances of the EU to 2027 and resolving the stand-off on a rule of law provision between Poland and Hungary on one side, and the rest of the European Union on the other.  The progress made should not be taken as sufficient to address the real rule of law concerns held by many Deputies with regard to what is happening in Hungary and Poland when it comes to interference with freedom of the press or judicial independence.  It is long past time for real political action on the issue.  I believe the European People's Party must take effective measures with regard to the membership of its group and send out a clear message of its intent in this respect.</p>  <p>  The European Council discussions around the development, purchase and EU-wide distribution of effective Covid-19 vaccines are critical, as is the plan to take forward proposals for an EU health union.  The news yesterday that the European Medicines Agency, which is the EU agency responsible for the evaluation and supervision of medicines, has brought forward to a date before Christmas its meeting to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is very welcome.  All Members are agreed that every single day counts.  We work at full speed to authorise Covid-19 vaccines that are safe and effective and to get them distributed as effectively and efficiently as possible.  President-elect Biden made the point very well that vaccines alone do not save lives; vaccinations and people do.  We need to vaccinate as many people as humanly possible as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  This year, we saw the awesome power and force of nature, so I am very happy to see that EU leaders achieved a significant breakthrough in combating climate change by committing to a binding EU reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.  This is progress.  Now comes the hard part of implementing it in a way that does not penalise those who have been doing most to protect the environment.</p>  <p>  The conclusions of the Council on external relations, specifically with the eastern Mediterranean south neighbourhood, and those on security, particularly in strengthening the mandate of Europol and securing Europe-wide police and judicial co-operation, are important.</p>  <p>  As I stated at the outset, I wish to briefly address one issue that did not appear in the meeting conclusions but clearly was a part of the background discussions to the meeting, namely, Brexit.  The fact that Brexit is not part of the conclusions of the meeting is confirmation that, for most in Europe, Brexit is a regrettable fact of life.  Contrary to the Tory spin, Europe is not trying to undermine Brexit but, rather, to mitigate its impacts.  As I have commented many times previously in the House, Brexit is a lose-lose game.  Both sides suffer in Brexit.  The difference is that EU Governments recognise that fact now and are trying to ease its negative impact.  We in Ireland know this better than anyone else, and the people of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the other Border constituencies know it even better.  The negative impact of Brexit is not some theoretical outworking we have yet to see.  In my region, we have already seen it impact adversely, but we know, sadly, that worse is to come.</p>  <p>  I have made the case previously in the House for mitigation measures and will do so again.  The specifics of what we will require still depend on what emerges from the EU-Britain talks.  What we know for sure is that we will need to have systems and mechanisms for the maximum levels of all-island co-operation no matter what is agreed between Michel Barnier and Mr. Frost.</p>  <p>  The shared island unit and substantial funding are very welcome, but practical and tangible implementations are what matter.  We need key projects such as the A5 upgrade and the Narrow Water Bridge to be advanced speedily.  We also need greater co-operation across a range of areas such as health, transport, education, agriculture and IT infrastructure.  The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 facilitates co-operation in all of those areas and we wish to maximise the potential of that agreement.</p>  <p>  I had discussions with An Taoiseach recently regarding progressing the Ulster Canal.  I am very glad that he is clear in his commitment that funding will be provided under the shared island initiative, that it will be possible to progress the project quickly and that funding will be made available without delay.  It is an all-Ireland project that was committed to.  Some small-scale works have been carried out and I look forward to it being part of the great network of inland waterways we have throughout the island, North and South.</p>  <p>  I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to move speedily to create opportunities for ministers, North and South, as well as, most importantly, officials from both parts of this island, to interact and meet regularly to look at the nuts and bolts of how we can ease the impact of Brexit across the Border regions.  That is something we must do at parliamentary level as well.</p>  <p>  I spoke previously to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, who is present, both in discussions at our parliamentary party and privately, regarding the need to ensure that the EU cross-border healthcare directive is protected post Brexit.  All Members have helped and know patients who have travelled to various health facilities or clinics in Northern Ireland to have procedures or treatments carried out.  Deputies are aware that the EU healthcare directive will be available to Irish citizens in the 26 other EU countries post Brexit, but the reality is that more than 90% of people who currently avail of that healthcare directive source treatment or procedures, or both, in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  We need to ensure the arrangements that are in place at present are continued after 1 January.  I know people who have begun treatment or are awaiting dates to commence further or follow-up treatment.  It is an extremely important part of our healthcare delivery to be able to access capacity in Northern Ireland.  Similarly, we must ensure that citizens of Northern Ireland are not deprived of the opportunity to avail of healthcare facilities in the South when there is capacity.</p> <p>I urge the Minister of State and his officials to ensure that the negotiations that have been ongoing for some time are brought to a successful conclusion in regard to the need to protect the cross-border healthcare directive.</p></speech>

I also welcome the European Council's commitment to treating the vaccination as a global public good.  There were positive steps recently at EU level in the conclusion of common advance purchase agreements to guarantee access for Ireland and other member states to the vaccines as they become available.  As was said previously, it is not the vaccines that are important, but the vaccination.  It is important that, alongside this, we ensure the poorer countries have vaccines as well.  Many corporations should be commended on the work they have done so far on vaccines, but corporate interests cannot be allowed to be the determining factor in regard to who has access to vaccines and who does not.  There must be increased transparency on pricing and costs.</p>  <p>  The COVAX Facility is the international initiative which is intended to ensure that poorer countries have access to the vaccine.  I sincerely welcome the EU's commitment to contribute to the international response to the pandemic, including via the COVAX Facility for guaranteeing affordable and fair access to vaccines for all.  However, we need more than words.  The COVAX Facility is currently &euro;5 billion short of the funds it needs to procure its target number of vaccines for 2021.  The window to act to ensure a fair approach to Covid vaccines is closing fast.  The new seven-year budget was given the green light by the European Council.  It will last until 2027.  While the COVAX Facility needs &euro;5 billion, the EU is moving ahead with the European defence fund, an &euro;8 billion subsidy to the arms industry.  It is a fund that is explicitly intended to increase EU arms sales and exports.  I certainly believe that vaccines would be of far greater use.  I welcome the European Medicines Agency, EMA, announcement that it should have approval for the vaccine before Christmas.</p>  <p>  The Government must provide much greater clarity to the people about all aspects of the European budget and what it contains, as well as more information about what it will cost and what benefits we can expect.  It is important to remember that the EU budget does not cover housing, education and social protection, which are the biggest spending areas in a national budget.  I am concerned about the funding for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, particularly rural development.  The overall EU budget has been increased, but in real terms that of the Common Agricultural Policy has been reduced.  This is alarming in view of the dire situation being experienced by family farms.  It also comes at the same time we are asking farmers to do more for environmental protection.  Looking at the various budget lines we have received, there are billions at the expense of the traditional programmes such as CAP and Cohesion.  In addition, it is absolutely vital that we protect our fishing industry for the coastal communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600038#LL00300"><p>On a number of occasions in recent weeks and again with the Taoiseach today I have raised the issue of access to the vaccine on a global basis being critical to the effectiveness of the vaccine anywhere.  If access is not provided to the vaccine for poorer countries, this potentially will create a massive hole in vaccine cover which will allow for mutations and potentially undermine the efficacy of the vaccine.  We are literally all in this together.  The report from Johns Hopkins University public health school today that up to a quarter of the world's population in the poorest countries may not have access to the vaccine until 2022 is a major cause of alarm.  The report goes on to say that pricing issues are a problem.  There are also different attitudes.  While some are co-operating with poorer countries and with generic producers of vaccines in poorer countries, others are not.  What will we do about it?</p><p>People Before Profit has tabled a motion in this regard but, unfortunately, we do not have Private Members' time, so it cannot be taken until the new year.  However, we appeal to the Government to look at the motion on the Order Paper today.  It calls on the Government to raise in Europe the need to support the proposals from India and South Africa that aspects of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, relating to intellectual property regarding the vaccines and vaccine technology would be waived so there is no profit inhibitor on the distribution of the technologies that are necessary to produce the vaccine quickly and so generic producers around the world would be able to produce it.</p><p>Indeed, we hears the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, saying there will be very low numbers of the vaccine here, that it will be perhaps by the end of the year and that the Government is not quite sure when it will have the rest of the population vaccinated, we start to worry even about this country.  When will we get all these vaccines?  There is massive pharmaceutical capacity in this country.  Is there an issue with us having access to the technology, once it is available, and all the data?  I ask the Government to support the proposals that have been brought forward, to vote accordingly at the WTO and to raise it in the European Union.  All the normal mechanisms through which multinationals protect their profits, and are allowed to do so with laws on intellectual property, patents and so forth, should be waived.  If we are serious about us all being in it together and trying to eliminate Covid-19, this is an absolute necessity.  The Government must be very vocal and proactive in pursuing it.</p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of content moderators.  It is somewhat Covid-related but has another dimension.  I do not know if the Minister of State has read some of the articles in the <i>Business Post</i>, but I have been in contact with some of the people who work in this area, although not directly in the well-paid jobs in Instagram and Facebook.  They work for CPL/Covalent and Accenture in badly paid jobs but do incredibly traumatic work.  They have to moderate vile content such as suicide and self-harm promotion, terrorist activities, abusive posts, videos and so forth.  In one report by Facebook, over a three-month period there were 1.3 million posts relating to the promotion of self-harm and suicide.  Human beings have the job of trying to weed these things out, and many of them are suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  They had to sue Facebook and so forth about it, and they did that successfully.  Something must be done about this at European level to protect those workers and ensure they have proper counselling support.</p><p>I also discovered when I talked to these people that, during the level 5 restrictions, more than 1,000 of them were working in the office when they should have been working at home.  I believe there were similar situations in East Wall.  It must be asked why the infection rates did not go down low.  It was because the level 5 injunction that if people could work from home, they should do so was not being enforced and respected in some of these big workplaces that have more than 1,000 people going into them.  That must be investigated.</p></speech>

The &euro;1.8 trillion deal is a major vote of confidence to the world that the European Union is ready and able to tackle Covid-19 and to build back better after the pandemic.</p> <p>The &euro;390 billion being distributed in the form of grants raised by new EU debt mechanisms by the European Commission also highlights that the EU is taking a stand to help those countries most affected by the pandemic.  The response to the pandemic must be stimulus-led and we must not be afraid to spend billions in order to save trillions.  This is not a time to return to the austerity policies of the past that created enormous inequality and hardship for millions of people, including here in Ireland.  That should be avoided at all costs.  That is not to say that we should not be careful of how the money is spent.</p> <p> As I indicated in the House previously in the debate prior to the European Council meeting, the need to uphold the rule of law is critical for the functioning of the European Union.  We must also look at the protracted Brexit negotiations on a level playing field.  I welcome this morning's news that there seems to be some degree of progress in that regard.  That is incredibly important for every constituency right around the country.  I think of the farmers in Cork East, as it is one of the most productive regions in the country for dairy products, and the devastating impact in the event of a crash-out Brexit.  We must try to avoid that at all costs.  I know the Minister is making great efforts in that specific area.  It is a reminder that the functioning of the Single Market is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people, based on harmonised standards across the European Union.  We cannot allow that to be weakened.  Too many lives and livelihoods are at stake.  Likewise, we cannot let countries such as Hungary and Poland flout the rules, as the implications of doing so are potentially dangerous.  We must focus on those countries to ensure they are toeing the line and obeying the same rules as everybody else.</p> <p> Investment in the long-term development of State airports is critically important.  Under the Next Generation EU funding that will be made available, some must be ring-fenced for spending on long-term development and capital infrastructure.  We should be looking at ways we can bolster international trade, not just within the European Union, but elsewhere.  That is critically important.</p> <p> Much progress has been made in recent days with our European counterparts on energy.  I raised the matter with the Minister previously in the D&aacute;il.  We should also look at our airports, as they are very important in terms of Brexit-proofing the economy to the greatest extent possible.  Cork Airport could potentially benefit from Next Generation EU money to fund ongoing projects at the airport.  That is critically important.  I encourage the Minister to highlight that to his colleagues.</p> <p> From the point of view of vaccination research and antigen testing, one of the major crises facing the European Union in the coming months has just been raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett in terms of new outbreaks and mutations of the virus.  We must have a degree of concentration on the matter and invest in antigen testing at European level.  I urge the Minister to bring that message back.  We in Ireland have a critical role to play in that fight as we are home to the European base of many of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies.  Nine out of ten of the top ten companies in the world are located in Ireland.  They are a significant part of the economy and society now, so we should be leading the battle to improve antigen testing to ensure that we can have accurate rapid testing in place in the event of more outbreaks of new strains of the virus in some European countries and in the United Kingdom recently, which is highly concerning.  Perhaps that is a matter the Government could consider at a European level as well.</p></speech>

We must ensure the roll-out of the vaccines.  Several speakers referred to the difficulties there may be if we do not get a steady supply quickly enough in this State.  There are difficulties in the sense that we have heard reports that poorer parts of the world will not receive the vaccines at the same time.  Outside of the fact that this is utterly wrong and reprehensible, even from a purely selfish point of view, it is a bad idea.  We must treat the pandemic on a global basis for it to be successful.  That is straightforward.</p>  <p>  On some level, it is welcome that the multi-annual financial framework is sorted, but there are concerns about the CAP, for example.  A bye-ball may have been given on the rule of law, in particular as regards Hungary and Poland but if we are serious about the rule of law at a European level, we must look at the actions of the Spanish Government on Catalonian elected representatives.  Its actions have been utterly reprehensible.  If that is not a breach of the rule of law, I do not know what is.</p>  <p>  Once again, we return to Brexit, the story that will not stop giving.  We have reached the final hurdle.  How many times have we been here before?  We welcome the fact there have been moves and promises by what is not necessarily the most trustworthy British Government.  That is saying something.  The British Government will not now undermine the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol.  That is a necessary mitigation.  We have all heard today and in recent days about Brexit preparations.  According to the National Audit Office the UK is an absolute basket case.  The necessary preparations have not been done.  We accept that will have a significant impact, in particular on Irish companies and others using the land bridge.  We have also heard from the port companies, the Irish Road Haulage Association and numerous other groups.  I add my voice to the fact that there is a need for an audit to be carried out.  Eugene Drennan spoke today about the fact that he believes there has been insufficient collaboration between the stakeholders.  He was referring to the hauliers, the port companies and the ferry companies and there are also the businesses that require these operations.  We cannot ensure what type of Brexit will occur.  It is going to be bad.  We do not know how bad it is going to be, but we can introduce whatever mitigations are necessary to ensure we do not have chaos on this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600039#MM00300"><p>Two of the issues that faced the European Council in recent days must go down as seismic events in recent European history.  I refer to Covid and Brexit.  It is not unfair to say that the Union was already challenged with defending the impacts of Brexit before the body blow of Covid arrived.  The Covid story is probably taking centre stage now, given the upheaval it has created both economically and socially for the bloc of 27 member states.  All countries are in the pendulum swing of lockdown and feeling the economic and social effects.</p>  <p>  That said, European integration has also proven itself by the joint collaborations on the development of vaccines which are under consideration by the European Medicines Agency.  On approval, significant mobilisation of resources will be required to inoculate and protect the European population.  Ireland will also have to engage in similar activity in lockstep to ensure that we defend against the virus until a level of herd immunity has been achieved and we can continue to remain that way.  This will require vigilance and compliance, which will only prove possible if vaccine take-up is successful and European financial supports are of the significant order that is required.  It appears that the Council is prepared to make significant versatile funding provisions and also to achieve agreement in order to implement a multi-annual budgetary and recovery fund, the outline of which was drawn up in July.</p>  <p>  On the agenda also was an ambitious objective to achieve climate neutrality for the European Union by 2050.  As part of this commitment there is an ambitious proposal to a reduction of at least 55% in carbon emissions by 2030.  It gives credibility to Europe's leadership on climate as the Union marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris accord.  As well as creating benchmarks for how the EU seeks to initiate climate reductions, this ambition will have a significant effect on Irish emissions and must surely herald the need for a whole-of-government approach to climate action and change.</p>  <p>  We have heard much about the possible reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through taxation policy, innovations in housing retrofits, electrification in motorised transport and renewable energy developments, as well as moves away from fossil fuels in energy production.  Although laudable, many would suggest that some of our climate ambition is not achievable in the timeframe committed to, without significant and radical social change.  Our target for the penetration of electric cars, for instance, within the car fleet to 2030, has been shown to be overly optimistic considering the availability and cost of electric vehicles, allied with the infrastructural capital developments required to provide a feasible network of charging points around the country.</p>  <p> The move away from utilising turf in our electricity generation heralds a new lease of life for the Irish bog, but we must implement a just transition to ensure viable new work streams for those who must cease employment in that industry.</p> <p> Brexit is a particular concern for Ireland, but it gets little mention in the post-European summit press briefings, and I presume this is because the work is ongoing.  I hope the worsening unemployment figures announced in recent days in the UK as a result of Covid-19 will focus the attention of all parties in the UK to committing to a deal to minimise further economic harm to the UK bloc, and in that regard this Parliament resolutely supports such an outcome.</p> <p> The relationship between Europe and the United States also appears to be a discussion point, and I hope Ireland can be a strong beneficiary of future White House policies in trade and immigration as well as in developing further our strong US trade links.  President-elect Biden may have come along just at the right time to help provide a backstop to the Northern Irish protocol to Brexit and, I hope, to Covid-19 as we await vaccine deployment.</p> <p> The news on a European banking union also appears to be positive, as it has been credited to contributing to financial stability and helping to maintain finance to economies seeing the impact of Covid-19.  Financial instruments were also on the agenda with the banking union, and the question of progress in capital markets was under discussion.  All this dialogue is a result both of our membership of the European Council and our dependence on EU funding to provide a lifeline to our economy given the significant deficit we are currently running.  It is important we continue to be proactive Europeans and positively engaged with the European project, particularly given that the UK is gone in another direction.</p> <p> A Minister in this House years ago suggested that Ireland is closer to Boston than Berlin, but that statement, if made today, would require some scrutiny.  There is no doubt Ireland's future is now inextricably bound with Europe like never before, and our future economic prosperity will largely rest not only on our place in Europe but also how we adapt to the constraints of European federalist thinking.</p> <p> This year, 2020, has indicated how vulnerable our country is to political, economic and social upheaval not of our making.  That is now a fact and wishing otherwise will not make it so.  Our only course of defensive action for the future as a small European player is to become the best pound-for-pound performer in the European Union.  We must continue to invest, innovate and educate, and to execute microeconomic and social policies that continue to ensure Ireland remains a force to be reckoned with.  Although small in stature, our representation within Europe must continue to exert influence over future EU thinking.</p> <p> Issues similar to Covid-19 and Brexit will appear and disappear across the European horizon over the coming years.  Our island's mission must be to ensure that when decisions are being taken, we have a place at the top table.  To that end I commend the ongoing work of the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and all other actors and State agents who continue to contribute positively to Ireland's future standing on the European stage.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Taoiseach's full debriefing and look forward to the Minister of State's concluding remarks.</p>  <p>  I will touch on a couple of matters that have already been raised by other Deputies in this debate, and I was fortunate to have the time to sit in for a little longer than usual.  Before speaking to any other matter, I note the most important result of this European Council meeting is the final agreement on the multi-annual financial framework and the funding it will provide over the next few years throughout the Union.  Where we see real importance and power with this is in the Covid-19 recovery fund and the collective desire and will of the entire Union to see an equal recovery across it.  It is so vital to every member state, and not just those which have seen the most impact by the Covid pandemic, and we are all in this together.  We all have that shared responsibility.</p>  <p>  The ability of the European Central Bank now to issue eurobonds is important to provide that level of solidarity among member states.  A Covid recovery needs a collective approach, as other Deputies have mentioned, with a proper equitable roll-out of a vaccine from the five vaccines secured by the European Commission heretofore.  I welcome the Government's vaccine roll-out plan, which was announced yesterday, and I look forward to seeing that being taken up on a European level.</p>  <p>  An element of reality must be added to this debate.  Many people got very excited a week or so ago when the UK launched its vaccine slightly prematurely.  People thought it was the start of the process but the number of vaccines made available was in the tens of thousands as opposed to the tens of millions.  We need to be realistic, fair and straight with people that all these vaccines are not going to come in the next fortnight or month.  All of us have a personal responsibility in social distancing, mask wearing, limiting contacts and hand hygiene.  Everything is so important, not just through the festive period but for many weeks and months to come.</p>  <p>  The second aspect of this budget is also very important and it demonstrates the power and strength of acting as a Union of 27 member states rather than simply one member state, or even a small member state, as in the case of Ireland.  This is the Green New Deal and the very ambitious targets that have been set by the Union.  It is therefore important that this Government continues to work with European partners to pursue such matters.  This might include the Celtic interconnector linking Ireland and France for the purposes of energy supply or drawing down resources from the European Investment Bank to have proper approaches to the green development of our economy.</p>  <p>  Another aspect is difficult for us who are members of Fine Gael.  Deputy Smith made reference to the European People's Party and the ongoing connection of the group to Fidesz.  I want to be clear on the floor of the D&aacute;il that although Fidesz is currently suspended from the European People's Party, it is my very strong feeling it should be expelled and that process should be expedited.  When it comes to the rule of law, the actions of both the Hungarian and Polish Governments have been absolutely deplorable.  I welcome the funding stream and compromise of the budget but I regret that the rule of law aspects of this budget are not strong enough.</p>  <p>  In saying this I give credit to the Minister of State for his comments at the Institute of International and European Affairs LGBTI+ event this week.  It is important to see Ireland standing at the top table of the EU when it comes to the rule of law and rights of women, the LGBTI+ community, minorities or anybody who comes in.  We must truly believe in that Europe of equals and equal opportunities.</p>  <p>  One aspect that has not really been referred to in much depth is the conclusions of the European Council on security and the commitment of the European Council to double down on the levels of police and judicial co-operation across the Union.  That applies to areas such as data sharing and the sharing of information to deal with dissident terrorist groups.  Unfortunately, we know much about them on this island.  There is also the question of the fundamentalist terrorists who have been active across Europe, and we send solidarity to all member state colleagues who have been a victim of any terrorist atrocity.</p>  <p>  There is also the question of organised crime.  We will debate legislation later in the D&aacute;il relating to money laundering and counterfeiting and how this is factored into the activities of so many organised crime groups across the Continent.  Organised criminals simply do not recognise borders, which we have seen both in the form of money laundering and new approaches to using cryptocurrency.</p>  <p>  Yesterday there was the conviction of a certain individual in the Irish courts for money laundering to fund ongoing drug cartel activity in this State.  This activity is fuelled by narcotics, weapons, information and, crucially, funding from across the European Union.  If we are absolutely serious about tackling organised crime and the high level criminals who are absolutely terrorising our streets, piling misery on so many households that are pumped full of drugs, weapons, extortion practices and violence, we need to see a level of European co-operation.  We must ensure the level of co-operation on security in the EU as a whole, along with the United Kingdom, is maintained post Brexit.</p>  <p>  The House of Commons intelligence and security committee still receives reports of a severe level of threat from dissident terrorism in Northern Ireland.  We must also see the importance of cross-territorial communication and co-operation between police forces and security agencies in tackling organised crime.</p>  <p>  I will devote approximately 90 seconds to Brexit and this is not much less than the level of discussion of the subject at the European Council meeting.</p> <p>I believe it was ten minutes all-in over dinner.  The Minister might be able to go into a bit more detail, not necessarily on the formal discussions but on the informal conversations that happened on the margins either between himself and his other ministerial colleagues, the Taoiseach or with officials, about the state of play in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p> I welcome the comments by President von der Leyen this morning in the European Parliament that there is a pathway, albeit a narrow one, to a Brexit deal.  It behoves all of the actors in this process, both British and European, to dedicate all of their energy to securing a Brexit deal in the coming days.  To be honest, any such deal will not be good for Ireland, the EU or the United Kingdom but it will limit the damage.  A no-deal scenario is so unbearably awful for all actors that it is important that we secure a deal, even if it is a thin one.  Having a trade deal with the UK is of vital importance to so many workers and businesses across this country.  I look forward to contributing tomorrow evening to the discussion on Brexit preparedness.  Even as we go into recess for Christmas, I hope that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas are kept fully abreast of any new developments in the negotiations and hopefully a post-Brexit agreement.</p></speech>

When I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I was lucky enough to get involved in a group, along with Deputy Michael Collins, that helped me to transport people from Limerick to Belfast for cataract surgery.  Today I heard the Taoiseach saying that he does not know if this will continue after Brexit.  He could not give us a definite answer on that.  I asked earlier this week about the management of our hospitals.  If the proper structures were in place, we would not have to bring people to Northern Ireland for operations.  There is no structure there.  I have raised the issue of an audit of hospital management in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, which has the highest number of patients on trolleys.  It is not the care provided in the hospital that is the problem, it is the management.  There is no structure.  We have all of the investment and top of the range equipment required but the management is wrong and needs to be fixed.  The HSE made a statement about nurses being bullied who then left their jobs.  This is an issue with management and structure.</p>  <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is renewable energy which is being pushed down our throats.  We are hearing nothing but electric cars here and electric cars there.  How can we have electric vehicles in this country when we have no charging infrastructure?  We do not have the infrastructure to build houses, including sewage systems and we have no charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in rural Ireland.  All that the Government has done is raise taxes on fuel.  Who uses the most fuel in this country?  It is people from rural settings with no infrastructure.  How does the Government look after us?  It raises taxes on the people who have to use the most fuel.  The people who use it the most are the same people who have no infrastructure.  Where are the taxes spent?  They are spent in areas where the Government wants to have more infrastructure, namely in cities like Dublin.  The Government must give us back our money.  It must invest in infrastructure in rural Ireland and rural Limerick and stop spending our money, raised by taxing us to death, elsewhere.  It must give us infrastructure so we can have the same quality of life as others.</p></speech>

The Minister is well aware, given his own constituency, of the negative effects of Brexit on Irish agriculture.  A recent report from the Central Bank indicates that beef and sheep farmers will be the most economically vulnerable and that up to one third of Irish farmers could be forced out of business.</p><p>I am also very worried about the negotiations on fishing rights in Europe at this time.  I raised this matter last week with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I asked, in the context of the 18% figure referred to by Mr. Michel Barnier in his negotiations with the UK, where that percentage of the catch was coming from.  They failed to give me an answer but it is quite clear that these fish will be coming from Irish waters.  I asked the Taoiseach today why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not involved in these negotiations and he told me that I cannot expect all 27 states to get involved but I certainly do expect the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to be involved.  Irish fish will be taken out of our waters, our seas will be attacked and our Taoiseach will stand idly by and allow that to happen.  We stand to lose 18% of our fish or possibly more.  God only knows what is on the table right now but we have no Minister at the table.  The other member states are not offering their fish.  The French, Spanish and others are fishing in our waters because they have no fish in their own waters.  They are taking our fish and now we are handing more over.  We have done this for decades without any consideration of Irish fishermen.  I called for a minister for fisheries during the negotiations to form a Government but that call was rejected and we are going to pay a heavy price in this country for that.</p><p>Finally, I wish to speak about the EU cross-border directive which was also raised by Deputies O'Donoghue and Brendan Smith.  The cross-Border healthcare initiative is excellent.  Obviously the ideal cure for all of these things is in our own jurisdiction but that is not happening.  The Taoiseach said earlier today that approximately 7,000 people crossed the Border for healthcare.  We need a seamless transition <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>that scheme.  We cannot have a situation where there is a different wording and people are left waiting for longer.  People are suffering; they are going blind and are living in pain.  We need the cross-border directive to continue to function.  I accept that it is an EU directive but we need a new initiative to be put in place so that people from the Republic of Ireland can go to the North and have procedures carried out to save their eyesight.  That must continue and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  Some Fine Gael politicians have said that it is sorted and that we are wasting our time jumping up and down about it.  Other Ministers are saying that it is not sorted and I respect what they are saying.  I do not think it is sorted but it might be sorted in the days ahead.  I would appreciate a comment from the Minister on that.</p></speech>

What strikes me about how the conclusions are presented is the unnecessary language used.  Do the European Council, the European Commission and other EU bodies ever produce materials in accessible format?  We hear about civic engagement and involving citizens in our democracies, yet reports are produced in a way that prevents people from understanding what is going on.  If these reports were written in plain English and plain languages, it would make a lot of sense.  Our legislative and policy processes can exclude people and make it seem that local, national and European issues are not matters for them.  I know that parliamentary language must be used but there should also be concurrent, accessible information for people who are interested.</p>  <p>  The Council dealt with Covid-19, climate change, security and external relations.  Section 2 in the conclusions relates to Covid-19 and the advance purchase agreements.  The Council has invited the Commission to present a proposal on rapid antigen tests and the mutual recognition of test results.  It is welcome that the Council is looking for a co-ordinated approach around vaccination certificates and common frameworks.  It makes sense to work together on this if we want to re-open cross-border tourism which is vitally important.</p>  <p>  Section 3 on climate change talks about delivering in the most cost-effective manner possible.  Earlier this morning, I spoke about the &euro;50 million that the Irish Government is spending on statistical transfers of renewable energy for missing our own targets.  Our climate change actions will not be cost-effective for us if we keep missing our binding targets.  The Commission has also been asked to bring forward a proposal on a possible EU green bond standard and to look at ways to strengthen the EU's emissions trading system.</p>  <p>  Section 4 deals with security.  Points 25 and 26 of this section reference the importance of preventing radicalisation online.  There are calls for illegal online content to be addressed, as well as the dissemination of terrorist content online.  The Council called for support for initiatives to understand better the spread of extremist ideologies.  This is a very important issue and is connected to the measures that will be taken around Covid-19 and vaccinating the population.  The rise of conspiracy theories as well as anti-mask and anti-lockdown protests across Europe have links with the far right and must be addressed.  However, I do not think the far right is the intended target here and I ask the Minister to tell us what is the target.</p></speech>

One was to circumvent and hollow out democratic debate.  Parliamentary majorities were used to ensure that debate was stymied and that issues were not properly debated.  The second method was to appoint cronies as judges.  On the first point, I will return to the issue that 55 minutes was given to this Parliament to debate the ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  That has now been pulled to spare the blushes of the Green Party.  I hope we will have a proper debate next time and the Green Party will not sell out its principles for another cycle path somewhere.  Cycle paths are important but some elements of CETA are deeply problematic.  Yesterday, I heard the Taoiseach babbling about Se&aacute;n Lemass, a man I greatly admire.  I use the word "babbling" because he equated Se&aacute;n Lemass's favouring of multilateralism with what is happening with CETA.  CETA is not about the pooling of sovereignty between member states but about the dilution of state sovereignty by corporate power, particularly through the investment court system envisaged in the agreement.</p> <p> I also oppose CETA because it envisages the importation of beef from Canada into the European Union.  Canada, of course, does not outlaw the hormone treatment of cattle.  While it is clear under the agreement that beef imported must be hormone-free, how does one ascertain whether hormones were administered to 30-month-old steers when they were calves of just a couple of weeks old?  It is simply not possible.  </p> <p> The Mercosur agreement must also be dealt with.  We have seen leaks from EU diplomats to the effect that we need assurances from South American states, and Brazil in particular, that the price of producing cheap beef will not be the destruction of Amazonian jungle or rainforest, because that is what is happening.  As we risk losing some of our market in Britain as it gains the ability to conclude free trade agreements with other countries, there will be pressure on our beef sector.  I am certainly opposed to the import of beef from South America or Canada into Europe at this time because it will put further pressure on European farmers, and Irish farmers in particular.</p></speech>

In the past, I have just answered questions as they arose, which I will do for the next five minutes.  I will then be happy to take questions.</p>  <p>  I will go through some of the points that have been raised.  If I heard her correctly, Deputy McDonald spoke about the protocol's full implementation or operation being dependent on a wider free trade agreement.  I want to be clear that the Northern Ireland protocol to the withdrawal agreement was designed to be an evergreen solution which would operate with or without a trade deal.  It would clearly be less complex with a trade deal, but it will operate regardless.  I compliment the work of the EU and British negotiators in making sure that protocol will be fully implemented.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brady raised a number of issues.  The Welsh border situation and general preparedness in Britain are of great concern to us.  Traders are telling us that they are not convinced that their counterparts in Great Britain are fully prepared.  There is not a whole lot we can do about that from this side other than to keep talking about it and to make our voices heard as strongly as possible.  We are trying to do the best we can within our own system.  There is a lot of talk about green lanes and green lights.  There may not be a physical green lane in France, but there should be a green light system on an app with regard to customs checks for goods coming through the land bridge.  Trucks coming to Ireland through Holyhead about which customs officials have no concerns will effectively get a green light on an app telling the drivers that they do not have to go through customs when they arrive at Dublin or Rosslare.  There are high-tech solutions on this side to make sure this will be as seamless as possible.  If customs officials have concerns about trucks or want to investigate particular shipments, the drivers will get a red light and will have to go to the relevant facility.  There are ways to follow that up.  The system is designed to make matters as seamless as possible on this side.  </p>  <p>  I do not know what the situation is in Britain other than what we and our diplomats are hearing and what is being announced publicly.  We are working very closely with the French to ensure that issues on that side with regard to goods leaving Ireland destined for the European Union can be cleared.  I have met a number of significant traders in this country who have told me they are abandoning the land bridge entirely and are moving towards direct ferries.  I listened very carefully to what Deputy Howlin said and there certainly is a lot of demand for the many new direct services that are operating.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the issue of the rule of law, as did Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, Deputy Richmond and, I am sure, many others.  It is a really important issue.  It should be noted that this is the first time that EU funding has been conditional on respect for the rule of law.  That is in place.  It is not perfect but it is as agreed at the European Council and at the European Parliament.  We have not rolled back on that.  It is happening and, in my opinion, it is very welcome.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan was concerned that it may have been more about fighting corruption but corruption is one of the big problems in some of these countries.  Issues regarding the rule of law allow for corruption.  We need to look at the issue very carefully.</p>  <p>  On the cross-border healthcare directive, I will defer to what the Taoiseach said.  It raises extremely complex issues.  It is correct to say that they have not been resolved yet.  Britain has decided to leave the European Union and that presents a problem regarding access to that particular scheme.  There will be no difficulties with what is called cross-border healthcare.  If one is in Britain or the North and has an emergency, one will be able to use the hospitals there.  That will not be an issue.  As things stand, one will not be able to arrange the type of treatments we currently arrange, but the Taoiseach is personally committed to overcoming the very genuine difficulties that exist in that regard.</p>  <p>  I heard what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about content moderators.  I will take that issue up with the Minister because I have serious concerns in that regard having read those particular articles.</p>  <p>  With regard to antigen testing, the Commission has published fantastic documents on what is happening on a co-ordinated basis.  Some Members will have read these.  Antigen testing is very useful but it is not the panacea some present it as.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle raised issues of plain English.  It is something in which I am very interested.  The classic example of bad English for me is the name CETA for the Canada-EU trade agreement.  I would love to know who conceived of that particular title for the agreement because it makes the issue confusing and scary.  When 27 member states, the vast majority of whose representatives are not native English speakers, are trying to negotiate wording and unanimously agree on something, as they did on climate change, throughout the night, the results may end up being a little bit complex to read.  It is the result of a multilingual democratic process.  Perhaps it is something that could be looked at.</p></speech>

I believe the Minister of State has also said that he expects us to get the lion's share of this &euro;5 billion.  I know that the French, under President Macron, have their eyes on this fund.  They expect to use it to look after their fishermen.</p> <p>What actions is the Government taking to ensure we get a just amount given the serious impact Brexit will have on economic sectors across the board? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600043#QQ00200"><p>That point was raised during the debate and I did not get to everything, so I am glad to have this opportunity.  The Brexit adjustment reserve is part of the overall budgetary proposals for the next seven years and the recovery fund.  Progress on it was to some extent held up because of the situation pertaining to Hungary and Poland which put a veto on an own-resources position until that was resolved last week.  That issue was resolved, and the European budget process could then move forward, including the Brexit adjustment reserve.  Progress was stalled on that, but it is now back in action.</p>  <p>  I give full credit to the Taoiseach and his then Belgian counterpart, the former Prime Minister of Belgium, Sophie Wilm&egrave;s.  Interestingly she is only a couple of years older than I am and she was in intensive care for a couple of weeks with Covid-19, which is a salutary lesson as to how devastating that disease is.  I am delighted to see her back in action; she is now deputy prime minister.  She worked with the Taoiseach during the summer to ensure the Brexit adjustment was in the conclusions.  Belgium and to a much greater extent Ireland are the two countries most affected by Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Brexit adjustment reserve states that the &euro;5 billion is to be shared out among the member states and sectors most adversely affected by Brexit.  Despite the Hungarian and Polish veto situation, which is now over, our officials have been in contact with our counterparts and have discussed it.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have been in touch with Commissioner Hahn, and the Taoiseach has been in touch with the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, expressing our concerns.  We need the fund to be flexible and available quickly.  We need to be able to react to help the sectors affected in the new year.  Those are our concerns and our officials have been working very hard on this.</p>  <p>  I had understood the Commission would publish a proposal within days, but that is not the official note I have so I will not state that definitively on the record.  I certainly understood it was to happen very quickly once the budget was resolved last week.  Much of the background work has been done and we will decide how that gets spent once the allocation key is announced.  That is in addition to what the Government has allocated in the budget, which was based on a no-deal scenario and in addition to other funding coming from the European Union in the coming years.  Clearly, we are hoping for a trade deal - we make no bones about that - to minimise the impact of Brexit.</p></speech>

It has been widely reported that the French are looking to use that reserve to offset losses in the fishing industry.  Does that mean that fishing has been sold out and gone as a result of Brexit?  Ultimately, we will go along with what the French decide because I imagine we will not fight for the fishing industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600043#QQ00500"><p>One of the reasons fishing is such a difficult issue to resolve is because the British place a higher priority on it.  They see these as their seas and when they leave the European Union as they see it, they will keep all their seas.  That is what some of the hard Brexiteers see.  They may not understand the other side - that they need to export their fish.</p>  <p>  It is taking so long because the Irish and French positions on the issue of fish have been unified.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue and the rest of the Government, including the Taoiseach, have taken a very strong line with Michel Barnier to ensure that our fishers, small and large but particularly small fishers, and those fishing communities are protected from the impact of Brexit.  We have been at one with, not just our colleagues in France, but also with our colleagues from Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.  Germany is also in that mix on the North Sea.  We stand together and work together.  There is an informal group for which fishing is a big issue.</p>  <p>  Clearly it is an enormous issue for us, which is why it is at the top of the agenda here.  Negotiations are taking place to ensure our fishers and our fishing industry do not suffer unfairly because of Brexit.  That was a big risk at the outset when Britain decided to leave.  Simply because we fish in much of its waters, we want to be as fair as possible.  This is so difficult precisely because those communities and people who depend on fishing for their livelihoods deserve and need protection.</p>  <p>  British fishers and British fishing communities do not just need access to the seas, specifically the North Sea; they need markets in which to export their fish.  The British do not eat most of the shellfish, in particular, that they catch; it is sold into European markets.  I hope that is in their minds.  That European market is just as important for fish as the British market is for cars.</p>  <p>  I wish the negotiators well.  In know that Michel Barnier is fully apprised of the situation with Irish fishing communities as he is of French fishing communities.  I discuss these issues with my French colleagues regularly and we have full solidarity with fishing communities.  I look forward to a positive resolution to this, but it is a difficult issue.  Deputy Howlin expressed the situation with fish very bluntly a few weeks ago.  Let us see what the negotiations come back with.</p></speech>

I return to the point I made in my earlier remarks about keeping the Houses apprised of any developments, deal or no deal in the coming days when it comes to future relationship negotiations between the EU and the UK.  How will that be communicated, bearing in mind that we rise for the Christmas late tomorrow night?  Of course, we hope we will be learning details of a deal in due course.  We understand it is very much in the balance and we should not jump to conclusions.  Are there plans to convene a European Council meeting and how quickly could that happen?  Would it need to meet in person or would meeting virtually suffice?</p></speech>

To be fair to them, this is officially the format and was always the format when we sat in Leinster House, but we have not really stuck to that since we came to the convention centre for various reasons.  I find no fault in anyone who is not here to ask questions.  It could well be a better system, allowing more people to ask questions, but that is up to the D&aacute;il to decide.  I am only here to do what I am told to do.</p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond made a good point about the communication strategy.  Officials are working very hard on planning that.  I hope we will have a trade agreement and it may run to 1,000 pages, which will need to be translated into all our languages, including the Irish language.  We do not yet have any of the text of that trade agreement, formally or informally.  For negotiating purposes, it has not been published.  We know the big issues and the ones that are most intractable - the level playing field, fishing and governance.  However, there are many other items in that agreement, including security, police and judicial co-operation, which is not discussed but is probably critical to our friends in Britain; we will see.  Considerable planning is required, including planning my schedule and that of the officials particularly in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments to ensure that details are made available if an agreement is reached.  It will, of course, be published and available, but clearly people will want briefing notes and summaries of its contents.</p>  <p>  Most preparations that have been made for, and advice given about Brexit by the Irish Government, apply deal or no deal.  I appeared on "The Week in Politics" on Sunday.  Customs facilities have been built outside the port at Rosslare and in Dublin Port.  They apply, whether a deal is reached or not.  Companies will need to comply with extra bureaucratic hassle, deal or no deal.  Issues such as chilled prepared meats coming in from Britain will be affected, deal or no deal.  There will be many issues like that. </p> <p>That is all available on the Government website now, and businesses which might be affected need to read that information, if they have not already done so, because a deal will not affect it in any material way.  Those businesses also need to contact their British counterparts and ask them if they are also ready, in the context of Irish businesses wanting to continue trading with them.  Hopefully, there will be no tariffs, but Irish businesses will need to ask if the paperwork and supply lines of their British counterparts are in order.  Just yesterday, somewhat tragically, the makers of Hornby train sets, a well-known British company, whose train sets many of us might have had, stated that it will not be delivering orders outside of Britain before it sees how things are in the middle of January.  That is really an indictment of the preparations at a national level in the UK.  We must ensure that we are as best prepared as we can be, but all the information is available on the Government website.</p> <p> Turning to ratification, there are many different views and much speculation regarding this issue.  We should probably wait until the agreement is published and we see the proposals that come from the negotiators.  Clearly, we are clearly running out of time.  It was not envisaged, I think, that the agreement would go to national parliaments, although at some point, undoubtedly, I imagine the Government will seek a motion in the D&aacute;il on any trade agreement, even if that is not required.  The European Council will not have to meet physically.  Agreeing to any proposals can simply be done by written procedure or videoconference.  The European Parliament, however, will have to approve any deal.  If an agreement is reached, however, we think it is in everybody's interest that we do whatever is practicably possible in the most flexible manner to ensure there are no gaps or lacunae, and that it is implemented immediately on 1 January.</p></speech>

He seemed very relaxed in respect of Brexit.  When asked a question regarding Calais and difficulties with IT systems, however, one thing he said was that there had been some element of communication between the IMDO and the port of Calais.  Some of the difficulties indicated in the media in the past two weeks were not foreseen nor was how they will be sorted out.  I would like confirmation on that matter, if the Minister of State has any information in that regard.</p>  <p>  The other thing Mr. Lacey said was that market forces would sort everything out regarding Brexit preparations.  That was in stark contrast to several speakers at the transport committee, especially Mr. Eugene Drennan, who represents the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA.  He stated straight out that he believed there had been an insufficient number of meetings between the stakeholders.  Perhaps there is a necessity at State level to make that happen and to ensure that the ferry companies are talking to the ports companies and hauliers, and that they are all talking to those business sectors which sometimes require just-in-time delivery and other alternatives.</p>  <p>  Traffic has been highlighted as a major difficulty which will affect the ports, particularly three or four ferries arriving at the same time.  They come in at the same time because businesses want their goods to land at particular times.  It was accepted an adjustment was needed, but I am afraid of just leaving it to the market and a disaster occurring on 1 January.  I state that in the context of accepting that we do not know what kind of Brexit there is going to be, other than that there is going to be major change.  Is there anything we can do to mitigate that situation at this stage and could the State involve itself in doing any of that?</p>  <p>  The question I have concerns the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  At one stage, there was talk about the connection with rule of law issues, particularly regarding Poland and Hungary, and I believe further issues should be involved in that regard.  I think Angela Merkel said at a COSAC meeting that there was a difficulty in respect of European directives.  Is that a matter at which we can look in the future?  I ask that because obviously the European Union is like everything else, in that leverage is needed to deal with what is basically political wrongdoing on a major level in respect of something which is utterly unacceptable to the ethos of the European Union.</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said regarding fisheries.  Mentioning France again, there was a fear in recent weeks that the French, and President Macron in particular, were talking about the need for the French to have a great deal of the Brexit adjustment fund.  Has there been much discussion in that regard and do we have any clarity on that aspect?  In that context, we have always said that no one is going to suffer, for want of a better term, more than us from a bad Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600044#RR00300"><p>On the matter of the Brexit adjustment reserve, I said what I have said.  We have been working closely with the European Commission to express our concerns about Brexit, which are well known.  The fund was devised by Ireland and Belgium, although I am certain we will not be the only countries to avail of it.  I think, however, that we should be pretty satisfied when the proposal comes through but that will be in addition to provision we have made ourselves.</p>  <p>  Regarding traffic at Dublin Port, there is a contingency traffic management plan, and there have been some references in the media in that regard.  I will, however, get a copy sent out to the Deputies.  The plan involves the various stakeholders coming together.  Clearly, though, there can be difficulties sometimes when it is a matter of dealing with private limited companies, as they are not public companies.  A great deal of work has been done, however, and we are hoping these types of contingency measures will not be needed to the extent we have been talking about.  They must be created, however.</p>  <p>  Part of this context is that a great deal of the customs checks which will be done will be paper-based.  When I say paper-based, I mean online.  Documentary is a better term, I suppose.  It will only be necessary in a minority of cases for officials to check products.  In the vast majority of cases, the lorry drivers will get a green light on the app and will just drive out of the port without doing anything, because the proper checks will already have been done.  If there are concerns, however, and Revenue, the Department of Health and-or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have reason to check particular shipments, they will do that and the lorry driver will get a red light.</p>  <p>  For anybody listening, regarding shipping capacity, the new services which have started to offer direct links to the Continent are doing really well and have a high level of reservations.  For any shipping companies thinking of starting new services between Ireland and the Continent, those new services have been really successful so far and have a large number of bookings.  We strongly encourage people in that industry to look at this possibility.  As I said earlier, I met some significant traders in this country who are completely abandoning the land bridge.  Despite the direct service to Dunkirk, for example, in theory being significantly longer, the certainty and the lack of bureaucracy and traffic that route offers certainly means a great deal to traders.  Anyone who has driven across the land bridge, perhaps returning from a vacation, will know it is possible to be stuck in traffic on some of the roads through Britain.  More and more traders, therefore, will now look favourably on the new routes.</p>  <p>  Turning to the issue of the rule of law, there should be a debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  I said that previously, and I will try to arrange it because we need to have a strong voice in all these issues.  Generally speaking, however, the adoption of the rule of law mechanism has been welcomed as a step forward in enhancing and encouraging the rule of law across Europe.  We all have our part to play and it is not just going to be on this matter as there are many different mechanisms.</p></speech>

From an earlier debate, we are aware that we are relying on Denmark and Estonia to bail us out in that regard.  What discussions happened on the sides of the European Council meeting, if any, with representatives from Denmark and Estonia to see if they will bail us out again in future?</p></speech>

There were many side discussions, mainly involving the Taoiseach, to be fair, because it was a meeting of leaders.  The meeting continued throughout the night to try to reach an agreement on this issue.  Again, nothing is ever perfect when 27 member states are around the table, but it is a hugely significant step forward.  I look forward to the European Union working together.  From these conclusions, the Commission will then publish its plans during the year.</p>  <p>  Those will marry very much with what we are doing on climate change.  Despite what Deputy O'Donoghue said about renewable energy being forced on all of us, it is absolutely necessary that we adopt it because we do not want force dirty smoke on people.  The key aspect is that there is a transition, and some people will be adversely affected by that transition and they need help.  That is the message from this Government and the European Union, and it is one of the issues which I talk about with my colleagues.</p> <p>That is a key focus not just of the climate change policy, but of budgetary policy as well.</p></speech>

It is important that I read the script.  It deals with issues that the Taoiseach promised I would raise and it is important the D&aacute;il be apprised of them.  I thank everybody for their participation in the debate.</p>  <p>  On 8 December, I participated in a meeting of European affairs ministers online, where we prepared the agenda for the European Council of leaders.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to have side discussions when a meeting is held online.  We had a good discussions on Covid, the MFF recovery package and climate.  We were briefed by Michel Barnier and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efƒçoviƒç on the state of play of the negotiations with the UK, the trade agreement, the future relationship agreement and the withdrawal agreement as well.  The Taoiseach reported on these items in his opening remarks this afternoon and I have replied to a number of follow-up questions on those issues too.  These are the most exciting issues with which Europe is dealing now in terms of the difference it can make for people in regard to the serious problems they face, including the Covid life and death situation, the MFF, which is about the life and death for our economy, and climate life and death issues.  The European Union is coming together, which is a complicated process in that there are 27 member states involved, to get real answers and solutions for our citizens across the Continent.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I met other European Union affairs ministers and we discussed security, the fight against terrorism and violent extremism.  We also discussed relations with the so-called southern neighbourhood, which is the countries bordering the southern and eastern edge of the Mediterranean, relations with Turkey and EU-US relations as well.  All of these issues were then subsequently on the agenda of EU leaders, which included the Taoiseach, when they met in the European Council last Thursday, throughout the night until about 11 o'clock on Friday morning.  EU leaders reiterated their condemnation of recent terrorist attacks in France and Austria and welcomed the presentation by the Commission of a new EU agenda for counter-terrorism.  </p>  <p>  Among the issues discussed was the need to tackle the dissemination of terrorist content online.  Ireland agrees there is a pressing need to advance work on this issue.  We strongly support efforts to progress this matter.  I heard what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about the workers who have to deal with this type of content and I take on board his point.  The leaders also discussed how to facilitate closer co-operation between law enforcement and judicial authorities, both online and offline. </p>  <p>  On the southern partnership, EU leaders agreed in October to discuss relations with the southern neighbourhood.  In the time ahead, the Commission and High Representative Borrell will make proposals for a renewed partnership on Libya.  The European Council recalled the offer to support the Libyan coastguard through training and monitoring, as well as the provision of equipment and vessels in accordance with international law.  </p>  <p>  In regard to Turkey, before the next European Council in March 2021 High Representative Borrell and the Commission will compile a report on the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and EU-Turkey relations.  They will present options on how to proceed, including the possible extension of restrictive measures.  I welcome that High Representative Borrell will also forward a proposal for a multilateral conference on the eastern Mediterranean and I welcome the commentary of the incoming US Government around its commitment to multilateralism, in which Ireland has always been very proud to be involved.  We want to see the development of a more stable and constructive relationship with Turkey, but for this to occur, Turkey needs to actively engage in finding solutions to current tensions, in addition to refraining from negative and provocative actions for a sustained period.  Ireland stands firmly with Greece and Cyprus and what they have to suffer at this time.</p>  <p>  On EU-US relations, the leaders took the opportunity of their first meeting in person since the presidential election in the United States to consider relations with the US.  Ireland hopes to play an important role.  The European Council highlighted the importance of a strong strategic transatlantic partnership in light of the need to tackle pressing global challenges.  The Taoiseach has noted the opportunity to reset relations with the US and to work closely with President-elect Biden, who shares the EU's commitment to multilateralism.  Ireland will play its part in making the connections and building that partnership between the EU and the incoming Biden Administration.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the issues I have already mentioned, EU leaders emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety of the Belarusian nuclear power plant at Astravets.  The Commission will investigate possible measures to prevent commercial electricity imports from nuclear facilities in third countries if they do not meet EU safety standards.  EU leaders welcomed the adoption by foreign ministers earlier last week of an EU global human rights sanctions regime.  They also agreed that sanctions on Russia should be rolled over on 31 January.</p>  <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir as ceisteanna t&aacute;bhachtacha a chur orm agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go raibh m&eacute; in ann na freagra&iacute; cu&iacute; a thabhairt ar ais d&oacute;ibh.

Pretty much everyone in the Chamber will be familiar with the area and may think of it as a shopping destination, but those who know the city and county a little longer will know that it is very much an established community with an extremely large population.  Not only is it large, it is set to increase by 44% by 2040, with the development of 4,500 new homes forecast, including 250 homes in Fernbank, 90 homes in Herbert Hill, the recently granted strategic housing development, SHD, in Dundrum Town Centre and, most important, the forthcoming development of the Central Mental Hospital site by the Land Development Agency, which will bring more than 1,200 social, affordable and private homes to the area.</p>  <p>  The area requires more supports, amenities and services to support this growth and allow the town to become a true community.  Funding has been applied for by the county council under the urban regeneration and development fund to improve the civic and cultural facilities in this area.  The uses for the community hub would be flexible to suit the needs of the community but are proposed to include a family resource centre, a civic plaza, a caf&eacute;, a positive ageing space, offices, a performance space and more.  It would be set within the civic centre and the existing Carnegie library, which is an extremely famous and much-cherished structure in the area for many of us.</p>  <p>  The move towards apartment living to help increase our housing supply in an efficient manner will increase the demand for community, cultural and civic spaces.  We absolutely welcome the new members of our community, and the diversity in age and background they bring is most welcome.  However, we must ensure the community resources are in place to support these new neighbours and allow them to become fully immersed in our community.  We must cater to the existing population of Dundrum as well as the new cohort of residents who will arrive and expand their families over the coming years.  There has been a lack of intergenerational mixing in the area over recent years, which would be addressed by these services.  This project is the ideal way to address that as well as to encourage community involvement in people who may not be able to afford private clubs or facilities, especially given the financial toll the pandemic has had on so many in our communities.  Family centres, facilities for the elderly, and libraries will all work in tandem to facilitate all members of the community and draw all cohorts closer together.</p>  <p>  The Dundrum civic offices have been in place for over five years and are simply not customer focused.  As the Minister of State understands better than most, with the changing role of local government and the nature of engagement between citizens and local government, we must prioritise the accessibility of these services and ensure they are fit for purpose.  By ensuring that these services are located in a focal point of the community, they will be in a position to serve the community for decades to come.  The provision of libraries, community spaces for all ages and crucial council services is invaluable and cannot be overstated.</p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to prioritise the funding for this project, one that will be so appreciated, not only by the community in Dundrum, but the wider communities going into Churchtown, Windy Arbour, Ballinteer, Kilmacud and Goatstown.  It is very important that we remember back to 15 or 20 years ago when there was a roar of development across the country, but especially the south County Dublin constituency that I represent.  For so many years, people were moving into new homes, apartments and houses, only to be completely robbed of those vital community facilities.  It is not good enough to build those facilities after the homes: we need to pre-plan and ensure that the community and civic hubs are there.  That is why I raise this with the Minister of State.  I hope that he and the Government will look on this favourably.</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040, which was launched by the Government on 16 February 2018, is the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period 2018 to 2027, the national development plan, NDP, 2018-27, and the 20-year national planning framework, NPF.</p>  <p>  The principles of the NPF are underpinned by the NDP, a ten-year, &euro;116 billion capital investment programme.  The NDP established four new funds, with a combined allocation of &euro;4 billion to 2027.  The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, has an allocation of &euro;2 billion to 2027, primarily to support the NPF&rsquo;s growth enablers for the five cities and other large urban centres.</p>  <p>  The URDF, which was launched in 2018, is providing part-funding for local authority-led projects that will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns, while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.</p>  <p>  Too many of our large towns and cities have been blighted by rundown and poorly utilised areas.  Through URDF support local authorities now have the opportunity to embrace the challenge to harness the untapped potential of these areas so that they contribute positively to our urban communities.</p>  <p>  The URDF supported capital programme has been very well received, and already the URDF is providing assistance for this pipeline of major projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns.  For the first time, the URDF provides planning authorities with the opportunity to coordinate their planned regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities with a stream of tailored significant Exchequer capital investment which will ensure that the right project is happening in the right place at the right time.</p>  <p>  In 2019, approval in principle and provisional funding allocations issued in respect of the 87 major projects across the country, including a project for Dundrum, which was approved under call 1.  Some &euro;65,679 in URDF support was allocated to support the development of a community, cultural and civic action plan for Dundrum, to assess the current situation and make recommendations on future requirements.  It is understood that the work has recently been completed on the action plan and my Department has requested a copy for review.</p>  <p>  Under call 2 of the URDF, launched earlier this year, 76 proposals were received, with every local authority submitting at least one application, including a proposal from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for further support in respect of the Dundrum community, cultural and civic action hub.  Many of the proposals received under call 2 are of significant scale and complexity and require careful evaluation and this process is in train.</p>  <p>  I hear Deputy Richmond's very strong case for this specific project.  I look forward to working with him on this.  The URDF funding is very important for unlocking the potential of our areas and ensuring that they can be developed in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all.  I assure him that his case will be taken on board both by myself and the departmental officials.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate the initial response from his Department under call 1 and very much welcome consideration under call 2.  It is important to stress how vital this funding is.  Dundrum is not a small town, it is a very large town with a population of tens of thousands.  Most people might associate it with a gleaming shopping centre which is wonderfully maintained by a very dedicated staff, but it is home to many.  For two decades, there has been an issue where outside of the gleaming town centre so many other aspects of the town have been neglected.  The main street is no longer a gleaming thoroughfare and an older shopping centre is still there.  There is great concern about how run down are the residential and public spaces surrounding the new shopping centre.  Dundrum is a populous town which is an economic driver in the area.  It is the main source of rates for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area which straddles two D&aacute;il constituencies, with a sizeable population of commuters as well as those who work and are educated locally.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Imagine Dundrum, a group of activists from across the town, some who have only lived there a couple of years and others whose family have been there for generations, because this is not a young town.  It is important that there is joined up thinking so that the increased residential development is partnered with a civic, community plan such as this to ensure that the current residents do not simply live in empty houses close to a shopping centre but that they live in a community.</p></speech>

It gives me an opportunity to commend all the local authorities such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for bringing forward such quality projects to bring life into these very important areas.  Deputy Richmond clearly outlined Dundrum's scale and potential and how this project is key to unlocking its potential.  I look forward to working with him in coming weeks, in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.  These projects are the life blood of our communities.  This is an unprecedented opportunity to unlock that potential.  I assure the Deputy that the merits of the project will be brought to the Department's attention as we finalise the assessment process.</p></speech>

I have put it down for the lottery five or six times.  Spina bifida affects about one in every 1,000 children born in Ireland.  For reasons still unknown, Ireland has one of the world's highest rates of spina bifida.  As a result, there are children who are waiting for complicated surgeries and procedures for some time.  They are waiting for life-changing surgeries, often in pain.  They often need surgery to ease their suffering and to make their daily life and that of their families and carers a little easier.  We are very lucky to have excellent voluntary supports for those effected by the condition, with organisations such as the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association doing tremendous work for these families.  It understands the complexities of the condition and provides support and advocacy for families.  One such family who have found themselves at their wits end is the family of Ois&iacute;n Halpenny.  I want to raise his case with the Minister of State.  Ois&iacute;n is a six-year old boy from County Louth who has spina bifida.  I know Ois&iacute;n and his mother, who is related to my wife, R&oacute;is&iacute;n.  Ois&iacute;n's mother, Kelly, has told me that he has been on a waiting list since March 2018, which is almost three years ago.  This is for necessary surgery needed to help Ois&iacute;n in his day-to-day life.</p> <p>In November last year, Ois&iacute;n's ankles had deteriorated and the family was told that the operation now needed was a Grice procedure and a Russian transfer.  The family was informed that this might change as his ankles deteriorated even more.  His parents were told time and again that the surgery was scheduled only for it to be rescheduled and pushed out.</p> <p> My question is whether Ois&iacute;n's family is going to have to wait until the next stage of his deterioration for the surgery to happen, which may be too late.  At that point, the doctors may need to go back to the drawing board and recommend another type of surgery, which will cause an inevitable further delay.  I have raised this matter through parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who said in his response that he would review the case.  I was also told that Covid-19 had impacted on scheduled surgeries.  The Government needs to look at how the scheduling of urgent surgeries is being handled and to rethink how those surgeries can be carried out safely and quickly, even in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p> Will the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, review Ois&iacute;n's case and work to ensure he gets his surgery scheduled as soon as possible?  On the wider issue, will they undertake to review the waiting lists for children with spina bifida, who are waiting on surgeries in Temple Street hospital and other hospitals?  I am told by Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, SBHI, that the main issues for children requiring essential services such as orthopaedics and urology is that there simply are not enough resources within the health system to look after them properly.  This means that children like Ois&iacute;n are left to live with unnecessary pain and disfigurement, a dynamic that affects their physical and mental well-being in a key phase of their development.  We need enough consultants and we need those consultants to have the theatre time required to operate.  We need a system to co-ordinate services in order that children with complex needs are not treated by each healthcare professional in isolation but are cared for by a multidisciplinary team which gives every child with spina bifida the best chance of reaching his or her full potential.  Will the Minister of State work to ensure that consultants, theatres and slots are prioritised for children with spina bifida-related surgeries, treatments and other supports?</p></speech>

The Minister and I sincerely regret that children can experience a long waiting time for appointments and treatment.  I am conscious of the burden this places on them and their families.  The Government's priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including children with a diagnosis of spina bifida.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Children's Health Ireland, CHI, had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity between March and May this year.  That decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team, in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization.  Since June, CHI has continued to re-establish services, following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols to ensure they are provided in a safe, clinically assigned and prioritised way.  CHI has advised my Department that orthopaedic surgery, and spinal surgery in particular, continues to be identified as a service priority.  It is of note that key social distancing measures and infection prevention and control requirements, such as the 2 m distancing rule, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures.  This has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.</p>  <p>  In terms of support for children with spina bifida and their families, under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 the HSE has provided funding of &euro;781,469 to SBHI this year.  In addition, also under section 39, the HSE has provided funding of &euro;127,000 to the Mid-West Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association this year.  A service level agreement between the HSE and SBHI is in place.  The role of the HSE is to provide a multidisciplinary team approach which includes provision of health and personal supports required by people with spina bifida and incorporates hospital, primary care and community services.  My Department recognises the great work done by SBHI in providing information, support and advice to people with spina bifida and-or hydrocephalus and their parents and carers, and in promoting social inclusion and equality for people with spina bifida and-or hydrocephalus in Irish society.  The SBHI represents more than 8,000 people nationwide, consisting of those with spina bifida and their parents, siblings, friends and carers.</p>  <p>  In regard to accessing scheduled care, officials in my Department remain in regular contact with both the HSE and CHI on waiting times for appointments and procedures across a wide range of specialties.  The boy in question, Ois&iacute;n, has been waiting for surgery since March 2018, as the Deputy outlined, and it has been scheduled and rescheduled.  I hope we will be able to get a review into his case and those of people in similar situations.  I will follow that up in the Department today.  The Minister is committed to ensuring transparency around the waiting times that children experience.  To that end, we welcome the work being undertaken by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to publish paediatric waiting lists for the first time.  The NTPF has advised my Department that it plans to have¬†that information publicly available in the first quarter of 2021.</p></speech>

In a reply to me in November, the Minister acknowledged that waiting times are often unacceptably long and that this places a burden on parents and families.  It is a huge burden and people are at their wits' end.  It is not just Ois&iacute;n's family but many others as well.  The Minister told me in his response to my parliamentary question that he had asked the HSE to investigate this case and issue a reply to me.  I still have not received that reply from the HSE and nor has Ois&iacute;n's family.  I am asking the Minister of State, as part of his commitment to take a personal interest in this case and to review it, to follow up on that and ensure a reply is issued by the HSE as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  This is a very serious case and it is unconscionable to leave wee Ois&iacute;n waiting any longer for surgery.  Every month that goes past, his situation gets worse.  I am asking the Minister of State, taking all the necessary Covid-19 precautions into consideration, to work with the HSE to ensure that he is given an urgent date for surgery and that the surgery is carried out.  In addition, as I have said, this is not just about Ois&iacute;n.  His situation is an example of what is happening.  Will the Minister of State ask his Department officials to work with the HSE to ensure the waiting times for spina bifida supports and treatments are reduced in order that children like Ois&iacute;n - little boys and girls - never have to suffer like this, when all they need is treatment and support?  Unfortunately, the system does not have the capacity to deliver that treatment in a timely and supportive way at this point in time.</p></speech>

Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a key commitment for the Government.  However, it is acknowledged that the challenges faced by the health system in 2020 are unlike¬†anything we have ever faced before.  We are very aware of the impact the Covid-19 crisis has¬†had on our health service and the delivery of scheduled care.  CHI's commitment to prioritise spinal surgery and find new ways to deliver care exemplifies the work undertaken by the HSE to provide care in a challenging Covid-19 environment.</p>  <p>  The Minister is committed to ensuring that access for children, including children with spina bifida, is improved.  CHI has advised the Department that its current level of activity is running at approximately 85% of pre-Covid levels.  CHI has increased the number of virtual clinics taking place to address outpatient waiting lists.¬† CHI is also maximising opportunities to use facilities, such as at Connolly hospital and HSE's Citywest facility, as alternative settings for clinics in order that timely appointments may be provided to patients.¬† Officials from my Department continue to engage on an ongoing basis with representatives from CHI and the HSE to monitor access to services, waiting lists and activity levels.</p> <p>The Department also welcomes the work undertaken by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to publish paediatric waiting lists and looks forward to seeing that project coming to fruition early next week.  I will follow up on the case of Ois&iacute;n and many other children and I hope to get back to the Deputy in the coming days.</p></speech>

I will speak slowly to let the figures sink in.  The outpatient waiting list for orthopaedic services at University Hospital Galway includes 6,487 patients.  Some 80 of those have been waiting for more than four years.  Some 292 patients have been waiting for between three and four years.  The inpatient waiting list has 1,390 patients.  In a letter dated 11 December I made representations for a specific patient and raised some general points.  The specific individual was put on the waiting list on 24 January this year.  They were categorised as "urgent" and told there was an 18-month waiting list.  Given those figures, I would say that is the very best estimate.</p>  <p>  The reasons for this are where we really need the Minister of State's help.  First, the service has developed a significant backlog of patients due to demand for the service outweighing capacity.  Unfortunately, more people have become sick than the service is capable of helping.  Imagine that.  The second reason is that operating capacity has been significantly reduced since September 2017 when the hospital roofs began to leak and water came in.  I will take the Minister of State on a quick tour of the four years since then.  We have been told that the HSE plans to replace the theatre by the end of next year.  This operating theatre was leaking in 2017.  In 2017, all of the TDs in the area met with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  Following that, we were told on 29 November 2017 that a tendering process was progressing for the procurement of a temporary theatre facility.  We were told this was being pursued as a matter of urgency.  The word "urgency" seems to have taken on a new meaning.  This is the 21st century.  Waiting lists are at this level just before Christmas.  I am only mentioning a selection of the events surrounding this issue.</p>  <p>  We were going to facilitate some of the patients in the hospital facilities outside of Merlin Park.  Some were to be accommodated in private hospitals.  We then learned that very few were cared for in University Hospital Galway facilities and none was facilitated in private hospitals.  We were told that Saolta University Health Care Group was working to have a modular theatre open in mid-2019 and enabling works were being carried out.  Putting it as benignly as I can, the Minister subsequently had to clarify that he was given contradictory information.  He was told that there was an enabling contract.  In a letter on 5 March, he stated that he was subsequently told it was actually a letter of intent.  That letter of intent was then withdrawn.  We were then told there would be a rapid build, which has not happened.</p>  <p>  I conclude by referring to a letter I read out previously, in which a surgeon stated that there were 2,000 people on the waiting list.  That is half the current number.  He stated that this was too big for management to address and that it was a regional crisis.  He stated that it was unbearable for the patients, who were clinically deteriorating. </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to take a hands-on approach to this matter.  At the very least, I ask him to agree that this is unacceptable and to give me a date on which the theatre will be open.</p></speech>

I also recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the HSE has had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April and May of this year.  This was done to ensure patient safety was maintained and all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19-related activity and time-critical essential work.  This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization.</p>  <p>  As a result of the significant disruption in scheduled care, hospital waiting lists peaked in May.  However, the resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity.  The number of patients awaiting an inpatient or day case procedure dropped by 16% from May to November and the rate of growth of the outpatient waiting list has slowed in recent months.  Regarding University Hospital Galway's orthopaedic waiting list, I note that while the number of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment has increased this year, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure has fallen by 7% compared to the same time last year. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.  Hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols to ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way.  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings, including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.  For example, University Hospital Galway has advised my Department that a very successful physiotherapist-led musculoskeletal triage process is in place there.  Under this process, patients are first seen by a physiotherapist and are then directed to the most appropriate care pathway.  This pathway reduces the number of patients being added to the consultant waiting lists and allows quicker access to services for many patients.  University Hospital Galway is examining ways to provide additional access to theatres, including setting up Sunday lists for surgical procedures.</p>  <p>  University Hospital Galway has also advised my Department that it has tendered for the construction of a modular theatre facility which will provide two orthopaedic theatres at Merlin Park.  The enabling works and the construction tender for this project have been completed and the contractor is to commence construction in January 2021.  It is expected that the works will be completed in late 2021.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund continues to work with hospital groups, including Saolta University Health Care Group, to support additional activity through insourcing and outsourcing initiatives for inpatient and day case procedures and outpatient appointments.  I heard the number the Deputy quoted.  Some 6,487 persons on the outpatient waiting list is a huge number.  We hope to address it in the coming months.</p></speech>

I accept his bona fides.  Covid-19 has nothing to do with this.  How the replacement of two modular theatres has taken from September 2017 until the end of 2021 should be the subject of an inquiry.  A brand new hospital could have been built in that time.  There is something seriously wrong.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the NTPF.  Not a single patient on these waiting lists has been referred through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have my own difficulties with the NTPF, but it is there as a matter of Government policy.  I have asked why none of these patients has been referred through the NTPF, despite waiting times of more than four years.  I have received no answer.</p> <p>Language fails me.</p> <p> I will go back to using the surgeon's language.  As the Minister of State will be aware, surgeons are not known for their radical nature or for writing letters.  I refer again to the letter from the consultant surgeon in March 2019, addressed to all Deputies and many more people besides.  It states that this is too big for management to address and that it is a growing regional crisis.  The surgeon states that the situation is becoming unbearable for the patients who are on the waiting lists and who are clinically worsening as they wait for admission to surgery.  I can give the Minister of State a copy of the letter.  It is dated.  The situation is now worse.  It is now 2020; the letter was written in 2019.  I absolutely despair of the reply, notwithstanding the Minister of State's bona fides, because it gives me only two paragraphs that relate to the question.  How could it take this long?  Where is the sense of outrage in the Department that two modular theatres could not go up and, in the meantime, alternative provisions be made?</p></speech>

Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a key commitment of the Government.  It is acknowledged, however, that the challenges faced by the health system in 2020 are unlike anything we have faced before.  We are very aware of the impact Covid-19 has had on our health service and the delivery of scheduled care.  The Minister and I welcome the progression of University Hospital Galway's modular theatre facility, which will provide important additional capacity for the hospital's orthopaedic service.  We also recognise the work that has been done not only by Galway but by the wider HSE to identify alternative pathways to facilitate patient appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  As for broader service planning for the year ahead, my Department continues to engage with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund on the development of the access to care plan 2021 which will set out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2021.  As the Deputy will be aware, an additional &euro;240 million has been provided in budget 2021 for the access to care fund, &euro;210 million of which will be allocated as required to the HSE and &euro;30 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the provision of treatment in both private and public hospitals to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists.  Officials from my Department continue to engage with representatives from the HSE to monitor access to services, waiting lists and activity levels.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that from September 2017 to today is a long time.  I have seen this before.  Projects in the public sector can sometimes take far too long.  I appreciate her concern in that regard.  If she has a copy of the letter to which she referred, I would be only too delighted to take it and follow it up within the Department.</p></speech>

One of these I wish to discuss with the Minister of State is the Yard Hub in Abbeyshrule, on the banks of the canal.  It involves the redevelopment of a derelict site in the hope of creating a new village hub, creating a space for economic and enterprise development and enhancing the first impressions of visitors to the village as they make their way along the Royal Canal greenway.  The Yard Hub seeks to provide local people currently commuting with an opportunity to work remotely and to bring activity to the village.  The recent pandemic has emphasised more than ever the need to create the space, opportunity and means to work closer to home.  It is a measure of the project and perhaps the ambition of its promoters that successful young local entrepreneur Garret Flower, CEO of ParkOffice, is enthusiastically supporting this project.  This young tech entrepreneur, who pioneered the world's first parking software, believes the project will foster a creative community of collaboration and self-improvement, focusing on IT learning.</p>  <p>  To date, almost &euro;1 million in funding has been set aside for the project.  I think the Minister of State will agree that that sounds fantastic, but it now transpires that Eir is unwilling to provide a dedicated fibre connection for this project.  The promoters asked the broadband officer with Longford County Council, Christine Collins, who is doing Herculean work, to seek out the connection and now the project promoters have been told that the only connection available to the premises and the project is digital subscriber line, DSL, and that the premises is not passing for fibre of any sort, be it efibre, fibre to the home, FTTH, or even fibre to the cabinet, FTTC.  The promoters have also been made aware that the local exchange needs to be upgraded to next generation network, NGN, in order for the hub to be in a position to order a dedicated fibre connection.</p>  <p>  We have invested a lot of hope and an awful lot of expectation in Eir and its ability to roll out broadband, and the early indications are certainly not good.  I think everybody in the House will agree that this is the type of landmark project that the company should embrace and promote if it is serious about its role in the most ambitious national roll-out plan since electrification.  I ask the Minister of State and the Department to engage immediately with the company to ensure that the necessary infrastructure to facilitate a &euro;1 million State investment gets the support it needs and that this hard-working community in rural Ireland deserves.</p></speech>

The provision of telecommunication services is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, as independent regulator.  Unfortunately, there is no provision for the Minister or Department to instruct a commercial operator to do anything in this context.  Decisions on the location of fibre roll-out are a commercial matter for operators.  In April 2017, the then Minister signed a commitment agreement with Eir regarding its plans to provide high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  This was later extended to a further 40,000 premises.  While deployment is monitored under the terms of the agreement signed between the company and the Department, it is not funded by the State and is not planned, designed or directed by the Department in any capacity.  A copy of the terms of the commitment agreement is available on the Department's website, where quarterly updates on Eir's rural deployment are also published.  Information on Eir's planned rural deployment is available on the Open Eir website.</p><p>The footprint of the Yard enterprise hub in Abbeyshrule is within the area covered by this commitment agreement, and I understand that it will be served from the Colehill exchange in County Longford.  According to roll-out information available to the Department, the Yard enterprise hub should be able to access a broadband connection from retail service providers offering services on the new Eir network.  I am advised that the building being used by the enterprise hub is currently designated as a derelict building and that, as a result, there is no valid GeoDirectory building ID or Eircode postcode available for the building.  The location will, therefore, be treated like a new build premises and can be indexed by Eir to the appropriate optical distribution point.  Should the owners of the Yard enterprise hub in Abbeyshrule, County Longford, experience difficulties ordering a connection to Eir's new network from any of the retail service providers that are offering services over it, I would encourage them to email the Department at <i>broadband@decc.gov.ie</i>with specific details and officials will look into the matter further.</p><p>The Government's national broadband plan will ensure that citizens throughout the entire country have access to high-speed broadband services and that nobody is left without this vital service.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% already have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps.  Investment in fibre networks provided by commercial operators and the national broadband plan will see 90% of premises across the State served with speeds in excess of 100 Mbps by 2024.</p> <p>This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and State-led intervention.</p> <p> It is encouraging to note that several industry players have announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband, including Eir, which has stated it will roll out fibre to a further 1.4 million premises, bringing its fibre deployment to some 1.8 million premises.  SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment, which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services.  It is actively considering the scope of phase 2 of this project.  Virgin Media is offering 250 Mbps as part of a standard offering, with 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps available to many of its customers across the more than 1 million premises it covers.  It too is continuing to invest in upgrading its network.  Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></speech>

I accept that there are other retail players operating in the market, but the view is that Eir fibre is the gold standard.  When one works on a project and develops it to the scale of &euro;1 million of State investment, there is a reasonable expectation that the standard of broadband available to it will be the gold standard.</p>  <p>  Abbeyshrule is an idyllic village.  It is a recent winner in the national Tidy Towns awards.  It is a centre for creativity and there are several specialist aviation businesses on its doorstep, operating from the nearby airfield.  Enterprise and innovation are eager bedfellows in that part of the country.  I pay tribute to the local committee which has worked so hard on this issue, as well as Councillor Mick Cahill, a local county councillor who has helped to advance this project thus far.  Their frustration at this turn of events is palpable.  It is inconceivable that a company blessed with such a large and lucrative national contract could be so dismissive and unco-operative.</p>  <p>   The House will be well aware that this is not the first time we have heard criticism of Eir in recent months.  It has been challenged on billing issues and customer service and, increasingly, it is being challenged on its ability to deliver the roll-out of broadband.  This latest saga certainly does not bode well.  If my premises was flagged amber or worse in terms of the roll-out plan for County Longford, I would be seriously concerned about the ability and eagerness of Eir to ever deliver fibre to my home.  We need to hear that Eir will provide whatever infrastructure is required to make this project work as, otherwise, it is a credibility issue for the company and its willingness and eagerness to deliver broadband to rural Ireland.</p></speech>

This is reflected in the commitments in the programme for Government for delivery of the national broadband plan, which will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged, particularly around increased levels of remote working.  However, ensuring that all premises across the State have access to quality and high-speed broadband can only be achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State-led intervention under the national broadband plan.  As I mentioned, the level of planned commercial investment in the sector is very encouraging.  Eir's rural investment in high-speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking.  However, the terms of an agreement between the Department and Eir with regard to its plans to provide high-speed broadband to more than 340,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis means that the Department should be provided with roll-out information on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that new-build properties or properties such as the Yard enterprise hub in Abbeyshrule, County Longford can be indexed by Eir to the appropriate optical distribution point which will enable a service to be provided by the retail provider.  Should the owners experience difficulties gaining connection Eir's new network via one of the retail service providers offering services over it, I request that they email the Department.  If the Deputy wishes to send me an email on the matter, I will bring it to the Minister and see if we can get this issue resolved.  I thank the Deputy for rasing this very important issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600051#DDD00700"><p>Tairgim: "Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois".</p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to bring the Bill before the House.  As flagged in the Seanad and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I intend to table further urgent legislative amendments on Committee Stage later this evening.  The amendments relate to the operation of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 and substitute consent provisions in the planning Act.  I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  Section 1 provides a definition for "principal Act", which means the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Section 2 amends section 11(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to replace the requirement to hold public meetings regarding the initial issues stage of a proposed development plan with a more flexible requirement for planning authorities to consult with members of the public in such a manner as it considers appropriate and to invite written submissions from members of the public.  The proposed amendment will allow the planning authority to take such steps as it deems necessary, such as public newspaper notices and online communication, to ensure the public are consulted in compliance with the principles of the Aarhus Convention, which include public participation in environmental decision making.  This measure is immediately required to allow planning authorities to adapt public consultation procedures in light of the current restrictions on the holding of public gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  If this amendment is not made, such restrictions will delay the progression of development plans during the pandemic.  The amendment is in line with the modernisation agenda for the planning system to increase online activity and ensure continued flexibility in communicating details of draft development plans to the public and it will, therefore, be a permanent amendment.</p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt, there will always be some format of public meeting under section 11(3)(b) in respect of the initial stages of a proposed development plan, either by way of a public meeting attended by the public in person or an online public meeting.  Indeed, a planning authority may hold both if it so wishes.  I imagine that many will do just that.  I hope this addresses any concerns Members may have around the public consultation issues that were also raised with me in the Seanad when I introduced the Bill.  It is important to note that subsequent development plan public engagement phases remain in place.</p>  <p>  Section 3 deals with emergency periods.  The provision will allow the Government to make orders during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, if required, which would extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and the Building Control Acts.</p> <p>This contingency measure is required to provide an essential legislative safeguard which can be invoked as necessary to ensure the public participation elements of the planning regime and certain decision-making and enforcement systems of the building control regime are not compromised in the event of further waves of Covid-19 infection that may necessitate a further period of stay at home travel restrictions or, indeed, may critically impact on the operation of individual planning authorities.</p> <p> The provision in the Bill includes new flexibilities.  More than one extension period order may be made within the combined operative period of the Bill, which is currently due to end on 9 June 2021.  Extension period orders, if required, can be applied to specific areas or administrative areas of the country, as opposed to only applying to an entire county.  The Government, at my request, may choose which statutory periods it requires to extend rather than applying the extension to all periods under the Planning Act and the specified Building Control Acts.  While it is obviously hoped that the safeguarding provisions are never used, it may be necessary to use them to ensure the integrity of the planning and building control systems and to ensure that it is maintained throughout the pandemic in the event that there is a critical deterioration in staffing levels due to infections in one or more planning or building control authorities or where the public generally or particular groups of the public may not be capable of engagement with the planning system due to the introduction of more restrictive travel constraints.</p> <p> Section 4 of the Bill provides the Short Title and collective citations to the Bill.</p> <p> I will outline the proposed amendments to the Bill which I will introduce on Committee Stage.  Regarding amendments to the substitute consent process in the Planning Act, to comply with the Supreme Court Ballysax and McQuaid judgment of 1 July 2020 it is necessary to urgently amend the existing substitute consent provisions of Part XA of the Planning Act to require that exceptional circumstances be considered in the second stage application for substitute consent, along with related provisions to ensure that additional public participation is provided, where required, with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances as well as the wider substitute consent application.  These urgent technical amendments are being added to the Bill on the advice of the Attorney General, as they will facilitate the earlier resolution of the terms of the November 2019 judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU against Ireland in case 261/18, the second Derrybrien wind farm case.  Without these proposed urgent amendments, to ensure that the substitute consent process is in compliance with the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, the ability of the State to meet the terms of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment will be called into question, with all the significant costs of delay from the accruing daily fines that go with it.</p> <p> The proposed amendments will amend the substitute consent provisions at Part XA of the Planning Act to provide for exceptional circumstances to be considered in a second stage application for substitute consent at section 177K of the Planning Act, along with the necessary ancillary provisions to ensure additional public participation is facilitated, where required, with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances, as well as on the wider application.  Section 177K will also be amended to provide for additional public participation to allow exceptional circumstances to be considered where an application for substitute consent is currently pending before the board upon the enactment of these amendments.  The public, prescribed bodies and those who have already made submissions on the application can make further submissions on the application, including on whether exceptional circumstances exist in this regard.</p> <p> The Government has approved the provision of temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, for increased notice periods, from 28 days to 90 days, in respect of notices of termination served on tenants during the period from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 for rent arrears and to prohibit rent increases for relevant tenancies during that period.  The aim is to further assist tenants financially impacted by Covid-19, while balancing the constitutionally protected rights of the property owners.  Section 8 is key and sets out that the new Part 3 protections shall apply where the tenant: makes the necessary written declaration that he or she is unable to pay rent due on foot of Covid-19 and is at risk of losing his or her tenancy; at the same time, serves a notice on the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, requesting </p> <p>assistance to obtain advice from the Money and Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS; and within five days of making this standard declaration serves a notice on his or her landlord seeking a consultation to make an arrangement to pay the rent due.  The new Part 3 also applies to tenants who have made a declaration under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, subject to certain conditions.  That is the Act that was passed by the House last July, which has had the positive and desired effect the Government wanted it to have insofar as protecting tenants who were most at risk of eviction.  Provision is made under section 9 for a counter-declaration by a landlord to disapply the protections.  Similar to a tenant declaration, it shall be an offence for a landlord to make a declaration that is false or misleading.</p> <p> Under Section 10, a notice of termination served during the emergency period shall not specify a termination date earlier than 13 April 2021.  This means that with the provisions we introduced in the last year there are more than 12 months of eviction protections and additional tenancy protections for tenants.  Section 14 provides that RTB tenancy tribunals are not required to be held in public during the period to 12 April 2021.</p> <p> I look forward to the debate on the Bill's provisions and I hope Deputies will appreciate the urgency of these measures, the increasing cost to the taxpayer of inaction and the ongoing need to continue to protect tenants during the Covid-19 emergency.  I understand there are concerns over substantive amendments, but I emphasise the significant engagement my officials have had with the Oireachtas joint committee on these issues and the legal advice received by the Attorney General.  We must act in a timely manner and I thank Deputies for the constructive role they have played in this heretofore.  I will respond to specific questions and engage further on Committee Stage.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600052#EEE00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his outline.  In my five years in the D&aacute;il, this is the fifth year in a row that in the dying days or hours of the December term very complex amending legislation on planning and residential tenancies has been brought before the House.  In each of those years the legislation was been brought to the House in an incredibly unconventional and, I believe, unhelpful manner.  That is not a comment on whether I support or oppose the provisions of the Bill.  Given the complex nature of legislation, the reason we have a legislative system with various Stages is to ensure the opportunity not only for the Minister to outline the intention behind legislation but for Members across the House to scrutinise, hear outside expert opinion, to deliberate and to try, in many cases, to improve the legislation.</p>  <p>  The difficulty is that when legislation of this type is rushed, mistakes are made.  That is not in any way to question the hard work of the officials, but to question the repeated practice of officials being put under undue pressure and unrealistic timetables to produce legislation to address complex matters.  In fact, in my first December in the Oireachtas in 2016 we dealt with legislation on rent pressure zones.  The Minister will recall that such was the rushed nature of the legislation, substantial mathematical errors were included in the formula for the rent pressure zones which meant that if the legislation had passed without amendment, there would have been an 8% cap rather than a 4% cap.  I am not criticising or questioning any official who works hard and late into the night to draft legislation.  It is the timescale in which officials are unfairly required to draft complex matters and the lack of adequate scrutiny by the House that are the problem, as was the case in 2016 and in each year since then.  It is again today.</p> <p>It was a mistake for the Minister not to allow the Oireachtas housing committee to scrutinise the substantive parts of the Bill before us today.  I will speak to those in a moment.  We had indicated that we wanted to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, but the Minister chose to take another route through the committee.  We offered a date for PLS in the same week the Minister wrote to us because we understood the need to expedite it quickly.  In fact, rather than the Minister taking it through the Seanad and speeding the process up, because he himself has had to introduce substantive amendments not consequent to the Bill, it is now happening in the same timeline as it would have happened if the committee had been allowed to do its job.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is important.  It is important to adequately scrutinise and strengthen the legislation before us and therefore I think it is disappointing that we were denied that opportunity.  I make this point constructively.  We want to be able to do our job as legislators to scrutinise, even when we support the intentions of the Bill, so I urge the Minister to please let us do that.  We will always facilitate the Minister with speedy meetings when required.</p> <p> I am most concerned with respect to the substantive amendments not consequential to the Bill, both on substitute consent and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act.  In the briefing we got from the officials the week before last they told us that the Attorney General had indicated that this was one of the most complex areas of law that he has ever dealt with.  If it is complex for the Attorney General, then for those of us who are not legal professionals it is inadequate to be given short briefings and insufficient time to scrutinise.  The Minister is correct to state that because of the failure of the State to adequately transpose EU environmental directives and ensure adequate public participation in the planning process, it is currently being fined &euro;15,000 a day.  The fines to date are somewhere in the region of &euro;10 million.  Even if we pass the Bill today and it is signed into law by the President at the weekend, those fines will continue to accumulate until the summer of next year when the board is expected to make its decision on the case in question.  This was confirmed to us by officials at the committee meeting on Tuesday of last week.  The expected total fine arising from the European Court of Justice, ECJ, case of last autumn will be in excess of &euro;15 million.</p> <p> I am also concerned that there are some errors in the Bill.  As the Minister is aware, there is a number of different pathways into substitute consent and a number of those exceptional circumstances are dealt with, as outlined in previous legislation.  There is a real concern that where a case is brought before the board, that exceptional circumstances may not have to be fully considered.  I will talk this through in more detail at a later stage with the Minister, but it is specifically related to the amendment to section 177K of the 2000 Act and whether those provisions adequately provide for what the Minister intends to provide in this legislation.  At the heart of all of this is the repeated failure of the Government to adequately transpose crucial directives from European law, which protect the environment, and in protecting the environment protect the ecosystem and communities and the livelihoods of people, especially those in rural areas.  There is a failure also by the Government to live up to its obligations under the Aarhus Convention to ensure full public participation.</p> <p> Ironically, there are two other hugely important and complex pieces of legislation going through the Oireachtas.  I refer to the water environment (abstractions) Bill and the marine planning and development management Bill.  We are getting to have proper pre-legislative scrutiny of the general schemes of those Bills, but many of us on the committee are deeply concerned that the same minimalist approach to implementing and transposing EU environmental directives and public participation is being taken to that legislation as was taken to substitute consent legislation previously.  It does not seem to be the case that the Government is learning from the mistakes of the past.</p> <p> I will briefly deal with what are essentially the four substantive sections of the Bill.  The Minister is making a wrong call on the provisions around public meetings in the initial stages of city and county development plans in terms of the permanent nature of this measure.  There are people who will never be able to engage in writing or online on the Internet for all the reasons we know and, therefore, including a mandatory requirement for some form of public meeting at the very outset is crucial.  I urge the Minister to rethink the post-Covid implications of what he is proposing.</p> <p> While I have no difficulty whatsoever in extending planning notice periods or the decision-making periods of local authorities because of Covid, the provisions of the Bill are too ambiguous and too wide.  My understanding is that the two main concerns are cases where local authorities, due to reductions in staff because of Covid-19, may not be able to meet their statutorily required timelines, as well as future potential lockdowns on a county or regional basis.  There are substantial holes in the way in which these propositions have been worked into this legislation.  We will try to get through them on Committee Stage.</p> <p> The concern from this side of the House is not the principle of what the Minister is doing, but is because of the rushed nature of the legislation and the outworking of potential unintended consequences.  I refer, for example, to a situation where there is a county lockdown in Meath and the good people of Meath want to engage on a planning matter with the board, and cannot physically travel to Dublin for that purpose, or go to a neighbouring county where such restrictions might apply in the local authority that is responsible for the planning matter at hand.</p> <p> While the measure on substitute consent is a modest improvement and may just about get the Government over the hurdle of the Supreme Court decision of the summer, it is minimalist.  I have tabled an amendment and I urge the Minister to look at the content of the amendment and to consider strengthening the process.  We need to do more than the minimum.  The community of Derrybrien, for example, has since 2003, if not 1998, when it was first faced with planning applications for wind farms, lived through a nightmare because the planning process is simply not up to scratch.  Therefore, we owe it to those people as well as all others who want to engage in the substitute consent process to get this right and ensure that at all levels, environmental directives and public participation requirements are fully adhered to.</p> <p> With respect to the section of the Bill dealing with the amendment to the residential tenancies provisions, it obviously extends the limited protections to a very small number of renters by a number of months.  I have no problem with that.  Therefore, I would not oppose the amendments.  However, it makes the terms of engaging with that protection more onerous and I think that is a problem.  The very fact that fewer than 400 or so people have availed of the protection to date is because the process as outlined in the Bill in the summer is simply too bureaucratic.  It is too onerous.  The criteria for accessing this protection are simply too narrow.  That is why the vast majority of renters, once the ban on level 5 evictions expired, are still at the mercy of potential notices to quit on a whole series of other grounds.  The Minister has still not adequately acknowledged or addressed that.</p> <p> We are not going to be obstructive this evening.  We are not going to oppose the legislation, but we are genuinely asking the Minister to consider some of the significant amendments that we have tabled to try to improve the nature of the Bill before us.  I also urge him to please rethink the public meetings at the opening stages of the development plan process.  It is simply a question of allowing meetings, post-Covid-19, as I think the permanent nature of that amendment is wrong.  We will get into the detail on Committee Stage but that is Sinn F&eacute;in's outline of the Bill and the amendments as it currently stands.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, we had a debate only last night on the causes of homelessness.  It appears to me from speaking to Senator Moynihan that two Bills have been wedged together: a residential tenancies Bill has been wedged into a planning and development Bill in order to deal with two issues at the one time.</p>  <p>  The Minister has decided not to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny.  Without that, I agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, that our ability to provide the type of scrutiny that is needed for these far-reaching measures that are incredibly important to the daily lives of citizens has been curtailed.  I can hear the Minister's voice as an Opposition spokesperson in previous years.</p> <p>If he was still the Opposition spokesperson for his party and a Minister walked in and tried to do this the week before Christmas, I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would say the very same thing - that it is too much in too short a time.</p> <p> The people who need this Bill are so vulnerable that we must do this right.  We have put down amendments in good faith around a sunset clause etc. and the onerous process.  Is it the intention of the Minister or the knee-jerk intention of departmental officials for this to be overly onerous on the tenant at all times?  We will speak to this on various different amendments as we go through the evening.</p> <p> The Minister has done many things since taking office that we have been quite pleased with.  He has engaged with my party in a constructive way with the rent-to-buy scheme that I have raised with the Minister and we hope to get some progress on that.  He took that on board as something he could work with.  We applauded the Minister's move on co-living arrangements, and I made a statement on that a number of weeks ago.  Last night he made a contribution in not opposing the Bill from the Opposition; that was also constructive.  Many of the initiatives he has taken appear to be getting somewhere, and all of us want that.</p> <p> This is crucial for the people who sent us here.  It really feels that at this hour and this date, we are not doing the matter justice with the manner in which it is being presented to us.  We have our amendments and we will try to work with the Minister on them and improve the Bill as we go through it.  In saying that, I must contend that the manner in which this is being done is less than satisfactory.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600054#GGG00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  We have all gone through the Bill as a committee and I make the point that it is critical to have public engagement in planning.  I am a firm believer in that.</p>  <p>  This Bill replaces the requirement on city and county council executives to hold public meetings about proposed city and county development plans.  The obligation is then on the planning authority to consult members of the public and invite written submissions from them on the proposed development plan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Government's proposed amendment to this.  It is vital that we provide for additional public participation, where required, in exceptional circumstances such as these trying times.  We all know we are finding living with Covid overwhelming with the life changes we have had to accept.  It is obvious we need this legislation to deal with it but I cannot accept how the virus is sometimes used as an excuse to keep out the public.  It has been my experience that engagement with people has been left behind while we are trying to adhere to public health guidelines.</p>  <p>  It is important that the public feels it can be part of this process.  The main aim of public participation is to encourage the public to have meaningful input into the decision-making process, and this is very important when it comes to planning.  Public participation provides the local community with an opportunity for communication between agencies making decisions that will affect the public.  This will have a great impact on people's lives, which is why it is so important.  I was a councillor for years and I know how important this process is.  We must ensure we give full access to the public when it comes to the planning process.</p>  <p>  I have seen at first hand how delays come about when people have appointments cancelled.  People like to be able to go into a planner, sit down and go through a plan.  They can discuss the timescale and the number of people who are not sure about dates for an application is amazing.  This is all about communication with the public.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that even in a pandemic we give access to the public so people can be part of the process.  Giving the public a say is not a negative and contributions should not be seen as negative.  People can be so positive and observations can be really good when they engage in the process.  They can play a big part.  We need not see this as a negative process.  There are many positive people who would make really good contributions.  That is so important.</p>  <p>  I know we cannot do all we used to do, but if we can sit in this House and listen to each other, towns and villages around Ireland should have a place where experts and planners can sit and listen to the voices of the people.  That is very important.  This is a significant matter and we must get clarity on how we will operate in future.</p>  <p>  I agree with some of the comments made about online forums.  I have a big fear that going forward we will be disenfranchising a large section of the public that is not online.  Perhaps people cannot read or write.  People may need to go to meetings in order to engage with the process and I feel so strongly about this at housing meetings.</p>  <p>  There is also the question of the residential tenancies legislation and evictions.  It is important that we see no evictions at any time but in particular during Covid-19 when it is so hard to find somewhere to rent.  What is the understanding with county councils and evictions during Covid-19?  It was brought to my attention the other day and it is important for us to consider communication in these matters.  We must know that the public is aware of what is happening.  These have been horrific times for everybody but I compliment all the 31 local authorities, including staff such as planners.  They have done their best in challenging times to try to do what they could to help people with housing and planning.</p>  <p>  We all know the county development plans are being done as we speak but they have been delayed.  That process is now going until the middle of next year.  We do not know what way Covid-19 will affect it but we must be mindful of what is happening.  Our local authorities play a significant part in people's lives so it is important for us to appreciate the work they do.</p>  <p>  Staffing is also a major concern.  I always talk about Carlow but all the staff in the local authority work so hard.  Understaffing can be a problem in local authorities.  We should examine it.</p></speech>

As he said, we are not opposing the legislation but we ask the Minister to consider some of the amendments because of the rushed nature of this process and the absence of scrutiny by the housing committee.</p>  <p>  It is most important to consider the Deputy's amendment to delete what the local authority might consider "appropriate" and to ensure effective public participation.  As with many issues in planning, the question of trust is most important.  If people are opposing wind farms or large developments in their area, for example, but do not feel they are being heard, the system could fall apart.</p>  <p>  I support online public meetings but we must rethink this in the context of a post-Covid world.  The permanent nature of what is being introduced is wrong.  Many people find the process opaque at the best of times but if there is provision for the process continuing at the discretion of local authorities, it would be a step backwards.</p>  <p>  I am thinking in particular of east Kerry from Barr Dubh outside Killarney up through Cordal and into north Kerry.  Everybody in that area should be able to participate fully in a process.  People feel that when appeals go in, the process is not clear enough.  From the initial hearing of a proposal, there must be full trust and confidence in what is going on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600054#GGG00400"><p>I will respond to a comment from the Minister.  He said there was significant engagement between officials in his Department and the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with housing.  That is absolutely the case.</p> <p>It is also the case that the Minister wrote to the committee seeking a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  Instead of agreeing to that waiver the committee, whose members take their constitutional role as legislators and scrutinisers of legislation very seriously, offered to facilitate the Minister by carrying out the pre-legislative scrutiny quickly but thoroughly.  The Minister did not agree to that and introduced the Bill in the Seanad rather than putting it through the pre-legislative scrutiny process at committee.  A substantive four-page Bill went to the Seanad and then last week, 17 pages of amendments and entirely new sections were introduced.  For the record, this is not a good way to legislate, particularly when one element of the Bill is an attempt to correct legislative mistakes that were made in the past.  One would hope that we would have learned some lessons at this stage but it appears not.  I certainly cannot see any evidence of lessons having been learned.<br/><br/>The substitute consent element of this Bill is an attempt to fix a problem that effectively dates back to 1985 when the original iteration of the environmental impact assessment directive was adopted.  The problem here is that Ireland has been taking a minimalist approach to EU directives.  That is why we have ended up in difficulty on this and why we are now paying fines and dealing with a large number of court cases.  It is also why the community in Derrybrien has paid such a high price for mistakes that were made in terms of legislation that was not thorough enough and was not adequately scrutinised.  If one thinks of the time this has taken at Civil Service and Government level, as well as the costs involved, including legal costs, we really should have learned to process legislation properly at this stage and not to rush it.  In terms of EU directives, we should have learned not to try to get away with the least amount possible in terms of implementation.  That is not the right approach.  There has been a lot of very good talk recently in this Chamber about our important role in the European Union in the context of Brexit, with which I wholeheartedly agree.  Yet, when it comes to really important EU directives the approach time and again is to try to get away with doing the minimum amount necessary to comply, rather than embracing the spirit of the directives and thinking about the long-term benefits for us as a country of full implementation.  The political attitude in that regard needs to change.<br/><br/>Specifically on substitute consent, I am concerned about the proposals in the Bill in terms of how we can be sure that in all cases the information under consideration by the board on the issue of exceptional circumstances, which will now take place at a substantive stage, will be fully available to the public.  I am also concerned as to whether the wording and consideration for exceptional circumstances conforms to the high bar required by the European Court of Justice for regularising developments or consents in breach of the EIA directive.<br/><br/>With respect to the provisions to remove the requirement for public meetings in relation to proposed development plans, I am fully supportive of online meetings.  They are a great way of engaging with people and there is a logic to these provisions in the context of emergencies such as Covid-19.  However, I am absolutely against the permanent removal of public meetings at this stage in the development plan process because it will exclude people.  In my own community, some of the best community activists are not comfortable with online participation.  Indeed, even when people are comfortable with online fora, there is often a lot to be gained from real world, physical public meetings, including the potential for community building.  We should be facilitating both options and not making this move which will result, in practice, in many local authorities choosing to go for the online option only.  We could and should be doing both in an effort to include more people in the process.<br/><br/>On planning changes in the context of the Covid-19 emergency period, I am concerned that there may not be proactive communication from local authorities and planning authorities if planning timelines change.  Will there be enough communication around that?  Certainly all practice to date suggests that this sort of communication and information tends not to get out to people.  There tends to be a lot of confusion around it when set times are involved.  In that context, I am concerned that changes will lead to confusion about deadline dates and so forth.  I am also concerned that there will not be sufficient safeguards in place with regard to the discretion afforded to local authorities.  I understand the situation the Minister is trying to address and he is quite right to do so but I am not convinced there are sufficient safeguards built in.  This aspect of the Bill may not be in compliance with EU law and the Aarhus convention in terms of public participation.  We could see a situation where there are different planning timelines in operation in different parts of the country and that could be highly problematic in the context of citizens knowing their rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>deadlines and so forth.<br/><br/>The concerns I have just outlined must be addressed and I have submitted amendments to improve the relevant sections of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider my amendments which were tabled in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation.  A lot of the measures contained in this Bill are very welcome and their intent is to be supported.  I will be supporting the thrust of the Bill; the amendments I have tabled seek to improve it further.<br/><br/>The Social Democrats will support the section of the Bill that extends protections for renters.  However, it is problematic that these provisions will only provide protections for a limited number of renters.  Fewer than 400 renters have been able to avail of the protections so far and some renters will potentially have their declarations cancelled under the measures proposed in the Bill, when landlords will also be able to make a declaration.  This concerns me, as does the fact that the protections will only apply to notice of termination for rent arrears.  All other notices for eviction will remain valid.  In the context of an ongoing pandemic, when public health should be first and foremost in our minds and when we know that some of those most at risk from Covid-19 are people living in overcrowded conditions in the private rented sector, renters should be getting more and stronger protection.  The measures in the Bill lack the kind of social solidarity that is needed and they lack ambition.  Research conducted by Harvard University shows a direct link between evictions and an increase in the spread of Covid-19.  This is not a theoretical issue but one that has an impact on the fight against Covid-19 which will continue to be a very real public health challenge at least until the middle of next year.  The complex and bureaucratic process surrounding declarations and the timelines for same will ensure that some more vulnerable tenants who could be eligible for protection are more likely to miss out.<br/><br/>What we should be doing is putting in place protections for all renters who fall into rent arrears.  We should also be putting in place permanent measures, protections and structures around debt resolution, payment plans and mediation as alternatives to eviction.  We should be going further than the proposals in the Bill.  We would be better served by long-term reforms in this sector rather than a limited extension of emergency measures.  The Residential Tenancies Act provides landlords with seven different ways to end a tenancy when there has been no wrongdoing on the part of the tenant.  That needs to be changed.  We need to remove these no-fault grounds for eviction.  That would reduce the number of people who lose their homes, bringing us in line with the European norm.  The Social Democrats is taking a constructive approach to this Bill and I ask the Minister to look constructively at the amendments we have put forward to improve it.</p></speech>

This Bill makes important changes to safeguard planning and building control systems during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Bill will amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to remove the mandatory requirement to hold physical public meetings on proposed development plans while continuing to oblige planning authorities to hold meetings and engage with members of the public either in person or online.  This measure will also have future application, thereby improving the flexibility of the planning system in the context of the development and proliferation of new technologies.</p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Bill will amend the 2000 Act.  The Act currently requires authorities to hold public meetings and to seek written submissions on proposed development plans while allowing them also to invite oral submissions from the public.  The new provision will provide planning authorities with more discretion under new planning authority regulations, which will require consultation with the public.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that many of my colleagues in the House have raised concerns with regard to hosting public meetings.  I agree with some of the sentiments expressed.  Perhaps this is a matter to which the Minister can give further consideration.  It is certainly a concern for many older people and those who may not have access to online facilities.  As a Deputy for a rural constituency, I know that this is quite a large problem.  It is surprising how big of an issue communications and access to the Internet is for some rural settlements, including some across my own constituency.</p>  <p>  It is also important to look at the ability of the Minister's Department to modernise the planning process as much as possible.  As one of the youngest elected Members of the Oireachtas, I know from first-hand experience that the housing crisis is an enormous concern for many young people and that he has an enormous challenge before him.</p>  <p>  The provisions outlined in the Bill are certainly proposed in good faith and with the aim of speeding up developments that have been slowed down due to Covid.  It is important that we are realistic and acknowledge that in the House.  Perhaps, however, when Covid has passed, we should review the issue of online meetings.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for visiting my constituency during the week.  It was fantastic to have him down to meet officials from Cork County Council.  He was very aware of the challenges faced by that local authority in trying to speed up badly needed housing developments, both social and private.  I look forward to welcoming him back when he is next in Cork East.</p></speech>

Instead of widening public participation in the planning and development process, this Bill narrows it through the curtailment of public meetings.  The review of the Kildare county development plan started only this afternoon and this Bill could effectively lock out those who most need to access and participate in the process, such as the lovely elderly man in north Kildare in my constituency who is freezing in a mobile home with no running water, no electricity and only a gas bottle for heat.  Though in urgent need of housing, what is proposed here denies him that vital access that is his right as a citizen.  He can go to a public meeting but he cannot access one of the procedures in respect of planning and development because he has no laptop and no power, and I mean that both literally and metaphorically.  We have a growing swathe of different cohorts of people in north Kildare who are experiencing this housing crisis.  They are left at the mercy of the markets, which we all know have no mercy.  Citizens need access and inclusion, not exclusion.  I hope the Minister will give the public participation aspect of this Bill some more attention.  We have to do better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600056#JJJ00300"><p>Two people contributed a very important concept to our understanding of modern society: Hegel and Karl Marx.  They spoke of the concept of alienation, which was brilliantly captured by Edvard Munch's famous painting, The Scream.  While there are advantages to meetings on Zoom and Teams, the substitution for real human social interaction of endless Zoom and Teams meetings for all time to come with regard to how we interact to discuss the future of society is the definition of alienation.  We will have a nation of people mimicking the scream depicted in Edvard Munch's painting.  It is a horrible vista which I find fundamentally objectionable.  It is an unfortunate reality that, in the midst of Covid, we have to live on Zoom and Teams.  Even in a world without Covid, there would be times where such technologies would be useful.  We have learnt something from the use of this technology.  The idea that such meetings would permanently replace actual public meetings of human beings - although God knows where it will end as it may spread to education and all sorts of other absolutely vital human interactions - is, frankly, a terrifying and borderline dystopian vista.  I absolutely object to this.</p>  <p>  This relates to another issue which has been alluded to.  I object to the fact that we are dealing with all of these matters together.  There are things in the Bill that are modestly progressive.  I do not want to get in the way of these things, but I really fundamentally object to local authorities permanently having the option to replace public meetings with regard to development plans.  There is not a shadow of a doubt but that it will set a precedent for issues far beyond those public meetings.  It strikes at our fundamental nature as human beings.  I mean that very seriously.  Alienation is a reality and it has very detrimental effects on human well-being.  We need to tread very carefully.  To slip this provision into a Bill comprising three or four different disconnected elements at the last minute on the second last evening before the Christmas break is just not good practice.  It is a very poor way with which to deal with very serious issues regarding how human beings come together to influence the future of their society.</p>  <p>  That is what development plans are about.  As emasculated as local authorities have become because of policy moves to centralise control over planning and other functions, this is one power they still have and it is an opportunity for ordinary people to get involved.  Coming together and interacting in a live environment is absolutely critical.</p>  <p>  I face a real dilemma.  I do not want to get in the way of this Bill but I really object to this measure.  I believe amendments have been proposed to address the issue.  To be honest, we are a small party and do not even have representation on the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage so we are scrambling even to get our heads around what is in this Bill.  There is something about residential tenancies, which is a critically important issue.  There is something on the issue I have just discussed, that is to say, development plans, democracy and public participation in development plans.  This is also a critical issue.  There is also something on the issue of substitute consent, to which I will get in a minute.  This is another absolutely critical issue in the context of the aftermath of the development of the wind farm at Derrybrien.  In building this wind farm, there was a failure to comply with the environmental impact assessment directives as they relate to public consultation.  In that case, the result was that a mountain fell down and slid into a river with disastrous consequences for the environment.</p>  <p>  Again, I cannot believe the Green Party is involved in this stuff.  Its members have seen themselves as the guardians of good planning and so on yet the party allowed this to be rammed through at the last moment.  It really annoys me.</p>  <p>  On the issue of residential tenancies, I would like to alert the Minister to something, but he has left the Chamber.  People who fall into arrears as a direct result of Covid, if they can prove that to be the case, will not be evicted during this emergency period.  I will not object to that but, to be honest, it is so inadequate it is sickening.</p> <p>I want to alert the Minister to this.  This week I went to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with tenants who are facing their fourth eviction attempt at the hands of ruthless vulture funds.  These people really disgust me.  They are using the window occasioned by the lifting of level 5 restrictions where a pause button was put on evictions.  We could go back to level 5 again in January.  As soon as the eviction ban associated with the level t restrictions was lifted, they went in ruthlessly to evict, in this case, eight tenants.  They have already driven the previous 12 out through nasty tactics, grinding down the tenants, trying to exploit loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Act such as claiming sale, refurbishment etc.</p> <p> These ordinary people who have always paid their rent are now facing eviction.  They are in the RTB and will probably lose the case this time because these guys have found a way around the Tyrrelstown amendment by evicting eight people instead of ten, which is what they really wanted to do.  They will then move on to the remaining two who are left in six months, which the law allows.  The Government allows this to happen coming up to Christmas and in the midst of a pandemic.  Putting an absolute pause on those kinds of evictions should be covered in legislation this week.  Instead we have a token measure which we will support, but it will do very little for people who face that kind of ruthless activity.  Another example of the same thing happened in Rathmines this week where the same vulture funds were on pause because of the eviction ban occasioned by Covid and they have moved in and evicted the tenants in Rathmines.</p> <p> On substitute consent, again the measure seems to be at the absolute minimum of trying to deal with this.  What do we call substitute consent?  It is retention for developments that did not really comply with environmental directives, the need for proper public consultation or the environmental impact assessment of what these developments can do.  We need to go much further in cutting out the abuse that is being done in this.</p> <p> There may be a place for retention and occasionally for substitute consent in exceptional circumstances.  However, in general it is an abuse of the planning process and it is systematically abused by developers trying to get around the planning process, as we have seen in the case of Derrybrien and we are seeing it again in Donegal.  God knows, we may see it with the Dublin Array development which is proposed to be built close to the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank.  Will there be proper impact assessment of what they will do to the Kish Bank and the biodiversity, marine diversity and so on that exists on that bank?  These are very serious issues.  I will not get in the way of the measures that marginally improve the situation from what it was.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Cian O'Callaghan have a good amendment which I hope passes, but this is not a good way to do business.</p> <p> The permanent option to have online and not physical public meetings on development plans is not on and needs to be withdrawn by the Government.</p></speech>

Kelly from Lissycasey, has repeatedly made the point about the Flemish decree.  The European Union guarantees movement of people, yet in Ireland we still insist on people who apply for permission for a one-off house in a rural area to prove they are from the local area.  In the south part of County Clare where I come from, not only do they need to prove they are local but also they need to prove they have an entitlement to live in a certain band of the county that is considered to be under urbanised pressure.  That is not in the spirit of European Union law, the Treaty of Rome and all the treaties that guarantee European freedom.</p>  <p>  Planning legislation needs to realise that Ireland is like a boat at the moment with one side, the east coast, tipping into the water because it is so laden down with overdevelopment, while on the west coast, towns like Lisdoonvarna are totally hollowed out because people do not live there anymore.  The streets of towns in north Clare and west Clare are full of "For Sale" and "To Let" signs because of the exodus of people.  Of course, there are ancillary services such as broadband, the rural post office network, local schools etc., but people should be allowed to go home and build in their locality.  The Covid pandemic has proved that there is a capacity for people to work from home.</p>  <p>  There is a flurry of applications for wind turbines to Clare County Council and local authorities throughout the country.  Wind farm developers are rushing to get in ahead of new planning guidelines on wind energy which have been drafted but have yet to be issued to local authorities.  It is wrong.  They are trying to circumvent new guidelines that would allow for wind energy to co-exist at a reasonable distance back from houses.  At the moment wind farms may be located right up alongside other properties to the great dissatisfaction and upset of residents.  The new guidelines stipulate that wind farms are only permitted 500 m from houses.  That is a reasonable rule and I urge the Minister to introduce those guidelines as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Onshore wind farms are only 40% as efficient as their offshore counterparts.  We urgently need to revamp the licensing process, which dates back to the Foreshore Act 1933, to ensure that key infrastructure off Irish shores can get the go ahead.</p>  <p>  In the last county development plan for County Clare and throughout the country several public rights of way were struck out because the Government and local authorities fear what happened in the Lissadell House case.  In my locality and in many villages throughout Clare and the rest of the west of Ireland, graveyards are sited in the middle of a field.  People need to go up through a laneway or a farmer's field to get to them.  The people have had that right of way for over a century and nobody can deny them that.  We need a mechanism in planning legislation to recognise that and, for once and for all, to codify it in the county development plan.</p>  <p>  We have an acute shortage of planning enforcement officers.  At one point we had only two in the entire county of Clare, which has a population of 118,000 people.  We need that capacity beefed up when planning in the country is being overhauled.</p></speech>

This development includes ten turbines reaching to 170 m and there is strong opposition to this proposed development among local residents who, as they describe, would ultimately be living in the shadow of these turbines for many years to come.</p>  <p>  The planning application was rushed into the local authority and has caused major distress and anger among these residents.  As far as they can see this application was pushed with little or no public consultation and during a pandemic.  Employees of the developer arrived unexpectedly at people's doors with a glossy brochure.  It is completely understandable that people were nervous and did not feel comfortable with a stranger arriving at the height of the pandemic.  This development has been planned for the past seven years, yet the community affected got just six weeks.  The people who live within 2 km of the proposed development were not even made aware of the application.  Many in the area were left with little or no knowledge and could not submit objections.  The residents rightly pointed out that many of them have poor broadband and lost valuable time accessing the planning documents as there was a long delay in these documents being scanned and made available to the public.  This is not acceptable.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to strengthen public participation and I hope it is accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600057#KKK00400"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.</p><p>I am delighted to be able to speak on this legislation.  As I was a councillor before being elected to the D&aacute;il, I know the vagaries of the planning system and the differences that can apply in how people take on the legislation that is there.  Fundamentally, we need to look at how we are dealing with rural housing.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to look at that because several issues arise.  One concerns people from a farming background not being able to build a house on that land, unless they are farming it.  That is unfair because such people are being given a site by their family and access to the site may be through the farm.  It is single access and not creating any more access onto the road.  It is important we build in that point.  One of the other speakers mentioned the Flemish decree and the free movement of people.  It is important that we afford that right to people.  The other issue which comes up regularly is that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has such influence when people want to build houses.  If TII puts in a submission to a local authority, that is it.  No planning permission will be granted and that is unfair because people spend a lot of money on getting their applications together.  Two issues must be examined in the context of the overall planning legislation, which we must look at and overhaul.<br/><br/>Another issue prevalent at the moment concerns asking people to live in towns, villages and settlement centres.  In County Galway, and in east Galway in particular, no house can now be built in settlement or growth centres such as Craughwell, my village of Corofin, or Abbeyknockmoy, and there are many similar places.  The reasons include the local authority being unable to grant permission for a private wastewater treatment plant.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has backed that up by also refusing it.  Galway County Council will also not give planning permission for single septic tanks on these sites, and neither will An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We also do not have a central municipal treatment plant, as we used to call it, in place.  What we have, therefore, is no planning permission being granted and no building going on.  We do not want people to live in the countryside, but they cannot live in the towns and villages.  It is important, therefore, that we get this issue sorted out once and for all.<br/><br/>I also want to raise the issue of subsequent consent.  We spoke about Derrybrien and we must get that matter resolved.  It is in my constituency, and it was a disaster.  We are paying &euro;15,000 a day in fines and we just cannot let that go on <i>ad infinitum</i>.  What could we have done with that &euro;15,000 per day in recent years, when we have been paying out so much money?  There are issues concerning applications for planning permission, subsequent consent and leave to appeal which are worrying.  I ask the Minister to look at those aspects.  He might solve the Derrybrien issue with this legislation, but we still need further clarity and legislation in respect of quarry owners.<br/><br/>I refer to those who cannot get planning permission because neither the local authority nor An Bord Plean&aacute;la is capable of dealing with it for the simple reason that we have serial objectors and every move is being challenged in the courts.  This is tying people up and wasting a great deal of resources.  This goes back to one thing: EU directives.  The way we have transposed them has resulted in a big log jam.  We have inertia.  We cannot get things done or move things on and that is costing industry millions of euro.  We will end up with local authorities not being able to find quarry material in the not too distant future, just as we have similar problems now in the forestry sector, where it is not possible to find any native timber.<br/><br/>We have serious issues.  We must take the planning legislation we have, have a root and branch examination of it and ensure we deliver something which is workable.  One of the things which has crept into this area of planning, and we can see it if we look at the situation involving Apple in Athenry, is that the judicial review process is a sham.  We must introduce timelines and we need to do that immediately.</p></speech>

The opinion now seems to be that county councils, and Louth County Council in particular, do not want any one-off housing construction to take place.  The current Louth county development plan severely curtails one-off housing.  I completely understand the rationale behind the idea that it would be better for people to live in large urban areas, where services such as schools, shops and hospitals are more readily available.  We must also understand, however, that people who are born and raised in certain areas would like to aspire to move back there, once they are in a position to do so.  The situation in Louth now is so bad that many people are simply giving up on their dreams to live in the area or parish where they were raised.  This is wrong.</p>  <p>  It is also wrong that planning regulations do not allow so-called "outsiders" to apply for planning permission to build their homes in an area in which they would like to settle.  I reiterate that this is one of the most contentious issues I deal with in my constituency office.  Young people who are born and raised in local areas, such as Cooley, Kilkerley, Roche, Knockbridge, Dromiskin and Haggardstown, to name just a few areas, are now effectively being prohibited from living there through no fault of their own.  One young couple told me recently that they feel these regulations are an infringement of their human rights to live in an area.</p>  <p>  A great many issues need to be dealt with in this area.  How is it right that the planning regulations can stop people living in an area they choose?  I have great reservations about this aspect.  If this was challenged in the courts, I wonder would it stand up to such scrutiny.  I am sure many of my colleagues in this House are of the same opinion.  As it stands, young couples are effectively being forced to move away from their home parish or area.  County development plans, and in particular the proposed Louth county development plan, must be challenged and opened to more scrutiny.  Many issues regarding those development plans need to be debated.</p>  <p>  We have a situation now where one-off housing is being stopped in County Louth.  However, if we look around the country, we see there is still investment in rural schools and services.  How does this make sense?  We are investing in rural schools and services.  In 20 years' time, however, if these county development plans are allowed to come to pass, we will have no young families and no children to attend these rural schools or avail of any of these rural services.</p>  <p>  Another aspect completely overlooked is that of local GAA, soccer and athletic clubs.  How are those organisations going to survive if there are no children in the area?  How is this right?  The bottom line is that we need a more joined-up approach.  At this rate, we are going to decimate the rural areas, not only of County Louth, but of all counties.  Imagine having rural areas with no young families.  As I said, we continue to invest in rural schools and services and yet the planning regulations want to stop families from living there.  What about all-rural credit unions?  If there are no rural families, not only will those credit unions disappear, but so too will the local shops.  Nobody seems to want to provide a real solution to this situation.  All the development plans seem to want to do is to stop one-off housing developments in rural areas.  We must look at the knock-on effects of this approach, such as those I referred to regarding rural schools, GAA clubs, soccer clubs, rural credit unions and local shops.</p>  <p>  Another area which needs discussion is planning density.  In Dundalk, the county council's approach is that density has to reach a certain figure before approval for a development will be considered.  I know of a situation where plans were submitted for viable and community-friendly housing developments, but it was advised that planning permission would not be granted unless more housing units were squeezed in.  We have seen what happened in Dublin when high-density housing was introduced.  Including too many housing units simply does not work.</p>  <p>  Another matter which needs discussion is the amount of land zoned for development which will simply never be developed.  It is common knowledge in Dundalk that there are situations where land has been zoned for development, but that land will never be developed.  County development plans must address these issues.  There is no simple solution to these problems.  Planning regulations have been too severe in respect of rural Ireland.  While I agree there needs to be some form of control of one-off houses, I do not think that having a blanket ban is an answer either.  Surely, in this day and age, we can come up with a viable plan so that urban and rural Ireland can develop at a sustainable rate without prohibiting people from returning to the parish in which they were born and raised.  This is a serious issue and one which needs further debate and scrutiny.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by asking the county councils, and Louth County Council in particular, to have a more joined-up approach when drafting these county development plans.  It is an opportunity to bring more life into rural Ireland, rather than sucking the life out of it.  If we are serious about protecting rural Ireland, then we must be supportive of the idea that young families cannot be prohibited from moving back to their home parishes or villages.  The closing date for submissions in respect of the County Louth development plan is 12 noon on 23 December.  I plead with the Minister to intervene, contact Louth County Council and ask for that closing date to be extended.  Many people cannot get into county buildings or use the Internet.  Most other local authorities are doing what I requested, so I ask the Minister to intervene and ask Louth County Council to extend the deadline.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be taking note of these plans and of the desires and aspirations of local authorities in regard to how they develop their counties.  While having some flexibility, it should not be allowed to deviate from the core of a plan.</p> <p> Irish Water is a big issue in rural Ireland.  In my own county, the villages of Thomastown, Inistioge and The Rower are deprived of continued constructive development because they have poor water systems.  This must be addressed by way of immediate funding.  We have waited far too long for this funding to be put in place.  There is now an urgent need to prioritise, or to allow the county councils in each of the counties to prioritise, where the investment needs to take place.  There are some estates that are not finished and require essential services to be provided through Irish Water but that is not happening.  Some of the estates that are completed are having difficulty getting final clearance from Irish Water for the systems that have been put in place.  All of this is being delayed by heavy bureaucracy and that needs to be lightened.   I ask that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would immediately investigate and prioritise the rural schemes that are needed to allow villages to develop and move on.</p> <p> I want to raise the issue of quarries.  I have written to the Minister about this issue and I have also raised it publicly and with Laois County Council.  In the case of a quarry which has been developed but for which there is no planning permission historically - it needs to fulfil its planning obligations by reinstating the land, but that is not happening - we need the Minister or the departmental officials to insist that the local authorities act to protect our environment, support the people who live in the area and expect the lands to be reinstated.  Where this is not happening, there must be some mechanism whereby the Department or An Bord Plean&aacute;la can intervene immediately and deal with the matter.  Otherwise, we are leaving the matter open to continued argument and contention between the local government in question - I am citing Laois County Council as an example - and an individual and that is an unfair playing field.  Local government must put right the wrong that is being done in that county, allow the public consultation to take place and ensure the individuals concerned who wish to have the quarries properly wound up and closed have a voice.  That is not happening at the moment.  I urge the Minister to take a look at the representations he has received in relation to this issue and to take constructive action.</p></speech>

The plan is at a very advanced stage.  Covid-19 has meant the development plan process is prolonged and is happening in a hybrid manner online and offline simultaneously.  I am not for one second suggesting that people are not doing their best in difficult circumstances but there is, in my opinion, a failure to understand the nature of local government representation in Ireland.  Many councillors are part-time, and most of them are holding down full-time or part-time work as well, some of it deemed essential.  As a result, we have councillors missing votes, voting online while at work and, quite concerningly, in at least one case in Meath being reported to the Garda for Covid non-compliance for trying to do the work of development plan deliberation, which involves thrashing out issues.  I am of the opinion that it can be done this way, but it cannot be done right this way.  I ask the Minister to re-evaluate and assess the process that is being undertaken in terms of county development plan reviews, in particular the current Meath county development plan review.</p></speech>

The Aarhus Convention highlights the importance of public consultation and transparency.  I would like to speak about the lack of consultation in an oral hearing, which was held virtually, involving Irish Cement Limited at Castlemungret and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Is the Minister aware that the objectors were kept in a virtual holding room prior to giving their statement?  Does that seem fair?</p>  <p>  In Limerick, the biggest infrastructure project is the M20 motorway from Limerick to Cork.  Earlier this week, I invited the project co-ordinator to speak to some of my constituents via Zoom, which will happen tomorrow evening at 7.30 p.m..  I never realised how important an issue broadband connectivity is until the phones in my office started hopping again this evening with calls from people saying they will be unable to connect to the meeting because their broadband speed is not good enough to allow them to connect to it.  Some people do not have access to the Internet.  I mentioned earlier today that there are over 21,000 houses in Limerick without adequate broadband services.  This means they will not have an input into the meeting.  The project co-ordinator is also holding one-on-one meetings and the deadline for these meetings has been extended until 15 January to enable people to raise their objections.</p>  <p>  The 2040 plan will stop all building in rural Ireland.  I have been involved in construction and building houses all of my life.  I was a councillor before I became a Deputy.  All of the regulations have been put in place.  Fianna F&aacute;il voted for 2040 plan.  Is the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, aware that when a person goes to the expense of seeking planning permission in an area, even if he or she is from the area and meets all of the criteria, if another person objects for some unknown reason and the matter goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the objection is being upheld under the 2040 plan?  Did the Minister know this?  People who are spending thousands of euro in order to live in rural Ireland, in the home place where they grew up, are being discriminated against by Fianna F&aacute;il because it voted for the plan.</p>  <p>  Some of the local authorities are moving to close down all consultation.  This would allow those local authorities to move to online meetings permanently.  The recent ESRI report highlights the goals of the national development framework, Project Ireland 2040, and shows an increase in housing demand, particularly in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford.  The report also highlights the urgent need for the national planning framework 2040 plan to be debated annually and voted upon in the D&aacute;il.  This is an absolute necessity.  The ESRI collects independent research and remains committed to do this work, and it is free from political bias.</p>  <p>  If the Minister wanted to build a house in County Limerick, he would have to pay planning contributions.  Those contributions pay for infrastructure such as a sewerage system which is non-existent because the person has to put in place his or her own system at massive expense of &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000; roads which are poorly maintained because the local authorities are not being given sufficient funding; and an upfront of contribution of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  The upfront cost for anyone who wants to build to live in rural Ireland, in terms of planning for a biosystem, contributions and an ESB connection, is &euro;23,000 to &euro;24,000.</p>  <p>All the Government has done is increase the tax on fuel for people in Ireland who do not have transport infrastructure, so it will cost them more to go to work, to get their groceries, to go to school or to do anything because there is no infrastructure.  This 2040 plan needs to be reversed and the Government should look after the people who are looking after it.  It is taxing us to death with everything, including fossil fuels, because it has left us with no infrastructure.  If people want to build in rural Ireland, it taxes them even more.</p></speech>

The Minister was in opposition as spokesman on planning and the environment for long enough.  To bring forward this kind of Bill in the eleventh and a half hour before Christmas, c&uacute;pla l&aacute; roimh an Nollaig, is shocking.  The Minister is only new and I wish him well in his job, but there is huge disconcertment and disconnect between the Executive and the democratic system in this country.  It is shameful that we could be fined up &euro;15 million for ineptitude and for the lethargic and disgraceful executives who would not do the work they are paid to do, which they have a right to do and should do.  They will not do it.  They will pay these fines and there could be tens of millions more.  How many other ways are we being fined by the European Parliament?  Deputy O'Donoghue and I met a very eminent gentleman last night who knows a lot about Europe and what is going on there.  There are many areas in Europe that we could learn from and get solace for our people who are in trouble, such as homeowners, farmers and businesspeople, but the Government will not invoke any of those.  It will take the fines and be the good boys of Europe.  This is outrageous.</p>  <p>  There are many areas in the plan and this Covid situation is a silent takeover by the executives and by county councils.  The county development plans should all be stopped in their tracks for the duration of Covid.  We can amend legislation here and the Government can even bring in hearsay legislation to suit the banks and the vulture funds in the middle of this pandemic so we should stop this in its tracks, because people cannot have public meetings.  They have to have public meetings.  There is little engagement and a lot of disrespect for the public from senior planners.  In my own county, up to 200 submissions have been made on the Cahir local area plan.  My daughter, who is a councillor, was informed that there is a meeting on it next week and she is not happy because they are not listening to the public.  It is just a token exercise.  Our county development plan is the same, while the 2040 plan ruination is raining all over Ireland.  Nothing can be done while all those situations are going on.  It is just unbelievable.</p>  <p>  The whole area around protected structures needs to be examined because it is putting crippling prices on people with thatched houses.  They were deemed lovely and nice to keep but they cannot live in them and they cannot keep them maintained.  Where is the money for that going to come from?  It is the same with other buildings and facades, as Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned.</p>  <p>  I also want to talk about the situation regarding the Land Development Agency.  As I said, the plans should be stopped but when they start, and they will be starting soon, the councillors in Tipperary can do all they like about it, make the plan and the rest - as is their divine right and their reserved function - but they can be overruled by the Land Development Agency.  It is another layer the Government put in.  It is to hell or to Connacht for the people with this Government and successive Governments.  This is part of the greater plan and this is why I am so suspicious about Covid, what is being done under the cloak of Covid and the silent takeover.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the alienation of people.  It is shocking.  It is happening right across the world and more so in Europe.  B&eacute;al d&uacute;nta and eyes closed, fear stalks the land.  The Government arrested a publican in Mayo who was saving his business by doing antigen tests and it threatened a priest in Cavan.  Six garda&iacute;, including two female sergeants and four garda&iacute;, visited him on a Sunday morning to strike fear into him.  My goodness, where are we going to stop?  Six garda&iacute; came on a Sunday morning and they do not care about God nor man.  They did not care.  The Government is frightening the life out of people.  What is going on right in front of us under the name of Covid is shocking.  Covid is serious and we have to respect it, but there is blackguarding going on with the number of businesspeople who are going to be wiped off this earth.  The musicians cannot play and many more people like the small self-employed people will be gone because the Government wants them all to be paupers.  It throws them a few bob and thinks it owes them nothing.</p>  <p>  If the Minister cannot wake up and see that is what is going on, he should not be where he is because that is what is going on.  We are going to have the vaccine now.  A minute's discussion for each Member in our group is all we are going to have tomorrow on the roll-out of the vaccine.  Where is the democracy?  The founding father of Fianna F&aacute;il and Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, &Eacute;amon de Valera, must be turning in his grave at an awful rate with what Fianna F&aacute;il is doing now with democracy.  We only have a minute per Deputy to discuss something like the roll-out of a vaccine.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself with what is going on and what he is bringing in here by rushing this legislation.  He knows what has been done here in the last nine or ten years and he will do it again.  The executives will go off on their holidays for Christmas.  I mean no disrespect but they are not doing their jobs and many of them should be fired.  They are doing the job of cloaking the people, diminishing the people and alienating the people.  It is shocking what is going on.</p>  <p>  The HSE is running riot.  I just had another phone call to say it is moving another service out of Tipperary, or there are rumours of it which it will not deny or clarify.  The abdication of responsibility is shocking and so is the way the Government is blackguarding the elected people both here in the Oireachtas and down in the county councils.  It has no respect for democracy.  It is a dictatorship it wants.</p></speech>

In Cork, serious concerns are being raised by people at the minute regarding the consultation process for residents who may be affected by one of the routes of the M20.  These residents feel they are being shut out of the consultation process.  Despite my efforts, I have been unable to arrange a group meeting or consultation for the residents of Whitechurch, Blarney and the surrounding areas.  Many people do not have Internet access and many are not comfortable using the Internet or going online.  People would like to meet with engineers in person to discuss their thoughts and opinions on housing and road developments.  That is why I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and work together to come up with suitable alternatives for developments going forward.  I advise him to do that.  I am very concerned that this Bill will allow local authorities to not have public consultations and to do everything online or over Zoom or Teams.  We are trying to be positive and constructive and I ask the Minister to take that advice on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600060#NNN00500"><p>I am not sure if my colleague is here so I will take the ten minutes.  I would happily take the Government time as well if I could because this is quite complex legislation.  The manner in which this is being put through is quite unacceptable.  I do not sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I have done my best to come to terms with this Bill in the short time we have.  To waive pre-legislative scrutiny for such complex legislation is unacceptable, and to then go to the Seanad and not accept its basic amendments to change the wording to "shall" as regards having public meetings on development plans is totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  The Bill started out at three and a half pages and it is really three pages because the fourth page is the Title.  I would have no difficulty with it as a temporary measure to deal with Covid and indeed that is what the original Bill says.  The original Title reads, "An Act to amend section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000; to provide, in connection with the crisis occasioned by the spread of the disease known as Covid-19" for specific periods.  The Preamble goes on to use the word "whereas" three times, setting out each time that it relates to Covid.  That is not what it will say now.  The Minister has come forward tonight and has said that the change relating to no public meetings for the development plans will be permanent.  I have no idea where that is coming from and the Minister should take that change out.  It is ironic that the changes he is making tonight regarding public participation have come from the courts, namely, the European Court of Justice and the Supreme Court.  On a night where he is forced to act in the most minimalist way possible because of the judgments of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice, he is taking with the other hand and minimising public participation.</p> <p>I looked up the word &quot;insidious&quot; to make sure I had it right.  It is, &quot;Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with very harmful effects.&quot;  That is exactly what the Minister is doing here tonight and I will not support it.  I do not know how many times the Government has come forward with legislation because of the emergency, which is ostensibly very good, and then transforms it into something else that makes it difficult for Deputies, because they are voting for something that is minimally good but contains something very bad.  That has become a pattern with the Government since Covid came in.  I find it dangerous, insidious, and unacceptable.<br/><br/>July was an interesting month with the courts.  On 1 July there was judgment in the two cases relating to substitute consent on which the Minister is now acting in the most minimalist way possible.  The judgment noted many issues, which I will not go into as I have limited time, but I will read from its conclusion:</p><blockquote>	i. That on Issue One, for the reasons therein stated, I would hold that section 177C(2)(a) and its corresponding provision, section 177D(1)(a) are inconsistent with the EIA Directive as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in that they fail to provide adequately for the exceptionality test as demanded by that court;<br /><br />ii. On Issue Two, I would likewise hold that given the structure of s. 177, the failure to make provision for public participation at the leave application stage for substitute consent is inconsistent with the public participation rights conferred by and outlined in the EIA Directive. </blockquote> <p>The Minister has come forward in an emergency to act under that judgment from 1 July.<br/><br/>On 30 or 31 July, two other judgments were made which are interesting in the context of tonight's discussion.  One related to the Government's policy, which was very good, on excluding trawlers of a certain size from the six-mile zone.  The court said that the Government held a public consultation process which was not fair and just and was inadequate, and found that the policy was at nought.  Here was a good Government policy, but when it came to the consultation process, it did not do it well, so the policy was at nought and big trawlers are now allowed in to fish for sprat.  The Minister might ask the relevance of this to this debate.  There was a fundamental failure to understand the importance of public consultation.  Also on the same day, the Supreme Court found in favour of the concerned people who went forward on the climate action plan.  That was also set at nought.<br/><br/>One would think that any Government that was sensible would learn from that the importance of public consultation.  The courts consistently speak of the trinity in the planning laws: the developer, the local authority and the citizen.  Without citizens' active participation, many bad planning decisions would have gone ahead.  We should be thanking the citizens and residents who have who have come forward and shown courage and challenged very bad decisions.  Instead of that, what the Minister is doing tonight is insidious.  In the guise of emergency measures under Covid, he is making a permanent change and depriving the public of its right to a public hearing and telling us it is for our own good and in line with the modernisation agenda for the planning system.  It is not modernisation to prevent people from attending a public meeting.  Yes, there is a role for Zoom and online meetings.  I have attended joint policing committees and various seminars, including one on direct provision, and none is substitute for a meeting in person.  That was only in that limited sense.  For something like the city or county development plan we need the active participation of our residents and citizens.<br/><br/>I agree with every word that Deputy Boyd Barrett said; I could not put it better.  The Minister is building absolute alienation into this Bill and he is giving us a Hobson's choice.  The part relating to the protection of tenants, which is extremely limited, is good.  The part relating to substitute consent is good, but it is minimalist.  Therefore, if we vote against the Bill, we are voting against the good parts, but we have to accept the bad part.  I find that absolutely objectionable.  I find it objectionable that complex legislation like this did not go through pre-legislative scrutiny.  I find it objectionable that the Minister came forward with a three-and-a-half page Bill that was acceptable except in respect of public participation, and which was then transformed in a manner worthy of Kafka.  It is absolutely Kafkaesque.  There were three and a half pages dealing with Covid which were transformed into something entirely different, and the Minister tells us that it is for our own good.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to see sense at this stage and realise the importance of public participation in the planning process, that without public participation we are on the road to disaster.  We need active citizenry and active residents to keep us on our toes as politicians.  We know that from the climate debate.  The public - the people on the ground and the children - are way ahead of us.  They were way ahead of us 20 years ago in Galway when they led the debate against  incineration.  They did not do so in the manner of &quot;not in my backyard&quot; but they said that they wanted zero waste, and we were led by the nose to do that.  The response was to remove the power from the local authority to make a waste management plan.  We we did everything right and the power was taken from us.I had the benefit and privilege of being a councillor for 17 years and presided over a city development plan with meetings until midnight or 1 a.m. as mayor of Galway.  I would not like to repeat it and I would not be able to, but one thing I learned was that it is a David and Goliath situation with developers on the one hand and the ordinary citizen on the other.  We lose the citizens' participation at our peril and at great damage to society.<br/><br/>At the very least, if the Minister wants my support, he should put public meetings back in the Bill, that there shall be public meetings, which is what the Seanad wanted.  If the Minister does that and puts a time span on the Covid measures, he will have my support.  Then we will go back to look at making better legislation on substitute consent.  He will realise that he has been forced every step of the way by the superior courts of this country which have forced each Government to take action, which it does in the most minimal way possible.</p></speech>

I have listened to colleagues intently in quite a detailed debate.  There has been some misinterpretation around public consultation.  That relates to the pre-draft stage of a development plan only.  The joint committee received detailed briefings.  It is complex legislation but it is urgent and important.</p>  <p>  The tenancy protections that we are bringing through are an extension of the protections that I put to the D&aacute;il in July, which have worked and are very important to protect tenants and those most at risk from the pandemic.  At that time many questioned whether those protections would work.  Some said thousands upon thousands would lose their homes.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry said there would be tsunami of evictions, but that did not come to pass because the legislation is robust.  It has worked and this Bill is an extension to it  Its urgency is because the protections in that legislation expire on 11 January.</p> <p>We have to bring in those protections now.</p> <p> There was some talk about pre-legislative scrutiny and that we went into the Seanad having decided just to set aside the scrutiny process for this Bill.  We did not do so and I have explained that in a very detailed letter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that, as does the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Matthews.  We secured a slot for the Bill in the Seanad in advance of the committee responding to the request we put to it.  I gave a detailed response in writing to the committee, as I said, and I do not intend for the same thing to happen again.  I said that in my response and I apologised for what happened.  There was no slight meant on the committee and there was no attempt to get around the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I do not intend for that to happen again.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about the substitute consent process as a systematic abuse of the planning system.  The facts do not bear that out, but that does not really matter when it comes to the Deputy.  There are approximately 30 cases of applications for substitute consent before An Bord Plean&aacute;la out of 29,000 planning applications.  That is hardly systematic abuse of substitute consent.  The provisions in this Bill relate to the importance of addressing the issue of the Supreme Court decision.  The State is being fined &euro;15,000 a day.  I must have regard to that, as must all colleagues.  I have been in this job six months and I want to address that issue.</p> <p> In the context of the planning aspects of the Bill with regard to Covid and some of the changes required, the advice from the Attorney General, which I absolutely accept, was that this legislation would be a good vehicle to bring in those changes.  I explained that in detail here.  Is it something I think we will be doing often?  Absolutely not.  I do not accept that it is an insidious, creeping type of process or set of proposals that I am bringing forward in any legislation.  That is not the case.  The two pieces of legislation relating to the rental market that I have brought to the House, which have worked and are protecting tenants, were opposed by some who are, fortunately, speaking for, and in support of, these additional measures I am bringing in.  I am glad there has been a recognition that the stance taken by some people in July was the incorrect stance and that the Government's stance was absolutely the correct one.  I assure Deputies that the provisions on substitute consent have nothing to do with whether a particular application will be granted.  That will be a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> Regarding the provisions for online meetings, Deputy Mattie McGrath strayed into the area of vaccines in his contribution.  I hope, in the minute he has tomorrow, that he might clarify his position in this regard.  I say to him and Deputy O'Donoghue-----</p></speech>

I would say to the Deputies that these provisions relate to the pre-draft stage of a development plan process.  They are nothing whatsoever to do with other public consultations.  Local planning and zoning issues are not dealt with at the pre-draft stage.  It is a development plan provision and there are some Covid-related provisions that are absolutely needed.  What would we do if an outbreak of Covid within a planning authority in Limerick, for example, meant that the structures of that planning authority or of An Bord Plean&aacute;la were compromised?  That is what we are dealing with in these provisions.  They do not preclude public consultations or face-to-face meetings so long as the necessary health measures are taken.  I ask Deputies not to say that the Bill is trying to do things they probably wish it did but which it does not.  That is the reality of the situation.  I hope we will address some of these issues in more detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600063#QQQ00500"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That, pursuant to Standing Order 187, it be an instruction to the D&aacute;il in Committee on the Planning and Development Bill 2020, that it has power to make amendments to the Bill<br /><br />which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill, in relation to:  	(a) amendments to Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for the purpose of requiring An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse an application for substitute consent in the absence of exceptional circumstances and enabling members of the public to make submissions and observations in relation to the question as to whether such circumstances exist; and<br /><br />(b) amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, for the purposes of increasing notice periods in relation to notices of termination served on tenants under tenancies of dwellings during the period from 11th January, 2021 to 12th April, 2021, for failure to pay rent due and prohibiting increases in rents on tenancies of dwellings during that period.  </blockquote>  <p>The purpose of this motion is to instruct the D&aacute;il in committee that, pursuant to Standing Order 187, it has the power to make amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2020 which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, I will introduce amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2020 on Committee Stage later this evening.</p><p>The Committee Stage amendments to this Bill are twofold and comprise amendments to Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The amendments to Part 2 of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, relating to substitute consent under Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000, are as follows.</p> <p>In order to comply with the findings of a Supreme Court judgment of 1 July 2020 relating to substitute consent legislation, it is necessary to amend the substitute consent provisions under Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for exceptional circumstances to be considered in a second stage application for substitute consent at section 177K of the planning Act along with the necessary ancillary provisions to ensure that additional public participation is facilitated, where required, with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances as well as on the wider application.  Until recently these urgent legislative proposals were being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in anticipation that the amendment to the planning Act could be introduced by way of European Communities 1972 Act regulations to implement incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions to the EIA directive into national law.  The Attorney General advised three weeks ago, however, that the 1972 regulations approach should not be used and that instead the provisions should be introduced as soon as possible by way of primary legislation in amendments to the Planning and Development Bill 2020.  The necessity to introduce these technical amendments into existing substitute consent provisions in the planning Act is a matter of urgency as these provisions will facilitate the earlier resolution of the terms of the separate November 2019 judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU against Ireland in case C-261/18, the second Derrybrien wind farm case.  Without these proposed amendments to ensure that the substitute consent process is in compliance with the EIA directive, the ability of the State to meet the terms of this CJEU judgment has been called into question, with all the significant costs of delay from the accruing daily fines that go with it.</p> <p> The Residential Tenancies Act amendment to the Planning and Development Bill 2020, specifically Part 3 of the amended Bill, are as follows.  The time-critical provisions contained within the proposed new Part 3 of the Residential Tenancies Bill provide for enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and as a result are at risk of losing their tenancy, subject to certain conditions, from 11 January 2021 until 12 April 2021, effectively extending the protections we brought in in July of this year right through to April 2021.  The temporary tenancy protections provided under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 are due to expire on 10 January, and it is not possible to assess or forecast the full and continuing economic impact on tenants in the residential rental sector of successive restrictions on the movement of people during 2020 and possibly 2021.  The proposed amendments need to be introduced as a matter of urgency in this Bill ahead of the expiry date of the protections under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act on 10 January 2021.  It is critical that these provisions are enacted before 11 January to ensure that those tenants who continue to need protection due to the economic impact of Covid-19 can continue to rely on those protections for a further period until 12 April 2021.  Through the enhanced tenancy protections under Part 3, the Government aims to balance carefully and in a calibrated manner the legitimate interests of both the property owner and the tenant during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p> I look forward to our debate on the motion.  I will seek to respond as best as I can to any specific questions or legitimate points that are made.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600064#RRR00200"><p>I fully accept the need to use such a motion to introduce amendments that are Covid-related because of the emergency nature of the pandemic.  However, the use of this mechanism to introduce what is essentially an entirely new Bill to address the legal problems with existing substitute consent legislation is wholly inadequate.  It is important to remember that this issue has not just been sprung on us.  The first Derrybrien European Court of Justice case was in 2008.  The second case, as the Minister mentioned, was in 2019.  The &euro;15,000 per day fines have been accruing since then and will continue to accrue, even if we pass this legislation today, until at least June or July of next year.  That will result in a total of up to &euro;15 million in fines.  We also had the Supreme Court judgment on a related substitute consent matter in the summer of this year.  We are therefore led to believe that the Attorney General was working on regulations from July, when that Supreme Court decision was taken, through to November.  Only three weeks ago, we are told, the shift was made to legislation.  Again, this is not in any way a criticism of any official in the Department, but to expect officials to write such complex legislation in three weeks and then to give Members of the Oireachtas literally hours to consider it is wholly inadequate.</p>  <p>  My big concern about this is not an objection to the intention behind the legislation.  Modest and all as it is, I support it.  My worry is the mistakes and genuine human errors that people working late into the night on complex legislative formulas are likely to make.  One possible error I wish to bring to the Minister's attention now, in case we do not get to amendment No. 21, relates to that amendment and to the proposed subsection 6(b)(1A), the new proposal to introduce essentially a second consideration of exceptional circumstances when the substantive matter is before the board.  My concern is this: against what definition of "exceptional circumstances" will the board make its deliberations?  Will it rely on the existing legislative provisions for exceptional circumstances outlined in subsection 177D(2) of the existing planning Act or something else?  The Minister's amendment does not make that clear.  My big concern is that, as we know already, when substitute consent leave or notice applications are being considered, the existing legislative provisions of - I am forgetting the words because this is so damn complex - exceptional circumstances do not apply in all those cases.  It is incumbent on the Minister to say at some stage today whether that legislation, specifically subsection 177D(2), will apply to all substantive considerations by the board of applications for substitute consent at the second stage, as per his amendment.</p>  <p>  The Minister does himself and his Department no favours by not giving us more time to scrutinise this.  I am not yet convinced he could not have introduced a full Bill, gone through pre-legislative scrutiny and then asked the committee and the Oireachtas to prioritise it early in January.  If we had done that, we would have had more time and it would still have been in place in time for the board to consider these matters and make the decision within the timeframe it will probably make that decision by next summer.  Therefore, spending just a little more time to get this right would have been the right way to do it and would not have incurred any additional fines.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge not only the two detailed briefings we got from the Minister's officials but also the very detailed written answers they gave to the committee at my request.  I believe they stayed up until 1 a.m. drafting those to email them to us, and that has helped us enormously.  I am not convinced, however, that the majority of us, and I include myself in this, are fully assured that the text of the legislation before us does exactly what the Minister says he wants it to do, or that it is the best formulation of the text to address the Supreme Court decisions and the two European Court of Justice decisions referred to and does not contain accidental human errors, mistakes or unintended consequences.  On that basis, while I will not oppose the Minister's motion, I urge him not to get into the habit, which his predecessors did, of bringing in complex legislation at the last minute and denying the House the rightful opportunity to scrutinise it fully, irrespective of whether we are for or against the legislative proposals coming from the Government.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, this is not really the way we should be doing business.  The Labour Party has no issue with the motion as proposed, but to present the House with the emergency-type rationale the Minister has given for the Bill is not good enough.  I commented previously that it seems to be two Bills wedged into one.  As a legislative body and a Parliament, we must be equipped with the time to scrutinise Bills in a proper fashion.  When a Minister comes to the House and apologises for the lack of time but explains that there is an emergency nature to the legislation, the Government did not realise how important it was, and then expects Deputies to screech in here and the Bill to be passed immediately, it leads Members to believe that we are not giving the Bill the scrutiny and deference it deserves.  Any Bill that comes before the Oireachtas needs to undergo such a level of scrutiny.  On that basis, I do not intend to make a long-winded contribution.  The Labour Party accepts the rationale behind the motion, but to deal with such complex matters on the second-last sitting day before the Christmas break leaves a lot to be desired.  These issues have such significant implications for people who are in housing need, as well as for the democratic process of the development plan.  I repeat that if the Minister were a member of the Opposition, he would be saying the exact same thing I am saying.</p></speech>

The initial directive on environmental impact assessments has been in place since 1985.  There has been plenty of time to get this right but choices have been made not to get it right.  The first case on this issue, the Derrybrien case, was taken in 2008, 12 years ago, so there is no immediate rush on this issue such that it would necessitate the Bill going through the House without sufficient time allowed for scrutiny of it.  I remember the Minister stating how much he respects the Constitution a few months ago in the course of speaking against an Opposition Bill on housing.  He attacked that Bill on the basis that he believed it was unconstitutional in terms of trying to increase rights around housing.  He believed it was in contravention of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  What I am saying on the Bill before the House tonight is that the Minister needs to respect the Constitution in terms of our role as legislators.  It is not showing respect for the House to bring in legislation in this manner, circumventing proper scrutiny and not allowing proper time for Members to do their job on the Bill.  Earlier this year, people went out to vote for Deputies.  They elected us to do our jobs correctly.  This process is not allowing us to do our jobs correctly.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage wanted to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill but the Minister circumvented that by sending it straight to the Seanad.  That was his choice.  He can wave his hand all he wants, but this is important to us and we need to send a clear message to the Minister that this is not an acceptable way to do business.  It is not respecting the D&aacute;il or the need for proper scrutiny and proper time for it.  In my view, it is not respecting the Constitution and our role as legislators.  I ask that this be the last time that the Minister and his Department take this approach.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the hard work that has been done by the officials on the Bill.  I appreciate that it is necessary legislation, but we have a necessary role in this as well and that must be respected.  In my view, it is not being respected in this case.  It is not sufficient to state that the Government has advice from the Attorney General and it has other legal advice and, therefore, the Oireachtas does not need time to scrutinise the Bill, get properly informed on it and have proper debate and discussion of it.  I wish to state in the strongest possible terms that this is not the way to do business.  This D&aacute;il must be respected.  It must be given a proper amount of time to scrutinise and engage with legislation.</p></speech>

Actually, I will deal with them now.  The Minister should not attribute quotes to me that I never made.  I never, ever used the phrase "tsunami of evictions".  A very well known housing activist who is not a Member of this House used that phrase.  In my opinion, his concerns were just concerns, given the heroic role he plays in dealing with the homeless in this city and his awareness of how most of the people with whom he has to deal were evicted from private rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  As we are on the topic, it is disappointing, given that the Minister has brought in a number of unrelated issues in one Bill in this completely unacceptable way of doing business, mixing moderately good things with some really not good things, that he did not do something really important, such as address the issue of vulture funds evicting people and using the issue of sale as the excuse for so doing.  As I warned the Minister, as soon as the level 5 restrictions and the pause on evictions that goes with them was lifted, the vulture fund that owns St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire moved in on the tenants.  This week, I had to go down there with the tenants and face the vulture funds and their heavyweight barristers, who pretty much stated that the evictions may be immoral and driven by profit, but they are within the law.  That is essentially the argument made by the barrister for the vulture fund.  On a previous occasion, the vulture fund tried to evict ten of the tenants but the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment protected them.  The vulture fund got legal advice, reduced the number to eight and it moved to evict those eight tenants as soon as level 5 was lifted.  Why did the Minister not close that window?  Those tenants will now almost certainly be evicted.  They will then rock up at my office and the offices of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, looking for homeless HAP or emergency accommodation.  The Minister could have stopped that through this legislation if he had listened to the facts.  Similarly, I just heard today that, following the lifting of the pause on evictions,  residents in Rathmines were evicted this week in the teeth of Christmas and in the midst of a pandemic.  The Minister should have brought in a Bill to stop that from happening.</p>  <p>  On substitute consent, we will discuss the issue further on Committee Stage.  The Bill contains the bare minimum required to deal with the Supreme Court judgment issued in July and the ruling of the European Court of Justice ruling.  A lot more needs to be done.  I heard the Minister's response to my comment that there is systematic abuse of substitute consent.  I say there is systematic abuse because it involves the big guys deliberately trying to do the minimum in terms of environmental impact.  It is not the number of applications for substitute consent.  Some of these big, profit-driven developers try to do the absolute minimum in terms of public consultation and environmental impact assessment.  Substitute consent, that is, retention, is a mechanism essentially to sort of get them off the hook after the fact.  I welcome the moderate measures forced on the Minister, but a hell of a lot more needs to be done.  This will be a live issue with more developments of giant wind farms and so on, both onshore and offshore.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of real, physical public meetings not having to take place, that is justified under Covid but it is pretty depressing having to substitute real public meetings for Zoom meetings or Microsoft Teams meetings.  It is not good for the human spirit, democracy or planning.  It has been forced on us in Covid, but to make it permanent is fundamentally wrong.  That wrong move should not have been included in a Bill that we would otherwise support, albeit not with great enthusiasm, for the modest improvements it contains.  The Minister should not have included that measure.  It is controversial and fundamentally misguided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600066#TTT00100"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak again on this Bill.  I wish to raise a number of matters.  The first relates to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and how we are dealing with it and landlords.  I will put a twist on it.  It is important that the landlord is protected as much as the tenant.  In some cases if the tenant is not able to pay his or her part to the county council, the HAP scheme will not pay the rest of the money to the landlord.  This becomes a problem for everybody.  We should conduct an overview of the HAP scheme.  We should also examine the income thresholds and the thresholds of support being given to people.  There is a discretion to provide a 20% top-up, but the threshold should be lifted and the discretion should be left in place in certain cases.</p>  <p>  I have encountered a great deal of uncertainty.  Many of the landlords I know never wanted to be landlords but ended up in that position.  They end up in a situation where they are trying to pay a mortgage on a property.  When they see what is happening, they become very evasive about signing up to the HAP and are, in fact, refusing to do so.  That is putting more pressure on people who are trying to find private rental accommodation and trying to get support for that.  If the only way we can do this is through HAP, it must work for both the landlord and the tenant so it is fair for everybody.</p>  <p>  When we think about planning and the goals of planning, it can be very complex.  We must unblock some of the system to ensure it becomes less complex.  Issues arise for various reasons when trying to make housing available and to make what is available affordable.  The planning process needs to be streamlined.  I believe the planning process, in itself, is fine.  There is a statutory timeline for the local authority to issue its decision, a statutory time for objections, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in fairness, deals with the appeals to the board in a relatively reasonable time.  However, it all goes wrong when the judicial review occurs.  When that starts, there is no end to it in terms of time.  There is no statutory obligation for the review to take place within a certain amount of time.  This is creating uncertainty.  It is eating into confidence in the planning system.  In turn, that is turning people away from getting involved in developing housing.  The housing market at present is dysfunctional because very little private housing is being developed, especially in the regions.  This is something we must examine.</p>  <p>  This legislation is being introduced to solve some immediate problems, partly due to Covid-19 and partly due to the Derrybrien situation.  It is only the first step.  I would support the Minister in reforming the planning legislation to ensure we give confidence back to investment in this country and to people who want to come here.  We do not wish to see a repeat of the Apple situation in Athenry, which is in my constituency.  Likewise, we do not want a repeat of the Derrybrien situation as well.  Again, that is in my constituency.  Perhaps they are a plague on everybody in our constituency, but I do not believe so.  However, they are two prime examples where we are not getting things right at each end.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Minister has been in the job for six months.  He has a major job to do given all the responsibilities he has.  I will support every positive move he makes to ensure the local authorities can make decisions in a timely way, that they have a clear direction and that they are not fearful of legislation or legal activity.  I believe there is a legal paradise in the planning process at present where everything goes to the courts for judicial review and we end up with very little in return.  The Minister has a job on hand and I will support him in bringing about positive change.</p></speech>

I wished him well and still do, but dealing with legislation and with two issues, trying to put the good into the bad, is a type of liquorice allsorts.  If we could take out the bad parts, it would be great, but we cannot.  There is an effort to try to deal with evictions and deal with the situation of people who are forced onto the housing lists and are on them forever without getting anywhere.  However, the Minister changed the Bill fundamentally from what was introduced in the Seanad.  It had three pages, but there are now many Parts in it.  There was also no pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is a bad way to do business.  If the Minister were in the Opposition and somebody else was where he is now, he would be railing against it.  Why is the system of governance so dysfunctional?</p>  <p>  The Minister said he does not want to be responsible for &euro;15,000 per day in fines, and rightly so.  He should not be.  Why did it take so long to get this rectified?  I realise the past eight months have been difficult due to Covid, but why did it take so long to rectify something like that?  Why are we dragged kicking and squealing to resolve some issues in Europe when on other issues we are the first to implement them?  If it is to do with farm inspections or the like, we are leading the posse to terrorise farmers.  We are doing it even in the middle of the Covid pandemic, and I understand there is an EU directive that only vital inspections should be carried out at this time.  One can pick and choose.  As I said, it is like a pick-and-mix or liquorice allsorts.</p>  <p>  With regard to the planning situation, people's rights are being trodden on.  Then we can add the situation with public meetings.  The Minister tells us it is only for emergencies, such as Covid-19, but once the practice is established, unfortunately, it can last and be made to last.  I am very concerned about that.  We should not have it.  The Minister should be able to pass legislation to give this space, be it eight, ten or 15 months of a delay.  My county's urban planning is already delayed, so why can the Minister not introduce legislation?  He introduced emergency legislation to remove the moratorium and legislation relating to the hearsay clause in the middle of a Health Act to suit the vultures.</p>  <p>  The enforcement that is taking place is shambolic in the extreme.  As regards developers who built estates, there are a couple of estates in Tipperary town and they are approaching their seventh or eighth Christmas without lights.  Imagine trying to find the way around the estate.  They are fine estates really, but there were problems with the sewers and the drainage and no lights.  It is shame that families have to live through that.  It is the same in an estate in Monard in Tipperary.  It is ten years without lights.  Imagine the danger of that.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a situation in Tipperary that is unreal.  It is a shooting range, the Woodlands Range Sports and Recreations Club.  There have been criminal convictions of the owners and managers of the club for reckless trading with guns.  Windows in cars have been shot through.  The neighbours there have objected.  They are afraid of their lives, but the council has been dragging its feet for the past two years.  It goes into court every couple of months and agrees to a postponement.  There is no follow-up.  From talking to the senior executive officers, they say they have engaged a solicitor.  There is a big firm of solicitors and it sends in a junior solicitor.  He just nods and will get paid for the day, while the case is put off repeatedly.  The last day was Tuesday this week.  The neighbours have made the objections and the planning has been refused because it is dangerous and there is no access to it, for good reasons.  However, it is still going on two years later.  Families cannot get closure.  There are criminal convictions, and I salute the garda&iacute;, Superintendent Whelan and the inspector from Cahir Garda station, who had to do this.</p> <p>A lethargic effort was involved in getting the enforcement finished.  They rock into court every couple of months and the solicitor walks in and nods the head and there is a fee for the day and it is put off instead of dealing with it.  There is no specified end date, and everything is found to be outside planning.  If enforcement proceedings are taken, there should be a set timeline for them to be concluded, unless someone takes a judicial review or challenges the process in a higher court.  We must specify in legislation that a conclusion will be brought to an enforcement situation, especially if there is a dangerous situation involving the use of high-powered weapons being used on a site that has been trading recklessly.  People are afraid and they have no solace or redress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-16a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121600067#UUU00200"><p>The Bill proposes to amend the Planning and Development Act.  I do not wish to discuss that, as it has been discussed by others.  I wish to discuss the changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, because that is very important.  In August, the Oireachtas passed the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020.  The protections afforded by the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act, RTVA, will expire on 11 January 2021 and it is proposed to pass the Bill before the House to extend the protections.</p>  <p>  The RTVA was intended to provide breathing space for a narrow cohort of people who have sustained rent arrears during the Covid-19 pandemic, but it did not address the issue of rent arrears directly.  It offered no real solution for tenants in arrears and the actions required from tenants were cumbersome and bureaucratic.  When the Bill was being considered, Threshold noted that it fell short of what was promised.  These shortcomings will not be addressed by the amendments to the Act either.</p>  <p>  Threshold has put forward a comprehensive plan to address the issue and it is worth outlining some of what it says.  Threshold is concerned that the process is designed with an assumption that the rent arrears notice is valid and that the tenant requires budgeting advice.  It may be the case that tenants are funnelled into this process and away from advice on the validity of the notice.  There is a concern that tenants lack recourse to a body such as Threshold to advise on the validity of a notice.</p>  <p>  In the months since the passing of the RTVA, the experience of the Act has not been encouraging.  We understand that up to the end of October, the RTB had only received 286 self-declaration forms and only six referrals were made to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, on foot of the Act.  As with the previous legislation, a tenant who makes a declaration that is false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class B fine, with a value of between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of a criminal sanction for making a false declaration can only operate to discourage tenants from making a declaration.  There is no evidence to suggest that tenants are likely to make false declarations and therefore no need to impose a sanction.  Later sections of this Bill allow a landlord to make a declaration that he or she should be allowed to evict despite the protections offered, and no similar criminal offence is created in respect of that declaration.  The creation of criminal offences in this Bill applies only to tenants seeking to avail of its protections but not to landlords seeking to escape its operation.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of this Bill, a tenant will be required to make a written declaration to the RTB and his or her landlord that he or she is a "relevant person" to avail of the protections from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021.  He or she will be required at the same time to serve a notice on the RTB requesting it to assist him or her to obtain advice from MABS.  Within five days of making the declaration, the tenant will also be required to serve a notice on his or her landlord requesting a consultation to agree a rent payment arrangement.  It is not clear what will occur if a landlord refuses such a request, or if a tenant, as is often the case, does have the contact details of the landlord.</p>  <p>  The Bill builds on the cumbersome and bureaucratic process contained in the RTVA and adds new layers of complexity.  The low uptake of people availing of the protections of the RTVA may well be attributable to the complexity of the legislation and the difficulty in navigating the declarations, time limits and notices required.  The protections of this Bill will not automatically apply to tenants who declared as relevant persons under the RTVA where they have not engaged with the RTB to get MABS advice or entered into a rent repayment arrangement with their landlord.  It would appear such tenants will only have five days from the date of commencement on 11 January until 16 January to apply to the RTB to seek assistance and advices from MABS or to enter a repayment plan if they have not already done so.  The timeline on this is not clear in the briefing document.  It appears that people who do not act within this very short timeframe will lose their protections on 16 January.  There does not appear to be any clear rationale for this short timeframe, which takes in the Christmas and new year period.</p>  <p>  Threshold suggests that tenants be afforded until 15 February to meet these requirements, which is reasonable.  The protections of the new legislation will not apply where a tenant who makes a declaration does not serve a notice on the RTB requesting assistance to obtain MABS advice, or where a tenant is in rent arrears to the value of five or more months' rent on 10 January 2021.  There does not appear to be any need to include a provision that the provisions will not apply where a tenant is in rent arrears for five months.  Threshold recommends that the five-month timeframe be removed, which is also reasonable.</p>  <p>  The protections shall cease to apply where a tenant fails or refuses to provide the RTB or MABS with required information or documentation, as might be requested for the purposes of obtaining the requisite MABS advice.  The measure is problematic and we will have to revisit it again.</p></speech>

No one wants to come in to the House with significant pieces of legislation in a short space of time.  It is not my intention to do that on a regular basis, nor have I done so, but there is an urgent imperative to extend tenancy protections to tenants who need them.  Let us remember as well that thankfully only 2% of tenancies end up in dispute.  Just under 400 tenants, a relatively small amount, sought the self-declaration protection.  The fact that the protections are in place and that people, including landlords, are aware of the protections has a positive effect as well.</p>  <p>  We did issue 450,000 circulars to tenants and landlords.  We are actively engaged with Threshold.  I met with Threshold again on Monday, as it is part of my homelessness delivery task force.  It has an input into legislation.  I am in the process of planning a national campaign on tenants' rights and advice for next year that will run right the way through the year in conjunction with Threshold and other agencies.  That is something we should do.</p>  <p>  There is also an imperative to protect the Exchequer.  There is a reality with what we are dealing with on substitute consent.  I understand the reason Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised a point but it was not the case that these provisions were drafted in three weeks.  They were worked on for a number of months by way of them being regulations and they were then transposed into primary legislation, so a lot of the work was similar.  They were not rushed in a three-week or four-week period.  I wish to assure Deputy &Oacute; Broin of that.  That was done on the basis of the Attorney General's advice that it would be better and more robust if the measure was on a primary legislative footing.  Because of the planning element to the Bill it was decided that we would deal with substitute consent here.</p>  <p>  Let us look at what the taxpayer has had to pay already.  There was a &euro;5 million lump sum fine.  The sum of &euro;15,000 is being paid a day, which led to another &euro;2.475 million in fines every six months.  My Department is paying that fine, but I do not agree that my Department should be the one paying the fine.  Leaving that aside, I have a duty as well to try to rectify a situation where the taxpayer is being fined and the State is losing money.  We have an opportunity to resolve it, and to do so quickly.  I have taken the first opportunity to do so.  While some people may feel that they have not had the required time to assess these provisions, it has been acknowledged by most Deputies who are present in the House right now that the officials provided very detailed briefings both in person and in writing.  They answered detailed questions that were put by Members.  I do respect this House.  I think Deputy Cian O'Callaghan knows that.  I also respect Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the democratic process and the legislative process.</p> <p>I have had the honour of being involved with this since 2007 in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and I am now serving as a Minister in a Government.  As an Oireachtas we have a duty to protect our citizens.  Fundamentally, behind these provisions is an extension to the August provisions that are working.  Some criticised them at the time, which is their right, and said that these provisions would not work.  They said we would see an alarming increase in evictions and homelessness but I am thankful we have not.</p> <p> We will not be complacent about this and I know every Deputy in the House wants to ensure we can work together to drive down homelessness, protect tenants' rights and ensure people live in good, secure, permanent and affordable accommodation.  That is why this week, just last Monday, we put out a call for our first cost-rental affordable rental scheme.  These new tenancies will be tenanted in 2021 for those above the social housing limits.  The single biggest public house building campaign in 2021 will be undertaken by me and this Government next year to deliver 12,750 new public homes.  These are real measures that will be taken.</p> <p> I have taken notes of a number of comments from Deputies and we will get the opportunity as we move through the amendments to deal with them in more detail.  We have dealt with the substitute consent matter.  Deputy Canney mentioned the housing assistance payment.  I will deal with the matter of false declarations.  If a landlord makes a false declaration, it would be, correctly, an offence.  That is provided for in the legislation.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 2 amends the definitions for the Bill to reflect that new Parts 2 and 3 amending the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, respectively, provide for their own definitions for the purposes of those Parts.  Therefore the definitions of general application to the Bill itself are that:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;Act of 2020&quot; means the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020; &ldquo;Covid-19&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.&quot;. </blockquote>  <p>Amendment No. 3 provides for an amendment to the Planning and Development Act 2000 as set out in the new Part 2 of the Bill titled &quot;Planning and Development&quot;.  In this context, the definition set out for the purposes of Part 2 are those references to the Act of 2000 used in that Part meaning the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 replaces the previous reference to the &quot;Principal Act&quot; with &quot;Act of 2000&quot; accordingly in section 4, which amends section 11 of the Act of 2000 concerning the holding of public meetings for the purposes of proposed development plans.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, are also Government amendments.  Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are technical drafting amendments to reflect amendment No. 2, which provides that the definition of &quot;Act of 2020&quot; means the &quot;Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020&quot; and &quot;Covid-19&quot; has the meaning assigned to it by that Act and is of general applicability to the Bill itself.  Therefore, the definitions at section 4 of the Bill are now superfluous as a result of amendment No. 2 and are now to be deleted.</p><p>Amendment No. 18 is supplementary to amendment No. 3 to reflect that the &quot;Act of 2000&quot; has replaced the previously referenced &quot;Principal Act&quot;.</p></speech>

Recitals 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 at the end of the Bill set out the policy context in which the temporary and limited restrictions contained in Part 3, Residential Tenancies, on landlords' constitutionally protected property rights can be legally justified as a fair, proportionate and rational State intervention to achieve an overriding important objective for the social common good.  Part 3 of the Planning and Development Act, Residential Tenancies, will provide subject to certain conditions, enhanced protections for tenants during an emergency period from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 if they have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and consequently are unable to meet their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act to pay rent due and are at risk of tenancy termination.  Recitals 1 and 2 at the end of the Bill set out the policy context to allow the Government make orders under section 3 which are emergency periods during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></speech>
