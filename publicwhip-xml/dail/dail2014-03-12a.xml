I seek information from the Minister so that the public can be made aware of the various options which will inform the document CER puts forward for public consultation, with a view to arriving at a fixed price for water.  Has the Minister made a submission to CER yet on the free allowance, the social welfare support levels, the details of the first-fix policy and the level of the Exchequer subvention into the future?  That in itself, in the absence of any other concrete proposal or leak from the Government, might allow the public to ascertain the level of expense they can expect to incur.  It is especially important for the Minister to make his proposals known so that people can adjudicate on the process to date and the manner in which it has been handled.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200003#A00700"><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services.   The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The commission has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from 1 January 2015.  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted to CER in line with the provisions of the Act and CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan.  CER has indicated that in April 2014 it will be carrying out a number of public consultations, including consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties.  CER is expected to announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. </p><p>  The Government is committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage will apply.  The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by householders.  Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by CER.  I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly.</p></speech>

However, he has merely restated much of what I said at the outset.  We are already aware that the Government is obliged to make proposals regarding the free water allowance and the level of Exchequer subvention that will apply to Irish Water.  That, as the Minister has said, will form the basis of a mechanism by which we might be able to deduce the sort of costs that will be borne by consumers in January when they get their first bill.  When exactly will the Minister submit his proposals?  When he says "shortly", what does he mean?  We have heard different dates mooted in the media and elsewhere and it is rumoured that the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party will be made aware of the charges that may apply before everyone else.  It is imperative at this stage to bring clarity to the situation.  A definitive roadmap must be put into the public domain.  When will the Minister submit the necessary information to CER?  Will the Minister make that information public and will he assure me that it will be in the public domain prior to 23 May?</p></speech>

I know that the local elections are Deputy Cowen's primary concern, rather than the level of water charges.  However, I would urge everyone to be patient.  A lot of consultation is going on at the moment with regard to this matter.  When I say "shortly", I mean that in the next couple of weeks the Government's submission to CER will be ready.</p></speech>

Obviously, I will be making a submission to CER, as will colleagues and members of the general public, which will be included in the mix, with a view to arriving at a conclusion at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Minister is urging me and everyone else to have patience but it is very difficult to be patient in view of the manner in which this process has been handled and the way in which public funds have been used and abused.  We are no further on in terms of our knowledge of the level of charges because of the veil of secrecy that has engulfed this process since day one.</p></speech>

The timescale agreed between the troika and the previous Government for the metering programme and the establishment of a new company was very short.  We have simply got on with the work.  I can assure the Deputy that we will have the required Government decisions in good time to allow the regulator to publish a consultation document in April.</p></speech>

In those regulations, the Minister has not differentiated between the two, which is the problem and the nub of my question.  The regulation process is causing enormous concern.  I have heard that professionals are looking for between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 to sign off on construction and I ask the Minister to comment on that, given that he gave estimates of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,000 previously.  I have a quotation here for &euro;18,012.35 for a modest house in County Laois, for example.</p></reply>

These statutory obligations apply to all sectors of the housing and construction market, including the self-build sector.</p><p>In a self-build, the legal responsibilities of both the owner and the builder rest with the self-builder.  Under the new regulations, an owner who intends to self-build will, therefore, notify the building control authority prior to commencement that he or she is the builder and will sign and lodge the new form of undertaking by the builder.  By signing the notice and the undertaking, the self-builder declares that he or she will construct the dwelling in accordance with the design as certified; that he or she and any persons employed or engaged to undertake any part of the works will be competent to undertake such works; that he or she will co-operate with the inspection plan prepared by the assigned certifier, who is the registered construction professional required to be engaged during construction to inspect and certify the building; and that he or she will take all reasonable steps to ensure he or she will certify the works in conjunction with the assigned certifier on completion. </p><p> In regard to allowing local authorities to have designated, qualified personnel provide the final decision on buildings, the new regulations do not involve local authority approval of buildings.  The regulations seek to make those legally responsible for the quality of construction, that is, owners, designers and builders, accountable for the steps they have taken to ensure that the building complies with the building regulations.  Local authorities have strong powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Act 1990 but these remain separate and complementary to the building control regulations, including the recent amendments under SI 9 of 2014.   In these circumstances, the question of halting the implementation of the regulations does not arise. </p></speech>

I have studied the guidance, the statutory instrument and the correspondence we have received from lobbying groups.  While it is technically correct that an individual can self-build or hire his or own builder, is the builder required to be registered with Construction Industry Federation of Ireland, CIF?  This document appears to have been drafted by CIF.  Is it necessary for the builder to be the director or principal of a company?  If I am building my own house, can I hire qualified bricklayers, carpenters and electrician if I stand over their work?</p><p>  The Minister has given a cash cow to architects and chartered surveyors.  He said they will charge between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,000 but I have seen a quotation for &euro;18,000.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the potential for costs to be exploitative initially.  The same thing happened in respect of the building energy regulations introduced several years ago by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  People were charged between &euro;3,000 and &euro;4,000 for certification inspections that cost &euro;150 in the market.  The professions have tended to jump on the bandwagon to exploit the customer for what they can get.  I advise those who are involved in self-builds to shop around.  There are a considerable number of people on the register.  One does not need to be an architect to sign off as an assigned certifier;a building surveyor or engineer can also be an assigned certifier provided he or she is a member of a professional body.</p><p>  I expect Deputy Stanley, of all people, to support the new regulations in light of the experience of Priory Hall, in respect of which professionals and builders like Mr. McFeeley drove a coach and four through the regulations in order to exploit ordinary people who had to pay for the mistakes made by others.</p></speech>

A farmer who builds his or her own house will stand over the work.  We do not want to make the costs prohibitive, however.  The experience of shopping around to date is that high prices are being quoted.  The aforementioned quote of &euro;18,000 is for a modest dwelling.  The Minister clarified the big question of whether the local subcontractor, plasterer or bricklayer can be hired in.  He has stated unequivocally that if I am involved in a self-build I can do that.  However, the issue of the assigned certifier will still cause problems.  The local authority building control officers carried out good work but they were under resourced.  This could be a self-financing mechanism.  If local authorities charged &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 for carrying out final inspections, people would be happy to pay them rather than pay &euro;13,000 or &euro;14,000 to somebody in the private sector.  The final point I want to make is that housing extensions will be expensive as a result of these regulations.</p></speech>

The public lighting in one estate in my constituency was switched off last week because the builder had gone into receivership and there was nobody to pay the bill.

In March 2011, my Department launched the public safety initiative, PSI, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  Under the PSI my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5 million to local authorities from the funding made available.  To date, &euro;3.26 million has been drawn down.</p><p>  The public safety initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development.  In circumstances where the developer is merely inactive, responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard.  However, I understand that public lighting in Chambers Park has been restored. </p><p>  Budget 2014 contains a special provision in the form of a targeted &euro;10 million special resolution fund, SRF, to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments.  The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the national housing development survey of 2013 and, particularly, those developments unlikely to be resolved in the normal way through developer, owner or funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It is envisaged that the SRF should be targeted at addressing remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified for the purposes of the local property tax waiver as being in a seriously problematic condition.  My Department is currently evaluating SRF proposals from local authorities.  I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></speech>

The number of estates will increase as companies are liquidated, and they require a mechanism to transfer from category 3 to category 4 to allow them to leverage funding.  In the case of the aforementioned estate, approximately &euro;200,000 is needed for the wearing course on the road and to finish other aspects of work on the estate.  There is a commercial building on the estate and any assets from its liquidation would have gone to the Minister for Finance.</p><p>There is no bond in place in this particular estate.  I am using this estate as an example, but it is not unusual and can happen anywhere in the country.  The assets will go to the Minister for Finance and will not be available to the local authority.  The estate will be retained at category 3 unless there is a mechanism for it to go to category 4 to resolve these issues.  How will the Minister of State deal with the growing number of estates which will fall into this category?  There will not be thousands, but there certainly will be some which need to go into this process.</p></speech>

If there is anything further we need to investigate with regard to the estate we certainly will do so.  We asked local authorities to categorise estates and this information was used to draw down the public safety initiative.  We have moved on to the site resolution fund of &euro;10 million which I announced recently and on which we will make decisions soon.  The fund will be used for estates with public infrastructure work to be done, including public lighting, footpaths and roads.  It will encourage funding by developers to bring the estate fully into use and then move it forward to be taken in charge by the local authority.  This is the purpose of the fund, which will be a mechanism to address the ongoing issues which arise in unfinished estates.  We have site resolution for each unfinished estate and the intention is that gradually they will no longer be unfinished and will be either fully finished or, in a very small number of cases, cleared.</p></speech>

This is my point.  There is no site resolution on this estate of 300 houses.  The local authority picked up the &euro;25,000 tab left by the developer, but the estate cannot get into the resolution process unless it is recategorised from a category 3 estate to a category 4 estate which means it has been abandoned by the developer who has been put into liquidation.  This is my point.  The process of getting from category 3 to category 4 must be seamless where the developer is no longer a legal entity and no longer around.  It does not seem possible to get from category 3 to category 4.  This is the question I want answered.</p></speech>

Recently I chaired a meeting with representatives of all the various interests involved.  We intend to get to a point where these estates are ready to be taken in charge by the local authorities.  There are ongoing issues and I concede there are issues in some estates which are difficult to solve, particularly where the developer has gone.  We must be careful the State does not take on the obligations of private developers.  We must get the balance right.  This is an ongoing issue.  There are some difficult estates where we have not reached a position where they are resolved.  We will continue to work on them, including this one.</p></speech>

In addition, &euro;5 million has been provided for an axis 1 agrifood measure.  Of this, up to a maximum of 20% may be spent on administration costs, leaving a minimum of 80% of the funding available for projects and animation expenses.</p><p>  Of the potential &euro;300 million available for projects and animation, to date &euro;190 million has been spent on projects and &euro;12 million on animation expenses, with &euro;52 million spent on administration.  This gives total expenditure under the programme of &euro;254 million or 68%.  The spend to date in 2014 is &euro;9.58 million and I expect this to increase steadily over the coming months.</p><p>  Under EU regulations, expenditure can continue under the programme up to the end of 2015.  However, I anticipate that most local development companies will complete their expenditure by the end of 2014 with a small number completing in early 2015.</p><p>  The rural development programme has provided significant financial resources to rural communities throughout Ireland.  It has provided assistance to 6,744 enterprises, supported 2,189 new tourism initiatives and led to the creation of 2,930 full-time jobs.  In the current economic climate the value of this level of support for indigenous microenterprises in rural Ireland should not be underestimated.  Along with direct support for economic activity in rural areas, the programme has increasingly provided support for community activity which ensures the maintenance of vibrant communities that are a critical component of a healthy rural economy.</p></speech>

My calculation is that approximately &euro;110 million has yet to be spent on projects.  The Minister seemed to indicate that &euro;9.58 million has been spent after two months, which would work out at an annual spend of &euro;57 million.  On the other hand, the Minister also indicated all the money will be spent by the end of the year.  Does he accept it is likely that as the year progresses word will come back, as happens in all schemes, that projects will not go ahead and therefore the Minister needs to have more projects lined up in case this happens?  As an example, spend on the capital sports grant is never more than 90% of the money sanctioned.  It is very important that whatever happens we ensure all the money is used.  Will the Minister outline the contingency plans put in place for alternative projects if projects do not proceed?</p></speech>

This process will be continued to ensure we have the maximum spend which is essential as part of the programme.  I will contact the companies again shortly for an update on all the projects since the start of the scheme in 2009 to establish once and for all whether there can be further reallocation of the money to projects in the pipeline to ensure they are allowed go ahead.</p></speech>

It is important the money is reallocated from non-performing projects or companies.  Does the Minister have any white smoke with regard to co-funding, as his colleague at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did?  I know these programmes never run for the full seven years and there is always a delay in their establishment.  It will probably be 2015 before we see the new Leader programme.

Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  The Arigna, Boyle-Ardcarne, Roscommon central and south Roscommon regional water supply schemes were included as water treatment plant upgrade contracts to start and a network contract at construction in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2010&ndash;13.</p><p>  In March 2013, I approved the council&rsquo;s contract documents for the water treatment plant upgrades for the Arigna, Boyle-Ardcarne, Roscommon central and south Roscommon regional water supply scheme after many years of Roscommon County Council waiting for this.  Early in November 2013, I approved the commitment of the necessary capital funding of just over &euro;12 million for the scheme to enable Roscommon County Council complete the contract formalities with the successful tenderer and to commence, as soon as possible, the works involved in the design build operate contract on the scheme.</p><p>  In December 2013, I also approved the provision of funding of &euro;3.976 million to allow Roscommon County Council to complete the tender formalities to commence the network contract on the Boyle-Ardcarne and Arigna regional water supply scheme.  This approval of funding provides for the construction of five treatment plants and other ancillary works on the scheme and will also provide treatment works for areas badly affected by recent boil water notices in Roscommon.</p></reply>

In the meantime, while people are waiting for all this to happen, I ask the Minister to provide funding to the council, or whoever he wants, to get water to people in my county.  It is unsustainable for people who are already put to the pin of their collar to have to spend &euro;500 to &euro;600 a year on water.  The Minister might think that is excessive but when one has four- and five-year old children having to pour bottled water on toothbrushes before they use them, the water goes quickly, no matter what regime one puts in place.  The idea that one has to put a regime in place in the first case, that one has to stand over one's children to ensure they do not poison themselves with what is coming out of the tap, is a major problem.</p><p>  I appreciate the Minister cannot solve everything overnight and he is trying to do something but as things stand, we cannot drink the water.  We pay for it through general taxation and we deserve something for what we pay.  Mr. Jerry Grant, from Irish Water, said at a conference in Athlone he would guarantee that by the end of this year there would be no boil notice anywhere in County Roscommon.</p></speech>

I am told the Boyle-Ardcarne scheme will be finished by the end of this year and the Killeglan scheme will be finished early next year.  These will resolve 64% of the problems in the area which is under a boil water notice.  I advise the Deputy - and I will do the same - to make a submission to the regulator to take account of the issues he raised regarding boil water notices.  The &euro;500 or &euro;600 people have to privately spend, which they should not have to, is a lot of money for any family.  I intend to ensure they will get a cheaper amount of good-quality water through the local government system and Irish Water when charging comes into play on 1 January 2015.  In the meantime we will make a submission to articulate the financial and water-quality issues here in the context of the charging mechanisms that will be brought in for the remainder of the people who, unfortunately, will not be able to get quality water for a little longer.</p></speech>

They do it in other countries where there is a problem with water.  They did it in Galway when the water was polluted there.  People were given water, but they are not being given it in County Roscommon.  I am reluctant to say the water is so bad because it puts people off coming but, at the same time, we must bring this to a head.  The Government has a long-term plan, credit where credit is due, but in the short term, having to go to the local supermarket to buy five litre bottle after five litre bottle, people are choosing between buying good quality food, heating their house or getting water.  The heat is not being put on because water is the priority.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

We have a very rickety system due to historic under-investment.  That is why we must establish a new way of doing things, to deal with the issues the Deputy rightly points out.  I will examine the issues he raised and speak to Irish Water about the issues that arose in Galway and see how we can replicate them in Roscommon.</p></speech>

One aspect of that is the promised delivery of social housing units from NAMA.  Could the Minister tell us how many social housing units we are getting from NAMA?  The delivery seems to be pathetic.  I want to hear some good news from the Government that we will get serious delivery from NAMA of desperately needed social housing.</p></reply>

My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies in identifying suitable NAMA housing units and bringing them into social housing use.  By the end of December 2013, of the 4,374 units identified by NAMA as being potentially suitable, 2,055 units have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing.  Completed housing unit transfers from the NAMA loan portfolio stood at 492, with a further 104 units contracted and where completion work was ongoing.  This brought the overall total delivery of social housing from NAMA sourced units to 596 units, completed or contracted, since the process began.  Some 367 of these units were delivered in 2013 alone.</p><p>  Progress is ongoing and I expect these numbers to increase significantly in 2014.  Further information on the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county, is available on the Housing Agency's website.  Units acquired from NAMA are brought into social housing use by way of a number of existing delivery mechanisms including the social housing investment programme, the capital acquisition scheme and the social housing leasing initiative.  These are existing funding mechanisms and my Department does not distinguish the financing of NAMA-sourced units from other sources of social housing supply.  To the end of February 2014, the social housing leasing initiative, including NAMA-sourced units, has delivered 4,736 units for social housing use and expended some &euro;66.4 million in leasing costs since its introduction in 2009.  The current average per-unit cost of social housing leasing initiative units, including over 400 NAMA-sourced units, is just under &euro;505 per month.</p></reply>

Others may be in the pipeline or approved as suitable but, given the fact that NAMA has this enormous property portfolio, this is pathetic, particularly against the backdrop of 96,000 families languishing on housing lists for, in many cases, over a decade.  Is the Government on top of what NAMA is doing?  At the weekend we discovered that much of this portfolio is being sold out to property speculators such as Lone Star.  Has NAMA delivered such a pathetic amount of social housing because we have made a decision to sell off all this property, which we need, to property speculators such as Lone Star?</p></speech>

There is a big portfolio of NAMA properties.  The Government committed to delivering 2,000 units from NAMA for social housing.  NAMA identified over 4,000 properties as potentially suitable but the local authorities deemed only just over 2,000 of those to be suitable.</p><p>There is no point taking a house from NAMA that is situated in a place where nobody on a social housing list will live.  We have to be realistic.  The local authorities are best placed to identify which are suitable.  I acknowledge that it was very slow at the start but the Minister and I have had several meetings with NAMA, which has established a special purpose vehicle into which it gathers the suitable properties and makes them available to local authorities or the voluntary housing sector.  The figures I gave the Deputy show that it has escalated considerably in the past year and will again this year.  I am confident we will deliver the 2,000 units in the lifetime of this Government. </p></speech>

I take the point about properties in the middle of nowhere being of little use to anybody on the housing lists but is NAMA holding back the good properties because it wants to flog them off to speculators such as Lone Star, Apollo or Kennedy Wilson, which we have recently discovered are in the process of bidding for or buying up these massive property portfolios?  They get the good, quality buildings and NAMA offers the rubbish it cannot flog to these speculators to local authorities.  It would be a supreme irony if, on the back of a massive crisis caused by property speculators, we handed over this property to another gang of speculators while tens of thousands of families, who could use those homes, languish on housing lists.</p></speech>

I have figures for this part of the world.  In Deputy Boyd Barrett's constituency 114 properties were available for consideration and 58 of those have been completed or contracted.  In Dublin city there were 247 and 115 have been completed or contracted; in South Dublin 42 were available and 40 have been completed or contracted; in Fingal 56 were available and 44 have been completed or contracted.  House prices are going up in these areas so there is no evidence to suggest it is offering only properties where prices are low or cannot be sold to somebody else.  They are offering a considerable number in the greater Dublin area, which suggests it is not doing as the Deputy suggests.  Some of the banks have properties that might be suitable for social housing and we want to pursue those to identify other units.</p></speech>

Every effort has been made to ensure that arrangements have been in place for a successful transition to the new building control arrangements on and from 1 March 2014.  </p><p>  The new on-line Building Control Management System, BCMS, has been developed to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  Briefing and guidance on the new system has been provided for local authority staff and representatives of the key construction sector professional bodies and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, in recent weeks. </p><p>  The definitive <i>Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works</i><i>,</i> was circulated to industry stakeholders on 7 February 2014.  Standard forms of contracts used for both private and public sector projects fall to be revised to reflect the new regulatory environment.  The Government construction contracts committee and the key construction professional bodies both report strong progress in advancing this work within their respective sectors.  The Government has established an oversight group to ensure no unavoidable delays will occur in relation to critical public infrastructure projects, at a time when construction activity and employment depends significantly on public sector investment.  Briefing and guidance is available within the public and private sectors to deal with contractual challenges and procurement issues that will inevitably arise as change takes place.</p><p>  The above measures are the key supports necessary to ensure the new regulatory arrangements can work well in practice.  Concerns that the new regulations prevent a self-build situation are unfounded, as I have indicated to Deputy Stanley.  An owner who intends to self-build will, as before, assume legal responsibility for ensuring that the building or works concerned are compliant and they will be required, as builder, to sign the undertaking by the builder and the certificate of compliance on completion. </p><p>  As local authorities and industry now move to full implementation of the new regulatory arrangements, my Department will continue to work with all parties to ensure they understand their obligations and the steps necessary to meet them.  I do not intend to defer the regulations as the RIAI advocates. </p></reply>

It is noticeable in this country that we have always been good at introducing regulations but never at enforcing them and have never intended to enforce them.  That is part of the reason they were brought in.  One of the concerns of the RIAI is there is no independent oversight to support the people carrying out the inspections.  The Minister said that he has done this for major infrastructural projects but what about the people who self-build, who, with the best of intentions, employ somebody to oversee their work?  There is no oversight of that person.  The problem will be lack of enforcement when the regulations are in operation.  Does the Minister intend to have any independent oversight of the people in charge of overseeing the construction?</p></speech>

We have plenty of examples of no regulation or enforcement.

We will establish a clear chain of responsibility from before the work commences through to completion.  We will place a legal obligation on professionals and builders to confirm compliance with the regulations and our comprehensive inspection plan will ensure works are monitored.

This limit is an outdoor limit - in general, the reduction of noise levels between the outside of a dwelling and inside would be approximately 10 dB.  They also propose a mandatory setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations and that a condition be attached to all future planning permissions for wind farms to ensure that there will be no shadow flicker at any dwelling within ten rotor diameters of a wind turbine.  If shadow flicker occurs, the wind energy developer or operator will be required to take necessary measures, such as turbine shut down for the period necessary, to eliminate the shadow flicker.</p><p>  My Department received submissions on the proposed revisions to the guidelines from over 7,000 individuals and organisations by the 21 February 2014 deadline.  These submissions will be taken into account in finalising the revised guidelines.

Why has she opted for a fixed figure in the case of the 500 m distance but a variable figure in the case of shadow flicker?</p><p>  Finally, would the Minister of State clarify whether she will include the provisions in Senator John Kelly's Bill in the final regulations?</p></speech>

They will apply until the new guidelines are adopted.  That is the answer to the first question.</p><p>  On the second question with regard to minimum distance, the 500 m minimum distance is not statutory and we propose to make it statutory in the revised guidelines.  Effectively, we propose to eliminate shadow flicker in the new guidelines, but that will not come into effect until the new guidelines are established.</p><p>  On the third question with regard to the Bill, other Deputies and Senators have produced various suggestions as well as proposed legislation.  We will consider whatever comes in to us.  I have looked at some of the submissions and yesterday met the officials who are dealing with them and sorting them out into the different issues that arise.</p><p>  There are a large number of submissions.  It is an issue of considerable public interest.  We will consider them carefully.  I myself will consider whatever has come in and ensure that I am fair to all of the representations that are made.</p></speech>

For example, the compensation paid to landowners is approximately &euro;20,000 whereas in the United Kingdom it is up to &pound;50,000.  In the United States, there is a good neighbour agreement which deals with individuals whose property is not directly impacted but is within 500 m of the turbine because there are impacts in planning and sterilisation of lands and depreciation of those lands.  Why has that not been included in statutory regulations?</p></speech>

However, that is an issue that is under general discussion as well, but not one on which I, with my responsibilities, can make determinations.</p></speech>

While it is envisaged that the recommendations set out in the strategy will be addressed over a four-year period, it is also recognised that the full impact of the strategy may not be fully realised within this period, as many of the measures that require to be implemented will continue to reduce the radon risk in subsequent years.</p><p>  Successful implementation of the National Radon Control Strategy will require action from a range of Departments, public bodies and other stakeholders, and will require clear identification of responsibilities, good co-ordination between the various stakeholders and effective monitoring of progress.  Accordingly, I have established a co-ordination group, under my Department's chairmanship and comprising representatives from key Departments and agencies, to implement and track the key recommendations outlined in the strategy.  This group will co-ordinate policies and actions on radon across the relevant Departments and agencies; monitor implementation of the strategy; report annually on progress; and at the end of the four-year period covered by the action plan, make recommendations to the Government on what further actions it considers necessary at that time.</p><p>  I expect the first meeting of the group to take place in April.</p></speech>

In the actions outlined in the strategy, I am struck by how it appears to be done to minimise cost in terms of implementing the strategy.  Given the high probability of radon-affected areas in the country appears to be fairly well mapped at this stage, I wonder whether the Minister would give consideration to a targeted grant-aid or assistance programme for those who must remediate their properties or, initially, to provide a free test - the radon test costs &euro;56.90 - for those areas.  The areas are fairly well mapped and defined, and we know the areas of highest risk.  Targeting those areas, either with free testing or assistance towards remediation, would be an effective measure that should be considered.</p></speech>

We can include it as part of the home renovation scheme, perhaps, in terms of some of the remediation measures required in dwellings.  That is some help.  I am not making a big deal of it but it certainly needs to be included because it is a serious issue.</p><p>  There was no work done on this until I became Minister.  I made it a priority because the south east, the north west and the west were clear areas of identification and nothing was happening in regard to how we could deal with this radon problem which was killing 250 persons from lung cancer each year.</p><p>  There are high radon areas in almost every county, but in some parts of the country, mainly in the areas mentioned, I will consider Deputy Pringle's overall principle to see whether we can target additional resources at the areas that are identified and mapped out as the areas of highest incidence of radon.</p></speech>

As the House knows, the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and that CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015.  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.  CER has indicated that in April 2014 it will be carrying out a number of public consultations, including the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties, and the final announcement in regard to water charges will be made in August 2014.</p><p>  The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply.  The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households.  Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charge.  I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly.  Part of the consideration will be the work of an interdepartmental working group established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of local domestic water charges, in particular the concerns of families with children and single people, as indicated by the Deputy in his question.</p><p>  Local authorities have been instructed to continue with all their current charging tariffs for non-domestic customers on behalf of Irish Water pending the approval by CER of the water charges plan.</p></speech>

I want to raise further the extent to which it is envisaged at this stage that the basic water allowance will be adequate to meet a portion of the requirements in a particular household, be it a family household, a single person or an older person.  To what extent will it be possible to take into account the financial circumstances in cases where the charge, being a new charge, is likely to impact significantly on the household?</p></speech>

Again, I am disappointed that the Minister's submission has not yet been made to CER.  I am also disappointed that I have not yet had access to it but I await its publication in a matter of weeks, as the Minister said, although I would have thought it would be in a matter of days considering how long this has been going on.</p><p>  The Minister said there is an intergovernmental report that will determine what is contained within his submission.  Am I to divine from this that he has sought input from other Ministers who have a responsibility, not only at Cabinet but by virtue of the Departments they represent?  For example, to arrive at a free allowance, I presume the Department of Social Protection would have a role, and other Departments, including perhaps the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in regard to the first fix policy.  Obviously, the level of Exchequer subvention would emanate from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance.</p><p>  If that is the case, will the Minister make public the information that has been derived from that intergovernmental group and the relevant Departments contained within it?  Will they too make a submission or will it simply be formulated and put into the mix for the Minister's submission?  That being the case, will the Minister publish the information he received from those Departments?</p></speech>

What actions has she taken within her Department to look at this?  As she is well aware, rents in Dublin went up by more than 11% in 2013.  I am sure she agrees that, without some controls, this could become a very poor situation.</p></reply>

In recent years improvements have been made, for example, in regard to security of tenure and the resolution of disputes.  The Government recently approved the drafting of amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, including provisions for the establishment of a deposit protection scheme and for improved management of rental arrears cases.</p><p>  The private rented sector is an increasingly important element of the housing market, with the proportion of households in the sector almost doubling in the period 2006 to 2011.  Approximately one in five households are now renting their home in the private sector.  Against this background, the growing evidence of increasing rents, particularly in Dublin, is a cause for concern.  The most recently published data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, showed a year-on-year increase of 6.4% in the Dublin region to the end of September 2013.  PRTB figures for the year ending December 2013 will shortly be published and are expected to show a continuation in this trend.</p><p>  Nationally, the situation is complex, with data indicating that rents outside the Dublin region and the bigger cities are broadly stable while rents in cities other than Dublin are showing increases in the region of 4%.  Meanwhile, ESRI data show that the consumer price index grew by only 0.5% in 2013 and is forecast to grow by 0.8% in 2014.</p><p>  It is clearly a cause for concern that affordability issues are emerging in the private rented sector, given its importance to the overall housing mix.  Accordingly, I have sought to stimulate a debate on how to bring greater stability to the sector, in the interest of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.  Fundamentally, the situation in Dublin is a function of housing supply.  In 2006, housing completions in Dublin had risen to 19,470, or some 21% of the national total of 93,419.  In 2013, of the 8,301 houses built nationally, only 1,360, or just over 16%, were in Dublin.  The reasons for this are complex and include the current market viability of developing new housing projects, having regard to the land acquisition, development and construction costs of bringing new houses and apartments to the market, combined with the issue of the availability of credit, both development finance and mortgage credit, and certain other factors.</p><p>  The Government is taking steps to address these challenges in the property and construction sectors.  These will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing relevant improvements in the planning process, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.  Resolution of the housing supply situation is a key element in restoring stability to the market.  I am conscious of the need to avoid introducing measures that might have unintended consequences on supply and affordability.  Nevertheless, I believe there is scope to explore measures that would alleviate short-term difficulties pending a return to equilibrium in the market.  Accordingly, I have asked the PRTB to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to me with policy recommendations in that regard before the end of June.</p></speech>

It is interesting that France and Germany are introducing measures to target rents in large cities and high-demand areas such as Berlin, Munich and Paris.</p><p>In Germany, landlords in the three largest cities will be unable to charge more than 10% of the average rent for comparable housing in the area.  In addition, rents must rise by no more than 15% in three years with no increase permitted in the first year.  In France, no new rental contracts in high-demand areas will be allowed to charge more than 20% per square metre above the neighbourhood's median rent.</p><p> There is little doubt that if we had more controls here, we would not run into quite as many of the problems we did even in the housing boom.  A lack of control is a big problem.  If one just lets the markets dictate and work to their idea of supply and demand, the system inevitably runs into roadblocks after a while.</p></speech>

They have long-established stable private rental markets that make up a large percentage of their housing.  We are not really at that stage yet but the amount of people living in rented accommodation is rising and I want to see that being stable for people.  This is why I have opened the debate.</p><p>  The supply issue is hugely important and we have an under supply at the moment.  The Government will be publishing recommendations in the next few weeks regarding the construction industry, which will include the area of supply in the Dublin area.  I have asked the PRTB to carry out a short piece of research that will give us the options and let us look at them.  We have not reached conclusions yet.  I want us to have that debate and to focus on that issue as well as the other elements that are contributing to the difficulties that arise, particularly in the Dublin area and other cities in Ireland.</p></speech>

For the sake of &euro;100 or even &euro;50, many people on rent supplement and RAS are being made homeless.  We gave a guarantee that people on RAS would be housed but it is not happening.  People are reporting that they are homeless.  Rent controls will be of use if there is a proper social housing that involves building social housing on a large scale.  This is what is required to keep control and level out the playing field in terms of rents.  That is the area upon which we need to focus.</p><p>  The Minister of State mentioned supply.  If she comes up with a plan to build more social housing on a large scale and if the private market is addressed, jobs will flow because there is a huge opportunity out there and it is important that we get there.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that we need to ramp that up but I do not agree with him that this will solve the problem of rents in the private sector.  We will always have a certain number of people who live in private rented accommodation and get support from the State but the problem is that other people who can pay fully for their private rented accommodation are in competition with the people who are subvented by the State and there is just an under supply.  I do not think social housing alone will solve that problem.  It is part of it but it will not solve the problem as a whole.</p><p>  We must become much more involved in preventing people becoming homeless when their private rented accommodation is unaffordable for one reason or another.  I have set up the oversight group with regard to homelessness and have spoken to Dublin City Council and other local authorities about whether we can establish some kind of preventative system whereby if a family is in danger of becoming homeless, we know that in time to intervene so we do not have to get into the emergency situation.  I am working on that.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about &euro;58 million for social housing.  She does not need me to tell her that it will need serious multiples of that number to address seriously the shortage of social housing.  Even though going back to the State providing social housing does not seem to be on the neo-liberal agenda, it is imperative that we do so.</p><p>  With more controls in the private rental sector, the Government could actually have direct investment in the industry.  We will run into a problem.  It does seem to be getting worse and the country is becoming more and more centralised.  The provinces will die on their feet bar some policy on the part of the Government to direct investment outside of the capital. </p></speech>

This is over a two-year period.  However, we must also remember that nearly &euro;60 million was cut from the housing budget for this year.  Sometimes, we play with figures and it does not always add up.  Since 2008, over &euro;1 billion has been cut from the housing budget.  That is one of the big problems we have.  We cannot keep cutting and then adding on a bit later on and massaging the figures because that is what it is.  The reality is that we need to build more social housing to address this issue.  It will not solve all the problems but it will help level the playing field.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is inevitable that the local authority housing stock be increased dramatically at the earliest possible date because some rents in areas like the greater Dublin area have increased by up to 40% in the past 12 months alone.</p></speech>

It was cut significantly during the lifetime of the previous Government and we had to cut it because of the deal with the troika which said that our capital budget was cut every year.  There was nothing I could do about that.  We have turned the corner.  I announced &euro;58 million yesterday.  The figure given by Deputy Ellis did not take account of the roll-over of money from one year to the next and the stimulus money announced in the budget which was then included in the capital programme.  We have money to bring 500 void properties back into use.  We are turning things around and will ramp up as soon as we can.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that we want to see more investment generally across the sector.  This is why the Government has been doing work on the construction sector and will be putting forward policy proposals.  Quite a lot of research is being done by a variety of bodies like the ESRI and the PRTB on the area of supply and we will use all that information to improve the situation because we have turned a corner.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200010#H01100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to open this important and timely debate on social housing supply and in particular I will focus my remarks on homelessness and the Government's firm ambition to eliminate long-term homelessness and rough sleeping by 2016.  Deputies do not need to be reminded of the human and personal tragedy that the threat or reality of homelessness can trigger in a person's life.  Homelessness is a destructive social condition that can wreak havoc on human dignity and well-being.  As a social condition, it requires a social response from Government, from the voluntary sector and from citizens.  Homelessness is an affront to every value that we assign to the concept of citizenship.  In a real republic, there is an onus on us to ensure that all citizens have a place they can call home - that is the goal of the Government's policy in this area.  I am strongly focused on ensuring that we fulfil that commitment.</p><p>  In February 2013, I published the Government's homelessness policy statement in which the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  Past policy on homelessness was driven by short-term measures and an overwhelming emphasis on emergency accommodation.</p><p>It is widely accepted that housing-led approaches offer the most positive outcomes for those experiencing homelessness.  In the past two years in Dublin, 1,500 people have moved from homeless services to independent living, with necessary supports.  This is the type of housing-led policy I want to see at the heart of homeless services.</p><p> When I published the Government's homelessness policy statement, I also established a homelessness oversight group for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group recently submitted its first report to me and a copy is available on my Department's website.  On 25 February, the Government approved the establishment of a homelessness policy implementation team and an implementation unit.  The team is tasked with implementing the homelessness oversight group's first report.  This will include the preparation and publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness and to achieve the 2016 goals for homelessness.  This practically focused delivery plan will secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports.  It will contain actions that will be direct, immediate and solutions-based.</p><p> The implementation team is representative of the key State agencies dealing with homelessness, housing and related services because the solutions to homelessness do not solely reside in my Department.  The team is being led by an official from my Department and includes a senior official from the Department of Social Protection and the HSE as well as the managers of Dublin city and Monaghan county councils representing local authorities.  The team will report on this plan to the Cabinet committee on social policy in April 2014 and quarterly thereafter.</p><p> There is strong engagement at Cabinet level on the Government's homelessness policy.  I acknowledge the supportive voices in the House and the voluntary sector for a housing-led approach.  Critical to the success of the Government's plan is the securing of a stream of appropriate accommodation in order that people can move on from emergency or temporary accommodation.  For too long, an out of sight, out of mind attitude was deemed acceptable in homelessness policy, with people spending many years in hostel or bed and breakfast-type accommodation.  A housing-led approach is radically different.  International evidence points to its high success rate and it can make the difference in the lives of hundreds of our citizens who are currently without homes.</p><p> Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue for the Government.  In the coming weeks, the Government will agree and publish its construction strategy, which will facilitate an uptake in development and has the potential to create thousands of jobs.  While no one wishes to return to the boom-bust cycle that inflicted so much damage on our economy and society, the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction.  Especially in key urban areas, we are simply not building enough private or social homes to meet demand.  I want to see a situation develop whereby housing supply closely matches our increasing population and rate of household formation.  I do not want the property sector to become another casino as it was in the past, but I want a thriving housing sector that serves its primary purpose of providing affordable housing for families.</p><p> The most recent data on the number of households qualified for housing support underpin the need for flexible and diverse approaches to be taken to increase the level of social housing supply.  Homeless households featured in these data.  There is no single solution to supply and my priority is to use all avenues available to me to respond to this housing need.  More than &euro;500 million in funding is being made available through my Department in 2014 across a range of housing programmes.  I expect that in the region of 5,000 new social housing units will be provided this year.  These will be delivered through a range of mechanisms, including continued investment in leasing and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the completion of existing capital programmes, mortgage to rent arrangements and the continued transfer of NAMA units.</p><p> As part of the public capital investment in housing, the coming 18 months will see in excess of &euro;200 million being invested to expand and enhance our housing stock.  Investment in regeneration and unfinished estates will total &euro;80 million this year and additional measures include a new &euro;68 million local authority mainstream building programme that I announced yesterday; an additional &euro;15 million investment that will bring more than 500 long-term vacant local authority housing units back into use; a new two year capital investment in housing for people with a disability, the elderly and people without homes, which will see some &euro;35 million invested this year and next; investment in partnership with the not-for-profit housing sector to expand the number of social units available; and a &euro;30 million investment in improving the energy efficiency of local authority homes, thereby reducing energy bills for thousands of families and supporting green energy jobs.  Yesterday, I was in Darndale to announce the &euro;68 million programme when a woman told me how much her fuel bills had been reduced by thanks to the insulation programme, which we started last year.  I hope that it will make a major difference to families.</p><p> There are two important strands to this investment programme.  The first is to increase the supply of new social homes.  The second is to ensure every available appropriate unit that exists is transformed into a family home.  With supply at record low levels, the second strand is important in addressing the immediate problem of supply, particularly for social housing.  Given that the scope for Exchequer-funded large-scale capital building programmes is still limited, the not-for-profit housing sector must play a key role in the delivery of social housing.  Approved housing bodies have a record of steady achievement over the past 20 years or so and greater use must be made of that sector's skills and expertise.  In particular, the capacity of the sector to attract additional external financial investment will be important.  It is actively engaging with the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and my Department in exploring new ventures for this sector that I hope to see progress this year.</p><p> My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards identifying suitable NAMA housing units and bringing them into social housing use.  As I mentioned during Question Time, by the end of December 2013, 596 units had been completed or contracted under this process.</p><p> There is a need for continued innovation to accelerate the transfer of homeless people from inappropriate and expensive emergency accommodation into more appropriate and sustainable housing and to identify the barriers and solutions to accessing a supply of appropriate and adequate housing.  During 2014, I will seek to maximise the supply of housing for homeless households.  It is largely within the various social housing delivery mechanisms that we must find the adequate supply of housing to make a housing-led approach to homelessness a reality.</p><p> Traditionally, it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an ongoing basis.  This is in part a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need.  When the homelessness policy statement was published, I announced a set of indicators to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness and, in quantifying its ongoing extent, will support the introduction of realistic and practical solutions for individuals.  It is not just a case of having figures for the sake of it.  The pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, was extended in 2013 and is operational nationwide.  It will assist housing authorities in reporting on these indicators and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness.  These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.</p><p> People become homeless for a variety of reasons and, accordingly, a variety of responses are required.  Dublin City Council recently released figures from the November 2013 count of rough sleepers, which confirmed a minimum of 139 rough sleepers across the Dublin region on a given night.  This is unacceptable.  It is an increase on the number during the previous April and is a matter of concern.  The increasing number of rough sleepers in Dublin reflects the gravity of the challenge facing the Government, the voluntary sector and other agencies in tackling the homelessness problem.  Rough sleeping is its most disturbing manifestation.</p><p> By the end of 2013, some 4,613 unique individuals used homeless emergency accommodation services in the Dublin region.  This compared with 4,837 in 2012.  The number of new presentations of homeless persons in Dublin averaged at 5.4 per day in 2013.  The daily average in 2012 was 6.8.  Dublin City Council has indicated that the fall in the number of new service users in 2013 was not as a result of decreased demand, but rather a slowing down in the number of people moving out of services into tenancies, thus reducing the number of beds available for new service users.</p><p> Despite the significant achievement in assisting 1,500 people to move from homeless services, there is an increase in the numbers presenting as homeless and, worryingly, an increase in the number of families presenting.  This is an urgent issue, particularly in the Dublin region.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the most common reason for this increase is rent arrears for families residing in private rented accommodation.  Families are served with notices to quit and I understand that they leave the accommodation immediately and present to homeless services.</p><p>Prevention measures are essential to ensure families and individuals do not become homeless.  Dublin City Council is planning to launch a prevention campaign in the coming weeks.  Measures must be put in place to ensure we know in advance if there is a danger of a family or individual becoming homeless and in order that we can intervene at that stage.</p><p> I am examining all sources of supply held publicly, privately or by NAMA which can be utilised to provide adequate emergency and, more importantly, stable long-term accommodation in the Dublin region and elsewhere.  Securing supply will reduce our reliance on expensive and often inappropriate emergency accommodation and give people security and stability.  I do not underestimate the challenge of sourcing supply given the lack of new building over the past five to six years, but I am determined to examine every available option to tackle the scandal of homelessness.  Approximately one in five households in the country is renting accommodation in the private sector, which is the biggest share of the housing market since the 1950s.  There is evidence of rents rising far in excess of the rate of inflation, particularly in cities, which suggests a lack of supply in certain segments of the private rented sector.  Other data suggest a growing pressure on rents especially in the lower segment of the market.  Rising rents carry a risk of affordability issues emerging in parts of the private rented sector.  My Department will be commissioning relevant policy research in this area, including in regard to the potential role of rent certainty.</p><p> I am pleased my Department's 2014 national homeless budget will be maintained at the 2013 level of &euro;45 million.  I am acutely aware, however, of the demand for services and the cost of delivering them.  This makes it all the more important that effective strategies are used to address and prevent homelessness and that people are moved out of homelessness and into independent living as quickly as possible.  Investment of more than &euro;50 million was provided through my Department and housing authorities towards the provision of homeless services in 2013.  Similar investment is expected in 2014.  In addition, the Health Service Executive spends in excess of &euro;30 million annually providing care supports for the homeless.  Arrangements were put in place in 2013 to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the nine regions, and this will continue in 2014.  These arrangements seek to ensure the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place to achieve the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.</p><p> Ending long-term homelessness is an ambitious target.  Success will require an enhanced level of partnership between the statutory and non-governmental sectors.  Often the discourse around homelessness focuses on figures.  Our language refers to the numbers presenting, units provided, millions spent, rough sleepers counted and bed nights occupied.  Tackling homelessness is not just about the figures.  Our driving motivation is the dignity and value of individuals and families.  It is a responsibility I take very seriously in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning.  That is why finding housing-led solutions to homelessness ranks high on my agenda.  I look forward to hearing other contributions to the debate.</p></speech>

More than 100,000 households are on social housing waiting lists nationally.  That equates to at least 200,000 citizens, which, notwithstanding the financial difficulties faced by the Government, must be acknowledged to be a crisis which is out of control.  I contend vehemently that the Government has failed to put any flesh on the bones of its lofty 2011 housing strategy.  Instead, we have had re-heated policy announcements and a failure to launch capital investment or help voluntary housing associations to finance projects.  How different was the Minister of State's announcement yesterday from what was announced in the 2014 budget?  What difference does the announcement make to a sector which is starved of funding for the disabled, the elderly and housing adaptation grant assistance?  In my county, applicants are being told their assessments will take three to five years before they even get to approval stage.  Can the Minister of State tell me that yesterday's announcement will make a blind bit of difference to those applicants?  How can she account for the fact that in this day and age a housing officer in my county of Offaly, which I have been given the privilege to represent, could say to me recently that it was not possible to deal with the representations I was making on the housing list?  He said I could publicise that fact as he has not the resources, staff or mechanisms to deal with the issues.</p><p>  There has been a vicious combination of harsh social welfare cuts and escalating rents, not only in Dublin but in other parts of the country, which is driving more and more people onto social housing waiting lists.  Homelessness levels are increasing as a result.  The woefully slow pace of property transfers from NAMA is testament to the failure of Government to prioritise the issue and provide sufficient administrative and logistical support to voluntary housing associations and local authorities.  I contend further that the Government's over-reliance on private rented property and the rental accommodation scheme will blow up in its face very shortly.  There should be no mistake about the fact that banks will call in the debt relating to many of the investment properties which are in private ownership.  When that blows up, God knows what point the waiting list figures will reach.</p><p>  I will not harp on this morning about the inability and inefficiency of Government in the handling of this issue and the failure over three years in office to bring forward a housing Bill containing concrete proposals - thinking outside the box - to meet the lofty aspirations which were in the strategy it published when it took office.  If it had been otherwise, maybe then we could see light at the end of the tunnel and a distinctive mechanism and roadmap to deal with the issues.  Instead, I will use my time to make concrete proposals which I expect the Minister of State to note, respond to and include in any housing legislation which is imminent and intended to be before the House in the current session.</p><p>  I ask that each local authority have a specific task force entrusted with accelerating the transfer of NAMA property units to social housing provision.  The current delays have reduced the social dividend of the body and compounded the waiting list problem.  The team, based in a local authority housing department, could be charged with identifying units, facilitating housing associations, co-ordinating the legal work on transfers and ensuring follow-through on necessary upgrading and investment.  Another example of the deficiencies and inefficiencies of the current approach to delivery is that in Tullamore, a number of units were identified in a housing development which the local authority was interested in acquiring.  Notwithstanding that ambition, there has been a failure by the bondholder and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Having agreed a plan to address the unfinished nature of the estate, they have gone to ground on a framework and detailed plan on the use of funds to make the estate habitable, not only for those in residence but also for those seeking housing from the local authority.  I remind the Minister of State that her Department is well aware of the issue.  I spoke recently to an official in the Department about it specifically.</p><p> The Minister of State indicated that a fund has been established.  A bond may be available but despite their best efforts in this regard, local authorities have not received an adequate response.  I questioned the Minister for Finance on this issue some weeks ago on the basis that he has a role in acquiring bonds for local authorities to be used to finish estates.  A departmental official has been charged with responsibility for ensuring this is done.  The fault, therefore, lies not with the local authority but with the bondholder, a reputable bank in which the State owns a large stake.  As far as I am concerned, the official in the Department who has been tasked with liaising with the bondholder and local authority is not doing the job properly.  </p><p> A tenant purchase scheme should be established for local authorities and voluntary housing associations, with a view to empowering people to achieve home ownership.  The proceeds of sales completed under the scheme should be ring-fenced for future investment in the construction of new housing units. </p><p> We can all identify with the issue of vacant homes.  Far too many dwellings in the ownership of local authorities are lying idle because they have been starved of funds to address the issue.  Under the direction and leadership of the Minister of State, local authorities should allow families on waiting lists to move into and refurbish such homes.  The costs of refurbishment should be gradually defrayed by a reduction in rent.  This approach would result in more housing units becoming available and would help to tackle waiting lists, while simultaneously reducing upfront costs to local authorities. </p><p> Development plans should adhere to a hierarchy of plans to facilitate the construction of homes for sustainable demand, rather than speculative construction.  They should play a strong role in the creation of long-term housing policy.  Density issues must also be addressed to stimulate greater levels of construction and keep prices affordable for ordinary households.  Housing construction should adhere to sustainable planning guidelines.  Onerous unit density criteria are having a prohibitive impact on construction levels and stoking up prices to the exclusion of low and middle income earners. </p><p> Approximately 50% of income from development levies is spent on water supply.  By virtue of the establishment by the Government of Irish Water, water supply will be subject to change under the new water regime.  This will give rise to a double charge on home owners if they are required to pay water charges and the development levy, as it currently stands.  The Government must review development levies across all local authorities and reassess the level at which they are set based on a re-evaluation of costs arising from the removal from local authorities of the responsibility for providing water. </p><p> The problems with the Priory Hall complex and many similar housing developments underline the pressing need to protect home owners from rogue developers.  I welcome the new building control regulations in so far as they address issues related to multiple units, albeit not in respect of purported deficiencies in one-off dwellings.  I ask the Minister of State to consider establishing a national database of rogue developers who fail to meet the criteria associated with planning approvals.  This database should be used to inform future planning permission decisions and the level of bonds required by local authorities.</p></speech>

As she admitted, I am making some reasonable suggestions, which I hope will be taken on board.  I look forward to the housing Bill, which has been three years in the making.  I hope the Minister of State will consider some of the suggestions that I and other Deputies will make in this debate to ensure the housing crisis is addressed in a meaningful manner.</p><p>  On apprentice labour models, the dramatic decrease in construction activity has decimated apprenticeship numbers.  Skilled labour is vital to the future of the construction industry and a reliable source of employment for young people.  Any increase in construction by local authorities and housing associations should be co-ordinated with SOLAS to maximise the training and upskilling elements of apprenticeships.  This would benefit the economy and young people who wish to work in the construction sector.</p><p>  The Minister of State will have noted an analysis published early this week of CAO applications made by young people and many not so young people who have benefited from the welcome lifelong learning initiatives encouraged by previous Governments.  The study found an upturn in the number of applications for courses related to construction.  The Minister of State has a responsibility in this regard in so far as she is able to encourage housing development and construction.  In the event that increased construction activity flows from the Bill to be published in the coming months, I ask the Minister of State to work with SOLAS with a view to maximising the training and upskilling available to apprentices.  </p><p>  I regret that I have been forced to raise my voice in making some of my proposals.  I entered this debate in the expectation that the Minister of State has provided Deputies with an opportunity to engage in an honest effort to play a role in addressing the housing crisis.  As I stated, I have been informed by a housing officer in my home county that it is no longer possible to deal with the number of representations being made on housing because the time, resources and tools required to adequately deal with the housing waiting list are not available.  The position is replicated in many other areas.  Colleagues from Dublin, Cork and other cities will agree that spiralling rents have caused the housing crisis to spiral out of control in their areas.  </p><p>  Irrespective of who was or is in government, the fact remains that we have become excessively reliant on the private rented sector and local authorities have become over-dependent on schemes such as the rental accommodation scheme.  To echo the words of Professor Morgan Kelly, it is as sure as night follows day that the banks will start to call in loans.  This will also mean calling in the properties associated with many of their loans, in which many of those on housing waiting lists are housed.</p><p>  A concerted effort is required to address the housing crisis.  I implore the Minister of State to honour her commitment, which was echoed in recent months by the Minister and Taoiseach, to introduce a housing Bill.  The legislation is required in addition to the funds announced yesterday and in the 2014 budget.  A whole-of-government approach is needed to address the serious crisis in housing.</p></speech>

What it should not be is a time for Government to give itself an undeserved slap on the back for re-announcing housing measures already declared and so far undelivered.  The latest of these is the &euro;15 million over two years for the redevelopment of vacant housing units, which will deliver a meagre 449 homes.  These are not additional houses but houses already in existence which could have been made available previously but for massive cuts to maintenance and other council services.  These houses form part of a natural turnover in the context of the death of tenants and so on.  This money has been announced a number of times, giving the impression that great strides are being made to tackle social housing.  It has also been announced time and again that NAMA is to provide 4,000 homes for social leasing.  It is rarely announced that fewer than 500 houses have been delivered, that the scheme is almost three years old and that social leasing is just another subsidisation of private landlords with limited social housing return.</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, finally clarified this morning that the local authorities have deemed only 2,000 of the 4,000 homes promised by NAMA as suitable and that the Government only promised 2,000 units.  Despite this, the number of 4,000 is bandied about by the Minister of State and the Government.  The reality is much less impressive.  Cl&uacute;id housing plans to build 400 new homes in 2014.  The State should support the delivery of social housing by the local authorities.  Voluntary housing bodies are welcome but the main source of housing provision should be local authorities.  The fact that the 449 houses to be provided will be local authority housing is positive.  We need to grow the publicly owned housing stock.  If this starts with reclamation of vacant units, so be it.</p><p>  While I welcomed the recently opened new housing in my area by Fold housing, I was not happy that this was originally publicly owned housing which was given to the voluntary bodies to redevelop.  The excuse I expect is that the local authorities cannot raise the funds to refurbish these but that is only because the Government has done nothing to open up new funding avenues.  The Government's solution is not to be creative to ensure a large varied public housing stock, which is essentially privatisation.  This is privatisation to not­for-profit bodies that do excellent work but privatisation none the less.  The Government wants to shirk its responsibility and is using voluntary bodies to do so.  I do not believe this Government wants to live up to the reality of the crisis in housing.  Slapping itself on the back for a scheme to deliver-refurbish only 449 homes in two years is a clear indication of this.  The Government is in denial or does not care.  I hope it is the former.</p><p>  The numbers cannot be ignored.  There are currently approximately 90,000 families on housing waiting lists in this State; 98,000 families in receipt of rent supplement and 25,000 on RAS.  Homelessness has worsened because of the Government's austerity agenda and failure to deliver social housing which would reduce rents and house people currently in emergency accommodation.  The statistics are shocking, particularly when juxtaposed with the claim by the Government that it will end long term homelessness by 2016.  We cannot have a housing led approach without housing.  The Government is pursuing a houseless approach.  There are approximately 5,000 homeless people in this State.  According to Focus Ireland, there was a 43% increase in 2013 in the number of people seeking housing advice to help prevent them losing their homes.  In the capital, 16 families per month, and up to five children per week, are losing their homes.  In 2013, approximately 9,237 people were homeless or at risk of losing their homes.  This compares to 7,819 people during the same period last year.  The number of people sleeping rough on the streets of inner city Dublin has increased by 88% since 2012.  Homelessness statistics are now at an all-time high.</p><p>  In 2013, rough sleeper teams from the Simon Community made contact with 4,271 people, distributed 22,700 sandwiches and hot drinks to people on the street and issued 2,500 needle exchanges.  More than 40% of those who accessed its emergency service had been homeless for more than five years.  There were approximately 136 people sleeping rough in Dublin in November last, compared with 94 in April.  Threshold states that there was a 77% increase in demand for its services in 2013.  The solution is simple.  Private housing must become more affordable and more social housing must be provided.  The provision of more social housing will curb demand and so lower rents across the board.  This requires only political will to decide what must be done.  All the major housing charities agree that the solution is political.  </p><p>  We can build more social housing.  In this regard, Sinn Fein has shown the way.  In 2012, we showed that with European Investment Bank funds and other investment funds more than 9,000 homes could be built over two years.  This is 18 times more than NAMA has delivered for leasing and 18 times what the Government is promises to have refurbished in two years.  While it would not be sufficient to end the housing crisis it would be a good start, or it would have been two years ago.  The Government only recently sought European Investment Bank funding for housing.  We have little detail regarding on what that investment will be spent.  Given recent Government schemes, I have my doubts about its likely effectiveness in tackling the shortage of housing.</p><p>  The provision of 9,000 new homes in the system would start to ease soaring rents.  This type of development could allow for rent caps to be put in place.  Rent caps can work but they have to be introduced in conjunction with the delivery of significant numbers of social housing to ensure people are adequately housed.  Much of the private rented housing in the inner city of Dublin is not fit for habitation, with most failing even the most basic of standards.  The State cannot stand by and allow slums to develop.  The programme for Government proposes exploration of alternative funding models for social housing.  Three years on the best this Government can come up with is alchemy as nothing has been brought to the table.  Even its proposition of social housing bonds has been ignored.  This scheme would allow local authorities to sell bonds using existing social housing as leverage.  It has worked for many bodies in the UK and Europe which have raised billions to build more housing, thereby overcoming the problems referenced earlier by the Minister of State in the context of the troika and loans.</p><p>  Another policy proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in and many experts in social housing is the establishment by local authorities of housing trusts which would allow them to borrow in the same way as voluntary housing bodies do.  This would open up many more options for councils to raise funds to build housing, separate from Department funding.  This could significantly increase the ability of councils to provide housing.  This policy has been ignored by the Government despite some councils exploring it.  I recently asked the Minister a number of questions in this regard but they remain unanswered.  I propose to bring this to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle.</p><p>  The Government needs to make a serious about-turn on social housing provision.  It is the key to lowering rents and ending homelessness.  It is as simple as providing for peoples' rights.  I look forward to the debate on the housing Bill.  We have a housing crisis.  Some 16 additional families per month are reported as homeless.  If that is not a crisis, I do not know what is.  Over the last couple of years, and in particular the past couple of months, I have dealt with many families facing homelessness.  I recently dealt with two families in that situation.  I also recently protested at the clinic of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in regard to a family previously in receipt of rent supplement that had to split up having become homeless.</p><p>This is the human cost of what is happening.  Families are being split up and men, women and children across the board are suffering.  We are not tackling this matter in a serious fashion.  There is a need to get real and to put a genuine house building programme in place.</p></speech>

In any event, I wish to use my time to focus on three areas, the first of which relates to the changes to rent allowance.  Those changes are pushing more and more people into poverty and onto the streets.  That is a fact.  Deputies will attest to the number of people visiting their constituency offices and stating the changes to rent allowance have led to their being forced to pay more to their landlords.  Said landlords refuse to maintain the properties in which those people live.  To be honest, some of the properties in question are slums.  I have visited a number of them and discovered they do not have hot running water or heating, that the windows are faulty and that they are damp and cold.  People are paying a portion of their social welfare payments to top up their rent allowance in order that they can live in these properties.  The only other choice available to them is to register as homeless.  Some are beginning to do so because they can no longer afford to pay.  The position in this regard must change.  This matter is not about money, it relates to a policy decision the Government took in respect of rent allowance caps.</p><p>  The second matter to which I wish to refer revolves around the quality of housing.  We have already heard a great deal with regard to the provision of social housing to people who are on social housing lists.  What about those who live in social housing?  Local authorities employ building inspectors charged with inspecting dwellings in the private rented sector.  I refer here to the building inspectors from the rental accommodation scheme sections of local authorities who are responsible for ensuring properties meet the relevant criteria before their owners can become landlords under the rent allowance scheme.  I have visited local authority properties in the city in which I live which would not pass any safety standards.  I do not say it lightly but local authorities are among the worst rogue landlords in the State.  The quality of housing in some local authority areas is shocking.  Last year Cork City Council introduced a &euro;2 rent increase, the purpose of which was to pay for boiler maintenance.  There are people in the city who are paying an extra &euro;2 in rent for the servicing of boilers which are not to be found in the dwellings in which they live.  Those people have neither central heating nor hot water.</p><p>  I am referring here to local authority housing, some of which is in appalling condition.  I accept that much of this comes down to finances.  Local authorities are being starved of funding.  We have heard a great deal about how the money collected by means of local property tax is going to go back to local authorities and be spent on improving services.  That is not happening at present.  The Minister of State visited Cork recently and she is aware of the regeneration project that is in train on the north side of the city.  As part of this project, housing that was substandard was knocked down and is due to be replaced by top quality dwellings.  To date, not one brick has been laid.  All the old houses were demolished and there are now green areas where they once stood.  None of those houses has been replaced.  There are houses in the city which are boarded up and which have been lying idle for five years or more.  That is shocking.  I have been visited at my constituency office by people who want to know why they cannot be allowed to move into these houses.  They have informed me they will redecorate them bit by bit.  They want to move into these dwellings to get a roof over their heads.  This is because they are sleeping on couches in other people's houses.  Others have informed me they and their two children are sleeping in a box room into which it is not even possible to fit a wardrobe.  As a result, these people are living out of suitcases.  They just want homes at a time when there are houses all over the city that are boarded up.</p><p>  The Minister of State just announced that funding will be made available to bring 500 vacant houses back into use.  There are 500 vacant houses in Cork city alone.  I accept that a certain percentage of dwellings must be kept idle in the context of facilitating turnaround and for emergency purposes.  However, there are houses available.  It will cost us more in the long term.  When houses become idle, the council goes in and rips out fitted kitchens, tears up tiled floors and removes wood panelling and top quality fixtures and fittings.  All of these are thrown into skips.  We are informed that this is done because houses must meet a certain standard before they can be reallocated.  Council workers then paint all the walls yellow in order that the houses in question can finally be reallocated.  When I was a councillor I raised this matter and I was informed that the reason houses could not be allocated in their current condition related to the insurance criteria and safety standards which need to be met.</p><p>  Deputy Cowen referred to the rent allowance scheme.  This is a disaster waiting to happen and it is going to come crashing down around the ears of those in local authorities.  We must face up to that fact and immediately begin to implement policies to address the social housing needs of people in this State.</p></speech>

I refer to those who are on the housing lists, those who are being pushed into homelessness and out onto our streets, those who couch surf and those who live in desperately overcrowded conditions with other family members.  These people have no possibility of getting a secure roof over their heads.  It is not an exaggeration to state that we are facing into the worst crisis relating to social housing and homelessness in the history of the State.  This crisis is the result of a catastrophic failure on the part of the previous Government, in the first instance, and it is being compounded by policy failures on the part of the current Administration.  The stakes could not be higher.</p><p>  There are many important issues with which society must deal.  If, however, a family does not have a roof over their heads, they cannot function properly within society.  How can one pursue educational opportunities, access employment, maintain one's mental health or avoid developing drugs or drink problems if one does not have a secure roof over one's head?  It is the most basic consideration and if the Government cannot deliver this for its citizens, then it is unworthy of the name.  The previous Government completely destroyed the economy because - quite disgracefully - it treated housing as a commodity for speculation and to enrich its friends in the banks and the property sector.  As the Minister of State said, that is what caused the crisis.  The current Administration, however, has compounded the problem at every single turn.  This debate is taking place three years too late, and tens of thousands of families are paying the price of the Government's failure to address this most serious issue as a matter of urgency.</p><p>  Everything to which I refer has happened in the aftermath of a period in which we built the largest number of houses ever in the history of the State.  We are faced with the greatest crisis relating to homelessness and social housing since the foundation of the State following its biggest ever building boom.  This does not add up.  There are more empty houses throughout the country than has ever been the case but we are faced with the crisis to which I refer.  In July 2012, with some 100,000 people on the housing list, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government stated it would no longer be directly providing and building council housing.</p></speech>

At the same time, rent allowance supports and caps were reduced.</p><p>I remember the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, promising us in this House that this would not cause problems or lead to homelessness and that, in fact, it would lead to a reduction in rents.  I plead with the Minister of State to put up her hands and say she got it wrong because the exact opposite happened.  Rents went through the roof and homelessness followed directly as a result of the reduction in the rent caps and this is still happening.  I recall the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, saying to me that no one would be made homeless as a result of the Government's policies.  On three occasions I have brought families to the House, including as recently as last week, who have been made homeless or who will be made homeless this week because of the reduction in the rent caps against a background of rising rents.  The landlords simply say they are sorry but that the rent is going up.  The rent allowance community welfare officers will not vary the rent caps and people are evicted.  Then, they must go to emergency homeless services and they are put in hotels or hostels on the other side of the city.  They have to drag children across the city to schools and some cannot get to schools.  They cannot function and they do not know from day to day where they will be sleeping.</p><p> It is an extraordinary situation and it is getting worse.  Deputy O'Brien is perfectly right.  Fully 80% of cases that come to my clinic relate to people facing homelessness in dire situations and I know it is the same for Deputy Catherine Murphy.  Some will be 17 years on a housing list.  I have before me a case study.  Noleen from Wicklow was renting a house for &euro;900 per month.  The landlord increased the rent to &euro;1,300 and the reason given was household charges.  She ended up in a hostel with her four children.  She now has a house on the rental accommodation scheme but the landlord refuses to do repairs and the council maintain it is up to the landlord to do such repairs.  She has been told she will be 17 years on the list before she gets a house.  What will the Minister of State do?  We need direct build of council houses.  The Government must vary rent caps in the interim to ensure people are not made homeless; otherwise, all words are useless.</p></speech>

There was a housing crisis throughout the years of the property boom, a crisis of affordable housing.  Young people and young couples seeking to start a family were priced out of the housing market by the greed of developers and bankers.  Hand-in-hand we had policies coming through local authorities referring to pathways to a home and that every homeless person would be in a home by 2010.  It was an absolute disaster.  Now, there is another policy stating that the homeless will be housed by 2016.  The situation will unfold into another disaster because the bricks and mortar and the foundations are not being put in place and there is no plan in place to deal with the issue.</p><p>  The combination of a property bubble and the housing crisis was facilitated by the previous Government's policy and it was supported by the Opposition parties in the local authorities at the time.  The Labour and Fine Gael parties supported all these policies which were pushed through by Fianna F&aacute;il in the local authorities in respect of housing.</p></speech>

Section 23 tax breaks were used to encourage a private landlord sector.  Local authorities were responsible by accepting levies instead of social housing units from developers and they attempted to maximise funding through levies throughout the country.  Absurd planning decisions resulted in a mass of ghost estates which are completely unusable when it comes to meeting today's housing needs.  It is an absolute scandal that we have arrived at the situation we face today.  The reliance on the private sector alone has led to a disaster.</p><p>  There is a severe shortage of suitable housing for rent in urban areas.  This is particularly the case in my constituency of Dublin South-Central.  Now private landlords are responding to this shortage by rack-renting.  In the past three months, rents in the Dublin 8 area have increased by 10%.  The average rent for a house in Drimnagh is now &euro;1,200 per month.  Landlords are refusing to rent to people on social welfare.  A virtual apartheid is under way and in the newspapers property is advertised with a requirement of work references only.  Potential renters have to provide a work reference which means a person who is on the waiting list and who is not working will not be accepted.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and they cannot even ring up the place for access to accommodation.  Otherwise landlords are blatantly stating that no rent supplement candidates need apply.  That is the situation people are facing in Dublin.  People have been forced out of private rented accommodation because rents have gone up.  Landlords can increase rent once a year according to the rules and regulations.  People have been told there will be an increase of &euro;150.  Many of these people are already topping up the rent.  At the moment the rent is approximately &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,025 and these people are paying extra through a second agreement with the landlord.  Now, the landlords are cheekily pushing that up again and forcing these people out of their accommodation and into a homeless situation.</p><p>  The rental accommodation scheme is a disaster in Dublin.  In one situation a family moved to Galway and gave their house in Drimnagh to the local authority for the rental accommodation scheme.  A young family is living there now but the family from Galway was forced to come back to Dublin because of a job situation.  However, they cannot move into their house because that young girl has nowhere to go and there are no rental accommodation scheme properties in Dublin for her and her two children.  Now, the family cannot access their home because we have advised this girl to over-hold and that is because she has nowhere to go except for the streets.  This is typical of the madness going on at the moment.</p><p>  The situation for buy-to-lets is equally unsatisfactory.  Many people who bought second or third properties are going through the process of their houses being repossessed.  Why does the Government not intervene and take those houses?  Many of these people simply want to see the back of these houses and have no wish to deal with the issue.  Why does the Government not intervene in the buy-to-let repossession process, take them back and let those people walk away from the situation?  Then, at the least we would have some housing stock in the city.  Far more could be done.</p><p>  This debate is simply not good enough.  There should be an urgent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which should examine the needs and what is in place.  There should be a task force made up of local authorities to examine the needs.  We need land.  The five main local authorities include those in Cork, Kildare, Dublin city and Galway.  We know where the need is.  These five authorities have 50% of the housing crisis.  The matter should be dealt with.  These areas should be targeted and we should sit down and examine the situation in an emergency meeting the week after next.  That is what we should be doing rather than debating it in the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200016#O01100"><p>I will confine myself in the main to homelessness.  I welcome a debate on housing policy although I wish we had a little more time to deal with it.  There has been a major legacy left to this Government - I completely acknowledge that.  The Minister of State has displayed an understanding of the issue.  I do not doubt her sincerity but I doubt the sincerity of the Government to give the kind of backing this crisis needs.  I would have preferred to see some other members of the Government in the House listening to the debate because this is the crisis dominating at constituency level.</p><p>  The reason for the crisis is the shortage of housing in some locations.  The caps are too low or they are below what is deemed to be the market rent.  People are being priced out of their homes although the term used is &quot;priced out of the market&quot;.  They have been trying to pay top-ups and have run up arrears from inadequate income.</p><p>  I rang auctioneers to find out why.  The <i>daft.ie</i> website and other online sites have references such as &quot;no rent assistance&quot;.  Landlords will not take tenants receiving rent assistance.  I rang up the auctioneers to find out why they will not take rent assistance and many of the auctioneers said there was too much red tape or that they could get far more without it or else they could get rent above the caps.</p><p>  In Kildare, the rental accommodation scheme practically does not exist.  I question the adequacy of the number of local authority staff dealing with housing.  A high input is needed to make the rental accommodation scheme successful but this has not been facilitated.  The only staff I have seen hired by Kildare County Council for housing are the security guards outside the building housing the section that deals with housing and homelessness.  This year alone, Kildare County Council dealt with 80 families with children in respect of homelessness.  This is not a problem exclusive to the cities.</p><p>It is happening elsewhere as well.  I have had people attending my office who are physically sick.  I have boxes of tissues on the desk because they cry their eyes out.  I have seen people stressed out and have had to refer them to Pieta House with suicide issues.  I have seen anxious children asking their parents where they are going to live.  At a time when the Government is doing good work on protecting children, we are creating another vulnerable section in society given the uncertainty involved.  Children can see the anxiety of parents who are out day and night looking for a roof over their heads.  They are not specifying where they want a home, they will take anything to avoid ending up in a homeless shelter.  </p><p> Meanwhile, people who were traditionally in homeless shelters during the good years when there was supposed to be plenty of money, are being displaced onto the street by others who were never homeless before.  This is just the beginning of an absolute crisis with serious numbers involved.  One can be sure, however, that the numbers will increase to a large degree due to the housing shortage.</p><p> Six local authorities account for half of the entire waiting list: three in Dublin, two in Cork and one in Kildare.  That is where rents are highest.  The matter must be put on a war footing because tinkering at the edges and thinking that the rental accommodation scheme will deliver a solution is cloud-cuckoo-land stuff.  Landlords are not providing accommodation because the caps are too low.  </p><p> I understand that banks are telling landlords, some of whom are accidental landlords, to get families out of houses because they will earn more by renting out individual rooms.  I have seen that happening.  The people worst hit by this crisis are families with children who constitute the new homeless.  This is nothing less than an absolute crisis.</p></speech>

Social housing in this country is at crisis levels.  Every day of the week, I receive queries from people seeking short-term, long-term and emergency housing but sadly there is very little out there for them at present.</p><p>  The demand for social housing has always been high but in recent years with the economic downturn, it has sky-rocketed out of control.  People who never thought they would have to seek social housing are now coming to me, and other Deputies, to see what options are available to them.</p><p>  Some of these people had bought properties during the boom but can no longer afford to pay the mortgage, and many have handed back their keys to the bank.  They are now relying on the State to put a roof over their heads.  Others in private rented accommodation had to leave their homes as private rents have increased.  Others have been languishing on the council's housing list for many years, some of them up to ten years or more, without any sign of being housed at all.</p><p>  With the new band system in place in Dublin City Council, the social housing list has become a black hole for thousands of people on the list.  They may now find themselves in 600th or 800th place on the waiting list, which is devastating as they face a longer wait of many years for council housing.</p><p>  According to the 2011 census, one in ten private households now lives in social housing via local authorities or voluntary co-operative housing.  This highlights the need to address the social housing situation.  This is the reality, not a dream.</p><p>  I have lobbied the Taoiseach and other Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on this issue since I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I am acutely aware of the seriousness of the situation not only in my constituency but throughout the country.</p><p>  The Government recently launched a new funding model to increase the supply of social homes provided through the not-for-profit housing sector.  The capital advance leasing facility, CALF, was launched in 2011 to renew co-operation between the Government, approved housing bodies and external finance providers.</p><p>  Under this scheme, an approved housing body can purchase or build properties with funding of up to 30% available from the Exchequer and the balance being raised under private or housing finance agency's finance.  The properties would then be made available to meet social housing needs.  Some &euro;13.5 million has already been allocated by the Department to assist in the provision of 353 housing units.</p><p>  This week, the Government announced a new &euro;15 million fund to bring vacant local authority houses back into use.  Local authorities have been asked to submit their proposals for funding under the new scheme by 28 March.  The Department will then make allocations as soon as possible and it is expected that the fund will bring approximately 500 vacant local authority units back into beneficial use this year.</p><p>  How much of this money will be ring-fenced for Dublin City Council to deal with the huge number of people on the housing list in Dublin?  This &euro;15 million fund is not enough so I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State to re-examine this matter to see if more funding can be approved.</p><p>  In Dublin city alone, there are approximately 16,000 people on the housing list.  In my constituency of Dublin South-Central there were 170 voids in September 2013.  It is unacceptable to have houses and flats lying idle when there is such a demand.  For example, there are 36 voids in the Basin Street complex.  At Tyrone Place, which is less than two minutes' walk from my house, there are currently 18 voids.  Other inner city flat complexes have equal numbers of vacant places.  It is time we opened the doors of unoccupied flats to help homeless people.  </p><p>  I am pleased to see that local authorities which access this new &euro;15 million fund will be encouraged to use the services of community-based organisations who recruit and train long-term unemployed people for some of the required works.</p><p>  At present, Dublin City Council's maintenance crews are dwindling rapidly, leaving local authority tenants waiting for up to two years to have simple maintenance problems resolved.  I am concerned that in my area of Dublin South-Central there are just two plumbers, one carpenter, two painters and 12 electricians to service city council tenants.  We must allow local authorities to recruit people in these positions, as they are really struggling to maintain their properties and carry out simple, everyday repairs.</p><p>  This week the Government launched a two-year &euro;68 million local authority home building initiative.  This is a major investment in local authority housing and will see &euro;68 million invested in building 449 homes right across the country over the next two years.  It is not enough, however, because a lot more needs to be done to facilitate thousands of homeless people, not only in Dublin but elsewhere.  The initiative is a drop in the ocean compared to what is required.  The Government should look again at providing fresh funding. </p><p>  Other new schemes under way with the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government include a &euro;35-million investment for housing for people with a disability, people without a home, and the elderly.</p></speech>

He did so in a selective and self-serving manner.  This brings the level of news management and damage limitation synonymous with the Government to a new level.  It was wrong in the context of the gravity and impact of the report.  I have been asking for this report for a number of weeks in conjunction with other issues we were discussing in the House.  However, for obvious reasons it was not ready for publication some weeks ago.</p><p>  It appears the report indicates major administrative dysfunction, the failure of management oversight and a context and a sense of material that is absolutely in stark contrast to the O'Mahony report into penalty point cancellations.  It would appear that the report is a vindication of the whistleblowers who brought these issues to light.  One of the whistleblowers was interviewed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which in itself is interesting.  At the heart of this issue is the treatment of whistleblowers in the system.  The whistleblowers in this case were isolated, undermined, denied access to records and to the PULSE system.  They were told by the Garda Commissioner that their behaviour was disgusting.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, however, brought it to a new level when on the floor of this House he said they did not co-operate with the investigations of the authorities and, in particular, with the O'Mahony investigation.</p></speech>

I ask the Taoiseach to consider that if the whistleblowers in the Neary case had been treated in that manner what the outcome would have been.  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality about this matter?  I know he finds it very difficult to unequivocally apologise to anyone, but in light of this report I ask the Taoiseach to ask him to apologise unequivocally for his misleading comments and for undermining the whistleblowers concerned.  If he cannot apologise, will the Taoiseach apologise on behalf of the Government for the treatment meted out to these whistleblowers on this specific issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200018#QQ00700"><p>Allegations were made by a whistleblower in September 2012 in respect of the operation of the fixed charge processing of penalty points.  This matter has been the subject of very lengthy discussions in this House and in committee.  There has been an internal Garda report and the O'Mahony report, both of which were referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate by the Minister for Justice and Equality which was the right and proper action.  That Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report is an overview of the two reports and the entire process.  I have not seen the report but I understand it contains a lengthy series of recommendations and the report will be presented to Cabinet this afternoon by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I understand it contains a lengthy series of recommendations which the Minister accepts and he will recommend their implementation to Cabinet.  Some of these will require some legislative and resourcing initiatives.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report and the overall review being carried out by GSOC will mean that this matter will have had intensive and very focused scrutiny about how it should operate.  I agree with Deputy Martin that the Garda whistleblower was engaged in conversation and discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate about this matter and this has probably helped the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to provide a full and comprehensive analysis.  The difference of opinion between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda whistleblower was in regard to the matter of a claim that deaths resulted from the non-imposition of penalty points.  That matter was referred to quite clearly in the report published by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony.</p><p>  The Minister will publish this report today and it will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This House can discuss the report as can the joint committee.  This will be in advance of the GSOC report which will be published and debated in this House.  The dysfunctional aspects which have come to light will be the subject of serious focus in order to put it right and make it fit for 21st century systems.</p><p>  In so far as apologies are concerned, I have already said that the Minister for Justice and Equality had one interpretation while Sergeant McCabe had a different interpretation.  That matter was the subject of intense discussion in the House.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be responding to the report when the House orders time for its discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200018#QQ00800"><p>With the greatest of respect, what is obvious over the past year is that the system tried to bury this issue and the Minister went along with that <i>modus operandi</i>, despite the Road Safety Authority sounding alarm bells with him.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, accepted the credibility of the whistleblower on this issue and I know he stood his ground with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report found about 67,000 cancellations, in contrast to about 600 in the O'Mahony report.  It is not as if there was no evidence.  The Road Safety Authority recommended that it would go to GSOC in the first instance but the Minister refused that recommendation; he had to be dragged screaming to get the report to GSOC eventually.  The bottom line is that there is no difference of opinion.  I refer to what the Minister said about the whistleblowers in this House on 1 October 2013: &quot;Having engaged with Members of this House and published material they did not co-operate with the Garda investigations that took place.&quot;</p><p>  His whole tone and demeanour was to isolate and undermine the whistleblowers and present them as unreliable mavericks who could not be trusted.  That was the import of what he was at.  There was no difference of opinion.  He said outside the House that their presentations were wild and groundless.  He should apologise.  This should not descend into narrow definitions and disagreements.  The Minister led the way in undermining people who were bringing to the surface issues of public importance, no matter how uncomfortable for some people.  The whistleblowers were undermined.  It goes to the heart of how a system and a Government treats whistleblowers.  The Minister is very culpable with regard to the remarks he made on the floor of this House.  It is quite shocking, unacceptable and disgraceful that he has not within him the capacity to do the honourable thing and say he was wrong to say what he said on the floor of the House and that he was wrong to seek to undermine the whistleblowers in this instance.  That is what should happen now and let us not continue dancing on the point of a pin.</p></speech>

It is all very well for Deputy Martin to come in here every week with his righteous attitude when he forgets that in 2003 his Government did nothing about a report.  The Attorney General gave advice in 2006 and nothing was done.</p><p>This is the first time something is going to be done about this.  The recommendations from the Garda Inspectorate report are following on from the Mahony report.  Some are being implemented now, some will require legislation, but all will be implemented.  We have the GSOC report to come, which will be published and debated here.</p><p> When Deputy Martin says it is not the case that there was no evidence around, he is right.  There are three instances from 2003 when the Government of which he was a member sat back and did nothing about it when it had the opportunity to do so.</p></speech>

As the Deputy well knows, whistleblowers in this country have always faced the wrath of those who might be affected by the issues of concern they raise.  I pointed out to the Deputy before where the Minister for Justice and Equality was coming from and where the whistleblower was coming from.  Deputy Martin does not want to focus on the important matter because his own Government, on three occasions, refused even to follow the Attorney General's advice.  Of course, he cannot remember that.</p></speech>

I will ask him the same questions as did Deputy Martin.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Garda Inspectorate report to be published today has serious implications for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter?  It would seem, from the leaks we have noted this morning, that the report vindicates the actions of the whistleblowers, Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson.  This begs the question of why the Minister attempted to discredit Sergeant McCabe - it was on the floor of this House that he did it - accusing him of failing to co-operate with an internal Garda investigation into alleged misconduct.</p><p>  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister about the Garda Inspectorate report?  Will the Minister come into the House and correct the record?  Has the Taoiseach asked him to do so and, if not, why has he not asked him?  Will the Minister apologise to Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe?  Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to apologise to Garda Sergeant McCabe and former Garda John Wilson?  They have both been subjected to a very serious, personally targeted smear campaign - of that there can be no question.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, to make an apology on the floor of the D&aacute;il to both of these gentlemen.</p></speech>

There is also the matter of his ongoing status.  Garda Sergeant McCabe is unable to perform his duties as sergeant, in line with his role and responsibilities.  Will all of the restrictions that are currently applying to his carrying out his role and function be removed and will he be restored to full sergeant status within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without any question as to his integrity?</p></speech>

As he well knows, the running of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in so far as day-to-day operations are concerned.  It is not for me to say that he must put this sergeant here or that sergeant there or these are the facilities he must make available for them.  That is completely off limits to Government, as the Deputy is well aware.</p><p>  I have not seen the report myself.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that I did speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality this morning.  I asked him if he intended to bring the Garda Inspectorate report to Government today and he answered &quot;Yes&quot;.  I asked him if it was his intention to recommend to Government that the recommendations in the report be accepted by Government.  The answer to that is &quot;Yes&quot;.  I asked whether the report would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the answer to that is &quot;Yes&quot;.  I asked whether it will be debated in this House and in committee and the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  The fact of the matter is that what happened in the past was that recommendations about this were not acted upon.  Whistleblowers did bring this into the public domain.  It is now a situation where this is the first Government actually dealing with it.  When it is all debated and implemented, we will have a system that is fit for purpose.</p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality also pointed out on the floor of the House where he differed with the whistleblower in respect of the allegations about deaths of people arising from the non-enforcement of penalty points.  He made the point to me this morning that he was very happy to note that Garda McCabe was in full co-operation with the Garda Inspectorate inquiry.  I also expect that when the GSOC report comes before the committee and the D&aacute;il, the whistleblowers will have co-operated, worked, engaged and discussed with the GSOC personnel on a comprehensive basis.</p><p>  We need to get this right now.  I hope that following the implementation of all the recommendations - from the Mahony report, the Garda Inspectorate report and the GSOC report to follow - there will be a system that is fair, accountable, transparent and not subject either to celebrity or political interference.</p></speech>

That is just a fact of life.  The Minister has performed abysmally in regard to this matter.  There is the further matter that at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts recently, the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, described the garda&iacute; concerned as so-called whistleblowers and said their actions were "disgusting".  Where does the Garda Inspectorate report, which vindicates, we believe, the claims of both Garda Sergeant McCabe and former Garda John Wilson, leave the Garda Commissioner?  This report apparently vindicates the whistleblowers, yet the Commissioner believes their actions were "disgusting".  That is a very serious matter.</p><p>  Does the Taoiseach believe that the Garda Commissioner's position is tenable while he holds to the view that the actions of the garda&iacute; concerned were disgusting, despite the fact that the Garda Inspectorate report, we believe, vindicates the claims made by both garda&iacute;?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is time now no longer to park matters for the GSOC report or any other report, review or opinion that will present?  There is sufficient information and evidence to prompt an immediate response from the Minister.  Will he come into the D&aacute;il today and make a clear and unequivocal apology to the garda&iacute; concerned?  Will he likewise make an apology to Deputy Mick Wallace, whom he also slighted in this House?</p></speech>

Elements of the O'Mahony report are being implemented.  It is intended that the Minister will recommend to the Cabinet that the recommendations in the Garda inspectorate report be accepted.  As I have said, the Cabinet will make a decision on that this afternoon.  A debate can be arranged and questions can be asked arising from this.  The GSOC report, which will come in due course, might recommend in its overall analysis of the situation that changes be made or something different be done.  It will take account of the Garda and other elements of this matter, such as issues relating to the Road Safety Authority and the courts.  All of that is part of the mandate given to it.  I hope clarity and accountability will come out of all of this.</p></speech>

This morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> reported that a Dublin family has had a debt of approximately &euro;150,000 written down by AIB and a further amount parked at 0% interest.  AIB should ultimately get the same amount of money back from the family.  As a consequence of this deal, the members of this family will stay in their home rather than being evicted.  They will own their home.  They will be able to raise their children, get on with their lives, recover financially and contribute to the State.  I think AIB and the various organisations that help families in these situations should be congratulated on what they are doing.  It is clear that there are serious obstacles to be addressed, despite this good news.</p></speech>

They said a variety of things.  They talked about the lack of transparency.  Many of the debt write-downs that have already happened have non-disclosure clauses attached to them.  They talked about the inconsistency of approach between the banks.  Bank of Ireland was mentioned by everyone to whom I spoke, as it always is.  It would be something of an understatement to say that the language they used to describe the behaviour of Bank of Ireland was unparliamentary.  They spoke about the lack of co-operation between the banks.  One senior lender to whom I spoke told me that many of the deals he tries to work on are torpedoed by Bank of Ireland.  Even when it is a minority creditor, it refuses to co-operate with other banks when they are trying to find solutions.</p><p>  The people to whom I spoke this morning talked about the red tape in the insolvency process.  I understand that 46 protective certificates, five debt settlement arrangements and three personal insolvency arrangements have been issued to date.  Based on the costs that have been accrued by the Insolvency Service of Ireland since it started to take applications, it can be calculated that the cost to the State of each of these measures has been approximately &euro;65,000.  It is clear that there is a great deal of work to be done.  The people to whom I spoke talked about bureaucracy in other places as well.  One lender in a bank told me that the compliance requirements associated with the second code of conduct on mortgage arrears are so severe and time-consuming that his team is no longer able to spend the necessary time with borrowers.</p><p>  The current review of the Insolvency Service of Ireland is welcome, but it is not enough.  We need a system-wide review that looks at all the parts of the system and talks to all the stakeholders, including the banks, the borrowers, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the credit unions.  This could be done in a matter of weeks.  It would be very cheap.  It would provide invaluable information to the Cabinet, the Oireachtas and the public.  In light of the good news we have heard today, and bearing in mind the significant opportunities to address the bottlenecks that exist, will the Taoiseach consider establishing a system-wide review?  Does he believe such a review would be a good idea?  Will he commission a review that could report back to the Cabinet and the Oireachtas within a few weeks?</p></speech>

I understand that the value of the house in question has been seriously reduced from the market value that was originally estimated.  It would probably be very difficult to sell it.  In any event, this form of analysis is done on a case-by-case basis.  The outcome of this morning's case might not be replicated in the particular circumstances of many other cases.  The Deputy has asked for a review of the system.  Some 85,000 mortgages have been restructured.  In 50% of those cases, the mortgages were restructured before people got into difficulties.  This was facilitated by banks or lending institutions that were in a position to cut deals with the people involved.  Everyone understands that house repossession is very traumatic and should be seen as a last resort.  The targets set for the banks are being monitored by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  That information comes to the Cabinet sub-committee on credit access and credit review.  The arrangements made by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the banks and the Irish Mortgage Holders Association are being monitored constantly.</p><p>  I do not think there is a need for a system review to be set up.  The system has to operate on a case-by-case basis.  Every case is different in some way or other, depending on the circumstances and the people involved.  I ask the Deputy to believe me when I say we want this to be sorted out.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear on more than one occasion that the significant numbers of people who still have mortgage distress hanging around their necks need to have that pressure relieved so that they can contribute to the economy, to society and to the well-being of their families.  I do not think there is a need to set up a body to review the entire system.  It is being monitored by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance on a regular basis.  The important thing is for the banks to be required to meet the targets that have been set for them.  It is intended that by the end of this year, every person in mortgage distress will have been offered a sustainable solution.</p></speech>

When deals are cut in this context, it must be possible for borrowers to adhere to them and have a future that will stand up.

The problem is that approximately 180,000 mortgages - one in five of that total - are in arrears.  Ireland has several times more mortgages in arrears than the next closest country on earth.  What has happened in Ireland is not happening anywhere else.  There are targets in place, the Insolvency Service of Ireland has been established and a review has been initiated to try to get rid of some of the red tape, but nobody is joining the dots.  We have a complicated system with lots of different stakeholders.</p></speech>

The Central Bank will say the opposite.  There are many different stakeholders, the system is complicated and nobody is joining the dots.  The Central Bank is monitoring whether the banks are hitting the targets, but that is just one aspect of the matter.  I have outlined five separate issues that have been raised by a multitude of stakeholders.  They have said that there is no transparency in what is going on.  They have said that there is complete inconsistency between the banks-----</p></speech>

They have said that there is no co-operation between the banks.  They have said that there is too much red tape in the insolvency process.  They have said that there is too much red tape in other parts of the system, such as the second code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That is why a system-wide review is needed.  We are not talking about a big and expensive review.  We are talking about a review that would take a few weeks and could be run by two or three people.  It would bring the stakeholders together, identify various issues and join up the dots in a way that is not happening at present.  The people who are involved in this sector on the ground every day are saying that a such review, which would systematically identify the problems in the system, would be hugely beneficial.  On the basis that such a review would cost very little and would provide incredibly valuable information to the Oireachtas and the Cabinet, and given that the social problems associated with this issue are so big, would it not be reasonable for the Government to conduct a short, sharp review to get this information?</p></speech>

Obviously the settlement that was reached with AIB has made that perfectly clear.  It is not just a case of the Central Bank or the Department of Finance setting targets for banks.  It is not just a case of monitoring what is happening.  It is a case of auditing the deals that have been done to see whether they are sustainable and can stand up.</p><p>  From one point of view the Deputy's request is reasonable.  It is not about having a cost in doing it.  My point is that it is already being done both by the Central Bank and by the Department of Finance.  This is March.  The Deputy should come back at the end of May or early in June and we can have a discussion about it here in the House on the basis of the monitored and audited reports, both of the Central Bank to that point and the Department of Finance, and let us see what is happening.  If conclusions or recommendations come from that as to how the thing might need to be tweaked a little bit to make it more effective, we are all for that.  Our interest genuinely is to see that people have these pressures released from them to allow them to get back to contributing to our economy and country.  That requires the banks to meet their targets.  Not only should they be monitored, but they should be audited to see that they stand up.  I would be happy to share that up-to-date information at that point with the House.</p></speech>

However, as the House is aware, an extraordinary meeting of EU Heads of State and Government was called in Brussels last week to discuss the deeply worrying situation in Ukraine.  For next week's European Council, therefore, there is an extensive and substantive agenda, including Ukraine.  As is traditional for the spring European Council, the focus is on economic issues.  The main agenda items are the European Semester, the Europe 2020 strategy, industrial competitiveness, climate and energy, and external relations.</p><p>  In Brussels next week, I also expect that we will review ongoing work on taxation issues, as well as progress in completing banking union.  Negotiations are continuing and I remain optimistic that we can reach agreement within the next few weeks.  Securing agreement on the single resolution mechanism is the next essential step in completing banking union.  It remains a key priority.</p><p>  I also look forward to having a good engagement next week on the key economic challenges facing Europe.  As we start to see more signs of recovery, we need to discuss what we need to do to support and strengthen the fragile return to economic growth and job creation.  The discussion on climate change and energy also addresses a central strategic challenge for the union.  Before getting into detail, however, I wish to say a few words about Ukraine.</p><p>  What is happening in Crimea has rightly been described as the worst crisis which Europe has faced since the end of the Cold War.  The EU, the Irish Government and most of the international community have strongly condemned Russia's actions over the past 12 days and have called on it to immediately withdraw troops to their barracks.  Russia's actions are in flagrant violation of international law and of its obligations to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>  It was against the backdrop of the deepening crisis in Ukraine that I attended last Thursday's informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Brussels, convened by President Van Rompuy to formulate a clear and carefully calibrated EU response.  Before our internal deliberations, the new Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, briefed the Council on the exceptionally difficult situation in his country and sought our assistance on a number of fronts.  I was impressed by his measured and sophisticated approach, notwithstanding the intense pressure he is under.  He came with three clear messages: talk to President Putin, press for the cancellation of Sunday's referendum in Crimea and urge Moscow to open direct talks with Kiev.  As expected, he focused for the most part on the highly charged situation in Crimea, strongly condemning Russia's violation of existing treaties and also rejecting the resolution of the Crimean regional assembly regarding the referendum on leaving Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation.</p><p>  I strongly agree with the Prime Minister Yatsenyuk that the decision to hold the referendum this Sunday, coupled with the wording of the question on the voting paper regarding Crimea's possible reunification with Russia, is clearly a significant escalation of an already dangerous situation.  Despite this provocation, it is worth recalling that the Ukrainian Government has shown restraint and not reacted militarily to Russia's illegal actions or declared martial law.  In our statement after the meeting, EU leaders applauded the courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people, as well as commending the measured response shown so far by the Government in Kiev.</p><p>  I was encouraged by the Prime Minister's assurances that the Government's proposed language law, diminishing the status of Russian, which caused a great deal of unease, will not be signed into law and that a task force has been established to consider that issue.  I welcome his commitment to reforms, including tackling corruption.  Prime Minister Yatsenyuk argued that Ukraine is not anti-Russian and, indeed, views Russia as a friendly country, but that Ukraine will not be dominated or intimidated by Russia.  He concluded there is no time to lose, and asked that the political chapters of the association agreement be signed immediately and that the EU expedite measures on visa liberalisation.</p><p>  We adopted a number of measures which we believe can make a powerful contribution to the stabilisation of Ukraine's macroeconomic situation, as well as helping the new Government in a broader political sense.  We endorsed the comprehensive assistance package prepared by the European Commission which has a value of approximately &euro;11 billion.  We tasked all relevant Council bodies to process this rapidly and we recalled the need to work with the IMF in order that assistance can be unlocked.  Prime Minister Yatsenyuk pointed out that he needs &euro;2.5 billion in cash now to pay for gas bills that are due.  The immediate priority is to restore macroeconomic stability through sound fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.  At the same time, the Government must urgently launch an ambitious set of structural reforms, including the fight against corruption, and introduce greater transparency.  The Council has also frozen the assets of persons identified as responsible for the misappropriation of state funds.  The intention is to recover those assets and return them to the Ukrainian people.  We also made clear that we are prepared to respond immediately to requests for humanitarian assistance.</p><p>  On the broader political front, we reiterated the EU's commitment to signing the association agreement, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area, with the Ukrainian authorities.  It is worth recalling that it was the announcement on 21 November last year by Ukraine's then President Yanukovych of his decision to postpone preparations for the signature of the association agreement at November's Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius that triggered major protests in Ukraine.  The initial protests were overwhelmingly peaceful yet were met just over a week later by heavy-handed police action which only served to inflame the situation.  We agreed last week that, in the interim and as a mark of solidarity with Ukraine, we will shortly sign all the political chapters within the association agreement.  I expect that to happen very soon.  The European Union also intends to adopt unilateral measures which would allow Ukraine to benefit substantially from the advantages offered in the deep and comprehensive free trade area.  These kinds of measures would entail an offer to apply provisions related to the import of goods by reducing tariffs and opening tariff rate quotas by so-called autonomous trade measures.  Finally, we pledged to continue to work on the visa liberalisation process.  These were the main demands of the Ukrainian Prime Minister.</p><p>  There was a great deal of speculation in the lead-up to our meeting as to whether the EU would agree to impose sanctions against the Russian Federation, with much being made of the supposed divisions within the Union on this question.  In the event, the statement delivered a clear and unequivocal message to Moscow, strongly condemning its unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and setting out our collective response to the Russian Federation.  We made clear that negotiations between the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation need to start right away and need to produce results within a limited timeframe.  In the absence of such results, the EU will decide on a second set of additional measures, such as travel bans, asset freezing and the cancellation of the EU-Russia summit, as well as broader economic issues that might be taken into account.  EU Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday will consider the next steps and, of course, the European Council meeting next week will discuss the situation in the Ukraine and the EU's response.</p><p>  I turn now to the economic agenda for next week, starting with the European Semester.  As the House is aware, following our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme in December, Ireland is a full participant in the 2014 process.  This is the fourth European Semester cycle, the third under the enhanced governance arrangements introduced by the six-pack and the first under the further enhancements introduced by the two-pack.</p><p>The discussion at next week's European Council takes place in the context of improving economic conditions across Europe.  Last year saw GDP in both the EU and the eurozone area back in positive territory for the first time since late 2011.  The most recent purchasing managers' data for February suggests that economic activity is now at its highest level in 32 months, while through the ECB's bank lending survey, we have seen some first signs of the easing of credit constraints for Europe's SMEs.  Most importantly, there are now signs that this improvement in economic conditions is feeding through to the labour market.  Many member states, including Ireland, have returned to net job creation.  Our own employment growth rate of over 3% in 2013 is currently the strongest in the EU.  However, unemployment remains unacceptably high at around 11% for the EU and 12% for the eurozone area.  The rate in Ireland is also 12%.  We must remain focused on the need to effectively tackle this.  Job creation remains the priority.</p><p> Against this broader background, the spring European Council will finalise guidance to member states on the preparation of national reform plans for 2014.  This process began with the annual growth survey presented by the Commission in November last year and will conclude with the June European Council endorsing country-specific recommendations for member states.  As part of this process, the Commission last week also published in-depth reports on macro-economic imbalances in 17 member states, including Ireland.  We are, of course, studying the report on Ireland.  It acknowledges that we have made significant progress in addressing imbalances which arose over the last decade.  We have noted the remaining challenges highlighted by the Commission and we remain firmly committed to addressing these by building on the reform measures which we undertook during the EU-IMF programme.  Work on the European semester is being led by my Department, working closely with the Departments of Finance; Public Expenditure and Reform; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and other relevant Departments.  The objective remains to submit our 2014 national reform plan to the European Commission in April.</p><p> As part of the European semester discussion, the European Council will also examine Europe 2020 - the EU's strategy to support smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  It is a ten-year plan, adopted in 2010, based around five headline targets in the areas of employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion.  These are translated into specific goals for each member state, with progress monitored within the framework of the European semester.  The Commission's stocktaking exercise shows quite clearly that overall performance against these objectives is mixed.  This is not surprising as, in many ways, implementation of the strategy has been overshadowed by crisis resolution in the euro area.  Now, however, is the moment to properly re-engage with Europe's post-crisis growth strategy.</p><p> I expect that our exchanges at the spring European Council will be followed by a full public consultation on the strategy which run until the autumn.  The outcome of this public consultation will then be taken forward by the new European Commission.  When Commission Secretary General Catherine Day met the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs on 23 January, she emphasised the importance of strong stakeholder engagement with this renewal of the Europe 2020 strategy, including, of course, from national parliaments.  The Commission's 2030 climate and energy framework proposals, to which I will return shortly, are likely to form an important strand of this wider process.</p><p> The spring European Council will also focus on industrial competitiveness.  Exchanges here will be informed by the recent Commission communication &quot;For a European Industrial Renaissance&quot; and by discussions at the Competitiveness Council on 20 February.  Ireland has been proactive in the preparatory discussions in this area as I believe that a competitive and innovative industrial sector will be an important element of Europe's recovery.  The Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, will expand on this in his contribution.</p><p> The European Council will also hold a first policy debate on the climate change and energy framework for 2030.  Discussions will again be informed by a Commission communication issued in January and the debate will be followed closely at a wider international level in view of the importance of EU engagement and influence in the international climate process under the UN framework convention and the Kyoto Protocol.  </p><p> I wanted to set out our initial thinking on the communication as we approach the European Council meeting.  In the first place, the communication is a basis for a timely policy debate on the next phase towards the EU's objective of transition to a competitive, low-carbon European economy by 2050.  We recognise the benefits of increasing the share of renewable energy in our fuel mix, both from the economic and the environmental perspectives.  The issue requires careful consideration in terms of both the challenges and the opportunities of global transition to a low-carbon future.  Both ambition and flexibility are important features of the package but we must also reach an outcome that is sustainable for the EU as well as for individual member states on environmental, economic and competitiveness grounds.  We can only build momentum towards a low-carbon society if our vision is founded on a policy framework that is affordable, fair and transparent and takes account of member states' specific circumstances and capacities.  The principles and objectives for the 2030 framework must be translated into concrete achievements.  To do this, we must at an early stage reach a shared understanding of the assumptions underpinning the Commission's impact assessment.  </p><p> Our own initial technical analysis of the communication has raised some issues of serious concern from a national perspective about the projected overall costs.  We look forward to engaging constructively with the member states and the Commission to deepen understanding of the national implications of the proposals.  We note the recognition in the communication that renewable energy has an important contribution to make to the 2030 framework.  Effective transition to a low-carbon future requires that the 2030 framework provides for cost-effective implementation without placing a disproportionate burden on EU energy consumers or taxpayers and without undermining EU competitiveness.  While the proposed 27% renewable energy target for 2030 for the EU can be welcomed, we hope that the EU as a whole can surpass 27% and that potential investors are convinced - beyond any doubt - of our collective commitment to an ambitious renewable energy future.</p><p> We are interested to hear the Commission's views on how the EU-wide renewable energy target post-2020 will be achieved and on how the export of renewable energy from areas of high resource to areas of high demand can play a role in achieving this target.  We must send a clear message to industry that delivering the innovation needed to open up new renewable resources will be rewarded.  Public acceptance of energy infrastructure and renewable energy development is crucial.  We cannot underestimate the importance of placing the concerns of local communities at the heart of the transition to renewable energy.  Citizens must perceive that such developments are being made primarily for their benefit and on an equitable and cost-effective basis.  </p></speech>

Improved energy efficiency remains the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, improve competitiveness and increase affordability, especially for low-income consumers and it will have a direct impact on the European jobs and growth agenda.</p><p>  Finally, Ireland welcomes the proposal in the communication to examine and pursue the most appropriate climate policy approach to agriculture and land use.  This is an important development from Ireland's perspective.  We believe that a coherent and cost-effective approach to the parallel priorities of sustainable food production and climate change is fundamental to a realistic way forward at national, EU and wider international level under the UN convention.  In anticipation of a new international climate treaty in 2015, we look forward to early development of this particular strand of the 2030 framework.</p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the European Council will also review progress in completing banking union.  EU finance ministers meeting yesterday had a long discussion on the single resolution mechanism.  The outcome of those negotiations is that finance ministers have now provided the Presidency with a revised mandate which I am confident will allow for an overall agreement with the European Parliament in advance of the parliamentary recess in April.  The single resolution mechanism is the natural complement to the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism.  It will overcome the asymmetry between supervision at the European level under the single supervisory mechanism and resolution at national level.  It will create a central body to apply the bank recovery and resolution directive toolkit to banks in the eurozone area and to banks of participating non-eurozone area member states. This central body will be known as the single resolution board and will have the power to restructure and wind down failing banks.  The single resolution board will have access to a single resolution fund, the principle for which is established in the regulation. The fund will be paid for by contributions from the EU banking sector. The rules for the use of and contributions to the fund are set out in the single resolution mechanism regulation.  The target level of the single resolution fund is approximately &euro;55 million to &euro;60 billion.</p><p>  The intergovernmental agreement will allow for the transfer of funds from national compartments during the transitional phase to the single fund.</p><p>Once a final agreement is reached between with the European Parliament, this will deliver the next essential step in creating the banking union for Europe and thus help meet the objective set by the Heads of State and Government of the euro area in June 2012 of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  Negotiations with the Parliament continue and while there are a number of differences between the co-legislators, I am confident that the deadline set by the European Council will be respected.</p><p> The March European Council is also expected to touch on taxation, particularly the savings tax directive, the parent-subsidiarity directive and ongoing work in the area of digital taxation.  The parent-subsidiary directive flows from Ireland's Presidency last year, during which we prioritised work on aggressive international tax planning and achieved significant progress.  We fully support measures to eliminate double non-taxation.  We also support the proposed changes to the savings tax directive, which will expand its scope, make it more effective and create a stronger and more co-ordinated approach to tackling tax evasion.  In my view, it is time to adopt this proposal now.</p><p> Ireland has, in addition, welcomed the establishment of the European Commission's expert group on digital economy taxation last November.  We hope that this group will be able to assist the EU in tackling this difficult and complex issue.  Of course, due to the global nature of the problem, we continue to believe that the OECD is the most effective forum for further work.  It has become very clear in recent months that the issue of international tax planning by companies is neither limited to any one country nor limited to any sector of the economy.  It is a global issue involving a wide variety of jurisdictions and companies and it requires a global co-ordinated response.</p><p> Finally, under the external relations agenda item, as previously mentioned, we will return to the situation in Ukraine.  The European Council will also discuss preparations for next month's EU-Africa Summit.  The theme of the summit will be investing in people, prosperity and peace.  I will attend the summit and intend to meet a number of African leaders there.  I see these meetings as a valuable opportunity to reinforce the aims of the Africa strategy, launched by the T&aacute;naiste in 2011.  The Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, will say a little more on this in his contribution.</p><p> As I said at the outset, there is a very substantial and substantive agenda for our meeting next week, but I look forward to constructive and productive discussions and will come back to the House on the outcome of next week's European Council in due course.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Members of the House for giving me the extra few minutes to read all of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200025#X00200"><p>By the time the European Council meets late next week, there will probably have been new and significant developments in Ukraine, including the results of the one-sided and clearly illegitimate referendum about Crimea becoming a part of the Russian Federation.  Ukraine will quite rightly dominate the summit.  As we do not know the exact context in which the summit will hold its discussions, it is difficult for us to make specific proposals.  However, there is much that will not change and there are core principles that must be upheld.</p><p>  There has been an ongoing attempt by Russia to throw up a cloud of distractions about Ukraine in the past three months, but it is clear that what we are dealing with is a former imperial power that is acting with aggression against a sovereign state.  This crisis has been directly created by the mindset that Russia has the right to control the destiny of a state that used to be a part of the Soviet Union.  Russia hopes that the strength of its verbal and commercial counter-attacks will prevent the democratic world from standing up to it.</p><p>  It is the wish of the strong majority of Ukrainian people to be part of the European, democratic mainstream.  This has led to Russia's reaction.  First there was the threat to crush the Ukrainian economy if an association agreement was signed with the EU.  Now there is the operation to take Ukrainian territory.</p><p>  Let there be no mistake about this - every single element of Russia's story for the annexation of the Crimea is illegitimate.  First, there is the story that it is acting to defend Russian civilians being from being suppressed by Kiev.  The fact is that the only people who have been beaten off the streets in the past two weeks are Russians protesting against their Government in Moscow and Ukrainians supporting their Government in Sevastopol.  No evidence whatsoever of the mistreatment of the Russian minority has been produced.  The initial claims of more than 500,000 people fleeing to Russia were so transparently bogus that Moscow has dropped them from its narrative.  The only fleeing populations have been Ukrainians and Tartars from the Crimea.</p><p>  Second, there is the statement that no Russian troops are involved.  Russia seems to believe that, by taking markings off uniforms, it has the right to sell this nonsense.  All of the vehicles being used to control Crimea have Russian military number plates.  These vehicles include light and heavy armour.  The weapons available to the pro-annexation troops are standard issue for Russian troops.  Most conclusively, the warships blockading the Ukrainian fleet are Russian.  Unless Moscow expects us to accept that replica warships to ones in its fleets have appeared and are under the control of local militias, the evidence is absolutely conclusive &ndash; Russian troops have invaded and taken control of Ukrainian territory.</p><p>  Third, there is the idea that Viktor Yanukovych is still the legitimate Head of State in Kiev and he has asked Russia for help.  Mr. Yanukovych is responsible for killing demonstrators on the streets of Kiev.  It was he who refused to implement agreements to resolve the crisis and it was he who fled the country.  The evidence of the kleptocracy he ran is now so overwhelming that no one is asking for his restoration to office.</p><p>  Finally, there is the claim that there is nothing to hide.  If that is the case, why are extraordinary steps being taken to prevent any external agency from getting a presence on the ground?  The OSCE is directly charged with being able to monitor these situations quickly.  It has groups on constant standby, ready to go into areas of unrest or conflict and create the basis for a unified international reaction.  However, the OSCE monitoring team has repeatedly been refused access to Crimea by Russian forces.  This has included an incident where an OSCE monitoring team, including a colonel of the Irish Army, had warning shots fired at it.  In addition, a United Nations representative has been subjected to mob intimidation while Russian troops looked on.</p><p>  There is no point in engaging with the Russian position in detail because it is transparent nonsense.  It is about trying to engage the international community in a diplomatic dance while Russia gets on with creating facts on the ground.</p><p>  One does not need to be an historian to see the uncanny comparison with the tactics of Germany in the late 1930s.  Were the Baltic states and other former communist states not now members of the EU and NATO, the logic being used by Russia to threaten Ukraine would apply to them as well.  Russia is not Nazi Germany, but it is an increasingly authoritarian state and a consistent opponent of basic democratic norms and the right of the international community to promote those norms.  Its support of the Assad regime in Syria has helped the latter to survive and create a humanitarian catastrophe.</p><p>  For those who assert that this is none of our business and that we should, in fact, only be concerned with business and trade, I could not disagree more.  We cannot charge around the world insisting that every nation we talk and trade with become a western European liberal democracy.  That would be naive and foolish.  However, if we genuinely believe in the rule of law in international relations and if we believe in basic human rights, there are times when we must speak up and be willing to act with others.</p><p>  The Russian Government is working on the basis that business means too much to European governments for them to do anything meaningful.  The Prime Minister of Poland, Mr. Donald Tusk, stated on Monday that he feared that the reliance of Germany on Russian gas and trade was such that it compromised European sovereignty.  If a European country can be torn apart in such an aggressive and dishonest way without real consequences, then we should consider repealing all of the founding declarations about the Union's commitment to democracy and the rule of law.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the EU's response so far has been extremely weak.  Strong words at press conferences have been followed by active work to weaken all proposed actions.  It is primarily because of the work of foreign Ministers Mr. Carl Bildt of Sweden, Mr. Radoslaw, or Radek, Sikorski of Poland and the three Baltic member states that Europe has not yet disgraced itself.  In particular, I commend Mr. Sikorski on his work.  From my time serving with him on the Foreign Affairs Council, I know that he is a passionate believer in building a prosperous and democratic Europe.  He is also someone who remembers how Europe standing up for its values helped societies suffering under totalitarian regimes in the past.</p><p>  It is not clear what, if anything, our Government supports.  The words of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in condemning Russia's actions have been strong and welcome.  I support them in that regard.  What is unknown is what is meant by the &quot;severe actions&quot; to which they referred.</p><p>Are we supporting the minimalist approach of Germany and some other major trading partners of Russia or are we supporting the much tougher approach of others?  Perhaps we are waiting for something to be agreed and whatever that is we will support it?</p><p> The current European position is to suspend future actions but leave everything else in place.  This is not good enough.  At a minimum, we should match the measures announced by President Obama.  In addition, we should make it a genuine priority to lift the reliance of many states on Russian gas.  This gas has been and will be used to support other Russian political objectives.  There comes a point where letting things drift must stop.  Instead of adopting the current innocuous draft conclusions on energy, the summit should adopt more radical ones about liberating Europe from potential energy blackmail.  Given the current situation, it is inappropriate for the Irish Government to proceed with any direct government-to-government activities in Moscow for St Patrick's Day.  Surely, we cannot hold social receptions with people we are simultaneously proposing to sanction.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, has a busy portfolio.  Given the significant challenges facing his free GP care and compulsory health insurance proposals, it would be understood if he were to remain in Dublin.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that approach to the engagement on St. Patrick's Day in Moscow.</p><p> On the new Government in Ukraine, we should not forget that the people of that country experienced a false dawn ten years ago.  The Orange Revolution did not deliver for the people.  There was no real attempt to show respect for civil society and end the rule of wealthy elites.  The European Union should condition its support on the implementation of a programme, which the EU should fund, to increase the role of civil society and bodies which promote transparency and accountability.  We should also insist that financial aid to Ukraine sets it on a realistic path to growth.  If this requires the restructuring of the debt amassed under the last regime, so be it.  Ukraine needs investment and hope, neither of which it can obtain if it spends years desperately managing these debts.</p><p> The summit will formally sign off the latest fiscal and economic oversight documents.  This is not a success.  The European semester leaves in place every element of existing economic orthodoxy.  Most importantly, it is following the policy of austerity for all which has undermined the positions of all European economies.  Many member states do not have the opportunity to implement significant extra investment.  While the idea that all austerity has been avoidable is populist nonsense, there are economies which are certainly strong enough to follow a more growth-oriented approach which would benefit them and the whole of Europe.  European recovery remains weak.  Growth rates are significantly lower than forecast this time last year.  This summit will again sign off on a policy of leaving policy unchanged.  Thankfully, ECB President, Mario Draghi, has not followed the policy of doing as little as possible as late as possible.  I welcome his statement that he is willing to implement new measures if he feels deflation is a rising threat.  The various decisions of Mario Draghi in his two years as ECB President have been absolutely central to any progress in Europe.  They have been far more significant in helping Ireland than any decision of our Government.  This must explain why the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and their parties have ignored him in the lengthy and still ongoing speeches of self-praise the D&aacute;il has been hearing for the last week and more.</p><p> The annotated draft agenda for the summit states that issues around the single resolution mechanism may be discussed, but not as a priority item.  The existing proposal for the SRM is wholly inadequate and goes nowhere near breaking the link between sovereign and banking debt.  The entire package for a watered-down banking union is also delayed.  Reports are appearing again about difficulties in Belgium and other members states.  While the Taoiseach and his EPP party colleagues engaged in an extended backslapping session about banking union last week, the reality is very different.  The essential bank resolution fund, to which the Taoiseach signed up, will take ten years to build up its funds.  After a decade, it will have &euro;55 billion available to it.  This has been estimated at only 0.2% of the total asset base of the covered banks.</p><p> The Taoiseach and his staff have once again been briefing journalists that they have everything in hand on banking debt but only the most gullible could take any of this at face value.  The Government has never said what it is looking for in terms of either the type or level of funding.  It is now well over a year and a half since the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Finance, Deputies Brendan Howlin and Michael Noonan, respectively, gave a giggling press conference at which they indulged the idea that &euro;68 billion would be on the way after they had, I quote, &quot;changed the game&quot;.  After 19 months, the game has not been changed.  The figures that were talked about then are in excess of the entire fund available from the European Union for past, present and future recapitalisation of the entire European financial system.  There is also the problem of the June 2012 communique, which the Taoiseach likes to tell journalists gave a specific commitment to sort out Ireland.  It did nothing of the sort.  The exact text, which is more referred to than read, states that &quot;The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&quot;.</p><p> It is over three months since the Taoiseach declared the adjustment programme over.  He also declared that he and his Ministers had already delivered debt sustainability and growth for the economy.  There is no commitment whatsoever in that to transfer to Europe Ireland's bank-related debt.  It may be that we can sell them some bank shares but, as we have seen in the last week, this is not a problem.  It is simply not true that we agreed to wait until the banking union was up and running before looking for debt relief.  What has emerged is a permanent campaign to refuse to be straight with the people and to constantly change the briefings about what was agreed.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said, by way of reference to the fair at Glynn, that he would not reveal his bottom line.  That is fine, but more than a year and a half later the public has a right to at least hear the opening bid.</p><p> The Commission's work on taxation may also be raised.  There is nothing in the EU treaties to prevent member states from setting different tax rates.  Enough time has been wasted trying to construct a case to get involved in the corporate taxation issue.  The idea that the German or French economies are suffering because of how Ireland taxes business profits is ridiculous.  There are much more important issues which should be taking up the time of leaders at this summit.  I welcome the fact that the summit will review the area of climate and energy policy.  The influence of climate change deniers is thankfully receding rapidly.  Unfortunately, this is being driven by the increasingly severe evidence of man-caused climate change.  Ireland should support the reinvigoration and not the watering down of action on climate change.  The area of competitiveness will also be covered but it appears that there is nothing new on the agenda.  A real competitiveness agenda would include a proper investment programme.</p><p> The people of Ukraine, who went onto the streets to demand a European future for their country, deserve our support.  Some of them paid for their dreams with their lives.  The country as a whole is facing an aggressive invasion from its powerful neighbour.  If the Taoiseach returns from the summit having done only one thing, it must have been to stand with the people of Ukraine through supporting concrete action to develop their country and rebuff the Russian aggression.  The Taoiseach has had his photo opportunities with Yulia Timoshenko and Vitali Klitschko.  It is time for some concrete action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200026#Y00200"><p>The upcoming European Council meeting is heavily focused on economic matters.  Once again, the European semester will be debated and the Council will take stock of how it has worked so far.  Many across Europe see the semester as simply another tool to reduce the economic sovereignty of member states.  Its main function is to give the European Commission, which is an unelected body, the power to decide the make-up of member states' annual budgets.  It is being forced into place to ensure that member states are locked into the same right-wing economic policies which have ruined this economy and continue to place the needs of big business over struggling and hardworking ordinary citizens.  While there was much hype and spin by the Government over exiting the bailout, the harsh reality is that Ireland will remain under extra surveillance until 2032 as our loan profiles currently stand.  Even then the Commission can prolong the surveillance.  During that period, the Council can impose whatever measures it deems fit for us.  The EU controls our future and economic decision-making more than ever.</p><p>  Last week, we had the EPP Congress in Dublin involving a collection of conservative parties from across the European Union.  As was signalled, they praised Ireland.  German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, described Ireland as an economic success.  Unsurprisingly, she did not focus on the &euro;666 million the Government has taken out of the health care budget or the huge housing crisis affecting Dublin.</p><p>The Chancellor did not speak about youth unemployment, the high level of emigration or retrospective recapitalisation.  It was not surprising either that she did not refer to Irish taxpayers paying unsecured German bondholders.</p><p> Even the President of the European Commission President, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, got in on the act by thanking Irish people for their courage, noting the leadership shown by the Government and describing the past decade as &quot;ten very challenging, very exciting years&quot;.  While they may have been exciting or even risqu&eacute; years for Mr. Barroso, the word &quot;exciting&quot; does not reflect the nightmare journey taken by families faced with the prospect of losing their homes and jobs or the possibility of losing their children to emigration.  Again, Mr. Barroso failed to make reference to Irish taxpayers being strong-armed into bailing out unsecured bondholders for billions of Euro.  He also neglected to focus on the fallout and legacy of the troika's presence in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, namely, mass unemployment, emigration, increased poverty and the devastation of communities and public services.  His intervention was an attempt to rewrite the narrative and pat little Ireland on the back for bailing out gamblers and speculators and devastating public finances in order that millionaires and billionaires would not have to take a hit on their unsecured bets.</p><p> Mr. Barroso also made no reference to a write-down or retrospective recapitalisation.  Has the Government given up on this goal?  Is it satisfied to receive thanks and plaudits for lumping this heavy burden of debt on its citizens?  Is it content to continue to erode economic sovereignty by handing it to the European Commission through the European semester?</p><p> This week, a key anti-austerity leader of the Syriza party in Greece visited Dublin and spoke of his country's serious social and economic problems.  I was struck by the similarities between the journeys Greece and Ireland must take.  The main message we must send to the European Council meeting is to emphasise the importance of working together to produce alternatives that improve the lives of ordinary citizens across the European Union.</p><p> I note the European Council will discuss industrial competitiveness.  Recently, one of Ireland's leading economists, Professor Morgan Kelly, warned that the recovery is masking underlying problems with the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  Professor Kelly is held in high regard in the economic field for forecasting the scale of the housing market crisis.  He believes that when the European Central Bank inspects Irish banks, it will find that a significant number of small and medium-sized enterprises have mounting debts.  According to Professor Kelly, these enterprises could be wiped out when the ECB tries to clean up Irish banks. </p><p> The Government's focus recently has been on job creation and it is keen to spin the message that recent figures demonstrate jobs growth.  While all jobs are welcome and the figures show that unemployment has decreased in the past 12 months, these data must be treated with caution.  The Central Statistics Office has been cautious about the figures given changes in the way in which the numbers of self-employed persons and persons employed in agriculture are measured.  Recent research has shown that 60% of emigrants were in employment before leaving Ireland but chose to move abroad because of low pay, an insufficient number of hours and the lack of career opportunities.  If the 127,000 persons of working age who left the country since 2009 had stayed, the unemployment rate would be 19.7% </p><p> The domestic economy is still in dire straits and there is evidence that jobs growth is being polarised, with little growth in high paid sectors and the greatest gains being made in low paid sectors.  The economy is still much too dependent on multinational companies.  Last week, it was revealed that Apple paid only $36 million in tax on profits of more than $7 billion from its Irish registered operations.  It appears the Government does not have any interest in challenging multinational companies which are abusing loopholes in our tax law.  Its response to the ongoing revelations has been a mixture of denial, embarrassment and silence.  If Ireland is not at fault, I ask the Taoiseach to raise the continued abuse of tax loopholes at the European Council meeting and seek EU-wide action to prevent multinational companies worth billions of euro from neglecting their tax responsibilities.  Will he also raise the concerns expressed by Professor Morgan Kelly?</p><p> What proposals will the Taoiseach bring to the European Council meeting to try to improve the industrial competitiveness of Irish firms and the domestic economy?  One of the many concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises is the high cost of energy.  What action will the Government take to tackle this problem?</p><p> As an island, we have high and fluctuating transport costs.  The proposed levy for heavy goods vehicles using British roads will significantly increase costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in Border areas.  The measure flies in the face of the EU concept of free movement of goods and services.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise this issue inside and outside the formal Council meetings.  Does he agree that this provides a further reason for creating and developing an all-Ireland economy?</p><p> The Taoiseach stated that climate change will also be discussed at the forthcoming European Council meeting.  Recent storms and floods demonstrated the devastating impact weather can have on businesses and communities.  Ireland needs to work with European Union institutions and international partners to help slow the process of climate change and prepare defences to battle against its effects.  Will the Taoiseach seek funding from the European Investment Bank to help build new and better flood defences?</p><p> Ireland has one of the highest rates of winter deaths in Europe and fuel poverty is one of the main issues affecting households here and across Europe.  Retrofit schemes are one way of reducing fuel poverty.  They save energy, make economic sense and, more important, have a major impact on homes and families.  Will the meeting focus on this issue in the context of the discussion on climate change?</p><p> Rising fuel prices are an issue across Europe and need to be tackled on a Europe-wide basis.  This can be done through the provision of supports and long-term investment in the development of renewable and green energy sources across Europe.  Biofuels have become a major issue in Europe and across the globe, especially in Africa.  I hope the EU-Africa summit will focus on biofuels and the practice of substituting them for food crops.  Europe must review its policies to take account of climate change and examine the spread of biofuel crops.  Ireland must raise its voice on this key area of concern.</p><p> Recent problems in Ukraine stem from the European Union and United States, on one side, and Russia, on the other, playing a zero sum geopolitical game with that country.  Ukraine was essentially offered an opportunity to place all of its eggs in the EU basket on the off-chance that it may at some stage become a member of the European Union.  The alternative was to put all of its eggs in Russia's basket and remain under Russian influence, while being surrounded by countries which have taken the European Union route.  All the while, Ukraine was practically bankrupt, socio-economically regressing, rife with corruption and in the depths of winter.  Rather than trying to force Ukraine down one route, the European Union and Russia should have worked together to create mutually beneficial, non-exclusive economic, political and social relationships with the country.</p><p>Given it borders these big powers co-operation would have made sense and would have benefited the ordinary Ukrainian and Russia and Europe.  However, again the zero gain process was chosen.  </p><p> The situation is Crimea is continuing to worsen, with a lack of adequate stability and security.  I look forward to hearing what the Russian Ambassador has to say today at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade about his country's negative involvement in this area.  The local government in Crimea has called for a referendum to be held on 16 March in regard to its remaining part of the Ukraine or joining the Russian Federation.  While everybody has the right to self-determination and to decide democratically their country's future by way of free and fair vote, given the crisis situation in the Ukraine I believe this referendum has been hastily called and comes at the wrong time.  The focus now needs to be on de-escalating the crisis.  Once peace and security has returned, decisions of this magnitude can be debated and decided by the citizens.  Any referendum needs to be free and fair.  It also needs to be free of any foreign influence.  These conditions cannot be guaranteed in Crimea at this time.  The decision to hold a referendum on 16 March was made on 6 March.  Ten days is far too short of a lead-in time for a referendum on such an important issue.  All voters need to be given time to make up their minds and political parties and civil society groups need time to formulate campaigns to support or oppose referendum questions.  Ten days is far too little time and does not follow democratic best practice.  </p><p> Yesterday the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, rejected an offer of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, until such time as Russia engages with US proposals on Ukraine's crisis.  I believe this is counterproductive and that both sides need to sit down and talk.  Does the Taoiseach believe that this meeting should have gone ahead and what will be the Government&rsquo;s response if the Crimea referendum goes ahead?</p><p> The European Council will also discuss the upcoming EU-Africa summit.  I understand that topics for discussion include education and training, women and youth, legal and illegal migrant flows between both continents, ways to stimulate growth and create jobs, investing in peace and ways to enhance EU support for African capacities to manage security on the continent.</p><p>As with all developing countries the EU must focus on mutually beneficial and fair trade.  Will the tax evasion and avoidance of EU based MNCs be discussed?  The actions of these huge corporations have cost African countries billions in tax revenues.  The amount is many multiples of what it receives in aid.  Until these MNCs and their actions are held to account the fight against poverty and underdevelopment will continue to be undercut and held back.</p><p> I wish the Taoiseach well in the discussions on what is happening in Crimea and the Ukraine and other important issues such as climate change the direction in which Europe is going.</p></speech>

There may be a pattern developing which, hopefully, is not a replica of that we witnessed previously in the context of former Taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, going to Europe and being hailed as the great pioneers of the Celtic tiger because we all know what happened after that.  Currently when the Taoiseach goes to Europe he is hailed as the great pioneer of a great economic recovery.  Let us hope that is the case and that he is not entering into an unrealistic world whereby the assurance he is getting in Europe is not reflecting reality.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Crowe that the Taoiseach, instead of taking his Department's portfolio with him, should take with him a copy of Professor Morgan Kelly's speech to UCD a couple of days ago.  I am not suggesting that Professor Kelly is necessarily right - he may or may not be - but he tells an alternative story which is one that they should hear in Europe.  As everybody knows, Professor Kelly was right before.  He was a voice crying in the wilderness when he warned about what would happen in the property market.  He warned those who were riding the crest of a false prosperity that it would all end in tears.  I am not suggesting what is happening now is all going to end in tears but there is an alternative view which is not heard very often.  It is certainly not heard in Europe and is also rarely heard in this House.  </p><p>  It would be in the Taoiseach's interest to inform Europe that there is an alternative view of the Irish economy, although not one shared by Europe.  As so eloquently articulated by Professor Kelly in the past few days all is not necessarily well here and there is an elephant in the room, namely, the banking sector.  Europe does not want to hear that.  I note the Taoiseach's speech contained only a few lines in relation to the banking sector.  Europe wants to hear the consensus interpretation that we are on an unobstructable road to recovery.  The message from Professor Kelly is that the SMEs are highly borrowed, and to an extent that is not recognised here or has not been properly addressed.  On top of this, the economy is dependent on the SMEs, in particular in terms of employment.  I have not heard that issue properly addressed by anybody here, with the exception of the Minister for Finance who said the matter should be referred to the Central Bank and that Professor Kelly should be listened to, which is a way of saying that the matter should be diverted, dismissed and sent for further critical review.</p><p>  As stated by Professor Kelly the stress tests are forthcoming.  They may or may not be bad for Ireland.  Nobody really knows how they will be done.  However, there is little doubt that the banks, which we recognise as still having problems, are an enormous sword of damocles hanging over the economy and, if the stress tests identify the real debt not only in terms of mortgage arrears, about which we speak as the most prominent problem, but in the context of borrowings by the SMEs, then the banks will at the very least have to be recapitalised.  There is a state of denial in this country about this, which is particularly noteworthy on the part of the Government.  When Ministers are asked they tell us not to worry, the banks will not have to be recapitalised but that statement is not based on fact, evidence or principles.  This is doubly important now in light of the what the Taoiseach had to say about legacy debt.  Legacy debt is another area which is not recognised in terms of what happened in June 2012.  In other words, we are still pretending that somehow the banks will be recognised by legacy debt.  That is not the message coming from Europe.  The message coming from Europe is, &quot;You're on your own: we think you're doing extraordinarily well and we're going to ignore the bad things.&quot;</p></speech>

I find him as abnoxious as his US counterpart.  They behave similarly.  For the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, to say that in the 21st century one does not invade a country on a completely trumped up pretext is bordering on the ridiculous.</p><p>This from a country which launched the greatest act of unprovoked aggression in modern history - on a trumped-up pretext &ndash; against Iraq in the form of an illegal war now estimated to have killed 500,000, along with the invasion of Afghanistan, the bloody regime change in Libya and the killing of thousands in drone attacks on Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, all without UN authorisation.  It is absurd that the Americans are carrying on as they are at present and it is extremely difficult to listen to what they have to say.</p><p> The US and European powers openly sponsored the protests to oust the corrupt but elected Government of Yanukovych, which were triggered by controversy over an all-or-nothing EU agreement that would have excluded economic association with Russia.  At present, fascist gangs are patrolling the streets of Ukraine.  However, their members are also in Kiev's corridors of power.  The far right Svoboda party, whose leader has denounced the &quot;criminal activities&quot; of &quot;organised Jewry&quot; and which has been condemned by the European Parliament for its racist and anti-Semitic views, has five ministerial posts in the new Government, including those of Deputy Prime Minister and Prosecutor General.  The leader of the even more extreme Right Sector, which was at the heart of the street violence, is now Ukraine's deputy national security chief.  Neo-Nazis in office is a first in post-war Europe.  However, this is the unelected Government now backed by the US and EU.  In a contemptuous rebuff to ordinary Ukrainians who protested against corruption and hoped for real change, the new Administration has appointed two billionaire oligarchs &ndash; one of whom runs his business from Switzerland &ndash; to be the new governors of the eastern cities of Donetsk and Dnepropetrovsk.  Meanwhile, the IMF is preparing an eye-watering austerity plan for the tanking Ukrainian economy which can only swell poverty and unemployment.</p><p> It beggars belief that Ireland could adopt the position it has taken in respect of this matter.  Yesterday I read a pamphlet produced by a Ukrainian female writer who has no sympathy for either side but who is saddened by her people's fate.  Her wish is that the Russians, the EU and the US should leave Ukraine alone.  What is being done in Ukraine is simply another economic carve-up.  The Ukrainians are the only ones who are going to suffer as a result of it.  Those in government here and across the EU want to be able to pick sides and to decide who are the &quot;goodies&quot; and who are the &quot;baddies&quot;.  Two groups of oligarchs are fighting for control of Ukraine and Russia, the EU and the US have all become involved and are making matters worse.  Ukraine is in for a hard time from those on both sides.</p><p> The European People's Party held a forum in Dublin last week at which Yulia Tymoshenko was present.  That one is as big a gangster as Yanukovych.  She was arrested in 1995 for currency smuggling.</p></speech>

She was arrested again in 2001 and would have been arrested in 2009, when she signed an illegal deal with Russia, but for the fact that she was in power at the time.  In the previous week, Clinton visited Ireland.  One would swear these individuals were the good guys as they are led around the place by the hand.  Have people forgotten that in the late 1990s Clinton was responsible for substantial increasing arms sales to Turkey, which led to probably the worst incident of ethnic cleansing - in respect of the Kurdish people - of that period?  When it was pointed out to the American establishment that it was contributing to the ethnic cleansing of Kurds by arming Turkey, it replied that helping the Kurds would have interfered with US power interests.  The Americans were probably right in that regard.  One of Clinton's last acts prior to leaving office was to provide only $75 million in foreign aid for the world's poorest countries.  Even then, this amount was regarded as a shameful pittance.  Simultaneously, he provided $1.3 billion for the Colombian army which was involved in a so-called drugs war.  In so doing, he facilitated what was nothing short of state terror.  For a period, some 3,000 political prisoners died in Colombia each year and more than 300,000 refugees fled the country annually.  This was all the result of a US Government policy financed by our friend Clinton.  Those in our Government have funny friends.</p></speech>

It is stomach-churning to listen to the authorities in the United States of America and the Taoiseach refer to the sovereignty of states and talk about how borders should be respected.  One does not need to be a genius to realise that this is hypocrisy of the highest order.  The people who are preaching to us about what we should do are actually guilty of massive crimes.  One can extend this argument to the North, into which warmongers such as Richard Haass have been brought to inform citizens about how not to kill people.  What is happening is remarkable but I suppose it takes all sorts.</p><p>  Russia could definitely learn something from the EU in the context of ignoring the sovereignty of countries.  The EU is somewhat more subtle when it comes to taking over countries.  It does not move in with tanks, for example, or with soldiers which it claims are not from within its borders but who actually are, as has possibly been the case in Crimea.  The EU operates in the same way as heroin dealers, namely, the first fix is free and after that one will pay the price until the day one dies.  The EU has been removing our sovereignty bit by bit.  It got the first part for free and ever since farmers here have been obliged to dance the dance to meet the criteria for obtaining funding to which they have become used.  If they disagree, they are basically threatened with starvation and with being run off their land.  It is funny that our Government is so concerned about Ukraine's independence when it does not give the slightest damn about ours.</p><p>  It might be stated that referenda are held here to decide whether Ireland should immerse itself further in the EU.  The strange thing is that if we do not vote &quot;Yes&quot; in such referenda, those in government tell us we have to vote again.  That is not democracy, rather it is a case of &quot;We will keep asking the question until we get what we are looking for&quot;.  The EU really outdid itself on the most recent occasion on which it proved necessary to hold a referendum here by deliberately naming the relevant instrument the &quot;stability treaty&quot;.  If anyone stated that they were opposed to the latter, those in government could say they were against stability.  That is not democracy.  The title &quot;Vote against this treaty and we will shoot all your kids&quot; might as well have applied in that instance.  People could then have been told that they could not be opposed to the treaty because if they were, it would mean that they wanted the Government to shoot all of their children.  The threat relating to the stability treaty was that if we did not vote in favour of it, we would not get retrospective recapitalisation in respect of our banks.  We are still waiting for the latter to happen.</p><p>  Jim Higgins, MEP, announced on a local radio station in my county in the past two weeks - he probably thought no one was listening - that retrospective recapitalisation is going to happen before the next general election.  However, I am of the view that the game is up and that we are not going to get back any of the money involved.  One of the reasons for this recalls to mind the story of the lad in the dance hall who never got to dance because he never asked anyone to dance.  In the same vein, the Government never asked for retrospective recapitalisation.  Even if it did ask for the latter, the EU would be right to refuse to provide it because the Government is obsessed with spinning the fact that we have turned the corner.</p></speech>

However, the number of working age people emigrating was 116,000, while the number on labour activation schemes - training, education, etc. - increased by 29,000.  In reality, the numbers have increased.  The Government needs to tell the people the truth in respect of this matter.  It must also deal with the fact that our economy is dwarfed by debt.  We are dealing with a slow motion reality check in respect of this matter.  In one sense, what Professor Morgan Kelly stated recently is remarkable because it is terrifying.  It was also remarkable in another sense, namely, that he was stating the bleeding obvious.  We have always known that there is no way our economy can repay our national debt, private debt or commercial debt, whether it be large-scale in nature or relating to SMEs.  If the Government wants to get back the money to which I refer, it should tell those in the EU the truth and stop kissing their arses.</p></speech>

I will respond to the points they made, in turn, in the context of the agenda for next week's Council meeting.</p><p>I will begin by addressing some of the questions Deputy Crowe asked in respect of the EU-Africa summit coming up and what will take place there.  The Deputy raised several concerns relating to bioethanol and the role of the European Union.  These summits are important in determining the policy between the European Union and Africa for 2014 to 2017.  That is why the Taoiseach will be there as well as participating in other meetings with prime ministers from African states.  At the moment considerable work is being undertaken to determine the exact agenda for the meeting, but the key themes likely to emerge are: peace and security; democracy, governance and human rights; human development; and sustainable and inclusive growth.  The agenda the Government has developed in conjunction with Irish Aid and through the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will feed into the summit agenda and will reflect the views we will take at the summit and which the Taoiseach will articulate.  We have built up considerable expertise and knowledge in development policy as a result of our relationship with African states and because of that we will be participating in the summit.  We will be able to update Deputy Crowe nearer the point as well as afterwards in respect of the agenda and the points made.</p><p> Deputies Martin and Ross raised issues relating to industrial competitiveness and the content of what will be agreed at the meeting.  Of the 6 million jobs lost in Europe during the crisis, a little under 4 million have been in manufacturing, 3.8 million to be precise.  There is recognition among the governments of the need for Europe-wide action to respond to this and the conclusions of the summit will reflect this.  Three areas of price competitiveness are being focused on at the moment, including what has happened in productivity; the fact people in work do not have the support, skills or investment needed to deliver what they want or what many of our competitors are doing; and the further steps that need to be taken to support the supply of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises in Ireland and throughout Europe.</p><p> This leads to a point made on the economy and the view the Government takes on the economy.  We have said that overall some progress has been made and the figures bear this out.  I listened to the points and figures raised by Deputy 'Ming' Flanagan.  In the same vein, the figure which should be highlighted is that 61,000 jobs were created last year.  There are now a little over 1.9 million people at work within the economy.  We have not had such a figure for those at work in our economy since 2009.  I fully realise that hundreds of thousands of people are keen to work but cannot.  I am as much in contact with the misery and stress that this causes as Deputy Flanagan because I deal with these people in my community and in my work throughout the country.  While it is welcome and it is a fact that unemployment and the live register have come down for 21 months in a row, we must ensure job creation plays a far more important role in taking down these figures, although this has been the case in recent months and in the past two years.  Too many people are still leaving our country.  The areas the Government has prioritised in our domestic economy in this regard are construction, agriculture and tourism.</p><p> Ukraine was raised by everyone in their contributions.  I listened with interest, particularly to the point Deputy Wallace made.  He described the singularly complicated and difficult situation within Ukraine.  However, the question I have for Deputy Wallace is: what would he actually do?  His analysis may well be strong and there may well be dimensions of it which reflect what is happening there.  In the context of a country facing the type of pressure Ukraine is facing at the moment, what should we do now?</p><p> It is absolutely not true to say that the European Union played any role in pressurising a government to take any stance in respect of signing an agreement with us.  An agreement was put on the table and we negotiated with the Government that was in place in Ukraine at the time.  It decided not to sign the agreement while Georgia and Moldova signed.  It is our responsibility not only to analyse the situation but, as Deputy Wallace might put it, to respond to it.  What we are now doing through our membership of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, one of the few organisations which has all these countries as members, is supporting the monitoring mission that was due to go to Crimea.  However, it has not secured the type of access it should have, as Deputy Wallace is aware.  There is an Irish member on the mission.  We are a member of the Council of Europe, through which an adviser has been appointed to work with the speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament to try to develop a system of parliament and changes in the Ukrainian Administration to deal with some of the complexities to which Deputy Wallace referred.</p><p> I emphasise that the main theme of the European Union throughout the crisis has been to emphasise that it is up to the people of Ukraine to decide their future.  What we want and what we are pushing and advocating for is fair elections within the country, an inclusive political arrangement and a constitution that reflects all the cultures in the country.  I welcome the fact that as a consequence, for example, the law in respect of changing the status of the Russian language within Ukraine was not signed.  This has been the approach of the European Union throughout.</p></speech>

However, it was broken.  The snipers, who happened to kill people on both sides, escalated the situation.  They were part of an extreme right-wing group and they wanted the other crowd out.  Sadly, the European Union has played a role that has not been altogether positive.</p><p>  The Minister of State asked what we should do now.  If the EU, the US and Russia were genuinely interested in helping Ukraine, then they would sit down together with both sides and work in the interests of Ukraine without giving top priority to their own selfish motives.  Russia, the EU and the US have economic ambitions for Ukraine and they are putting these before the interests of the ordinary Ukrainian people.  Ukraine is a difficult country and it is coming from a difficult point.  It would be great if the country got help from both sides to structure a proper normal society and the country is struggling for this at the moment.</p></speech>

I wish to respond to the point.  We have been trying to put in place inclusive political arrangements.  This is why European Union Foreign Ministers, Prime Ministers and Heads of State have been trying to engage directly with Russia.  They have tried to put in place arrangements and elections that reflect the complexity of the situation there.  I emphasise that the European Union was dealing in good faith and did not try to coerce anyone to sign the association and stabilisation agreement.</p><p>  I wish to respond to something Deputy Flanagan said.  His description of Richard Haass as a warmonger is an absolutely obnoxious description to put on the record of the D&aacute;il.  He is a person who has invested a considerable amount of time to try to defuse and deal with difficult situations in the North.  He sat down with all the political parties there and worked co-operatively with them and the Government to try to deal with issues which we all have a direct interest in seeing resolved.  Seeing his voluntary commitment to peace in Northern Ireland merited or rewarded by Deputy 'Ming' Flanagan standing up and describing him as a warmonger does not take any account of the work he has done in the North or the leadership or commitment he has displayed.  If Deputy Flanagan wants proof, he need only consider the willingness of all the political parties in the North as well as the two Governments to engage directly with him to try to ensure the difficulties and violence of the past are not repeated in future.</p></speech>

I have received apologies for his absence from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who I understand is attending a Cabinet meeting.</p><p>  This important debate is essentially about jobs and employment because 99% of businesses in Ireland are Irish-owned SMEs.  Some 70% of private sector employment in this country is accounted for by SMEs.  Some 700,000 to 800,000 people are working daily in Irish SMEs, so this concerns jobs.</p><p>  The issue of SME debt has largely been overshadowed by household debt and mortgage arrears, but both issues are inextricably linked.  If an SME gets into financial difficulty due to a debt overhang it can cost jobs.  If a family loses a job it will have a direct knock-on effect on their ability to pay the mortgage and other households bills.  </p><p>  Last year, Ms Fiona Muldoon, a director of the Central Bank, said that about half of the approximately &euro;50 billion owed by Irish SMEs was in some form of distress.  The alarm bells should have started to ring at that stage.  I welcome the recent intervention of UCD's Professor Morgan Kelly on this issue, given his strong reputation.  He has triggered an important public policy debate in this regard and it is essential to give it the attention it deserves.  </p><p>  At a political level, we have been raising the issue of the debt overhang facing Irish businesses.  Some weeks ago, I was informed in a D&aacute;il reply by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that last year the Central Bank set some targets for banks to move SME customers with debt issues onto longer-term solutions.  Unfortunately, however, those targets have not been published by the Central Bank and we have had no indication of the nature of those solutions.  The Minister said the banks reported that they have complied with the targets.  This is the same Minister who, less than two years ago, told this House that one cannot believe what the banks are saying.  </p><p>  As in the case of the mortgage arrears targets, the banks' compliance with these targets in respect of SME debt restructuring needs to be independently audited and verified.  It is essential for that to be done.  In addition, the targets that were set last year by the Central Bank exclude foreign-owned banks, including Ulster Bank which is a major player in the Irish SME market.  It is important to deal with that issue.</p><p>  Fundamentally, SMEs with a significant debt overhang should have their viable trading business separated from the debt which is probably related to property.  In recent years, we have seen many good, viable trading businesses being contaminated by  the property collapse.  Many of those property investments were not directly related to the business and did not relate to property which the business was using in its day to day affairs, yet represented a property investment.  That contamination has directly affected many good, viable businesses.  Therefore, we need to separate both aspects and put more innovative solutions in place.  The solutions will certainly be more complex and quite different to those for mortgage arrears cases, for example.  Many of the solutions for SMEs will involve equity participation and a fundamental balance-sheet restructuring for these businesses.</p><p>  I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say.  This is an important debate which is essentially about jobs and preserving employment.</p></speech>

It has recently been brought back into the public arena in a lively fashion by Professor Morgan Kelly.</p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and play a vital role in the continuing recovery of employment growth in our country.  Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  The Central Bank's statistics on SME lending provide a breakdown of outstanding debt across a number of different industries.  Credit advanced to all non-financial, non-property related enterprises decreased by 2.1% over the quarter and by 5.3% over the year to end-Q4, bringing the stock of credit to &euro;36.7 billion.  An annual decline of 5.3% was also registered for end-Q4 2012.</p><p>  SME credit to non-property, non-financial private-sector enterprises fell by 6.2% or &euro;1.6 billion in the year to end-Q4 2013, to stand at &euro;24.5 billion.  This represents a decline of 3.1% or &euro;771 million over the quarter, as these SMEs continued to repay more debt than was drawn down.  SMEs accounted for 67% of all non-financial, non-property credit.</p><p>  For a significant number of viable smaller and medium-sized enterprises the capacity to access financing is constrained by debt overhang, particularly in regard to property exposures.  Restoring confidence and unlocking demand for the finance that is required to invest in growth, necessitates a coordinated and focused strategy for facilitating debt restructuring.  Debt overhang and SME arrears are issues which impact on the ability of a SME to meet its existing commitments, as well as hindering its ability to secure additional credit which it may need.  The Minister for Finance and his senior officials meet regularly with representatives of the banking sector about all aspects of the economy and this is a topic addressed in those meetings.</p><p>  In June 2013, the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term forbearance solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  The Central Bank has informed the Minister for Finance that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.  This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission which report that the workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.</p><p>  Irish banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.  Bank of Ireland indicated in their recently published results that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.  AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year.  Given the scale of the economic crisis that was inherited by this Government, this clearly represents considerable progress in such a vital sector of the economy.</p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014.  Additionally, the Government's decision to fast-track legislation to allow small companies, as defined by the Companies Acts, to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership, the Irish Banking Federation's new protocol on multi-banked SME debt, and the ongoing work of the expanded Credit Review Office are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in addressing their debt situation.   Furthermore, specific measures to promote access to finance amongst SMEs, including measures relating to debt restructuring, are a central feature of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  I should stress that the credit review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland, as well as when credit is refused by them.  I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn, to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  Resolving the issue of distressed SME debt in a mutually acceptable manner that affords benefits not only to parties involved in SMEs and banks but also to the wider society and economy, has been and remains a key priority for this Government.</p></speech>

However, the figures provided in his answer ignore the problem we are facing, which is the property-related debt that SMEs are carrying.  The figure the Minister of State has provided for SME credit for non-property, non-financial private SMEs is put at &euro;24.5 billion.</p><p>My understanding is that there is another &euro;30 billion or so attached to these SMEs in respect of property related debt.  That is the problem we face.  Many of these SMEs have a viable and sustainable business model but they have to deal with the problem of the property related debt which is hanging over them.  We are asking for the targets which have been set by the Central Bank almost one year ago to be published.  We want to know the nature of the solutions being proposed.  We want independent verification of the banks' compliance with those targets.  We want the targets to be expanded to include non-Irish banks such as Ulster Bank.  We know that many businesses are very fearful now because of the consequences of the downsizing of the banking sector, including commercial customers of the former IBRC, whose loans have been sold on at significant discount to foreign-owned funds.  These customers are very concerned at the approach being taken by those funds in respect of their businesses and the capacity of their businesses to continue to be sustainable.</p><p> I am disappointed that the reply ignores a fundamental aspect of SME debt which is property related.  The figures have only been provided for non-property related debt and that only tells about half the story. There is much more work to be done.  We want to ensure that where businesses have a significant debt overhang, proper innovative solutions are being provided that will allow them to continue to trade in business by separating the debt related to property from the debt attached to the viable business.</p></speech>

The ECB comprehensive assessment will not deal with loan restructuring as such.  It will determine whether the banks have sufficient provision against their loans and capital.  Irish banks have undergone such an exercise prior to the troika exit.  The stress testing on that occasion proved to be successful.  This is the second in less than three years.  It has led to a substantial increase in the loan provisions made at the end of the year and as such we do not anticipate any capital issues for the Irish banks as a result of the comprehensive assessment.</p><p>  Professor Kelly presented a hypothetical situation that in the third stress testing the ECB could find the banks would be unable to respond satisfactorily and that there would be another major debt problem which would cause considerable difficulties for the SME sector.  The rate of restructuring is 90% for the Bank of Ireland and 65% for AIB.  The banks have met the targets set.  There is no reason to believe that even though we are not in possession of the full figures, the property related debts are of such a nature that would cause the difficulties that were feared in that hypothetical situation where we did not pass the stress testing.  The scenario as presented by Professor Morgan Kelly is hypothetical.  The response of the banks in dealing with the problems has been shown to be successful by two stress tests.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200032#FF00400"><p>The situation in the accident and emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda requires the immediate attention of the HSE and the Department of Health.  The Minister will know from our various conversations over the past three years that I am proud of my local hospital.  I am proud of its staff and I know the staff quite rightly take great pride in the service they provide to the people of Drogheda and for the people across the north east and north County Dublin.</p><p>  The hospital has evolved considerably in recent years from being a local acute hospital and maternity service to a major regional centre of excellence, the major trauma centre for the north east with a busy, newly built emergency department dealing with more patients than ever.  The Minister will be aware of the longer-term plan for the further expansion of the emergency department with &euro;22 million allocated to the project which will double the capacity.  Full planning permission was recently granted for this expansion and the project is ready to go.</p><p>  This does not deal, however, with the problem facing nurses, doctors, hospital management and, most important, the patients and their families.  Yesterday morning, a total of 45 patients who had been technically admitted to the hospital, were waiting for beds, with nine patients in a queue in the accident and emergency department.  Management and staff did their utmost to respond as best they could to the situation by reassigning staff and opening some new beds in other facilities in the region.  However, the major problem is that since the reconfiguration of hospital services in the north east under the previous Government, the Lourdes hospital has never had the full complement of beds which a region with this size of population merits.  It did not have a full complement under Fianna F&aacute;il when the country was awash with money and I take the view that neither does it now.  Older patients who are medically discharged need their home care packages fast-tracked.</p><p>  The Minister for Health and the HSE need to provide the necessary resources for the development of 100 beds in a long-term residential nursing home, a proposal promoted by me and by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.  The HSE has applied to the Department of Health for capital funding to allow this project to come to fruition.  This is my aim and that of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd.  It is now the policy of the HSE region of Dublin and the north east which made an application in recent months.</p><p>  The Cottage Hospital in Drogheda has been kept open and it is a facility in which the Minister has an interest.  The hospital cares for those who are no longer acutely ill and are waiting until they are well enough to go home or until their longer-term care needs are addressed.  It is vital to see the new extra transitional care beds which the HSE is committed to delivering and which are much needed.  The HSE is working with the staff in the hospital to fulfil that goal.</p></speech>

Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, experienced an unusually high level of presentations at its emergency department on Monday and Tuesday of this week, which placed services under severe pressure.  The situation was exacerbated this week by the fact that over 57% of the inpatient beds in the hospital have been occupied by elderly patients who generally require more complex care or who may be waiting for community or nursing home services to facilitate their discharge from acute hospital care.  In this regard, all available private nursing home capacity is being utilised and it is intended that a further 15 beds will be opened in Louth County Hospital.  In response to the pressures experienced earlier this week, a full escalation protocol was engaged within the hospital, and other hospitals within the area were notified and assistance requested.</p><p>  The overall aim of an escalation protocol is to ensure each hospital with an emergency department has a fit for purpose operational framework to respond to surge pressures.  The hospitals must manage admissions, discharges and escalation - surge capacity - procedures in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  It is important that escalation measures are undertaken across the full health system, including primary, community and continuing care services, to ensure all available capacity and options are utilised and brought to bear on the situation.</p><p> In response to the surge experienced in Drogheda, all non-urgent meetings and training sessions were cancelled to ensure availability of staff, including diagnostic teams - for example, radiology and laboratory - and allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, to focus on managing that surge.  All emergency department requests were expedited to allow everyone to focus on the emergency department response.  Elective endoscopy was cancelled or diverted, thus making six beds available to emergency department admissions. This will remain the case for the rest of this week and next.  Cancelled procedures are being redirected to Louth County Hospital to ensure patients are accommodated.  Non-urgent and non-cancer related elective activity is also cancelled at present.  In addition, use of the minor injuries unit and GP services are being actively promoted for appropriate patients.</p><p> Unusual pressures such as these are disappointing for the Department, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the HSE's special delivery unit, but much more so for the patients and their families for whom these delays add discomfort and further distress.  However, as a result of the efforts of the staff and management of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the number of patients awaiting admission has reduced significantly, from 45 at 8 a.m. yesterday to 15 at 8 a.m. this morning.  I take this opportunity to join Deputy Nash in commending the hospital staff on their efforts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200033#GG00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his detailed response.  I am aware that the numbers awaiting admission have reduced dramatically in the past 24 hours.  It is due to the work of nursing staff, doctors and hospital management that these serious inroads are being made.  Earlier today I contacted the INMO to arrange a meeting to discuss this problem, which concerns the wider community in Drogheda, County Louth and the east Meath area.  It is an issue we must address.</p><p>  When the special delivery unit got stuck into this issue of trolley waits at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital a couple of years ago, we began to see significant year-on-year reductions.  In fact, the trolley figures have more than halved since the Government came into office, from 7,500 in 2011 to 3,212 in 2013.  That dramatic reduction represents serious progress in addressing the problem.  It is all well and good, however, for the Minister or me to point to that progress.  The reality is that ill people being made to wait on trolleys for admission to a bed in this or any other hospital in the country is a situation people are not prepared to tolerate.  It is time to tackle this issue in conjunction with the SDU.  The response by the SDU to the crisis previously was excellent, progressive and effective.</p><p>  In an ideal situation, nobody would be waiting on trolleys, and there is no doubt that some of the reforms led by hospital staff and the Department have worked.  What it boils down to, however, is that where blockages arise in regard to the fair deal scheme and home care packages, they must be addressed without delay.  The underlying problem is the high numbers of elderly patients stuck in acute beds when that is not necessarily the right place for them.  The only way we can address this problem locally is by ensuring the HSE's proposal to develop a 100-bed unit at the site of St. Mary's Hospital on the Dublin Road in Drogheda is delivered.  It is a proposal I support, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.  I hope the Minister will take on board our representations in this regard.</p></speech>

We have major reforms under way which are yielding results.  I thank the front-line staff and management for implementing those reforms with 10% fewer staff, a 20% reduction in budget and an 8% growth in the population.  Despite these pressures, we are still managing to improve the service and will continue to do so.  Ultimately, however, reforms of the current system can only go so far, which is why I will shortly be bringing forward a White Paper on universal health insurance.</p><p>  Regarding the fair deal scheme, it is important to note that it operates in chronological order, with people in the community coming on stream first followed by people in hospital, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Early last year we opened up a number of long-term care beds, many of which went to people in the community.  As such, they did not alleviate the situation in hospitals.  I am in ongoing discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch on this issue.  Patients who require long-term care are, by definition, very ill and, in many cases, elderly.  As Minister for Health and as a doctor, my view is that those who are most acutely in need, namely, the people who are acutely ill in casualty, must be prioritised.  If that means we sometimes have to break the chronological order under the fair deal scheme, then it will be done because it is the fair thing to do.  I do not agree that we should dispense entirely with the chronological order, but when we experience surges such as we have seen at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, we must take action to protect those who are most vulnerable and most at risk.  Those are the patients lying on trolleys in our emergency departments.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and the staff of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for the great work they are doing, as well as the staff right across the health system who have implemented major improvements despite the lack of resources they face.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is in the Chamber to take it.  As he will know, in south Tipperary an ambulance service operates out of Cashel, Clonmel and Tipperary town.  There has been a concentrated effort by the national ambulance service to downgrade the service in south Tipperary by reducing the number of ambulances and ambulance personnel.  It is bad enough having people waiting on trolleys in our hospital in south Tipperary on a daily basis and staff operating under enormous pressures.  Now we will not have enough ambulances to collect sick people in any type of reasonable response time.  The service covers a huge area from the hills of Araglin right up to the hills of Hollyford.  It includes a national primary road and a motorway, as well as significant industry.  This issue is of huge concern to people in the area who are wondering what will happen if they have an accident or become ill.</p><p>  I have called on the national ambulance service to engage immediately, on respectful and conciliatory terms, with ambulance personnel in south Tipperary.  I salute those staff on behalf of my constituents in south Tipperary and beyond for their dedication in getting to people as fast as they can and using their paramedic training to stabilise patients and transport them safely to hospital.  The personnel in Cashel have come up with a very reasonable proposal that will improve the situation from the perspective of the HSE and the national ambulance service management.  They have offered an additional four hours of cover per day and other changes to the roster, which is currently very damaging to their own family life.  This proposal has been rejected, however, by the national ambulance service, which seems determined to downgrade the service in Cashel and possibly also in Clonmel.</p><p>  The Minister is aware that we have lost the psychiatric hospital in Clonmel.  Patients are now transferred to Kilkenny, which makes the ambulance service even more important.  I do not have time to list all the pressures under which the service is operating.  Will the Minister take a common sense approach and engage directly on this issue?  He promised when he took office that he would get rid of the HSE and take a hands-on approach, instead of having these agencies in the middle engaging in bullyboy tactics and telling people they must do X or Y or else.  We have a High Court agreement signed by the then Minister for Health and now Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, under which guarantees were given that two ambulances would be based in Clonmel, with sufficient staff and an adequate roster.  Those guarantees were reiterated last year.</p><p>I was present on the day the agreement was reinforced or reinstated by a Supreme Court judge.</p><p> The Minister has to sit up and listen.  He must get involved here.  These very dedicated staff are covered under the Haddington Road agreement.  The Minister is using reviews, mar dhea examinations and more reviews to wait until the Haddington Road agreement runs out.  At that stage, he will do the dirty work and remove the ambulance.  The people of Tipperary will not stand for this.  They are entitled to a modicum of service.  The personnel who are in place are doing a good job.  I want the Minister to live up to the commitment he gave the people of Tipperary and the rest of Ireland, which was that he would take a hands-on approach to prevent the HSE from issuing diktats without any communication or engagement with local politicians or the personnel involved.  He should ask the HSE to acknowledge that what is currently in place is not broken and therefore does not need to be fixed.  The people of Tipperary should have some bit of ease and relaxation in the knowledge that an ambulance will come if it is needed.</p></speech>

The service continues to modernise and reconfigure its services to ensure emergency pre-hospital care is delivered in an appropriate and timely manner.  Since 2012, in particular, there have been significant changes in rostering and work organisation arrangements for paramedic and control staff, following Labour Court recommendations.  These changes have included addressing arrangements which are obsolete in the provision of a modern pre-hospital emergency service, such as moving from rostering with built-in overtime to arrangements which reflect a standard 39 hour week.  The move from on-call rostering, where staff are off-site waiting to be summoned, to on-duty rostering, where paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles during shifts, is ongoing.  This is leading to faster deployment because the crew is in position to respond immediately to calls, rather than having to wait for the average on-call deployment period of over 20 minutes.  On-duty rostering is now in place across much of the State.  As part of the modernisation programme, an ongoing review of service provision is taking place in the former south-east area.  This includes consideration of rostering arrangements and resource allocation.  I am aware the Deputy has concerns regarding Cashel ambulance station.  I am informed by the National Ambulance Service there have been no changes in respect of cover or rostering arrangements at that station.</p><p>  The reform programme that is under way will ensure we have a clinically driven and nationally co-ordinated system that is supported by improved technology.  Development funding of &euro;3.6 million and 43 additional staff have been provided for in the 2014 national service plan.  The national control centre reconfiguration project is a key measure in this programme.  The National Ambulance Service has traditionally operated in eight ambulance regions, with no inter-connection of radio and computer systems.  This has delayed improvements in emergency response times, particularly at regional boundaries where the nearest ambulance may have been in the neighbouring region.  The control centre project is moving to one national control system, on two sites, with significant investment in new voice, data and mapping technologies.  This will allow the National Ambulance Service to deploy emergency resources more effectively and efficiently, regionally and nationally rather than within small geographic areas.  The national centre will be located in Tallaght and Ballyshannon, with the project expected to be completed next year.  I assure the House that the National Ambulance Service will continue to modernise and reconfigure its services to ensure emergency pre-hospital care is delivered in an appropriate and timely manner.</p></speech>

We have reconfigured.  We lost our hospital in Cashel.  We have a High Court agreement.  The paramedics and staff are not resisting change.  All they want is to be able to operate in the knowledge that they will not be blamed for any embarrassing or sad situations that might arise.  I do not want to predict doom and gloom.  When I hear all the lovely talk about "reconfiguration" - the Minister was prepared to read a statement about what might or will happen to the National Ambulance Service - I wonder what will happen when ambulances cannot get away from hospitals because there are no beds or trolleys to put people on, which is what happened at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Does the Minister know what will happen to all the predictions regarding delivery, call-out and response times when an ambulance is held up for hours because the trolley the last patient was brought in on is being used in the hospital to accommodate that person due to a lack of trolleys?  This is all poppycock.  It is lovely in writing.  It is lovely jargon for the Minister to read out and quote from.  It is nice that it is dressed up in flowery language like "reconfiguration".</p><p>  The bottom line is that we need a safe service.  The people of Tipperary and elsewhere are entitled to such a service.  They should not have to wait for periods of time that one might expect to have to wait for in a Third World country.  We have to maintain this.  Does the Minister have any respect for the High Court or Supreme Court judges?  Does he have any respect for the agreements that were signed and organised by his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he served as Minister for Health?  I ask the Minister to intervene in this matter by asking the National Ambulance Service to come up with proper management structures.  He has mentioned figures for new ambulances and new recruits, but what about natural wastage?  What about vehicles that are off the road because they have reached the end of their days?  Is the Minister expecting the Civil Defence or the Red Cross to fall in here?  Is he expecting people to use their own vehicles?</p><p>  During a recent edition of &quot;Prime Time&quot;, we heard about many cases of people who were beside hospitals in built-up areas but nevertheless had to wait nearly an hour for ambulances to arrive.  This is not the fault of the paramedics.  We do not have enough of them because they are being cut back, moved and downgraded.  Blame is being placed on honourable people who are trained and abide by the hippocratic oath.  They want to look after those who are in need, but they do not have the personnel or the ambulances to enable them to do so.  The Minister spoke about new radios and everything else.  That will not be much good to people when they are in the hills of Hollyford or Araglin, with an hour and a half of driving in between.  I ask the Minister to sit up and see what is happening here.  He needs to stop this situation from arising.  He should not wait for the review, as it will be too late for people's lives.</p></speech>

We need to stick to the facts.  There has been a great deal of investment in the National Ambulance Service in recent years.  We have not diminished the number of ambulances.  In fact, we have added to that number by providing intermediate care vehicles and using different vehicles for inter-hospital transfers, which were mentioned by the Deputy.  As a result of these measures, more ambulances are available for acute emergency care.  I remind the House that despite this country's financial difficulty, this Government was the first to bring in an air ambulance service, which serves the area alluded to by Deputy McGrath.  I know there were some reports and claims in local media earlier this year that ambulance services in Cashel were being downgraded.

Some &euro;129 million has been invested in our ambulance services.  The service employs approximately 1,550 staff and uses more than 480 vehicles.  The volume of calls has increased significantly in recent years.   Some 229,703 calls, equating to an average of 19,142 a month, were made in 2012.  That figure has increased to 296,730, which equates to a monthly average of almost 27,000 calls.  When there is such a volume of calls, sadly there will occasionally be times when the targets cannot be met.  It is a very serious situation for those people.  The ambulance service is striving to ensure ambulances are available for the most serious calls to deal with those who are most in need.  That remains the goal.  As the Deputy knows, we have limited resources.  We have invested in the ambulance service and we will continue to do so.  I congratulate the men and women who work in our ambulance services on the great work they do.</p></speech>

I have never forgotten one image from the campaign that really sticks in my mind.  When I was canvassing near Murrough Avenue in Renmore one day, I met a woman in her mid-60s who was looking forward to retiring and having her working life behind her.</p><p>She was absolutely distraught.  She was crying at the door and her whole sense of purpose had disappeared.  She had put her entire savings from the previous 20 years into bank shares as something secure on which she could rely, but everything she had worked for was completely gone.  At the time there was a sense of hopelessness in the air and no sense of where we were going.  The only view was that things would get worse.  We had just lost or sovereignty two months earlier.  People's national pride had been damaged by the country being humiliated into seeking emergency assistance.  Nobody would lend to us unless we surrendered our sovereignty and committed to a certain course of action.  There was a real sense of despair and hopelessness.  There was a sense that what was to come could never live up to what we had before and expectations had been dashed.</p><p> Three years ago was my first time to run in a general election.  The people I met were generally considerably older than me.  I felt a great sense of responsibility at that time.  I feel we have been vindicated somewhat by what we have managed to do in the past three years.  That sense of pure despair and hopelessness has gone.  That sense that the country has nowhere to go but down is gone.  There is a creeping sense of confidence that while times are still very difficult, hard decisions remain to be made and we are not out of the woods, we can see a way forward.</p><p> In this time that we have allotted to discuss the priorities in the year ahead, it is worth looking back over those three years in order to remember what has changed and why things improved.  They have improved because considerable work has been done by Government parties and people across the country to pick the country up by its bootstraps and get it standing tall again with a sense of confidence and purpose for the future.</p><p> Of course in the past three years the national discourse was dominated by talk of public finances, GDP growth, interest rates, promissory notes, international lenders and ratings agencies - things that do not connect with people struggling to get by in their lives.  It is not something people are inclined to worry about or ought to have to worry about because it is something very technical and obscure.  Much of the work we had to do was esoteric.  It was something that was unique to us and a certain clique of society that is in that world.  The average person felt disconnected from that discussion even though what has happened as a result of tackling some of those issues has been extremely powerful and positive.</p><p> We are finally starting to see job creation.  People can see that the real bread-and-butter issues are taking top priority.  We are seeing successes, going from losing 7,000 jobs every month to now creating 5,000 jobs every month.  We need to acknowledge that is a major turnaround and will make a huge difference.  For every ten jobs we create, seven further jobs are created in the economy and we will start to see that cumulative effect filtering is way through.</p><p> I issue a word of warning.  While we need to look at how we use those resources, how we ease tax burdens and how we can roll back on some of the draconian measures taken, the national debate in the next two years cannot focus exclusively on who is going to cut how much tax.  If we go through three years of hell and dictatorial attitudes from the troika, involving sacrifices of hard decisions, merely to reduce our public debate to one single issue, we will have done the State a severe disservice.</p><p> We have so many more things that we now need to discuss with the freedom we have got.  What are we going to do with our resources as they improve?  How will we improve the lives of children?  How will we ensure people do not just have jobs but have well-paid jobs and security for the future?  How will we ensure people have pensions on which they can rely?  If they are working and paying into a system there needs to be a reward and security for them.  How will we have the best education system in the world in order to ensure in the future the jobs in the emerging world economy come to Ireland and do not go to other countries?</p><p> How will we ensure we have participation in society such that people feel connected to it?  As citizens of Ireland, people should feel that they participate in the economy and society, to avoid what happened before, which was to leave it to the market and allow the clique at the top take the cream and create a society that suits a certain amount of people who have money already.  If as happened before the herd mentality comes back and we are all chasing one goal dictated to us by wealthy individuals, lazy media and so on, we will repeat all the mistakes again.</p><p> We need to think about the type of economy we want to build.  We need to talk about workers and their role in society.  We must cherish the human capital that makes our society and put it at the centre.  Workers, who every day bring their children to school, go to work and create wealth, must be at the centre of decision making because they are the ones who create the wealth we can then redistribute to other areas of society to fulfil our societal goals.</p><p> We need to get real about public services.  We need to provide a proper public service and not one that is simply funded to the level we can afford.  We need to know what we want to do with it.  What do we want its role in society to be?  Ireland has never decided if it wants to be a social democratic society or a conservative society.  Does it want to have top class public services or not?  We need to have that debate and make a decision.  We need to be political about it.  There is an anti-politics view that we can just leave things out there and not worry about it because things will happen anyway.  That is what got us into this mess.  We need to make decisions and have a goal as a society.  We spent three years with one national priority, to get rid of the troika, and we need to replace it with a new national priority, which is to create something different from that which went before, something we can be proud of and that will live up to the kind of society we ought to have and would like to see for our children and future generations.</p><p> However, I will pick one issue which the Government should prioritise and focus on.  While I can compliment and commend the Government on all other issues, I have seen little or no progress on this issue.  It is not a very popular issue and does not get much discussion in the media or in this House.  I refer to the issue of asylum seekers and the immigration system.  I am sick to the teeth of meeting individuals with lives, personalities and families, hopes and dreams, who are stuck in a perpetual system of nihilism, emptiness and idleness because they are trapped in our system if immigration and direct provision.</p><p> A number of weeks ago a man told me he had spent eight years living in a hostel in a room shared with other people waiting for the conclusion of his immigration process.  That is eight years on &euro;19 a week, not working, not in education, not participating.  The strain on that individual as a result of a life of emptiness was visible.  If we look back on this period in some years' time and ask what we did with this group of people, I would say that we forced upon them idleness and mental health problems all because we failed to sort out the immigration process.  I have raised the issue several times with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  I have met him personally about it and I have raised the issue in the D&aacute;il.</p><p> We are continually told that a new Bill is on the way to provide for a single-procedure system to streamline, strengthen and improve our immigration system in order to remove this waste of human potential and human capital.  Every time I asked - there years ago, two years ago and last Christmas - I have been told it is six months away.  I am starting to question whether the issue really is a priority and something the Minister wants to get done.  We have managed to get other much more complicated Bills through and we are still waiting for this Bill.  While we do that, we are condemning a generation of people seeking protection in our country to this utter waste of their human potential.  We need to get this done.  It costs nothing to introduce legislation and would save the State money to have a quicker procedure.  Let us do something that will not get us headlines or popular support, but is something that is morally right, and right from the point of view of human rights, the individual and humanity.  Let us fix this broken immigration and direct provision system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200036#KK00100"><p>It has been a difficult six years for many people in this country with the collapse of the economy and the collapse in the Irish banking system.  The outgoing Government and this Government have invested much of their time in the attempt to repair the banking system and regenerate the economy.  We are coming from a very bad place because Ireland's reputation suffered greatly as a result of the economic collapse and the banking collapse, not just in terms of ourselves as citizens of the State but internationally also.  Someone described inward investment to Ireland in 2008 as being similar to switching off a tap because everything that could go wrong for this country went wrong.</p><p>  Depending on one's resources, financial standing etc. different sections of society dealt with the collapse in a different way but we should never forget that some people suffered more than others.  The thousands of people forced to leave this country, the almost 500,000 people who found themselves without work and on the dole, and people whose homes were threatened due to insecure mortgages are ongoing problems.  It is a testament to the character of Irish people that they had any hope to continue in the past six years, given what happened, but I believe we are in a better place today than we were six years ago or even three years ago.  That is not to suggest that everything is rectified; it is not.  </p><p>  In commentary both inside this House and outside it I have always found alarming the notion that the new Government that came in three years ago would suddenly find employment for almost 500,000 people and that, in the space of 36 months, it would be able to fix the economy, the banking system etc.  Some of the commentary and the narrative has been nothing short of ridiculous.  There is not a country in the history of the world whose economy and banking system collapsed but was repaired in 36 months.</p><p>  Following on from that we are now in a post-bailout system.  As politicians we must be mindful not so much of what we want but what the people want.  Using the words of those who have suffered the most - those who lost their jobs or were forced to emigrate - people like us should be trying to protect and enhance their future as citizens of this State, be it in terms of employment or protecting the homes of those in difficulties with mortgages etc.  Those are the sort of priorities we should focus on in the years ahead, in other words, the people who suffered the most should be out front.</p><p>  I dislike the phrases &quot;We are all in this together&quot; and &quot;Everyone suffered.&quot;  That is nonsense.  We are not all in this together.  The reality is that there are people untouched by the collapse of this economy because of their wealth.  In the history of the world it is always the ordinary working man and woman who take the hiding, so to speak, in this situation.  We must be mindful of that in terms of what I said earlier and what Deputy Nolan referred to in his contribution about people's welfare.  That is the priority.</p><p>  Leaving aside the recent past what is happening now is that politicians on both sides of the House are rebuilding this country after the tragic loss in terms of the economy and so on but talk of repairing it in 36 months is nonsense.  Improvements, albeit marginal improvements, are being made but for ordinary people hope is what they hold onto, namely, the hope of getting a job, having a home and being able to stay in their home.  The function of politicians is to generate solutions to these issues and to give people hope and confidence in their future and that of their families.  That is not happening at the rate all of us would wish but, nevertheless, there is movement.</p><p>  To use my constituency as an example, unfortunately, we have the highest level of unemployment in the State, much of it focused around construction workers, tradespeople etc., but we have had notice of a large extension to The Square shopping centre, with an investment of over &euro;50 million.  When the planning process is completed construction on the site will involve 170 people and when the project is completed it will provide jobs for almost 400 people.  We had also the recent announcement by the Department of Health on an urgent care centre to be located not far from The Square site involving an investment of almost &euro;30 million.  That, too, will bring much-needed construction jobs to the area, and one or two more minor construction projects are due to come on-stream also.  I am talking about my constituency but these are the type of projects that give people hope because they have been battered, so to speak, something to which all speakers have alluded.  Economic recovery is good for everyone because the vast majority of people who are without work want to work, and we should afford them that opportunity.</p><p>  In terms of the priorities and what we should focus on whether in the year ahead, two years ahead or five years ahead, job creation is the most important issue.  It will give people the opportunity of getting up in the morning, going to work and having an independent, disposable income, which gives them back their self-esteem and confidence.  The other aspect is that the more people who are working, the more who are paying taxation, and we all know the benefits of that.  We can have a better society in which to live and better facilities in the country.  Let us look forward to the future in the hope that those who have suffered the most in the past six years will be given hope.</p></speech>

We need only consider the programme for Government and, three years on, extrapolate from it the successes or failures.  One would have to say that by any credible stretch of the imagination there has been a great deal of spin as opposed to substance in terms of the Government's performance.  I will refer to the health area later.</p><p>  On taking office this Government's general philosophy was that over the five-year period it would make major contributions in terms of employment.  The NewERA document, which was then transposed into Government policy, proposed the creation of 100,000 jobs.  We were to have debt restructuring, debt write-down and the stabilisation of the banking system.  Reflecting on what has been achieved, one could argue there has been very little movement away from the plan that had been previously put in place and the Government policies that were outlined in the programme for Government have not been supplanted into that.</p><p>It is almost a betrayal of its mandate to suggest the Government has adopted the proposals that it put before the Irish people and was elected on.</p><p> Reference has to be made to the whole area of the restructuring of debt and debt writedown.  There have been great plaudits and much back-slapping on the Government benches with regard to the renegotiation of the promissory notes.  None of us at any stage had a lot of joy about the time we had to enter into the promissory notes and make commitments to burden the Irish people for many years but, by an stretch of the imagination, given the vulnerability of the State at the time, decisions had to be made in a very pressurised situation.  There is a letter in the Department of Finance from Jean-Claude Trichet, the previous President of the ECB, to the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance, with regard to the bailout and the pressure that was put on the sovereign Irish State and its people at the time by the ECB and others to ensure there would be no burning of bondholders, because this might have a contagious effect on the broader euro currency area.  On numerous occasions, it has been requested that this letter be released and, on numerous occasions, this has been refused.  If it was a letter that was very damaging or indicted the previous Government in some way, I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would have put that into his breast pocket and slipped it out the back door some night.  Some night he would have done that, if that was the case.  It beggars belief that we are now talking about banking inquiries and everything else-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200037#LL02400"><p>What I am saying is that if we want to get to the bottom of what happened, we need an honest debate about where we were, how we got there and how we are trying to get out of there.  It would be appropriate for this Government to be more up-front in all its dealings with regard to the Irish people in terms of sovereign debt, bank recapitalisation and retrospective bank recapitalisation.  These are the key issues.  They are the central tenets on which the Government was elected from this side of the House.</p><p>  We can talk about the past in its entirety, but when Government members were on this side of the House, every morning it was a scorched earth policy of opposition.  They can say anything they like about this Opposition but, in fairness, when we believe something is right and proper, we support it.  At the time, however, it was a scorched earth policy, particularly that pursued by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, when in opposition.  Take, for example, the establishment of NAMA.  NAMA was brought in for a specific purpose, namely, to try to stabilise the bank balance sheets, which were impaired to a certain extent, and to transfer the debt.  Day in, day out, the leader of the Labour Party consistently insinuated that it was being established to bail out individuals, developers and others.  The Government has now been in office for three years but it has not changed as much as one sentence or comma of the legislation underpinning NAMA.  That is because it was set up for a specific purpose when the State was at its most vulnerable.  Yet, when they were in opposition, they consistently tried to undermine it, not for any ideological reason but for no reason other than bare-faced opposition when this State probably needed a little bit of united support in order to face the abyss before it.</p><p>  With regard to the health services, the Minister for Health gave an interview today congratulating himself and slapping his own back for his achievements in office in the past three years.  In the same breath, he then announced there will be a delay in the rollout of universal health insurance, that the White Paper will not be published for some time and even that it will not be a White Paper at all but a Green Paper, and that this will go into a consultative mode for the next year or so.  On any critical analysis, this is simply a slap in the face to the Minister for Health by his Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have both decided that the Minister for Health's handling of universal health insurance has been bungled, to say the least, given he could waltz into a Cabinet sub-committee meeting without any costings, any analysis or any idea of the impact it might have on the cost of providing compulsory private health insurance to families throughout this country or on the funding of services.  None of this was done.  This is a central plank of how we are going to fund the second largest spending Department, which needs to be guaranteed a certain source of funding every year to provide basic services, yet the Minister in charge of that Department has no notion of the cost of the policies he is pursuing or of how it will impact on the health services.  Just as importantly, he has no notion of how it will impact on citizens who will not be asked but forced to take out universal health insurance, because it will be compulsory.  It beggars belief that a senior Minister could, after three years in government, come forward with a piece of paper that effectively had no costings and no impact analysis on the provision of services.  </p><p>  We are discussing priorities for the year ahead and it is March 2014.  I want to look at the priorities for 2013 because to analyse retrospectively the Government's performance would be better than hoping it will be better this time around.  The 2013 priorities stated that the Department of Health would publish a White Paper on universal health insurance in 2013, but that was not delivered.  The Department was to establish a new patient safety agency on an administrative basis in 2013, and that was delivered in 2014, thanks very much.  There was a commitment the Department would work with the HSE and the State Claims Agency to develop a risk-based approach to provision of indemnity to services and professions by the end of 2013, and that was not delivered either.  We can go on and on.</p><p>  What I find most amazing of all is the issue of the funding and delivery of services and, more importantly, the cutbacks to services, all of which have been targeted at the most vulnerable.  We have time and again, year in, year out, a readjustment of the HSE budget in September or October.  Every year, this targets the most vulnerable.  There are cuts to home helps and personal assistants and the increase in prescription charges.  Does the Minister of State have any concept of what &euro;25 per month means to people on a fixed income?  The Minister for Health, when he was in opposition, told us that our introduction of a 50 cent prescription charge per item would have an impact on people's ability to access medication.  He said it would even cost lives because it would deter people from taking medication.  The same Minister, not in opposition but in government, promised he would get rid of the prescription charge in April 2011, yet in March 2014, three years into his tenure, we find that prescription charges have increased fivefold.  I would like to know from the Minister what is the difference between March 2011 and March 2014.  Other than the passing of three years, there is no difference at all.  What has happened is that ordinary people have been penalised, particularly those on fixed incomes who cannot access medication because it is costing them up to &euro;25 a month.</p><p>  By any stretch of the imagination, this debate should have facilitated us to scrutinise the Government's record to date, not allowed the Government to engage in self-congratulation on the benches opposite, pretending and spinning that it has done a good job.  This has been a shameful exercise for the last two weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200037#LL02500"><p>In 2011 we saw a big shake-up and there was the potential for a realignment of Irish politics.  As someone who had left this House and came back in that year, I could see the change not just because of the change in Government but also the depleted Fianna F&aacute;il benches, and I got a sense that things were going to be different.  We know that the new Government fought the election on the basis that it was going to bring in change and that there was going to be a new direction and a new approach.</p><p>Perhaps I am biased but I think the consensus among most people is that this has not happened.  The question arises as to why it has not happened.  The Government will say that it was because it did not realise the country was in such difficult economic circumstances and it did not have the inside track on figures and so on.  Many people get annoyed and start to disagree with Government spokespersons because they have not seen the new direction and approach.  It is much the same.  I must agree with the previous speaker in that much of what has been adopted by the Government was proposed by the previous Administration.  </p><p> People say that there was cronyism and there is anger and frustration among voters about what happened previously.  There have been scandals.  One looks at the recent GSOC scandal and what many people would regard as the stroke politics of the Minister for Health in respect of the debacle that led to a Minister of State walking out of Government over primary care.  My constituency suffered the fallout from that.  Some of that money was to have gone into my constituency where people were crying out for primary care services.  That is impacting people's health and the local hospital.</p><p> I was interested to hear what my constituency colleague, Deputy Maloney, said about the lack of hope.  He is right.  All of us have a responsibility to give people hope that change is possible.  The fact that things did not change and there was no new approach leads people to say that politicians are all the same and say one thing in opposition and do the opposite in government.  This undermines politics and politicians.  Ministers saying that one says this when one is in opposition does not help us when we try to convince people not only to be active in politics but, at a basic level, to go out and vote.  </p><p> There were promises of job creation but youth unemployment is nearly 30%.  Again, my constituency colleague was talking about Dublin South West, which has some of the highest unemployment rates in the country.  We have a youthful population, which is positive, but many of those young people are out of work and the Government has cut the dole for those aged under 25.  Again, this places huge pressure on families and individuals.  The Deputy spoke about some positive things that might be coming down the track, for example, construction jobs.  I do not take any pleasure in saying that one of the Government's failures is the fact that according to people in the construction industry, there are problems with the way some of the jobs proposed in the stimulus package are being put out to tender.  Companies are coming in and underpricing jobs.  The Government could look at that.  Many of the bigger jobs in construction are being awarded to companies that are clearly not compliant and that hire subcontractors, many of whom are from outside the State and are undercutting legitimate companies that are trying to pay people's wages at the proper rate and work to union agreements.  There is a difficulty there.  Even the small stimulus package put forward by the Government is causing problems.  </p><p> Drug dealing is increasing in towns and cities across Ireland.  We have seen the Garda response and there have been huge successes in my constituency.  However, drugs of all types are being sold openly only a couple of hundred yards away so that is a difficulty, a political failure and a failure on the part of the Department.  During this Government's tenure, there has been a cut of almost 20% in drugs task force areas.  At the same time, we are dealing with the growing availability of drugs.  There is no funding for emerging needs or those communities that are at the coal face and trying to deal with the problem.  This difficulty needs to be addressed but I do not think any other speaker has touched on that area.  It is something that can and needs to be done.  </p><p> There have been difficulties with the EU.  One memorable stated commitment was to extend the scope of bank liability to include unsecured and unguaranteed senior bonds.  The ECB has appeared to say &quot;No&quot; and that seems to be that.  All the talk of game changers and new beginnings fell flat and the good old Irish taxpayer was left carrying the can and continuing to foot the bill.  There was all sorts of backslapping at the weekend regarding Angela Merkel but there was no talk of her in respect of it.  She was saying how successful we are but nobody is talking about the difficulty, pain and hardship that the policies she has pushed have caused people not only in Ireland, but across Europe.</p><p> The Government has also reneged on commitments to reform how the Oireachtas conducts EU business.  I have just come from a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is the usual thing.  There was talk of full scrutiny of EU draft proposals but this has not really happened.  There was talk of systems being put in place to ensure Ministers did not bypass the Oireachtas and make decisions in Brussels on EU matters before those matters are subjected to scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  Again, this has not really happened.  Other countries are much more inclusive.  For all the talk of D&aacute;il reform, there have been no real examples.  The scrutiny of EU affairs in Denmark involves the Government and the Opposition.  There is dialogue there.  </p><p> In respect of the review of the foreign aid budget, the Minister of State has stated that the Government will not reach the target.  Again, there does not seem to be a plan regarding how we are going to do that.  That is causing concern.  D&oacute;chas has rightly said that by abandoning this commitment, Ireland is not only endangering vital relief and development programmes, but it is also in danger of damaging the international goodwill it has built up through its aid programme.  Again, there is much more to do here.  </p><p> Promises were made regarding positioning Ireland and Shannon Airport in particular to become an international hub for storage and distribution of emergency humanitarian supplies.  It was promised that the Government would enforce the prohibition on the use of Irish airspace, airports and related facilities that is not in line with the dictates of international law.  This has not really happened.  We are all aware that a woman is in jail in respect of what is happening at Shannon Airport, which is still being used for an illegal war in Iraq.  Most fair-minded people would say that the Government has reneged on that commitment.  If people say that this is not happening, there clearly needs to be an investigation into extraordinary rendition and human rights abuses in respect of Shannon Airport.  There needs to be an independent investigation.  We have no problem quoting human rights organisations like Amnesty International when they condemn breaches of human rights around the world so if they are claiming that this is happening in respect of Shannon Airport, why can we not use their claims as a means to an investigation?  That would enhance our reputation and move us forward into a new era.</p></speech>

What happened in the Chamber last week was a disgrace.  Much time was taken up by the Government clapping itself on the back for what it called a job well done.  I will highlight a couple of the Government's measures that it did not need to take but which have had detrimental effects on rural Ireland in particular and no economic benefit.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the coming weeks and months will be the closing period for our town councils.  They have served our communities excellently for many decades.  People from all political parties and none made valuable contributions thereon.  It was galling for me to go on a local radio show alongside a Government-supporting Deputy who was complimenting town councillors but voting in the D&aacute;il to abolish them.  Either one believes they are good and fulfilling an important role or one does not.  I have also endured Government backbenchers attending constituency meetings and agreeing that, for example, the closure of Garda stations is awful and should not happen despite voting in the D&aacute;il for their closure before returning to Kerry alongside Ministers to try to make out to their communities that giving back the stations that they took away in the first instance is actually a good thing because it costs more to keep them closed than it does to keep them open.  I proved beyond all doubt in the Chamber that it costs more to keep a rural station closed.  The Minister misled the House when he initially claimed that he was closing stations to save money.  Now, Government Deputies claim that they are trying to give the stations back to communities or to get rid of them.</p><p>  In a recent reply, the Minister told me that 40 former Garda stations had been identified for disposal on the open market and auctioneers had been appointed to manage their sale, with eight to be auctioned to the public at the end of March 2014 and the remainder to be offered for sale to the public in the coming months.  What would the politicians who used to be in the D&aacute;il during previous difficult times say about the Government selling off these assets and closing town councils?</p><p>  Local development companies have done excellent work and administered funds in a prudent fashion.  They have started up many small businesses throughout the country and much of the work they undertake is priceless.  They have set people up in businesses that are continuing to grow and create jobs, not just for the people themselves but for their friends and neighbours.  The Government in its wisdom believes that breaking up this structure and placing the local development companies under the umbrella of the local authorities is the right action to take, just as it believes that breaking up the town councils is the right action.  We will not only lose our town councillors but our town engineers, town clerks, planning departments and environmental sections as well.  The entire lot will be thrown into the county authority.  This will do no good for the delivery of services to people living in estates, the elderly or business people.  The town councils work in conjunction with chambers of commerce, Tidy Towns groups and other social groups but that entire structure is being done away with because the Minister, Deputy Hogan, believes it is a good idea.  Time will prove how wrong it is.</p><p>  The late journalist, Mr. John Healy, wrote &quot;No one shouted stop&quot;.  Given some of the Government decisions being taken, someone should be shouting &quot;Stop&quot;.  Time will prove that some of those decisions are poor.  This morning, people from An Post attended an Oireachtas committee.  Two weeks ago, the Technical Group introduced a Private Members' motion on behalf of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  Thousands of people from west Cork, Donegal, south Kerry, north Kerry, west Kerry, east Kerry, Galway and all over the country protested outside the D&aacute;il because they wanted to keep rural post offices open.  Ironically, in December 2006, Fine Gael tabled a motion similar to the Technical Group's recent one seeking the then Government to place an emphasis on retaining the network.  In government, however, Fine Gael would not support the Technical Group and IPU motion, which was intended to give people confidence in their post offices and to enhance the services provided by the network.</p><p>  We have lost many rural pubs and shops.  Everything is seemingly being centralised, but is that any wonder?  The Government is heavy with Ministers from Dublin who believe that the world stops at the Red Cow roundabout.  They should be given Sat Navs to show that there is more to the country than Dublin.  People who are supposedly charged with creating employment are only sending jobs to Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I wonder why.</p></speech>

More than ever before, we need local authorities to employ people to do the ordinary types of work that have been done for years.  Is it any wonder that when people travel the roads of Ireland, no drains are being opened and no hedges are being cut?  There is a race to the bottom because the embargo prevents local authorities from hiring people.  Staffing levels in local authorities must be increased.  Never was there more work to be done but so few to do it.  Privatisation is not the answer.  We used to have excellent people who knew what work needed to be done in their areas and went about doing it diligently.  Due to Government decisions, unfortunately, there has been a 25% reduction in staffing levels.</p><p>  Ironically, the Government believes it is a good idea to stop all business just to compliment itself for a couple of days.  It is cynical and people around the country are laughing at it.  If Ministers, who seem detached from reality, lived with people who were trying to find work, pay mortgages and send young children to school, they would not want to see Members praising them for a couple of days.  God knows, when people look back on all of this, the Government's record of hurting certain sectors of society will be famously remembered.  Its backbenchers have blindly supported key decisions.  Some of them will go before the people during the May European elections.  In two years time, they will go before the people during the general election.  The people will give their answer.  They will bite back and fight back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200040#OO00100"><p>I am here not to talk about the Government's priorities for the year ahead but rather to discuss what should be a Government priority but is not.  I refer to jobs and investment in parts of the country which have seen no economic lift to date.  There are significant areas which are almost untouched by the fragile recovery we have seen in some of the larger urban areas like Cork and Dublin.  In cities like Waterford, economic measures demonstrate that a downward trend is still being experienced.  After three years in office, the Government's investment strategy has not worked.  The question for the Government and its development agencies, including the IDA, is how they will incentivise jobs and investment in parts of the country which still have an unemployment rate of 20% or higher.</p><p>  I read the contribution to this debate given last week by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  The only reference he made to regional development was one line to the effect that all regions had experienced job growth over the past 12 months.  It does not appear to be a priority for the Government that the disparity in foreign direct investment figures for different parts of the country is both large and growing.  I have concluded that as long as the headline figures for the country as a whole are positive, the virtual non-existence of regional investment is considered irrelevant.  My theory is borne out by documents like the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  The only tangible investment for the regions cited in that document relates to advanced manufacturing facilities - one in Waterford and one in Athlone - and some office space in Letterkenny.  The rest of the document is repetitive.  I have heard it all before.  There is very little in the plan on the devising of a strategy to balance foreign direct investment across the country.  There is almost a sense of resignation about the fact that so much investment - 82% - goes to Cork, Dublin and Galway and so little goes elsewhere.</p><p>  This brings one to the question of what to do about it.  I have two specific suggestions, the first of which relates to the &euro;6.8 billion which will comprise the strategic investment fund.  It is intended that the fund will match up with private sector investment and it is hoped the overall amount invested will be &euro;12 to &euro;15 billion.  This is the only show in town.  It is the only stimulus package the country will see for the next five or six years.  The key principles of the fund are the pursuit of commercial return, which must be at the very least greater than the cost to the State of borrowing money, while targeting investments that support economic growth and jobs.  It will also seek to involve private sector co-investment and recycling of capital to allow new investments to maximise the effect on the economy.  Hopefully, private sector co-investment will include those SMEs mentioned by Professor Morgan Kelly recently.  I wonder.</p><p>  It was announced that a key aspect of the fund will be isolating it from political interference.  That is fair enough and something I understand.  We must guard against base political tendencies influencing how the stimulus package is divided up.  The relevant legislation must be clear about what the fund is intended to achieve.  Definitive policy will be necessary when it comes to devising the legislation which will determine in broad terms how and when the money is spent.  There must be heightened sensitivity to the prospect of undue political influence.  The key point is that this strategic investment fund of &euro;6.8 billion must be predominantly and proportionately invested in those parts of the country which have seen the least investment over the last ten to 15 years.  While that is a reasonable logic, it will not make sense to some politicians who see an election on the horizon and a potential lump of money for their own constituencies.  It may not even make sense to some in the private sector who do not understand the nature of our two-tier economy and evolving two-tier recovery.  It should make sense, however, to any government which is interested in balanced regional development.  For that reason, it should be a priority for the year ahead for the Government.</p><p>  Someone might ask what is my model or framework for this.  The answer is simple.  Regional aid guidelines will be published in July by the European Commission and will take into account unemployment rates and factors such as the potential for growth.  There is already a national and European acceptance that the regions are unequal and some need more financial support than others.  There is already an incentive system based on economic facts and figures.  The head of the IDA has said that regional aid guidelines and incentives have not worked in the past and are not working now.  One is left to conclude that balanced foreign direct investment into all of the regions has not happened.  The regional aid incentives have not worked.  It is therefore logical to adopt a policy to weigh the amount of strategic investment funding in favour of those parts of the country with the highest unemployment and lowest growth levels.  The level of investment should be based on the European Commission's own regional aid guidelines rather than on the subjective opinions of people in the House who may have their own political considerations.  When the legislation is published and comes before the House, if the issues I have set out are not considered, I will attempt to amend the Bill at the very least to highlight the scenario I have just painted.</p><p>  A second solution to the lack of investment in the regions involves the IDA specifically and a recent announcement that funding for 35 additional staff had been authorised.  Countless small businesses in Waterford city in my constituency have closed in the last year, including flagship shops, long-established pubs and major industrial employers.  They have included Diageo, Honeywell, Citibank, Centra, Intacta Print and B&amp;amp;Q.  In January, the IDA's job creation figures for 2013 showed Cork was up 1,441 jobs, Galway was up 705 jobs, Limerick was up 289 and Dundalk was up 504.  Waterford was a notable exception.  One observer of the economic situation locally in Waterford has estimated that approximately 200 IDA jobs were lost on a net basis in the city in 2013 and that 2,441 jobs were lost between 2008 and 2012, a period in which only 581 jobs were created.  Improvements in the live register figures must be considered in the context of the huge number of jobs Waterford has haemorrhaged over the past six years.</p><p>  I have looked at the locations of the IDA's existing staff.  There are 36 in Athlone, two in Dundalk, one in Cavan, six in Cork, three in Galway, one in Letterkenny, five in Limerick, nine in Sligo, five in Waterford and 148 in Dublin.  If the Government is to make regional development a priority this year, a good start will be to deploy the 35 new staff in the IDA in the regions which have seen the least amount of foreign direct investment over the last ten to 15 years.  There are people at the most senior level in the IDA who believe the policy designed to attract foreign direct investment evenly across the State has failed miserably and must be re-engineered immediately.  If the Government deployed the 35 staff into those places worst affected by the recession and least affected by foreign direct investment, it would send a significant message to the regions.</p><p>  I sound a warning on the strategic investment fund of &euro;6.8 billion.  It cannot end up being a political pie, gobbled up by insecure politicians with one eye on a general election.  For many regions, it is the only chance they have of a stimulus over the next five or six years.  It must be targeted and it must be focused on the areas in which it is needed most.  It is most needed in those areas in which the economic indicators of decline are at their highest levels.</p><p>That is a reasonable priority for any Government. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200041#PP00200"><p>I propose to share time with Deputy Alan Farrell.</p><p>  I concur with many of the points Deputy Deasy made on the need for new jobs to be spread more evenly in geographic terms.  I will return to this issue and how it affects my constituency in a moment. </p><p>  I regret that Deputy Healy-Rae has left the Chamber.  He criticised the Government for engaging in spin and accused it of hypocrisy before raising the issue of post offices.  Of approximately 2,000 post offices in the network in 2001, approximately 853 closed under previous Governments in the period from 2001 until 2011 and 14 have closed since the current Government was elected.  While I do not claim the Government has done everything right - mistakes have been made and other options could have taken in certain matters - it is important to bring balance to this issue and I hope to do so in the few minutes available to me.  </p><p>  Since the Government took office, the turbulence that rocked the country and wreaked havoc on the lives of thousands has been replaced by a sense of stability.  In 2007 and 2008, it was predicted that the economy would experience a soft landing and the economic downturn would be a blip.  These predictions proved groundless and the Government faced a mammoth task when it took power in 2011.  Record numbers of businesses were failing, the construction industry was imploding and the only funding available to the State was from European institutions and the International Monetary Fund.  It seemed the Government faced an impossible task.  As a result, it was forced to make difficult decisions which affected every household either in terms of employment or income.  In short, the Government had to reduce expenditure while, at the same time, protecting employment and creating new jobs.  Furthermore, Ireland's international credibility was at rock bottom and needed to be restored.  At a macro level, the Government had many balls in the air at once and at a micro level Deputies had many issues to contend with in their constituencies.  The task facing us was not an easy one.  </p><p>  The Government's many successes include the reduction in the interest rate on the promissory notes, the increase of 61,000 in the number of people in employment last year compared to 2012 and a decline in the number of people on the live register for 20 months in succession.  It is accepted, however, that many challenges lie ahead.  For example, we must still balance the budget.  In matching income with expenditure, we must try to continue to bring employment to a level that is as close to full employment as possible and ensure the thousands of people who had to leave our shores have an opportunity to return if they so wish. </p><p>  If one drew a line across the centre of the Chamber, the Government side would see the glass as half full, while the Opposition side would see it as half empty.  However, such an exercise would not bring us any further.  Viewed another way, if the Government could have looked three years into the future when it entered office - irrespective of which parties were elected - I believe it would still have taken the current path it is on.  While the job is by no means finished, the step-by-step approach the Government has pursued has yielded some success.  I accept, however, that this will come as little consolation to those who do not have a job, are in mortgage distress or have homes in negative equity.  People are still hurting despite the stability that has been achieved and the platform that has been created.  </p><p>  Tourism is one of a number of successes achieved in recent years.  The reduction to 9% in the VAT rate for the tourism industry, the abolition of the travel tax and the marketing of The Gathering last year have contributed to this success.  Deputy Deasy referred to the uneven geographical spread of the new jobs being created.  From my observations, the recent growth in tourism appears to have been evenly spread.</p><p>  Last year, almost 700,000 passengers used Ireland West Airport Knock.  I chaired a study group which produced a report setting out recommendations aimed at increasing passenger numbers at the airport to 1.2 million per annum.  I welcome the Government's decision to extend funding for regional airports for ten years, rather than eliminate it at the end of 2014, as had been originally envisaged.  Our report estimated that &euro;36 million will be required if the airport is to achieve its potential.  Ireland West Airport Knock serves the entire west and north west region.  If it achieves growth, thousands of jobs could spin off for County Donegal, County Galway, the midlands and elsewhere.  In the immediate aftermath of the abolition of the air travel tax, a number of new routes were added at the airport.  These will result in an increase of 80,000 in passenger numbers and generate further employment.  </p><p>  Much work has been done to encourage inward investment and job creation.  Increasing the number of people in employment by 61,000 last year was a major achievement.  The positive effects of employment growth and the green shoots of recovery can be seen primarily in urban areas.  While cities and towns clearly need employment growth given their populations, delivering jobs to smaller towns and villages is proving a problem.  In County Mayo, Allergan in Westport is expanding, while Northgate has started operations in Castlebar.  On the other hand, jobs have been lost at Homecare Medical Supplies and 700 jobs are under threat at Elvery's which employs 180 people in County Mayo.  The proposed management buy-out of Elvery's should proceed to ensure jobs at the company are protected.  The loss of 180 jobs in Mayo would be equivalent to the loss of 1,000 jobs in Dublin. </p><p>  To return to the need to ensure a better spread of new jobs, it will be necessary to review IDA policies and strategy.  The two major employers in my constituency base of Claremorris, CBE Limited and DeCare Dental, established operations in the town as a result of a local connection to the town rather than any efforts made by the IDA.  Between them, these two companies employ upwards of 400 people.  What this example shows is that the criteria applied by the IDA result in many areas that need employment failing to secure new jobs.  Claremorris has a MAN or metropolitan area network, a fibre network that makes the town an ideal location for investment.  A greater geographical spread of investment is required.  Thirty or 40 jobs in small towns such as Ballyhaunis, Kiltimagh, Knock, Charlestown, Swinford, Foxford or Ballinrobe would be equivalent to 500 jobs in a large urban centre.  </p><p>  The Mayo County Manager and head of the county council's enterprise section are enthusiastically pressing ahead with the establishment of local employment offices or LEOs.  These offices can provide mentoring for small businesses that deliver two, five or ten jobs.  In some ways, these jobs have a more lasting effect than major investments.  The local employment offices offer great potential in that regard.</p><p>There are challenges ahead.  A big issue for my county is that of grid network infrastructure.  All of this requires community buy-in.  I welcome the establishment of an independent commission to investigate undergrounding of the pylons.  If we continue to steamroll communities, progress will not be made.  It is not an option either to do nothing.  There is a need for a meeting of minds on this issue and for community buy-in.  While much progress has been made more needs to be done.  I have no doubt the Government will not take its eye off the ball in the years ahead.</p></speech>

The past three years in Ireland have not been easy.  I do not believe anybody is under any illusions in that regard, particularly the 450,000 people who were unemployed when this Government took office on 9 March 2011.  At that time, our economy was in ruin, we had lost our economic sovereignty and the prospects of an entire generation had evaporated simply because the political establishment of the day was too weak to deal with the mistakes it had made and the problems it had created.  The political system was unable to answer the questions being levied upon it by an increasingly angry electorate.</p><p>  This Government inherited a dysfunctional country, one which was unable to secure funding for the provision of services which we all take for granted.  What has occurred over the past three years is nothing short of remarkable.  What occurred rests squarely on the shoulders of the Irish people in terms of the sacrifices they made.  It is the Irish people and not the Government I wish to compliment this afternoon.  Without the contribution and sacrifices of the Irish people, none of this would have been possible.  There has been much discussion on the Government's priorities for the year ahead and the Government's approach to our economy and the economic restoration project in which we have been engaged for the past three years.  Although extremely difficult decisions have had to be made over the past three years, without the sacrifices of the Irish people we would not have reached where we are so quickly and most certainly would not have been able to create as many jobs as have been created during the past three years, particularly the last two years.</p><p>  The Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition took office when the country was at its lowest ebb.  It could be argued it was at its lowest ebb since the foundation of the State.  With the forbearance of the Irish people, we have managed to instil confidence and stability and to foster a growth that was painfully absent in previous years.  This confidence and stability brought 58,000 new jobs to our shores during the past 12 months, 900 of which I am pleased to say were in my constituency.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, incredibly, some 1,200 jobs per week are now being created, against the backdrop of the 1,600 jobs per month being lost in the previous years.  This Government has managed to restore our economic sovereignty having met virtually all of the criterion agreed to by the previous Administration with the troika.  We have re-established ourselves at the heart of a troubled Europe and restored our reputation in the process.  Our six month presidency of the European Council was greeted as a success and the markets have responded appropriately.</p><p>  The buzzword from 2008 to 2010 was bondwatch.  I recall it featuring daily in the newspapers.  It even had its own hashtag on Twitter, reporting the yield of the day, which while at 14% prior to this Government taking office in 2011 is now at 3%.  Nobody in Fine Gael said restoring our economy would be an easy task.  We knew difficult decisions had to be made and that there was no silver bullet or magic wand in that regard.  We knew there would be hurt but we knew progress was necessary to restore the level of jobs required to sustain our economy.  Our progress deserves an airing.  I have been frustrated during the past few weeks by Deputies opposite berating the Government for daring to have this debate.  It is important that every now and again we remind people, in particular the media which is constantly hungry for bad news stories and often misses the good news, of the stories of hope and progress.  While some dire situations remain we are trying to address them.  Constant doom and gloom makes it difficult for anybody to be anything other than cynical about politics, politicians and elections.</p><p>  In terms of business and enterprise, red tape has been removed, incentivisation programmes have been created, business support systems have been improved and a one-stop-shop for enterprise has been created in the community through the new LEO offices referred to earlier by Deputy O'Mahony.  In the area of health, waiting lists in many areas have been decimated.  Enormous progress is also being made on rolling out the huge programme of reform envisaged in the programme for Government.  The Department of Health was and continues to be one of the most difficult portfolios for any Minister.  I commend my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his Ministers of State, Deputies Alex White and Kathleen Lynch, for their work in that Department.</p><p>  In terms of D&aacute;il reform, which invariably is about reducing or improving the amount of time Members spend in this Chamber or the Seanad, the number of committees has been reduced from 25 to 16, payments for vice chairpersons and convenors have been abolished, entitlement to ministerial cars-drivers have been abolished, as per a commitment in the Fine Gael manifesto, and the number of sitting days has been increased by 32.3%.  A Topical Issue Debate, committee debates in the Chamber and Friday sittings have been introduced.  Deputies' pay and pension entitlements have been reduced and the right to draw a pension while being a sitting Member has been abolished.  We have scythed off an enormous amount of the expenses to which Members of both Houses were entitled and have made the whole process more transparent and accountable.  I acknowledge that some of this work was commenced by the previous Administration.  It was then necessary for this Government to take further steps to reduce the pay and expenses regimes of the Houses.</p><p>  In terms of education, millions of euros has been spent on new school buildings, including one for St. Oliver Plunkett's national school in Malahide, which it has been seeking since I became involved in politics ten years ago.  Despite that the previous Administration failed to recognise the requirement for new school buildings we have managed to find the money for an ever increasing demand for new school buildings.  We have done away with the pointless renting of prefabs where it makes no economic sense to continue doing so and are instead constructing new classrooms.</p><p>We recognise the enormous growth in the population and are making appropriate plans to deal with this.  Earlier today, we announced the establishment of five new schools throughout the country to deal with the issue of choice in the context of patronage.  We live in a diverse society and this must be recognised.  It is important that we take steps to provide education that is not necessarily denominational in nature.  In addition, we must be able to cater for the various demands placed on the education system.</p><p> The preservation of our heritage, both built and ancient, is of paramount importance to me.  I am pleased that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, have been able to invest in our built infrastructure.  Even only a small investment can guarantee the security of buildings at risk in years to come.</p><p> We have also responded quickly and decisively with regard to the recent storms which beset the country, particularly its western coast.  A small amount of funding allocated for repairs was given to my constituency.  However, Clare received &euro;20 million and this reflects the damage that was done during the two-week period when the country was hit by the storms in question.</p><p> In the context of local government, we have radically changed the structures of our councils.  We are about to abolish 83 town councils, which have 71 days to transfer their responsibilities to their parent councils.  In addition, the number of councillors will be reduced from 1,627 to 950 following May's local elections.</p><p> A total of &euro;68 million in funding has been allocated toward the provision of local authority housing.  While I commend the relevant Minister on this and on finding &euro;4.7 million for my constituency, which is located close to Dublin Airport, it is clearly not enough.  However, doing nothing is not an option.  I commend the Government on finding the funding in the first instance and I hope that in the coming months and years we will be in a position to try to respond to the enormous demands being placed on the social housing infrastructure provided by local authorities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, is present.  I listened to his performance on radio on Saturday afternoon last between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  Twice during the programme he repeated the claim that 61,000 jobs were created in our economy in the past year.  That claim has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> during this debate.  I have always been one to acknowledge if a person in direct opposition to me politically does something right and if I am corrected in respect of a particular matter, I accept it.  In recent years, however, I have found the level of propaganda rather than analysis and truth to be quite mind-boggling.</p><p>  I do not know whether the Minister of State has considered the detailed statistics which lie behind the claim that 61,000 jobs were created in the past year.  Does he really believe that 61,000 jobs were created during the past 12 months?  If he does, then he believes that there was a 30% increase in employment in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.  Does he really believe that this was the case during the worst year we have experienced?  Does he believe that employment in the area of agriculture has increased by 30% and that 26,800 additional jobs have been created on farms?  He knows immediately that this is not true.  All he needs to do to establish that it is not true is check the number of single farm applications.  If he does so, he will discover that the number of such applications received was not significantly different to that received during the previous year.  If the Minister of State believes the claim with regard to the creation of 61,000 additional jobs last year, then he also believes that there was a 30% increase in the number created in the area of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It should be noted that the processing industry was not taken into account in the calculation of this increase.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy bemoaned the fact that the region in which he resides did not do too well in the context of the creation of employment.  If the Minister of State really believes the figures are correct, then surely his colleague, Deputy Deasy, should be the happiest man in the House.  If the figures presented by the Government are to be believed, they indicate that the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region outperformed the south and east region including Dublin by two to one in terms of the percentage increase in employment.  That is quite an extraordinary claim.  As representatives from the BMW region, Deputy Martin Ferris and I would love to believe this to be true.  According to the statistics, the best performing region in the country, with an increase of 8.4% increase in employment, is the south east.  The next best performing region is the Border region, with an 8% increase.  After that comes the midlands region, with a 5% increase.  Dublin is doing worse than the national average with only a 2.8% increase in employment.  Next comes the west, which includes Galway city, at 2.7%.  Then we have the south west, including Cork city, with an increase of 1.2% in employment.  Finally, we have the mid-west, at 0.5%, and the mid-east, at 0.07%.  If the Minister of State believes these statistics and if he is of the view that they reflect how the economy is developing, he should ensure that the Government moves fast to invest more money in rural areas.  According to the propaganda being put about, these are the areas in which the level of employment appears to be growing at an enormous rate.</p><p>  When it published results relating to this matter, the CSO issued a warning.  It pointed out that the largest rates of increase - 29.8% or 26,800 - were recorded in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector.  The CSO also indicated that it can be noted that estimates of employment in this sector have been shown to be sensitive to sample changes over time.  It stated, &quot;Given the continued introduction of the sample based on the 2011 Census of Population as outlined in the note on the front page of this release [it was on the front page and those in government could not see it], particular caution is warranted in the interpretation of the trend in this sector at this time.&quot;  In other words, what the CSO is stating is that for a number of reasons the figure for agriculture is a statistical aberration.  Of course, one of the reasons the CSO provides is that the sample has changed.</p><p>  The other reason is quite simple and anyone who lives in a rural area will understand it.  If one considers the CSO's figures, one will detect a huge increase in the level of employment among males.  What has happened is that in the past many males were employed in construction and other industries.  When they were laid off, they applied for jobseeker's benefit.  When they were surveyed, they were assessed as being in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, that is, unemployed.  The south east, the Border region etc. show up so well in terms of the figures to which I referred earlier because in many cases the people in question live in rural areas and own small farms.  We are all familiar with part-time farmers who also engage in off-farm employment.  When the jobseeker's benefit of those to whom I refer ran out and they applied for jobseeker's allowance, one of two things happened: either they had working spouses and, in 90% of cases, were not entitled to payment or their farms were bringing in sufficient income to preclude them from receiving payment.  When they were surveyed again and asked if they were in receipt, they replied in the negative.  When they were asked if they had jobs, they replied that they are employed in agriculture.  Those are the facts.</p><p>  For that which I have outlined to be presented as the creation of 30,000 new jobs, for it to be continually repeated to the nation by the Minister of State as if he really believes it and for every Deputy opposite to be prepped by various backroom experts, who are supposed to be available to the Government and who analyse the figures in question, to come to the House in order to parrot this total fiction is absolutely despicable.</p><p>They come in like parrots, one after another, repeating this total fiction and it is absolutely despicable.  Anyone who spent five minutes examining the figures would know that there is more truth in the Grimm fairy tales than in the fairy tale of the 61,000 jobs that the Government has created.</p><p> The problem is that the Government representatives continue to state that this day is about letting the media know the great things that are happening here but the tragedy is that no one in the media is in the House for the debate.  They have long switched off from it.  They will not pick up on the real debate that is taking place in the House today when people go behind the prepared scripts, which are full of propaganda, start examining the facts and then deal with the facts.</p><p> When I tweeted last Sunday that I would show this week how these figures were wrong, Councillor Lacey could not take it on the chin.  Being an Oatlands boy like myself, he probably knew I had done my homework.  He tweeted back that we were losing jobs when we were in power.  Of course we were in the last years we were in power but there was a major increase in jobs in the early years we were in power and there are still more jobs in the economy now than there was in the 1990s.  In any event, the fact is that the jobs have not been created.</p><p> It is time that we had debates in the House based on the facts seen in the cold light of day.  One thing among many that disappoints me about the Government is that it seems to be all propaganda.  There is no serious analysis or debate and no effort to seriously try to work together to see how we can improve the country.  The Government parties would not work together on the hard decisions that had to be made and since they got into government, they continue to try to live with the myths they created about themselves.  Certainly, they do not want a cold light of analysis to be shone on what is actually happening in the economy in order that we can do something about it.</p><p> At the end of the day, it is cold comfort to all those on the social welfare system for those in government to be putting out figures that they know to be false.  Those affected know from personal experience that those jobs are not available and that there are no queues of employers coming out of the woodwork seeking to employ people.  Therefore, I hope that later this evening some member of the Government will come into the Chamber and recognise that the 61,000 figure is totally false and has no basis in fact and that employment creation last year came to 30,000, half of what the Government has stated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.573" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200044#SS00200"><p>There was a time when the so-called Celtic tiger was stalking the land and when, if we were to believe the prevailing wisdom of the Government and media at the time, the farming community thought it was the Cinderella of the Irish economy.  The crash came and the tiger went away.  Lo and behold, agriculture not only survived the crash, but it turned out to be the one sector which remained relatively stable and which has even shown growth and job creation potential.  I emphasise the word "potential".</p><p>  Jobs in agriculture are deeply embedded in the economy.  Food processing operations, for example, use raw materials from the surrounding area, employ local people and contribute to the economy in a meaningful way.  This, in turn, grows a local economy around them.  For example, when the sugar industry was sold out by Fianna F&aacute;il, the repercussions were felt far beyond the gates of the factories or the fields of beet that surrounded them.  Hauliers, agricultural contractors, shopkeepers, garages, guesthouses and all types of businesses depending on sugar went to the wall as a result.</p><p>  I grew up on a small farm that grew sugarbeet.  It was a cash crop for Christmas and a crop that lasted almost 80 years.  It provided a fantastic benefit to the economy in rural Ireland.  Sadly, the previous Government in its stupidity gave away that industry and accused those who opposed the decision of being economically illiterate.  My understanding is that other people are working at the moment to try to bring that industry back.  I wish them well and I give them my full support.</p><p>  The agrifood sector is badly in need of more integrated development of supply chains in the meat and dairy sectors.  This can be done while maintaining the structure of the family farm and encouraging young farmers to take over from the previous generation and bring the necessary innovation, imagination, research and product development to grow the sector and increase the native consumption and export of Irish food.</p><p>  The value and potential value of agricultural exports is significant not only in economic terms, but also in the manner in which the quality and standard of Irish food turns a profit and publicises the country at its best, that is, as a green clean beautiful place producing green clean food.  While this is a healthy image to promote abroad, the reality for many of us living outside the big urban centres is that rural Ireland is in crisis.  I remain concerned about a lobby that is trying to promote genetically modified produce in the country.  This could be detrimental to the green imagery and food safety aspects of our products.</p><p>  Despite the Government's declared priorities to protect vulnerable sectors of society, support disadvantaged areas and protect what we hold dear about our rural way of life, it has allowed its austerity policies to create havoc.  The Minister of State knows well what I am about to say and the list I am about to recite on the record; I have done it time and again.  The tragedy is that the list is growing longer.  This Government and, to a far greater extent, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Green Party Government before it set about closing rural post offices.  This is a cruel blow to any community and anyone who lives in isolated areas of rural Ireland knows what I am talking about.  Anyone who knows anything about rural life in Irish towns and villages knows that the post office is a hub for the entire community.  From the way the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has been talking recently, it seems he believes that the Irish high street as we know it is a thing of the past.  We have seen the closure of post offices, Garda stations, small schools and hundreds of small businesses and creameries, all of which were at the heart of rural Ireland.  It is a sad sight to see the number of empty premises along main streets throughout the State.</p><p>  The Government is altogether mistaken if it believes that the people of rural Ireland are happy to become idle custodians of wind turbines and pylons in order that private companies can export energy to Britain and France.  The people who live in rural areas will not stand for it.  Those in the Government might think that they can postpone plans for turbines and pylons until after the local elections but they are mistaken if they believe that people will tolerate this intolerable situation.</p><p>  The Government's talk of so-called recovery does not cut it in parts of the country like the south and the west, where many areas cannot field a hurling or football team because the young lads are gone to look for work abroad.  Those of us who live in the south west, the west and perhaps other parts of the country in rural isolated areas know full well what I am talking about.  Some people might be benefiting from Government and EU policies but the vast majority in the south and west are not in that category.</p><p>  The negotiations during the past two years on the Common Agricultural Policy from 2015 to 2020 presented an opportunity to bring more equity to the programme but the Minister failed to deliver on those expectations.  In the recent past I have attended sizeable meetings along the western seaboard where people expressed growing dissatisfaction with the Government and EU policies and the direction being taken by some among the farm leadership.  The anger at some of these meetings which I attended was palpable.  Anything up to 600 people turned up at these meetings.  Furthermore, it is not only a case of one or two meetings; they are taking place across the western seaboard.</p><p>  One of the things which has angered people most is something the Government falsely claimed to prioritise.  I am referring to a lack of a scheme to replace the rural environment protection scheme 4 for 2014.  Are the Government and the Minister so far removed from reality that they believe it is acceptable to leave a large percentage of Irish farmers in disadvantaged areas with no payment for the entire year?  The reality is that people coming out of REPS 4 in January and February this year will have no payment until the new alternative payment kicks in in January next year.  I am referring to farmers in the more disadvantaged areas and the low-income farming sector, the farmers most in need.</p><p> The REPS payments were invaluable not only to the environment which they were designed to protect, but also to the more marginalised and weaker farmers in receipt of them.  While the farming community awaits a final decision regarding Pillar 2, it is of huge importance to have a scheme to replace REPS 4 that will not reduce farm incomes of that sector.</p><p> Another source of great anger in rural communities are the issues surrounding land eligibility.  I am calling for an amnesty for those in the lower bracket of farming affected by the Minister&rsquo;s demand for a clawback of payments since 2009.  Most people, including the Department, believed they were compliant.  A change in the methodology regarding a satellite caused the clawback demand.  The Minister should re-examine what are being called overclaims.  Manual inspections often reverse them and such inspections should be facilitated for those seeking them.  Those still outstanding after manual inspection, which we believe to be a small number, should be given an amnesty so that weaker sections of the farming community will not be penalised.  It is a way out of this situation which does not involve big money and will not penalise people who believed they were compliant, as did the Department.</p><p> Then we have the issue of retired farmers and the new CAP.  The retired farmers scheme was outstanding which, along with installation aid, allowed young farmers to start up while older farmers handed over to a new generation.  Both schemes encouraged young people into the sector but there are severe difficulties now for some people who leased their land entitlements and did not farm in 2013. </p><p> In common with many Deputies, I have received representations from some older farmers and some younger ones who, due to ill health, leased their land in 2013 - which is now the reference year - and now find themselves without a pension.  They will be forced to sell their entitlements and pay capital gains tax in some cases.  This was visited upon them without warning.  The Minister should re-examine this situation and come to the aid of those who unwittingly leased their lands in 2013 and find themselves in the current situation.  He has an opportunity to make things more equitable and fair, and in doing so will maintain a strong and vibrant rural economy.  I call on him to prioritise rural Ireland.  It is not just part of what we are, it is also what we are.  Rural Deputies, some of whom are present in the Chamber, will know full well what I am talking about.  Rural Ireland has taken a huge hit.</p><p> I have not yet touched on the fishing sector, some 85% of which has been decimated.  Boats have been tied up since the second week of December and have not gone to sea.  They may have been able to undertake fishing this week but they are self-employed and have no income.  They cannot get jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  They must go cap-in-hand to the community welfare officer if they can find him.  However, community welfare officers are being withdrawn from certain areas which makes it harder for people to obtain the necessary entitlements.  </p><p> The system needs to be examined.  Much of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about manufacturing or sexing up unemployment figures to look good is correct.  People coming off jobseeker's benefit are unable to get the jobseeker's allowance because they may have a capital investment, such as a small farm.  These people are supposed to be returning to work.  They have been working all along, while their income was substituted by jobseeker's benefit and the farm job before that.  That is 30,000 of the so-called 61,000 who are back to work this year.  If the Minister of State believes the figures, he is fooling himself.</p></speech>

These goals represent indicators of the commitments made by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to people with disabilities in their pre-election debates where disability was named as one of the key social justice issues to be pursued.</p><p>  The most important matter is the need to appoint a senior Minister with a dedicated responsibility for disability inclusion.  Disability should be afforded the same understanding, respect and urgency that has been accorded to children and young people who now have a specific Minister and Department.  The reform of public services is a prerequisite for delivering the national disability strategy.  However, there has been little evidence so far of public services working as an entity to support the inclusion of people with disabilities.  </p><p>  Disability is a societal issue that stretches across the life-cycle affecting people of all ages, and their families, both directly and indirectly.  The disabled are not a category that anyone else ever joins.  There have been huge challenges for the Government at this time in the context of five years of recession with funding being severely reduced, particularly for health services.  Increased demand and demographic pressures have had to be accommodated even with reduced funding.</p><p>  Voluntary disability organisations have come under huge pressure since the recession began, with ever increasing demands on their services.  Services that are so badly needed by people with disabilities should not be subject to further onslaught.  The balance of funding should be moved to health care services and preventive care services, as well as community-based services and supports provided by voluntary disability organisations.</p><p>  Limits should be placed on tendering and outsourcing services.  It is essential that any cost-cutting measures are disability proofed to ensure that they account for the extra cost of the disability concerned.  People with disabilities endure a double hit when cuts are made to specific disabilities as well as mainstream services.  It is vital for the Government to pursue the implementation of agreed measures, targets and timelines for disability.</p><p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities must be ratified urgently so that people with disabilities can fully enjoy their rights on an equal basis with all other citizens.  It is essential that the monitoring mechanism for the national disability strategy implementation plan operates effectively, given the short timeframe remaining for its implementation.  </p><p>  Key pieces of legislation that have been deferred should be prioritised for implementation, including the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004, and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004.  Irrespective of budgetary constraints, health service funding should be organised on a multi-annual basis to improve and facilitate proper planning.  Due respect and recognition for the community and voluntary sector is required from the Government, both for the disability-specific and generic community organisations engaged in the provision of public services. </p><p>  The disability community has a vital role in terms of its contribution to partnership, working across statutory, non-statutory and private sectors, as well as facilitating cross-departmental working.  The Government should address the impact of the reduction in staff numbers in public social services that are supporting people with disabilities to get access to basic mainstream services.  A consequence of this depletion in human resources is that the capacity does not exist to implement Government policy as outlined in policy documents such as<i></i>Future Health, and will therefore result in a severely damaged social and health infrastructure when austerity finally ends.</p><p>  The HSE disability consultative forum should be strengthened to become a forum for dialogue and partnership working between the statutory and non-statutory sectors.  A systematic approach to collecting data on service use and demand should be prioritised in the statutory and non-statutory health and social care sectors in support of service planning.  Improved data are also needed in related areas, including housing and transport.  Data need to be gathered on the current labour market position of people with disabilities and their needs in order to assess their distance from the labour market and what supports might be needed to address this.</p><p>  The quality of life for many people with disabilities has not been enhanced since the Government took office.  Their quality of life has been affected by the reduction of HSE funding which impacts on the income of, and services for, people with disabilities.  We have seen continuous cuts in HSE funding for disability services in the order of 1.8% in 2011, 3.7% in 2012 and 1.2% in 2013.  On an individual basis, organisations have sustained cuts in excess of these amounts from the health services.  </p><p>  Key supports that enable people to live in their communities have been targeted, curtailing people's options to live an ordinary life with independent choice and control.  Examples of these include cuts to the housing adaption grant of almost &euro;60 million between 2010 and 2013.  The respite care grant was cut by 19% in 2013, the fuel allowance scheme was cut by six weeks in 2012 and there were reductions to the household benefit package in 2013.  These cuts have come at a time of rising costs.</p><p> There is a considerable level of unmet need for services with 1,670 people in need of a personal assistant service in 2011 while 3,938 households with a person with a disability had unmet housing needs.  In addition, mainstream health-related cutbacks are damaging people's ability to achieve good health and well-being.  These include increased prescription charges which are five times greater than in 2012, the increase in the threshold of the drugs payment scheme and the rolling back of free GP care for people with certain illnesses who comprise a cohort with a heavy reliance on health services.  Other cutbacks are affecting people's ability to progress in the labour market, such as the reduction in funding for educational supports, including the 20% cut in funding in 2012 for access programmes for students with disabilities.</p><p> In summary, the cumulative effects of the rising cost of living, the reduced supports for community living, the reduced social welfare benefits and the new taxes and changes to the existing taxes have seen the erosion of the incomes of people with disabilities.  In such a scenario the Government cannot claim that the quality of life for people with disabilities has been enhanced during its term.</p><p> People with disabilities continue to be at risk of consistent poverty.  A recent survey on income and living conditions demonstrated that in 2011, people not at work due to illness or disability had a rate of consistent poverty of more than 11%, an increase of 2.3% since 2009.  Meanwhile, their average annual household disposable income was reduced from &euro;31,731 in 2009 to &euro;22,089 in 2011.  A recent ESRI study found that almost one in five people living in jobless households were adults with a disability.  The report also found that welfare payments were crucial in lifting jobless households above the poverty threshold but there has been no improvement in their living standards or level of financial stress over the period.</p><p> The cost of living for people with disabilities is not similar to those of people without disabilities.  It has been long recognised that people with disabilities and their families incur extra costs for food, heating, clothing and transport.  They also incur extra costs for health care, assistance, aids and devices.  It has been estimated that the long-term costs of disability can be approximately one third of an average weekly income.  For this reason their income is considerably reduced compared to non-disabled persons in receipt of jobseeker's payment.  Disability allowance remains a contingency payment on a par with jobseeker's allowance and paid at the same rate of &euro;188 a week.  If those on jobseeker's payments are expected to move back into the labour force, various activation programmes exist for that purpose.  Meanwhile, many people with disabilities are likely to continue to live on the lowest of income protection supports, often for their entire adult life.  In addition, people with disabilities are subject to the same mainstream cuts as others, for example, the targeting of the household benefits package in the 2013 and 2014 budgets.</p><p> The extra demands made on their income is a double hit, one for which they are not adequately compensated.  It is arguably the case that the secondary benefits on income disregards associated with disability payments, such as disability allowance, go some way towards offsetting the extra costs of disabilities but they do not form the kind of package needed to adequately ensure against the risk of poverty and social exclusion.  People with disabilities are one of those groups most likely to be living in a jobless household and to be at risk of consistent poverty.  They have extra costs related to their disability and for this reason their income is comparatively less compared to other groups in receipt of income supports.  They also experience the double hit when cuts are implemented in mainstream services as well as specific services.  I hope these matters will be addressed before the end of the term of office of this Government.</p></speech>

We need to be positive because there is a lot that is right with this country.  We need to build on what we have.  The Government came to power three years ago with a mandate to fix the country and its finances.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have stuck to their promise and we are on the road to recovery.  Many might disagree that this is the case but I do not think there is anyone in this House or in the country who has not been affected by the events of recent years.  Tough decisions have been made so that we never have to go through a similar crisis again.  I am proud to make that statement.  I acknowledge that more needs to be achieved.  Unfortunately, not everyone is feeling the change.  Unemployment is still too high, and youth unemployment in particular.  I refer to the changes in the social welfare system which will change young people's attitude to work.  In the previous system young people were handed money but they were not helped to find suitable work.  We need to move away from that mentality.  The introduction of the youth guarantee scheme will place an emphasis on those who have been caught in that cycle.  I am delighted that the issue of youth unemployment is a priority for the Government because it is also my priority.</p><p>  I was canvassing last night and I spoke to a woman on her doorstep.  She has worked all her life, as has her husband.  They have put both their children through college.  Her husband has cancer and one of her daughters cannot find work.  The woman feels she is caught in the middle.  She said that she is too rich to be poor and too poor to be rich.  We need to look at middle-income families because they are still feeling the burden more than others.  I welcome the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Taoiseach that if our finances continue to improve, it may be possible to reduce the tax burden on middle-income earners.  The self-employed have kept this country going and if things fall apart for them there should be a rainy-day pot available for them.  The Taoiseach referred to the issue of mortgage arrears which is being addressed.</p><p>  I have a strong interest in the proposed North-South interconnector and the proposed wind export project in north Meath.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, announced a review of the policy.  Many issues must be considered and we need a clear picture of future energy needs, such as competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability and the potential to support economic growth and job creation.  As a rural Deputy, I welcome the work of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and our MEP, Mairead McGuinness, in the agricultural sector.  We do not have enough young farmers and we may be a dying breed.  I discussed this issue at the Ard-Fheis.  </p><p>  It is important to get rid of the two-tier health system so that everyone can benefit from a universal health care system.  We must ensure that the costs are kept to a minimum and that the system will cater for every man, woman and child.  My focus is on young people and I know that education has always been a priority for the Government, regardless of the state of the finances.  Issues affecting young people include the abuse of alcohol and drugs and issues of sexuality and mental health.  The Government needs to have a joined-up policy for dealing with these issues for the sake of young people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200047#VV00100"><p>While recent signs of economic recovery are positive and welcome, they are not being felt in every home across the country.  Indeed, the impact of unemployment and debt means many families are still struggling.  In 2014, the Government will focus on growing the economy and creating jobs, with specific targets set out in the recent strategy for growth.  There are three high-level priorities for this year, namely, increasing support for the domestic economy, ensuring those most affected by the crisis are not left behind, and continuing political and public sector reforms to ensure the recovery is fair, inclusive and sustainable.</p><p>  The Government has set out specific measures to be progressed in 2014.  A new construction strategy will be launched to support jobs in that sector and plan effectively for our growing population.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is progressing 70 major school projects in 2014.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, are expanding the energy efficiency retrofit programme for social housing, which will involve 12,500 homes and some 1,000 constructions workers.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varakar, will publish a new tourism strategy shortly.  That strategy will build on the success of The Gathering and the measures already taken, such as the reduction in VAT on tourism services, which have helped to create more than 22,000 new jobs.</p><p>  We will get more people back to work in 2014 through effective training and supports and targeting disincentives to work.  We must ensure that those who lost their jobs and suffered most are not left behind in the recovery.  We have already succeeded in reducing unemployment below the European Union average of 12%, with the target being to get below 10% by 2016 and a return to full employment by 2020.  We must continue to grow the economy if it is to support new jobs.  We are targeting growth of at least 2% in 2014, 2.5% in 2015 and 3% in 2015.</p><p>  We will offer enhanced support and lending to small businesses and progress openness by enacting whistleblower and freedom of information legislation.  We are also engaged in a restructuring of local government services.  Whomever the people elect to local authorities in the forthcoming elections will have new powers to determine local charges.  We are also improving water infrastructure.  The provision of free GP care for children aged five and under is one of a range of health reforms under way.  In education, we are introducing a self-assessment system for schools and taking steps to make school admissions more transparent.</p><p>  While there is much remaining to be done, the Government has already made real progress.  We kept our promise not to increase income tax or cut basic social welfare rates.  Unemployment has fallen for 20 months in succession, to 12%, and 61,000 new jobs were created last year.  We successfully re-entered the bond markets last year, at historically low levels.  We have a new economic strategy to manage Ireland's economy to 2020.  The liquidation of the former Anglo Irish Bank has been successfully implemented.  The deal on the promissory notes will reduce Government borrowing by &euro;20 billion by 2020.  Of the 333 actions in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, 90% were delivered in full.  The revised plan for 2014 contains 285 actions to grow SMEs and start-ups.  Pathways to Work has helped to move 27,000 long-term unemployed people into work.</p><p>  The Haddington Road agreement will reduce the cost of the public service by a further &euro;1 billion and provide for an additional 15 million work hours across all sectors.  The new money-follows-the-patient system of funding in the health service is being implemented across 38 public hospitals, with payments made on the basis of the level of inpatient and day care activity.  New legislation commenced in June requires pharmacists to offer cheaper generic alternatives to branded drugs.</p><p>  Constitutional reform continued last year with two referenda and a body of work completed by the Constitutional Convention, which considered all eight issues presented to it, along with an additional two.  The latest D&aacute;il reforms mean we begin business in this House earlier each day and work longer to provide more time for legislative debate.  The Government will continue to drive forward policy reforms across all sectors to ensure better services in the future in areas such as local government, schools and health.</p></speech>

While all of us in this House deal with daily representations of a diverse and varied nature, I have no doubt that the one overriding priority for everybody is the creation of jobs.  Recent figure from the Central Statistics Office showing that 61,000 jobs were created in the past year are hugely encouraging.  We have moved from a situation three years ago where jobs were being lost at a rate of 1,600 per week to a position today where 1,200 jobs are being created every week.  This is significant and positive progress, and great credit is due to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, for his tremendous work on the Action Plan for Jobs, which is clearly bearing fruit.</p><p>  The objective now must be to build on this progress and reach the ambitious target the Taoiseach has set of reducing unemployment to below 10% by 2016.  To this end, there must be a particular focus on youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high at 25%, albeit reduced from a peak of 33%.  In this regard, I welcome the youth guarantee initiative.  The danger, however, is that young people may fall into the trap of long-term unemployment.  If a person leaves school and goes straight into claiming jobseeker's payment, having never entered the workforce, there is a danger that it becomes a normal way of life.  It is worrying to note that according to an OECD report last year, Ireland had the third highest share of 15 to 19 year olds who are neither in work nor in education or training, the so-called NEET cohort.</p><p>  We must bridge the gap from when young people leave education until they find a job.  This requires the introduction of a greatly enhanced apprenticeship scheme.  Looking to the German model, there are more than 340 recognised occupations for apprenticeship purposes across a broad range of areas, from accounting to plumbing.  In Ireland, by contrast, we have only a tiny fraction of that number of apprenticeship places available, the majority of them based solely in the area of construction.  I met recently with representatives of a graphic design company which is on the cusp of a major expansion.  However, management simply cannot find employees with the necessary skills set.  While there are plenty of college graduates available for work, they do not have the on-the-job experience that is required.  There is a gap between the university degree and the world of work.  As the company representatives I spoke to explained, if they were to take on a graduate, they are required to pay full wages even though that person, through no fault of his or her own, will not have the full set of skills to do the job.  He or she could, as a result, make mistakes that would cost the company money.</p><p>  This situation is not the fault of graduates.  The problem is that they lack hands-on experience and there is no system in place to ensure they get it.  In Germany, on the other hand, it is usually not possible to secure a job unless one has served an apprenticeship with an employer.  Apprentices receive a training allowance from their employer of approximately &euro;650 per month and once they successfully complete their apprenticeship, they are often taken on permanently.  From the employer's perspective, this makes it much easier to take a person on to gain that invaluable hands-on experience.  In addition, it fosters a strong work ethic from an early age.  By going to work, the trainees feel valued and know they are making a contribution to society.  It is important to bear in mind that there are young people who do not want to or are unable to go on to further education.  When they leave school, there is a danger they will enter a cycle of claiming social welfare which can be difficult to escape.  Under a strong apprenticeship system, local employers would liaise with schools to identify early school leavers and those who will not progress to third level, and provide them with opportunities, through an apprenticeship programme, that will help to prevent their becoming unemployed.</p><p>  I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on her efforts under the Pathways to Work strategy.  The introduction of schemes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and the Momentum programme are having an impact.  I recall the serious demand for the WebActivate programme that was launched in Monaghan last year.  I have had feedback from several young people regarding the excellence of that particular scheme.  Nevertheless, we must give serious consideration to the issue of apprenticeships.  It is an issue I would like to see progressed in the year ahead as part of the youth guarantee scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200047#VV00300"><p>Three years ago last Sunday, I entered this House for the first time as a newly elected Deputy and part of a new Government.  We had a huge job of work in front of us, with the country in economic ruin.  Three years on, we have made progress on many of the key areas we targeted.  Last year, 61,000 new jobs were created.</p><p>The unemployment rate has fallen from a high of 15.1% and is now under the EU average of 12%.  We have made a clean exit from the bailout.  Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have been formally closed.  The promissory note deal has been restructured.  The budget deficit is continuing to fall.  We have a leaner banking system as a result of the establishment of the pillar banks.  The Haddington Road agreement was developed as a follow-up to the Croke Park agreement.  The biggest difficulty with the Croke Park agreement was that it took a one-size-fits-all approach.  Everyone from the highest-paid civil servant to the lowest-paid civil servant was treated the same.  The Haddington Road agreement broke that inequity.  We now have a fairer system in which those who have more contribute more.</p><p> We stuck to our commitment not to increase income tax or cut basic social welfare rates.  This was easier said than done, but it has been of great importance for our overall recovery.  While the economy dominated the agenda and the public consciousness, we made huge strides socially by addressing issues that had been swept under the carpet for too long.  I refer to the Magdalen laundries issue, for example.  We established the first ever Government Ministry for children and brought forward the children's rights referendum.  We passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, thereby meeting head-on an important and sensitive social issue that previous Governments had ignored for too long</p><p> Fine Gael had a five-point plan at the last general election.  That plan is working.  The medium-term economic strategy that was published recently continues the Government's plan, as set out in the programme for Government.  The essence of this plan involves creating more jobs and ensuring the economy grows in support of employment.  An economy is driven by those who work and pay taxes.  That burden has fallen on too few shoulders because unemployment levels have been so high.  Getting more people back to work allows us to reduce the burden on those who contribute.  Two Government strategies - the Action Plan for Jobs, which was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Pathways to Work scheme, which was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Burton - are working in tandem to address the need for State services to better adapt to a changing jobs environment and focus on where opportunities will be found in the future.</p><p> There are massive opportunities for continued growth in the home-grown agrifood and tourism sectors, which will thrive and create jobs if the Government continues to support and develop them.  There has been really positive growth in the tourism sector since we took office three years ago.  Initiatives like the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector and The Gathering have given it some momentum.  I do not doubt that many jobs have been created and - just as important - saved as a result.  The available numbers for 2013 indicate that international visits have increased by 7%, with domestic holiday trips also on the increase.  This is having a direct impact on job creation.  The number of people employed in the tourism sector has increased by 12% in the last year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that an additional 8,000 jobs could be created in the tourism sector in the year ahead.  It is important to note that many of these jobs will be located in areas where there is very little other economic activity.  The Government's decision to prioritise tourism is paying dividends.  I am happy that supporting tourism will continue to be one of our priorities in 2014.</p><p> The agrifood sector is another domestic industry that has huge potential for growth.  According to the findings of a Bord Bia food industry survey from December 2013, small Irish food businesses are optimistic about their growth prospects.  Some 67% of those surveyed said they expect their businesses to grow in 2014.  Almost half of them claimed to have increased their turnover in 2013.  The value of Irish food and drink exports approached &euro;10 billion for the first time in 2013.  This represents an increase of 9% on the previous year and 40% in the last four years.  Revenues in this area are almost &euro;3 billion higher than they were in the past.</p><p> In the area of energy, there has been a significant focus on electricity pylons and proposed wind farms for the domestic and export markets.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, that an expert group will be established to examine undergrounding options as part of the Grid Link and Grid25 projects.  There is a need for a full review of our overall energy policy, as outlined in a Government White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, in 2007.  A great deal has changed in this country since 2007.  Following the recent publication of the European Commission's targets for 2030, this is an opportune time for us to undertake a complete review of our overall energy policy.  Given that the newly formed expert group is to examine the potential for undergrounding 400 kV lines like Grid Link, a wider national debate on the forms of renewables we should be pursuing is needed.  We should consider whether we are too focussed on wind energy.  Perhaps we should place a greater emphasis on wave or solar energy.  A debate on these matters is needed in this country.  I look forward to the Government leading such a debate in the not too distant future.</p><p> I will conclude by referring to my local priorities in south Kildare for the year ahead.  I am fighting for the construction of the southern distributor ring road that the people of Athy have been seeking for 40 years.  This route is long overdue and badly needed in the interests of the economic development of the town.  Business supports are needed in areas like Newbridge where unemployment remains stubbornly high.  While progress has been made there, more needs to be done.  I will continue to fight for the re-establishment of the sugar industry, which we should never have lost.  I welcome the new recruitment drive for the Defence Forces.  This is obviously of great importance for my constituency, given that the Defence Forces are based in the Curragh.  The Government is keeping to its important commitment to retain a minimum personnel figure of 9,500.  I welcome the progress that has been made to date.  I accept that this is just a starting point.  I am optimistic about the future.  I look forward to seeing our economy grow.  The problems faced by this nation are being met head-on by this reforming Government.</p></speech>

That certainly applies to the programme for Government.  The creation of a programme for Government is a complex task.  If a Government includes a substantial number of commitments and objectives in its plans, it will be accused of being too ambitious, overly confident and unrealistic.  If a Government does not include a substantial number of commitments and objectives in its plans, it will be accused of lacking imagination and creativity.</p><p>  It is important to record how desperate this country's circumstances were when we came into office.  As a result of the lethal combination of economic mismanagement and a dire external climate, Ireland had relinquished its economic sovereignty and accepted a financial bailout.  The economy collapsed quickly, resulting in soaring unemployment, failing businesses, dwindling financial resources and an increasing gap between income and expenditure.  Not surprisingly, there was a feeling of hopelessness and fear.  Negativity was all too pervasive.  Three years later, there is a new sense of hope and optimism in this country on foot of the positive results we are seeing in areas like employment and economic growth.  It should never be forgotten that our economic recovery has resulted from the hard work, determination and perseverance of the Irish people.</p><p>  Is ceart &oacute; am go ham go bhfuil seans againn sa D&aacute;il breathn&uacute; siar ar sc&eacute;al an Rialtais.  Is taifead maith &eacute;.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig an Rialtas isteach tr&iacute; bliana &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; an troika in&aacute;r measc.  Anois, tar &eacute;is obair an Rialtais agus iarrachta&iacute; mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann, t&aacute; siad imithe.  Is sc&eacute;al maith &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuilimid ar an mb&oacute;thar ceart &oacute; thaobh eacnama&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re.</p><p>  A great deal of progress has been made across a significant number of areas covered in the programme for Government, the full title of which refers to national recovery.  On the economic front, a policy of careful and sustainable building and recasting of the economy has yielded many results.  We have regained our economic sovereignty.  Ireland is the first country to have successfully exited an economic assistance programme, following the worst recession for 80 years.  We have re-entered the bond markets at historically low levels.  We have liquidated the former Anglo Irish Bank.  Following the renegotiation of the promissory notes, the amount to be repaid has been halved, in effect.</p><p>  The unemployment rate in the west was a staggering 17% three years ago, but it has fallen to 11.9% today.  This huge improvement is verified by the increased participation rate in the labour market.  This shows that the improvement cannot simply be attributed to emigration.  Having said that, there is much more to be done.  We cannot be complacent.  We certainly need to ensure this growth continues.  Some 61,000 new jobs have been created in the past 12 months.  Ireland now has the fastest growing employment rate in the EU and the OECD.  The number of people on the live register has fallen for the last 20 consecutive months.  These undeniable facts irritate those who were hoping against hope that our country would fail.</p><p>  T&aacute; sc&eacute;al maith ann freisin &oacute; thaobh poist agus d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; an r&aacute;ta d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta tite &oacute; 15.2% go dt&iacute; 11.9%.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an r&aacute;ta nua f&oacute;s r&oacute;-ard, t&aacute; feabhas m&oacute;r tagtha sa t&iacute;r seo i dtaobh na d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go bhfuil an r&aacute;ta d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta tite mar gheall ar imirce.  T&aacute; daoine &oacute;ga ag imeacht thar lear, ach t&aacute; cuid acu ag teacht ar ais freisin.  T&aacute; na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; a bhaineann le l&iacute;on na ndaoine sa t&iacute;r seo at&aacute; ag obair n&iacute;os fearr &oacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil siad ag ard&uacute;.</p><p>  This welcome growth in employment can be attributed to a number of factors, not least the relentless focus by all areas of Government and the State on job creation.  I consider the Action Plan for Jobs to have been revolutionary in its ethos.  By bringing together all the stakeholders in a process characterised by comprehensive consultation, the Action Plan for Jobs has succinctly set out the measures and acts that are needed to foster the best possible environment for job creation.  The most important aspect of the plan is its clear identification of the Department, agency or organisation that is responsible for achieving each stated objective.  All stakeholders are clear on the aims and objectives for which they are responsible.  Everyone is focused on the overarching aim of creating jobs.  The results of this can only be positive.  The undeniable truth is that the Action Plan for Jobs is working.  The figures and statistics demonstrate this.  We need to continue that focus and intensify our efforts.</p><p>  While there have been positives in many areas, there have also been frustrating delays.  The introduction of free primary health care for all citizens is an honourable objective which would be of great benefit.  While I welcome the introduction of free GP care for all children under the age of five, I am disappointed that the objective of introducing free GP care for citizens on the long-term illness scheme has been delayed.  I think those with existing health conditions and chronic illnesses would benefit more from being able to access primary care free of charge.  I am also concerned about the apparent impasse between the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents general practitioners, and the HSE.</p><p>It is vital to negotiate a new agreement that is reasonable and is done in a respectful manner.  We must never lose sight of the fact that all sides have the same objective, which is to meet the people's health care needs.</p><p> The introduction of high-speed broadband outside our cities and large towns has also been frustratingly slow.  High-speed broadband has made geographic location less relevant for many businesses and enables businesses in places such as Connemara to compete on a level playing field with those in central Dublin.  Some 15 years after the shambles that was the privatisation of Eircom we are still experiencing the effects of selling off the entire network as well as the commercial entity.  Due to this shortsighted and misguided step, the country is still playing catch-up in broadband provision.</p><p> The national broadband scheme in the middle of the last decade, while welcome, proved to be inadequate in many areas by inexplicably omitting areas that should have been included.  We now have the national broadband plan which should bring speeds of at least 30 Mbps to all areas by 2016.  The mapping project to identify the areas most in need is nearing completion and the negotiations within the European Commission on the state aid that will be required have commenced.  However, the progress is frustratingly slow and it is all the more worrying given its importance for business.  Broadband is as vital as electricity and water can be in that context.</p><p> However, I welcome the recent ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill, which takes an innovative approach in changing ESB's remit to allow it to be engaged in broadband provision and to allow a suitable partner company to piggyback on the ESB infrastructure in order to provide high-speed broadband directly into people's homes.  I hope that can be progressed by the ESB as soon as practicable.  I look forward to the renewed emphasis on this area in the jobs action plan.</p><p> There has been scant progress on the micro-generation of electricity by homes, farms, schools and small local businesses.  Outside urban settings it is possible for homes, schools and businesses to reduce their energy bills and to play their part in reducing the effects of climate change by installing domestic-sized wind turbines.  However, apart from one electricity provider, providing a single scheme for householders only, there is no mechanism to reduce energy bills in a way that reflects the unused electricity generated by the turbines being fed back into the national grid.  I have raised this with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and with representatives of the electricity network, the energy regulator and energy companies, but nobody seems interested in tackling the issue.</p><p> Almost all can appreciate the precariousness of energy supply, feel the effects of energy costs and see the need to adopt more renewable sources of energy.  Our legislation and our regulatory framework must keep pace and I urge the Minister, the Department and the relevant organisations and agencies to work together in a practical way to reward those who take initiatives and switch to renewable energy sources.</p><p> I acknowledge that the agriculture sector has experienced very positive growth in recent years.  We have seen sustainable jobs created in companies such as Glanbia and Kerry Group, where 900 jobs have been created.  Work on the provision of facilities for such companies is very welcome.  I commend the Minister on his negotiations on the CAP, resulting in a strong Pillar 1 to ensure we maintain farmers who are producing food to benefit the food-processing factories, providing real jobs and boosting exports, and a strong Pillar 2, providing for the disadvantaged area scheme, the new GLAS, and the suckler cow scheme.  They benefit all areas and predominantly the most marginal land in the west.  There are challenges, including the collapse of beef prices this year and the near monopoly in the factory-processing sector.  There are also challenges regarding ongoing penalties for land declaration, which is causing considerable concern in the west.</p><p> In the area of transport and tourism, I commend the signing this year of the first public-private partnership for a new road project at Newlands Cross.  This is a further sign of the economic advancement of the country and shows that external investors are willing to invest in this country and no longer regard it as the risky investment it once was.  Progress can now be made on the Gort to Tuam road in my county where land has been purchased over a number of years.</p><p> I would also like to see continued progress on the Galway city outer bypass, which I have raised here on numerous occasions.  It has now gone back to the initial planning stages.  It has been long delayed because of appeals by certain organisations locally.  Local people have the right to object, but there have been many objections from others.  I acknowledge the firm support of the Government and of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in particular for this vital project, which has been deemed number one in the country on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

While I believe the Government has wrongly allowed itself to increasingly be seen as more of a bystander than an active participant on issues concerning Northern Ireland, the Government is not to blame for the recent problems.  Leaving the peace process in the hands of two parties focused on partisan interests is not a policy to bring much needed benefits to the people of the entire island.  Levels of trust are falling and, worst of all, opportunities for growth and reconciliation are being missed.  It is these opportunities I wish to focus on in my contribution today.</p><p>  The Government needs to seriously refocus its priorities now and make it a priority to re-engage on all issues relating Northern Ireland, the North-South bodies and the all-island dimension.  Last December, we had the opportunity to hear the former British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, outline how he and Mr. Albert Reynolds worked closely in partnership to achieve the Downing Street Declaration.  That work was carried out during a very difficult period in the history of both islands and it was the tenacity, commitment, leadership and courage of both political leaders that achieved that very important declaration.</p><p>  Similarly, the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement were victories for constitutional republicanism.  That commitment and that leadership were shown, and this is what is needed at present to deal with the important issues confronting the people in the Six Counties, which are of critical importance to the entire island.</p><p>  The Government, and the T&aacute;naiste in particular, needs to abandon the box-ticking exercise it is currently engaged in, namely, focusing on holding formal meetings, and it needs to start to develop concrete proposals for new North-South activity.  The development of all-Ireland frameworks should be a core priority not just for the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and their Departments, but for all Departments and all State and statutory agencies.  The cross-Border bodies that were established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 have been successful.  I believe their potential has not yet been maximised.</p><p>  Of course there are other areas where we should be developing a framework for new all-Ireland bodies.  We need to be fairly vigorous in that respect.  In developing an all-Ireland framework, we need to be very conscious of the importance of the message sent out to communities, North and South, where there are major infrastructural projects.</p><p>  In the area of all-Ireland bodies, it is surely time for us to develop the further and higher education sectors on an all-Ireland basis.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is with us this evening.  In the area of health, there is potential to maximise opportunities and deal with issues right across the board in an all-Ireland context.  That area needs to be given momentum and priority.  I represent two of the Ulster counties and we need cross-Border development to maximise the facilities and services north of the Border and also to provide services south of the Border, where applicable, to people from the Six Counties.</p><p>There is potential to work together and develop centres of excellence in whichever jurisdiction once all the people have access should the need arise.</p><p> With regard to infrastructure projects, it is very regrettable that the Narrow Water Bridge project has not progressed.  Substantial funding was committed by the European Union but there was a shortfall of a few million euro, which should have been made up by the Northern Ireland Executive and by our Government because it is a project that would be very beneficial for the east coast counties of Louth and Down and stretching to the broader region, where more visitors are needed.  In the overall context of public funding, it is a relatively small amount, and it would be a shame if that project were lost.  A substantial part of the funding was provided by the European Union.  Some funding had to be made up by both the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government here but a relatively small amount of funding could have got that project to construction stage.</p><p> In 1989, in much more difficult economic and political circumstances, the Government was able to progress the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which is now the Shannon-Erne Waterway.  It involved an investment of &pound;30 million.  In 1989 and 1990, the relationships between North and South and between east and west were far removed from what they are today.  The Government at the time was determined to bring that project to fruition, and it succeeded.  It has been a major catalyst for tourism development in Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim, and further afield in the South.  </p><p> It would send out a strong message to communities on both sides of the Border if the Narrow Water Bridge project was to be advanced, and it would cost a relatively small amount of money.  My colleague, Deputy Seamus Kirk, has continually highlighted the potential of this project and the need to advance it when we have favourable political circumstances, despite the economic challenges.  I know there are competing demands for public expenditure.  However, it is a project where the European funding is substantial and should not be lost.  Likewise, we need to progress the proposal to restore the Ulster Canal, which runs through my constituency and a number of counties north of the Border.</p><p> The same is true of the A5 road.  Representatives from the northern side of the Border and County Donegal are as anxious as my colleagues here that the project is advanced.  On a recent visit by the Good Friday committee of the Oireachtas to County Derry and Letterkenny, County Donegal, numerous public representatives and interest groups highlighted to us the need to ensure that the necessary investment goes into the A5 and that there is an adequate road network between County Donegal and the capital of this country, which does not exist currently.</p><p> There are a number of outstanding commitments under the Good Friday Agreement.  We have mentioned these in the House on many occasions but I refer again to the need to re-establishment the civic forum, which is provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  We need Acht na Gaeilge to be introduced without further undue delay.  A bill of rights needs to be established for the North of Ireland and an all-island charter of rights needs to be developed as well.  There is a need to establish the North-South consultative forum.  When one considers that well in excess of 300 submissions were made to the Hass talks by civil society, it shows that civic society wants to buy into the political process and have the relevant fora in which to make their contribution.</p><p> Both Governments have also failed to address the need for a victim-centred truth and reconciliation process.  The British Government has also failed to act on its Weston Park commitment to hold an independent inquiry into the killing of the human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane.  That was an international agreement, and the British are not honouring their side of that agreement.  Mr. Finucane's sons have continued his work in his name and the memory of all those who were brutally murdered.  They make the simple point: how can we deal with the past if there is no process of examining it?</p><p> In her excellent book, <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>, Anne Cadwallader of the Pat Finucane Centre has catalogued some of the tragic and distressing stories of the victims of collusion by state forces.  While reading about their stories is difficult enough, hearing them told to one in person brings home the deep pain and hurt felt by the surviving families.  It is very clear to all of us that those issues need to be addressed.</p><p> Late last year, I was in Armagh and heard the story of the killing of Dinny Mullen from his daughter Denise.  I listened to Seamus Mallon outline the terror inflicted on so many people in counties Armagh and Tyrone due to collusion from so-called state forces including the British Army, the UDR and the police in the North, which resulted in very many innocent deaths.  The people who suffered so much must have justice.  I am realistic enough to know that in many instances it will be very difficult to bring some of the inquiries to a conclusion.  The past on this island is touched with sadness and tragedy.  It represents a grave challenge to all of us who are working towards building a future free from the sectarian passions and violence that tainted the lives of previous generations.  However, that does not mean we should run away from difficult questions.  It does not mean that all victims were the same and that all who lived through those decades share the blame.  In reality there were those who took up the gun and resorted to ruthless violence for their own ends, while the vast majority sought peaceful means to achieve legitimate aims.</p><p> It is very clear to all of us that dealing with the past must be victim-centred.  Abandoning justice for victims would be an abdication of our moral and civic responsibility to those who endured during those grim days.  That would be a betrayal of our duty to the men and women who were always committed to peaceful means.  The history of the Troubles cannot be left to those who bloodied their hands on either side of the conflict, be they perpetrators of state violence or paramilitaries on either side.</p><p> We are approaching the 40th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974, which resulted in the deaths of 33 civilians and the wounding of almost 300 people, the highest number of casualties in any one day during the conflict we refer to as the Troubles.  The loyalist paramilitary group, the UVF, claimed responsibility for the bombings.  There are various credible allegations that elements of British security forces colluded with the UVF in those bombings.  The Joint Committee on Justice called the attacks an act of international terrorism.  In July 2008, the then Government Chief Whip, Pat Carey, moved a motion on this matter that had the unanimous support of all parties and Members of this House, and a similar motion was also passed in 2011.  We are still awaiting a British response to those motions.</p><p> As we are approaching the 40th anniversary I had the opportunity recently to meet with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the British Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland, Ivan Lewis.  I impressed on both men as strongly as I could that the British Government must be forthcoming and respond to the request of a sovereign Parliament which has asked that the necessary inquiries be progressed, and that access by an independent international judicial figure be allowed to all original documentation held by the British Government relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction.  That was the recommendation of Mr. Justice Barron when he produced his report, into which so much work went subsequently by the justice committee of this House.</p><p> We know that substantial progress has been made in the area of policing since the Good Friday Agreement.  There was progress up to the past 13 or 14 months with regard to parades.  According to a recent report in the <i>Irish News</i>, and from recollection, I believe it referred to almost 200 sensitive parades that were permitted last year despite failure by the organisers to complete forms correctly.</p><p>It is not acceptable that the Parades Commission would allow incomplete applications to be processed, finalised and approved.  There are clear guidelines for the Parades Commission to ensure that parades are properly notified.  To my recollection, only two parades in 2012 were not properly notified to the authorities, so the massive increase in non-notified parades has to be a cause of concern and emphasises again the need for the Haass talks to be progressed.</p><p> The parades issue did significant damage to the economy of Belfast and beyond, particularly around Christmas 2012 and into the early part of 2013.  We do not want parades to cause the issues they have consistently caused for small communities where there is thuggery and intimidation through the misbehaviour of a number of people taking part in those parades, which are not properly organised and where the organisers take no responsibility for organising them properly.</p><p> More than 3,600 people died in the troubled era that scarred this island for more than three decades.  The wave of violence that consumed so many lives in the North has left a dark legacy for an entire generation.  Out of that bleak period, the Good Friday Agreement emerges as a shining light.  For the first time since 1918 the entire island voted as one, and voted overwhelmingly in favour of moving beyond the bloody battles of the past towards a shared future.  That Agreement was not a free pass to the individuals who chose the route of violence that terrorised the North over 30 years, nor was it-----</p></speech>

I commend the Alliance Party, the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in on the huge effort they put in to try to reach an agreement when Dr. Haass was here chairing and leading those talks.</p><p>  I said months ago and it is still my opinion that the two Governments should have been more active participants in those talks.  When we look back on the recent history of our country, and in particular go back to the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993, the two sovereign Governments, under the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach of the time, Albert Reynolds, drove that process.  Similarly, with the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement, it was the two sovereign Governments driving the process that brought it to a successful conclusion.</p><p>  There is great potential in the Haass talks to deal with those particular issues that continue in many respects to scar individuals and communities throughout the North of Ireland and that have a downside for all of this island.  After St. Patrick's week, we go in again to an electoral process North of the Border, with European and local elections, and then we are into the marching season.  There is an urgent need to bring to a successful conclusion the Haass talks that offer so much potential for all of this island.</p></speech>

We have different players.  We have a different Taoiseach, and he is far more sober than the last one.  He does not need as many lozenges when he addresses &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; in the morning, but still the policies remain the same.  The same austerity is crippling the Irish people.</p><p>  Much space is given to banking in the programme for Government.  When this Government entered power, the banks were broken and they still are.  They are still not playing their role in building a proper recovery and this Government is letting them away with it.  The top bankers cannot believe their luck.  After Fianna F&aacute;il, they have equally been given a weak Government that is afraid to stand up to them.  We saw in the first weeks of this Government that Ministers were talking tough, talking brave, talking the talk, walking the walk, demanding that bankers come to Government Buildings to be given a dressing down for not passing on interest rate reductions.  That soon faded away.  No more talk of interest rate reductions when the ECB, time after time, cuts its rate.  No more talk about pay cuts for senior executives in Bank of Ireland, and yesterday we had the announcement that Richie Boucher did not take one cent of a reduction in 2013.</p><p>  The Government brings in a bank levy, the banks pass on the levy, the people pay and the Government says nothing.  The Government looks for a pay cut from top bankers, the banks cut the pay of ordinary workers and sack them, the people pay and the Government does nothing.  That is the Government's policy - do nothing.  It is failing.  Bank after bank is announcing cuts and redundancies.  Some have disappeared from the State altogether, some are selling off their mortgages to unregulated companies and, again, the Government does nothing.</p><p>  Where is the strategic investment bank promised by the Labour Party?  Three years later, are we supposed to believe that a vague arrangement with a German bank is the same thing?  Who is kidding whom?  The number in mortgage arrears is still very high, and the banks are being left to deal with it in their own way and in their own time.  The number in mortgage arrears has doubled in the first two years of this Government.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said he told the banks that letters threatening legal action do not constitute offers under the mortgage arrears resolution targets, but ask the Minister how he has told them, and we find that he was met with a deafening silence.</p><p>  Meanwhile, a long time ago - or at least it seems a long time ago for many - the Government promised and committed to introducing a two-year moratorium on repossessions of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay their mortgage.  I and thousands of families across the State must have missed the Government's small print where it stated, &quot;...and then we will legislate so that the family home can be repossessed as a first resort&quot;, because that is what this Government has done in the removal of the protection of the family home without any sort of replacement.  It was a brutal and cold decision that it took at the behest of the banks, and it was shameful.</p><p>  Personal debt, especially mortgage debt, is something the Government is unable to tackle or is incapable of tackling.  It has flapped around and made a lot of this, but it has achieved nothing of note.  Personal debt remains a huge problem.  Those who work with people in debt will say that the Personal Insolvency Act has been a damp squib at best for the many thousands of people for whom the Government thought it would be a saviour.  For those who have benefited from it, however, it has been a huge relief.</p><p>  Likewise, banking debt remains a crippling noose around our necks and makes economic growth difficult.  There is no doubt that Fianna F&aacute;il made a mess of it by taking on private banking debt as public debt, but this Government has failed to remove it.</p></speech>

These are facts that are on the record.  The Minister of State will have time to defend using the public's money in this way and the fact the Government has turned the toxic Anglo Irish Bank debt into a formalised sovereign debt.  The more we learn about what happened at the bank and at Irish Nationwide Building Society, the more disgusted the public becomes at the notion of paying off their debts.  Yet this Government has committed to paying every last cent of that debt.  Despite the number of times I have asked about unguaranteed and unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank who had nothing to do with the vote on the night of the guarantee because they were unguaranteed, this Government has continued to allow that State bank to pay off unguaranteed bondholders.  Whether it is &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;800 million, it does not matter to the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  It does not matter to the Government.  The people will pay.  The Government will introduce property taxes and water taxes, cut child benefit, reduce the amount of home help hours, take services out of hospitals and increase fees for students.  They will pay for the unguaranteed and unsecured bondholders.  The Government will ensure these big hedge funds, the people who bought these bonds at 60 cent in the euro, get paid every single last cent and get their bonus on top of it.</p><p>  Let us not talk about bonuses because the Government is good at those as well.  We have pay caps for those on disability payments, those who rely on pensions, the under-25s who are out of work and those who go on to schemes such as JobBridge and the Government's new concocted scheme.  However, when it comes to the Government's special advisers and party hacks, it does not worry about the pay caps.  Its attitude is: &quot;Sure they are one of us.  They are the old boys network.&quot;  It does not worry about the pay caps because one Minister will write to another and tell him or her that he is one of our boys and not to worry about the pay caps because they are for the other people, the lesser beings.  The golden circles may have been smashed in 2008 but they have reformed with the support of this Government.  There are circles and little fiefdoms in Cabinet that the Government continues to protect them.</p><p>  In respect of the money pumped into our pillar banks, very little progress has been made.  With every passing day, the prospect of the European Stability Mechanism being used to recapitalise our pillar banks retrospectively fades.  I hope it will happen but it seems it is important to listen to the president of the Eurogroup, the German Finance Minister or the ESM chief and, sadly, they do not think it will happen.  Given the rules this Government signed up to on how the ESM can be used, it is difficult to imagine a large part of that debt ever being eligible for recapitalisation.  That is the terrible failure of this Government.  Since 2008, approximately &euro;30 billion has been cut from public services and salaries or levied through tax.  That is equivalent to the amount that could be recouped if this Government had a plan and the determination and commitment to stand up for the retrospective recapitalisation of our banks, but it has failed even to ask for it.  On banking debt, like personal debt, this Government has flapped about and achieved very little.</p><p>  When it comes to laying out fiscal policy, the most startling aspect of the programme for Government is what it does not say.  There is no strategy or vision other than a commitment to reduce the deficit to 3%.  The lack of detail of how the Government plans to get there is stark.  There are a few bullet points on what it was not going to do so there are no changes to corporation tax or income tax bands.  There are a few vague bullet points about making tax exiles contribute more and cutting loopholes.  There are points that represent downright spin.  Examples include the increase in VAT being referred to as limiting VAT at 23% and the exploring of a site value tax with the IMF which was transformed into a property tax.  Given that both parties made the reduction of the deficit to 3% practically their sole goal in office, the programme for Government's fiscal policy reads like a mere footnote compared with other sections in the programme.  It is barely one tenth of the many pages that are set out on job creation and we know the Government's goal on that is an unemployment rate of 10.4% after four glorious years in office.</p><p>  Considering how much work would be required to get the deficit to 3%, it is astonishing how little of it was included in the document.  We all know why it did not include the detail because telling people that over the course of its tenure, they could expect billions upon billions of euro in tax increases and public service cuts in each budget was hardly desirable.  If the Government had told people at the start what it was planning with the property tax, that might have raised alarm bells.  There is no site value tax.  Instead, the Government introduced a highly regressive tax on family homes that took no account of ability to pay, mortgages or stamp duty paid.  The Government presented to families the length and breadth of this State a tax on the value of the roof over their heads.  If those families have parents who have lost jobs, who are in mortgage distress, who bought during the boom, who paid &euro;30,000 in stamp duty and who now live in houses worth a quarter of what they owe to the banks, none of that matters to the Government one damn bit.  The Government has told them they must stump up and pay the property tax.  What is worse is that it has tried to claim that it is somehow fair.  If it is fair, why did both parties campaign during the election on the basis that they would not introduce such an unfair tax?  The Government has said the property tax will go into providing local services but we all know that not one cent of the money raised last year went to any local authority.</p><p>  In its programme for Government, the Government committed to maintain tax rates, bands and credits.  Clearly, it did not keep its promise on tax credits.  Last year, it made changes that meant that separated fathers lost &euro;2,490 in tax credits every year, so the Government cannot for one moment say it has kept its promise after asking separated fathers to stump up another &euro;2,500 per year in tax, but then nothing about the Labour Party and Fine Gael and their brass neck surprises me these days.  </p><p>  The Government has engaged in a lobby-led discussion about tax cuts in the coming budget which would mean changes to existing tax bands, but only at the marginal level.  Sinn F&eacute;in firmly believes there should be tax cuts in the next budget.  We want to see the property tax abolished saving 1.8 million households an average of &euro;278 per year.  We want the Government to commit investment money to fix leaking water infrastructure and not introduce water charges for families next year.  We would very much like the Government to revisit the programme for Government commitment to review the universal social charge, USC.  It tinkered with it when it came into office and raised the entry point of the USC to just over &euro;10,000.  It was welcome but if the Government really wants to address tax being a disincentive to work, this is the tax it needs to look at.  We have argued that the USC entry point should be raised to &euro;17,542 per annum.  As it stands, this Government expects people earning between as little as &euro;193 and &euro;337 per week to pay USC on their entire wage.  Families need tax cuts via the abolition of property tax and water charges.  Low earners need tax cuts in the form of the USC entry point being increased.  These are the areas the Government should be discussing.</p><p>  The Government's fiscal policy has been a disaster for Irish families, jobs and the economy.  It has lengthened and deepened the recession.  Now the Government is approaching its blinkered goal of 3% debt to GDP ratio, it is actively considering adapting its fiscal policy to ensure that in a future recovery, people who are better off to begin with benefit most.  This is a fiscal policy stance that deepens inequality and does not adequately provide for a future economy that is stable and can fund the public services people desire and depend upon.</p></speech>

I listened to Deputy Smith's comments on the awful time that was the late 1980s.  This country has never found itself in a greater financial crisis than it does now.  On the night when Labour begged Sinn F&eacute;in not to vote for the bank guarantee, it pooh-poohed us and still voted for it.  Now its members have the brass neck to tell us that we should not be doing what we are doing to get the people of this country off the hook for the bank guarantee and what they would have done differently.  That type of revisionism is breathtaking, to say the least.  They voted for it even though we begged them not to and we are paying the price now.  The country is only beginning to recover because of the hard work and dedication of our Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in cannot disassociate itself from that night, nor should it try.  I have never heard the likes in my life.  Then again, Sinn F&eacute;in is good at revisionism.</p><p> As I only have a little time, I will set out the priorities for the coming year in my area of responsibility.  In terms of older people, the priority will be the development of an integrated model of care with a strong emphasis on home care and other community services.  Some &euro;23 million is being transferred from the fair deal scheme budget to community services to deliver a greater range of care options, prevent unnecessary hospital admissions, avoid undue delays in discharges from acute hospitals and provide rehabilitation to support older people in returning home.  This will occur in various stages.  In the first stage, &euro;10 million will provide 190 intensive home care packages, IHCPs, to benefit 250 people annually.  Under the second stage, &euro;3 million will be used to commission 25 intermediate-transitional care beds to benefit 650 people and 20 beds for complex cases to benefit 130 people.  There is a particular difficulty in terms of intermediate and transitional beds, that is, the piece between home and hospital and <i>vice versa</i>, but we are hoping to address it.  Far more will be necessary in the years to come, but this is nevertheless a significant start.</p><p> The third stage will see &euro;10 million used to address funding shortfalls in the provision of public short-stay beds and maintain the current provision of 1,860 beds.  This is seen as a first step in aligning the model of care more towards the community in line with Government policy and the expressed wishes of older people.  It should be noted that the single assessment tool, SAT, project will implement a standardised IT-enabled health and social care needs assessment for older people nationally.  Implementation will proceed as planned, with the first phase to commence in 2014 and a minimum of 50% of all new entrants to the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, and the home care package and home help schemes to be assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014.  There will be full implementation by the end of 2015.</p><p> Financial support for long-term nursing home care is provided under the NHSS.  The budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939 million, a reduction of &euro;35 million on the 2013 position.  This reduction includes the &euro;23 million that I have already outlined and that is being transferred from the NHSS budget to community services.  The full details are on our website.  The HSE's National Service Plan 2014 sets a target of 22,061 people to be in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care by December 2014.  This will be a reduction on the position that obtained at the end of 2013, the figures on which are not yet available but will be shortly.  It is estimated that this reduction will be in the region of 700 to 800 people.  The review of the NHSS will consider its long-term sustainability as well as related aspects of home and community care.  Work on the review is ongoing and we are expecting its report shortly.</p><p> In 2014, the key deliverables in terms of mental health are the delivery of an implementation plan for the remaining three years of A Vision for Change; promoting positive mental health and improving suicide prevention, including the development of a new strategic framework to enhance the implementation and governance approaches associated with suicide and outstanding actions for Reach Out, the national suicide prevention strategy; and addressing fundamental issues within mental health services, including the commencement of a number of key projects to address ICT gaps, that is, how we connect with one another and use the information that is necessary for planning, the development of an initial workforce plan for 2014 to bring certainty around essential replacements, and an improved training and development strategy for mental health.</p><p> Disability is the area in which the greatest change is about to come.  Currently, the Government provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the disability services programme through the HSE's national service plan.  This is just a fraction of what is spent on disability, but it is the amount for which I have responsibility.  The Government is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.  In 2014, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintain a consistent level with that provided in 2013 by providing the following specialist disability services: residential services to more than 9,000 people with disabilities; day services to more than 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for more than 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 3.7 million hours of personal assistance-home support.  An additional &euro;14 million has been provided to address the priority needs within the disability services that arise as crises every year, for example, emergency admissions and people leaving services and schools.  Surely if we know the numbers each year, we cannot continue to call it a crisis.  Therefore, we have made provision in this regard.  We have also put in train a system by which we must be notified much earlier of how many people will be leaving services and what their needs will be.  This will be a major improvement on what has existed to date.</p><p> Some &euro;4 million has been provided to deliver the required increase in services for children with disabilities, including autism, and to reduce waiting lists under the progressing disability services for children and young people programme, that is, people from birth to 18.</p><p> Value for money savings and cost containment measures of &euro;5 million in sections 38 and 39 agencies have been identified but have not yet been allocated to the disability budget.  The level of home support and personal assistance hours provided in 2014 will be the same as that provided in 2013.  A total of 150 people will be facilitated in moving from institutions to homes in the community.  The level of respite care provided will also remain at 2013 levels.</p><p> I will briefly address the mobility allowance.  We are working on legislation as a result of our investigation into how we can best provide for people who are in need of this personalised allowance.  I reassure those who rely on this allowance that nothing will happen until the legislation comes to fruition.  It is our intention that as many people as possible be safeguarded.</p><p> I am always conscious that the last of the areas for which I am responsible - it should be at the very front, of course - is that of equality.  We completed two reports today, those being, a mid-term review of the national women's strategy and an evaluation of what needs to be done by 2016.  We are also working on a parental leave Bill.  The situation is more complex than people might have imagined and we are conscious to ensure mothers retain their current levels of protection.  We hope to publish the legislation towards the end of the year.</p><p> We are also working on a way to stop domestic violence instead of simply patching people up and sending them home.</p></speech>

In particular, I acknowledge the great achievements of the Government in the promissory note deal and in emerging from the bailout.  I acknowledge the endurance of the people of this country.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's work in the area of mental health, which I greatly appreciate.  It is a mark of the work that has been done that we have seen 61,000 new jobs created in the last year.  It is only a step towards where we need to be but the Government has put the country in a much better place than it was in when we entered office.</p><p>  One issue the Government must prioritise between now and the next election is housing.  We have a growing housing crisis which we must address as soon as possible.  I want to talk about social housing and private housing, both of which are required.  There are approximately 90,000 households on waiting lists for housing, partly a result of the improvement in employment.  Fundamentally, the waiting lists reflect the fact that the previous Government, which was in office from 1997, spent almost nothing on social housing notwithstanding the fact that it had huge resources at its disposal.  It is important to make that point.  The previous Government left it to an amateur private tenancy market to look after the needs of people on housing lists.  That is manifestly failing.  We are left, yet again, having to pick up the tab for the failure of the previous Government to do its work.</p><p>  It is important to get across the urgency of this situation.  Within a mile of where I live there are two hotels which many Deputies pass regularly.  They are Bewley's Hotel at Newlands Cross and the Ibis Hotel at the Red Cow and they are full of people who are homeless.  It is appalling that they are reduced to living in situations like that.  We require a building programme for social housing for the families who need a much more secure system than has obtained to date.  A programme will have the advantage of housing those people, building communities and getting unemployed building workers back to work.  I acknowledge the issue of finance and note the &euro;100 million which has been set aside for work in this area this year.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, would acknowledge, it is a fraction of what is required.  I urge the Government to do everything in its power to find the extra money required.  The pressure is on to a huge extent.  Many private landlords are now refusing to take people who are on rent subsidy.  In other cases, they are selling or being obliged to sell properties due to debt.  There is a real and urgent need.  It is therefore important that Part V is maintained and strengthened until such time as we get on top of the crisis.</p><p>  I recognise that the crisis in housing relates not only to social housing but includes private housing.  For the first time in seven years, I saw a major planning application in my county for 250 houses at Saggart.  I was delighted to see it, but it is only a fraction of what is required.  It is important that the Government in the construction strategy plan on which it is working ensures that there is money for builders to borrow to invest in construction.  The Government must also ensure that people who need mortgages can get them.  If that side is addressed, it will help to tackle the pent-up demand for private housing that is particularly evident in the greater Dublin area, Cork city, Galway city and various other places.  The extent of the problem is demonstrated in relation to greater Dublin by a discussion I had with my colleague, Deputy Jack Wall.  He lives in the Athy area, which is 50 miles from Dublin.  There is a serious housing problem even there notwithstanding that a great deal of housing was built in the area during the so-called Celtic tiger boom years.  It is very important to tackle this issue head on and I urge the Government to do so.</p><p>  There are other actions which must be taken.  We must ensure there is enough land available for housing.  All local authorities should be chased to ensure sufficient lands have been zoned.  In my county, some land which was zoned as far back as the 1970s remains ready for building.  It is important that it is brought into play.  There must be an element of imagination in tackling the issue.  In city and town centre areas, there is a serious problem of dilapidation and under-habitation of buildings.  One can see it when one drives along Cork Street and Thomas Street in Dublin.  I was talking to a friend of mine who lives near Bailieborough in County Cavan.  He told me that there is only one family still living on Main Street in that town.  I have no doubt that situation is happening across the country.  Methods to bring life back to those places would help to deal with the issue.  A further action which is needed is to ensure that NAMA properties are made available.  Even in Dublin, there are NAMA properties which remain unoccupied.  The sooner those are made available to people, the better.</p><p>  In the main, I acknowledge the huge progress the Government has made for the people and I urge it to prioritise housing in both the social and private sectors.  We do not want the embarrassment of more people being forced to live in unsuitable accommodation such as hotels and caravans.  We must tackle this.  After food and water, what is our most basic requirement but shelter?  Housing must be a top priority in the years that remain to the Government.  It must be tied to the development of jobs.  People need places to live and we need to build new communities for those who are waiting for the chance to form families and homes.</p></speech>

For the Government to have regained Ireland's independence from troika oversight last December has been to take a firm step on the road to recovery.  A year-on-year job creation rate of 61,000 jobs is certainly a step on the road to recovery also.  Wiping &euro;40 billion off debt repayment over the next 20 years is also a stage on the road to recovery.  The State's share of Ireland's massive bailout debt is more than &euro;200 billion.  The repayments on borrowings alone will take &euro;8 billion from the pockets of Irish people this year.</p><p>The reason for the cuts and the pain and distress in people's everyday lives is that large amounts of money must be removed from the economy every year in the post-bailout period solely to service debt.  While Ireland is on the road to recovery and in a much better place now than it was in January 2011, the great shame is that this country of hard-working people needed a bailout in the first place.</p><p> On any long road it is sometimes valuable to look backwards and ask how one got to this point.  I propose to return to June 2005 for a moment.  Even then, when the economy appeared to be strong, there were signs that all was not well.  According to the Central Statistics Office, in 2005 Ireland had the highest construction output <i>per capita</i>of any European country and twice the construction output of the United Kingdom.  One in eight people was employed in construction, which was 50% higher than the European average, and we had the highest rate of residential building in the European Union.  The State received &euro;2 billion in stamp duty revenue from property transactions in 2005, a threefold growth in three years, and the total value of mortgage debt increased sixfold from &euro;33 billion to &euro;200 billion in the previous three years.  While the value of the average new mortgage in 2000 stood at approximately &euro;100,000, by 2005 the figure had doubled to &euro;200,000, with one third of all homes costing more than &euro;300,000.  The property market was showing all the danger signs associated with a bubble, which is what transpired. </p><p> Where was the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in June 2005?  What was it doing to avert impending catastrophe?  Its members were playing golf at the K Club.  In June 2005, the K Club hosted the fifth annual US-Ireland Alliance Golf Challenge.  Most of the Irish team are now household names, albeit not on the basis of their golfing skills.  The team that played for Ireland included Peter Butler, group head of banking in Anglo Irish Bank; David Drumm, chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank; then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen; Laurence Crowley, governor of Bank of Ireland; Bernard McNamara, former Fianna F&aacute;il Party councillor turned billionaire property developer; and Derek Quinlan, former tax inspector turned billionaire property developer.  That night, at a gala dinner in Dublin, the golfing prizes were presented to the winning team by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's current leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  The Irish team won the trophy and Ireland, specifically its pensioners, young people and families with inflated mortgages and those who have lost homes, jobs and security, continues to pay the price.</p><p> In light of what Fianna F&aacute;il had reduced the country to by the time the troika arrived with its bailout, the progress this Government has achieved in steering the country to recovery is nothing short of a modern miracle.  People have endured too many sacrifices to repay the cost of the poisoned chalice presented by Deputy Martin to his golfing buddies in 2005.  It has taken considerable effort to turn the corner towards recovery.  As we look forward beyond the bailout, it is right and proper, therefore, that we cast a glance back along the road we have travelled since 2011.  In doing so, we must ensure we never return that way again.  </p><p> On the Order of Business yesterday, Deputy Martin queried the reason for arranging this debate this week given that statements had been made on this issue last week.  The reason for this debate is to ensure the Fianna F&aacute;il Party does not forget that it caused the mess in which we find ourselves. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200055#DDD00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate, on which the Opposition is making much hay.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Martin, argued yesterday that the House is spending too much time discussing the Government's priorities.  It is important to take time to discuss from where we have come in the past three years and where we will go in the next two years.  The purpose of these statements is to discuss the Government's priorities for the years ahead, not to slap ourselves on the back and say we have done a good job.  Our task is not even half finished.</p><p>  The coalition has been working together for three years.  I recall knocking on doors in February 2011 during the general election campaign.  I had never experienced such anger on the doorsteps.  In some cases, people were so angry that it did not matter which party the canvasser represented.  Members of the public wanted to let off steam and we all became fair game, which was completely understandable given that the terrible state in which Fianna F&aacute;il and its supporters had left the country.  Matters have moved on in the intervening years.  I was canvassing in County Meath recently for the local elections and while people are still angry, they are allowing themselves to be a little more optimistic about the future.  We must continue to build on this optimism.</p><p>  The decisions the Government has taken, often under intense political pressure, are making a difference.  The results of our tough decisions include a reduction in unemployment from 15% at the time the Fianna F&aacute;il Party left office to 12% today.  While this figure is still too high, we are on the right trajectory and the number of jobs is no longer declining.  In recent months, 1,200 jobs have been created each week.  The economy is growing as opposed to receding, as was the case when the Government took office, and there has been a significant increase in the number of tourists.  The growing number of foreign visitors is generating jobs in the hospitality industry.  While there are signs that things are improving, it would be foolish to believe we have done enough.  Much remains to be done to ensure Ireland is never again required to go begging and borrowing around the world. </p><p>  People need to know what the Government plans to do in its final two years in order that they can feel confident that the recovery will last.  They need to trust that jobs and opportunities will be created.  Stability is the key to real recovery.  If a business owner in Ratoath or Duleek is considering taking on more staff or expanding his or her business, he or she needs to know if people will have more income in their pockets to spend in that business.</p><p>  We must be clear about what we intend to do to reduce pressure on the squeezed middle, in other words, hard-pressed families.  Government expenditure on local projects can also help generate additional income in communities.  If people see money being spent on capital projects, they will take the Government seriously when it states it wants recovery to continue.  My colleagues, Deputies Robert Dowds and Anne Ferris, referred to the need for new social housing.  Investment in new social housing schemes not only benefits families who are currently without a home but also provides employment in the construction sector which, as Deputies are aware, badly needs a boost. </p><p>  The Government was elected to deliver social reform and an economic programme.  Our social reform agenda spans education, children's rights and industrial relations.  There are more children at school than at any time in the history of the State.  For this reason, we must build new schools, as is being done in Ashbourne, Kells, Duleek and Ratoath in County Meath, to address the increase in children entering the education system.  We must pass the education Bill to ensure all children have equal access to education.  Access to one's local school should not depend on where one's brother or sister went to school or the religious beliefs of one's parents.  </p><p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce collective bargaining.  It is time this commitment was realised because collective bargaining is a right rather than a privilege.  The Government still has two years to make a difference and ensure the recovery is sustainable.  We must redouble our efforts to focus on jobs and the economy, without forgetting to introduce our important social reform programme.</p></speech>

Why was the entire business of the D&aacute;il last week and most of its business this week devoted to a back-slapping exercise?  There is nothing worse than listening to people who feel it is necessary to tell us how good they are.  People will tell the Government parties how good they are when their candidates knock on doors in the local and European elections.  I extend my best wishes to all those standing for election.  It is true that people were hostile to the outgoing Government during the previous general election campaign.  While I was a member of one of the parties in the previous Government for a long time, I stood as an Independent candidate in the general election and I am proud to be an Independent Deputy today.</p><p>  Many promises were made at the previous general election.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party could have promised anything and they still would have been elected but they chose to engage in a bidding war.  We were promised accountability, transparency, openness and honesty.</p><p>The bondholders were to be burned.  I have referred more than once in this House to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, saying when in opposition that hell's fire would not be as hot as the bondholders and to people being allowed some bit of dignity.  What happened?  This Government took on the clothes of the previous Administration.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is in the House.  While she was very vociferous when in opposition, unlike her colleague who had the decency to get out of the kitchen when she was being bullied by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, she has stood over the closure of hospitals and cuts in funding that had been ring-fenced for disability and mental services.  Like many other facilities throughout the country, the mental health service facility which had been in place in Clonmel for generations has been closed.  </p><p> The troika then came to town.  I met with the troika on a number of occasions.  They were spun the same spin by officials of this Government as they had been spun by officials of the previous Administration, including that there would be 2% growth here and there and that this, that and the other job was being done.  What was done to the untouchables, the barristers and the Judiciary?  Nothing.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, without any prior discussion or debate brought forward a referendum to establish a new tier of the Judiciary, members of which were to be appointed by him and would be colleagues of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  However, 38% of the people voted against it.</p><p> The Government also promised to abolish quangos but it has created more than ever existed.  In recent days, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, spoke on radio about how he met Mr. Flannery wandering around the inner sanctum of Government.  When the heat in the kitchen became too hot the Taoiseach dispensed with him, by agreement I would contend.  Members of Government, including the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, then took to the airwaves saying that Mr. Flannery should appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to answer questions about this and that, following which Mr. Flannery resigned that evening.  The whole situation was carefully choreographed.  However, the people have not been fooled.  They can see what is going on.  </p><p> This Government even broke the cap on salaries for its advisers.  This is the fifth day of the Government's self-congratulatory bunkum.  Day after day the Taoiseach fails to answer questions put to him in this House.  I engaged with him during Leaders Questions for six months.  One regularly gets a completely unrelated response to the question asked.  The Taoiseach cannot wait to go off on his travels to the US.  When members of the Government were in opposition they continually condemned the number of Ministers who travelled abroad.  During the first year of the troika programme they reduced to nine or ten the number of Ministers who travelled abroad.  Now 38 Ministers are to travel abroad.  I have no problem with the Taoiseach or particular Ministers travelling to particular countries but it is like the flight of the earls.  I heard a Government spokesperson say that the cost in this regard is &euro;330,000.  Who do this Government think it is codding?  It costs more than that to send 38 Ministers and their entourages abroad, and for what reason?  As I said I have no problem with ten or 12 Ministers travelling abroad but 38 is ridiculous.  I wonder if anybody will be left in charge of the country.  </p><p> Another commitment of this Government was that the number of Ministers would be reduced.  However, what we have witnessed is more jobs for the boys in terms of the number of advisers appointed and boards stuffed with Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues.  A former running mate of the Taoiseach, a solicitor, was appointed as a Justice.  The Labour Party has done likewise.  It is a case of tit-for-tat.  As I have said more than once, this Government set out to punish the electorate for having the audacity to keep Fine Gael and the Labour Party out of government for 14 years and preventing them appointing their friends to high places.  However, as in the case of the last runner in the relay, they have made up for it and stuffed their friends into every position.  This cronyism and nepotism is disgusting and despicable.  The public have had enough of it.  I have been canvassing during the evening and at weekends over the past five or six weeks.  The public can be fooled once but not twice.  </p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has responsibility for disability services.  As I have said previously, there appears to be an agenda in the Department of Health to attack people with disabilities.  During the past two and a half years three attempts were made to cut the entitlements of disabled people.  This year the cut was made without any discussion.  I attended the disabilities forum in the Mansion House, which the Minister of State was too afraid to attend and answer questions.  The Minister of State rather than blame the Minister, Deputy Reilly, for what is happening should take responsibility for her own portfolio and take care of vulnerable people who need to be looked after, including people in wheelchairs, carers and those in other difficult situations.  The response of this Government is to always blame the previous Government.  I was here when members of the Government were in opposition and were continually calling for more to be spent.  The previous Government might have been reckless but the Opposition was even more reckless in terms of its continually demanding more, with no thought for the rainy day.</p><p> Deputy Anne Ferris referred to people playing golf.  I have never played golf.  The people she named were not the only ones playing golf.  This Government has a new way of doing things.  For example, it is kow towing to and at the beck and call of big business like EirGrid, which is trying to ruin our country.  It is more disgusting cronyism.  Many members of the Government are opposed to the North-South interconnector and promised if elected that they would oppose it.  Legislation to deal with the issue will not now be ready until 2015.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is like a spokesperson for EirGrid.  Some months ago, I tabled a Priority Question on the matter to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  His response was that he has no responsibility for EirGrid, yet during the following month he was on radio shows with Matt Copper, Mary Wilson and others espousing the virtues of EirGrid.  When following the recent storms many people were left without lights for a week the Minister had the arrogance and audacity to tell us that if we did not accept the pylons and his new-found policy and new bed-fellows in EirGrid, many of whom are investors from abroad, we would be forever living in the dark ages.  What an arrogant cheek.  </p><p> The Minister then appointed Mr. John O'Connor, who is bordering on 80 years of age, having spent 45 years in public service and 12 years elsewhere, as chairman of EirGrid.</p></speech>

We are being told one day by it that the energy will be for export and another day that it will service my constituents in Clonmel and I should not be opposed to it.  We have been also told that to underground the lines would be nine times more costly.  We are now being told undergrounding would be less than three times the cost of laying the lines over ground.  We are all in a tizzy from the spin and PR.  This Government has spent a great deal of money on PR and choreographing every situation, including the despicable cuts to mental health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, refused at first to meet with the staff of St. Michael's Hospital in Clonmel.  When she did arrive unannounced she complained because the door was locked.  She said at that time that she had to pinch one patient to wake him up.  Does the Minister of State recall that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.683" nospeaker="true" time="18:30:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh on Tuesday, 11 March 2014:That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:

noting that:

&mdash; when the Government came to power 55.1 per cent of those unemployed were long term unemployed, after three years of this Government 61.4 per cent of those unemployed are now long-term unemployed; and

&mdash; there has been a 25 per cent reduction in local authority staffing levels since 2011 and local authority services are therefore unable to provide adequate services across a range of areas, as evidenced by the recent delays in addressing damage caused by severe weather;

considers that the new Gateway scheme:

&mdash; is a work-for-benefits scheme, also known as workfare or forced labour, on which participation is not voluntary;

&mdash; entails 22 months of hard labour for a very small social welfare top-up of &euro;20 that can be all but eroded by tax;

&mdash; will not enhance the employability of participants, as there is no quality training involved and there is a recruitment embargo in place on local authorities;

&mdash; punishes the unemployed for being unemployed;

&mdash; copperfastens the under-staffing of essential local services; and

&mdash; undermines existing pay, terms and conditions for staff across the local authority sector; and

calls on the Government to abandon the Gateway scheme and instead explore the introduction of an alternative activation programme based on a training-intensive Community Employment scheme type model for a local authority context or temporary work experience opportunities on the basis of equal pay for equal work done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.684" nospeaker="true" time="18:30:00" ><p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:

&quot;acknowledges the important role that activation and work placement initiatives have had on supporting jobseekers;

notes that:

&mdash; the number of people in employment in Ireland grew by 61,000 or 3.3 per cent last year and stood at over 1.9 million at the end of 2013; and

&mdash; the rate of unemployment was 11.9 per cent in February 2014, down from 15 per cent in early 2012;

nevertheless remains concerned that:

&mdash; the level of unemployment is still far too high;

&mdash; 60,000 young people aged under 25 are without work; and

&mdash; long-term unemployment levels remain above 155,000;

recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to:

&mdash; prioritise actions to stimulate employment creation and reduce unemployment under the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies;

&mdash; focus attention on initiative for young unemployed people;

&mdash; resource a broad range of interventions to support the jobseeker access education, training, internships and work placements; and

&mdash; provide opportunities for over 25,000 placements on Community Employment, 7,500 placements on T&uacute;s and 3,000 placements on Gateway to support jobseekers back to work and to underpin the delivery of important services of benefit to communities;

welcomes:

&mdash; the commencement of the roll-out of Gateway in county and city councils;

&mdash; the practical and social benefits Gateway offers the jobseeker to re-engage with work;

&mdash; the continued positive feedback from participants on Community Employment and T&uacute;s, work placements programmes similar to Gateway and the enormous success of JobBridge, the national internship scheme;

&mdash; the ongoing development of Government initiatives to support jobseekers in terms of further education and training, reskilling and activation, with a view to availing of opportunities as they arise in the economy;

&mdash; the continued positive contribution in terms of service support at a local level that schemes such as Gateway can offer; and

&mdash; the proposals made to the European Commission to support young people to get back into work;

commends:

&mdash; the commitment of county and city councils to deliver on Gateway and the positive outcomes it can have for jobseekers;

&mdash; the fact that 15 per cent of places on Gateway will be reserved for those aged under 25; and

&mdash; the ongoing commitment of the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the development and role of Gateway.&quot;- (Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton)</p></speech>

In 2008 Dublin City Council had 7,500 employees.  It now has 5,000.  By September next, it is due to have only 4,800 employees.  This means that more than one third of the staff of the council will have left during a six-year period.  That has had a huge impact on all services offered by the council, including parks, maintenance, etc.  On Monday night last, a family home was attacked and a number of windows were smashed.  Staff from the Ballyfermot maintenance depot arrived at the scene of the crime and stated that they had neither the staff nor the money necessary to replace the windows.  Instead, they are going to board up the windows with wood.  The family involved continues to live in the house.</p><p>  The staff of the parks department of Dublin City Council in Dublin South Central has been cut by 25%.  There are now no staff available to open and close the gates to or to maintain the playing area at Drimnagh pitch and putt club.  The course will now be left open all the time, with no support available.</p><p>  Dublin City Council has no training, transport or education budgets in respect of the Gateway scheme.  What the council needs to be able to do is employ proper gatekeepers rather than being obliged to operate the Gateway scheme.  Participants on Gateway will be paid an additional &euro;20 for 19.5 hours work per week.  This translates to a little more than &euro;1 per hour.  The Government describes it as a labour activation scheme but it would be that only if there were jobs available at the end of it.  When it reduced the jobseeker's allowance, the Government encouraged its backbenchers to defend the move by saying that those in receipt of it are at home watching their flat screen TVs.  On this occasion they are defending Gateway by stating that it will allow people to experience what it is like to get up in the morning.  How shameful it is that the Labour Party is playing a role in facilitating the introduction of this scheme.  That party is really scraping the bottom of the barrel and Gateway is nothing more than a slave labour initiative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.687" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200057#FFF03500"><p>Just before the previous Government left office, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v introduced a scheme that was quite similar to JobBridge.  There were screams of disapproval from the Labour benches at the time as a result of the way that scheme was introduced.  Essentially, they voiced their disapproval on the basis that individuals who were unemployed would not be given a choice with regard to participating on the scheme.  I do not understand that transformation which has occurred.  While the Labour Party may have objected to the scheme to which I refer, it is now introducing something even more draconian in the form of Gateway.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has launched an initiative in respect of workforce planning in the area of local government.  It is clear that some local authorities have staffing complements which are extremely disproportionate in size to the populations to which they are obliged to provide services.  Some of the workforce planning to which I refer is happening at present, which indicates that there are real jobs available.  If people are be asked to participate on a scheme such as Gateway, then there should be a possibility of progression.  In addition, they should be given a choice as to whether they want to take up a place on a labour activation scheme rather than being stigmatised if they do not sign up.  What is at issue here is the fact that people are being placed for being unemployed, while those who are long-term unemployed are being singled out, told that they need to be taught how to get out of bed each morning or informed that they have become lazy from sitting in front of their plasma screen TVs.  All of these individuals are essentially being informed that if they do not participate, their welfare payments will be cut.  That misses the point completely.  People want jobs and they do not need to be demeaned any further when they are already feeling quite vulnerable with regard to the lack of opportunities available to them.  What is being done in this instance is disgraceful.</p></speech>

Those in Fine Gael must be becoming terribly excited about the prospect of forcing people to work for next to nothing.  They probably dreamed about this for years but never thought they could get away with it.  Suddenly, however, they have their opportunity.  They are going to displace real, proper, permanent, secure, well-paid and trade-union supported jobs with what effectively is slave labour.  People are going to be dragooned into doing work which desperately needs to be done.  There is no doubt about the latter because how could we not need individuals to work for local authorities whose staffing complements have been drastically reduced in recent years?  In that context, 20% of the workforce of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have been axed as a result of the prevailing policy of austerity.  There is a desperate need for maintenance work to be done on people's council houses, for repairs to be made to roads, for parks to be cleaned up, for graffiti to be removed, for bins to be emptied and for flood relief works to be carried out.  There are construction workers and hundreds of other people in every area who would be more than willing to do this work but they should be paid for doing it.  These individuals should not be enslaved and forced to do the work to which I refer on the cheap.</p><p>  What the Government proposes to do is completely outrageous.  One would expect this from the blueshirts because they would probably confine all of us to boot camps if they got the opportunity.  However, for the Labour Party to have anything to do with what is proposed - particularly in light of its historic relationship with the trade union movement - is simply beyond belief.  Essentially, the Labour Party is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel in order to undermine proper jobs and facilitate both job displacement and what effectively is slave labour.  That is an absolute disgrace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200057#FFF03700"><p>The Gateway scheme is certainly workfare.  The only choice individuals will be given is to either participate or risk having their social welfare payments reduced or cut off altogether.  The Unite trade union has stated that the scheme may well place Ireland in breach of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which relates to the right to freely choose one's work, and the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that no-one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.  Last week the Taoiseach was at pains to tell us that people love to do things for their communities.  Of course they do.  In the region of 50 people are involved with the Wexford Youths football team on a voluntary level.  If I stated that I would give them &euro;1 per hour for what they do and that they would be paid members as a result, I do not think many of them would stick around.  These individuals take pride in being volunteers.  People like to and take pleasure from contributing to their communities.  However, informing people that they must do certain work for which they will be paid &euro;20 per week in addition to their dole is an insult.  How in God's name do those in government expect people to put up with that?</p><p>  Andreas Fischer-Lescano, a professor of European law and politics at the University of Bremen, recently indicated that as a result of the way we have implemented antisocial austerity policies, placed financial stability above all other considerations and ignored social stability, we may be actually breaking the law.</p><p>This country is eager and interested in some laws being kept but not as interested in keeping others.  Looking after those who most need the Government's help is no longer high on the agenda.  This should be reversed.  It is an insult to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200058#GGG00200"><p>We often hear bandied about the expression of asking people to work for nothing.  This scheme is even worse than that because the reality of what the Government is proposing is that it will cost people to go to work and they will end up poorer because of this mechanism.  It is a disgrace that such a proposition is even on the table.</p><p>  We must look beyond the consequences for the individual, bad and all as they are.  These people will be frogmarched out onto the streets, no doubt in high visibility jackets, to pick up some litter as a warning to the rest of us to be careful about what might happen.  Far more serious is the undermining of public sector jobs that this mechanism facilitates.  It is a cover-up for the erosion of council services which the public sector recruitment embargo has facilitated.  Not only that, it is economic lunacy, because it is replacing what were secure permanent and pensionable jobs with a chain gang.  The result is that young people have no choice but to leave the country.</p><p>  The Fingal County Council area, where I am based, has the lowest and youngest population in the country.  Only 21 out of the 1,300 council employees are below 30 years of age and I imagine most of these are 29 years of age.  Therefore, by next year there will be no one under the age of 30 years in the council.  Is it any wonder young people have to emigrate?  The functions that were being done are now either being outsourced to yellow pack companies with no decent terms and conditions or the jobs are not being done at all.</p><p>  I offer one example, that of libraries.  This is probably the only public service that is available in our area.  A total of 50% of the librarians are over 50 years of age and several of them are retiring.  What will be the consequence?  The Government is not going to recruit librarians.  The services will get cut at a time when people need them.  Meanwhile, potential librarians are on the dole queues while those numbers are being whittled down.  This is lunacy and for the Labour Party to be part of it is almost beyond belief.  I note the Labour Party has conned some of the unions into going with the scheme in return for the right to fleece people with union subscriptions.  It is a disgrace and the people will not stand for it.</p></speech>

I take some of the points made just now and those made by some Sinn F&eacute;in Members yesterday evening in respect of this scheme.  However, if we are to discuss labour initiatives and work placements, etc., then it would be remiss of us to sweep aside where we are and the fact that the country was destroyed by a handful of spectators, politicians and bankers.  They got us where we are, that is to say, thousands of people have left the country and thousands of people are on the dole.  In such an environment, irrespective of what jurisdiction a person is in, this changes things.</p><p>  I do not blow the trumpet for this scheme.  However, we should consider the circumstances.  The lights of the country are being kept on by money borrowed from our neighbours to pay the wages of public servants etc. including politicians.  This is being paid out of money from the British, French and Belgian taxpayers.  Sometimes we have debates in the House, parts of which are good and I will go with those parts.  However, it makes no sense to discuss these things in a vacuum.  A former Taoiseach said in the House one night we were the richest little country in the world.  If we were, we are not the richest little country in the world now.  There are limitations to this scheme and to how far embargoes can go with local authorities.  I do not believe any local authority, including my local authority, South Dublin County Council, can afford to lose any more staff.  It is difficult for a local authority to provide a service in such an environment.  Naturally, politicians on this side of the House and on the other side of the House look forward to the day when the embargo is gone and when local authorities can once again take on a full placement of people, whether in the environmental department, library services, cleansing or whatever.  I look forward to the day we arrive back at that place and the sooner it happens, the better.</p><p>  Some of the comrades have been at it again.  They have used the opportunity not so much to discuss the scheme or what type of alternative scheme they would put in its place.  Rather, they used the opportunity to slag off the Labour Party.  The Labour Party has been slagged off for a hundred years and it is nothing new.  Those of us born into the great tradition of the trade union movement and the Labour Party - the trade union produced the Labour Party in this country - and its proud tradition of a hundred years learn to live with it.  In fairness, not all of them have done it.  This applies to Sinn F&eacute;in Members, some of whose contributions last night were quite balanced.  They use every opportunity to slag off the Labour Party and that is okay because we are used to it.  The church does it and the political establishment did it for a hundred years.  William Martin Murphy did it.</p><p>  The comrades in Sinn F&eacute;in have referred to low wages and workers' rights and so on.  They might be better off putting their heads into the trench and pulling them down a little more.  The greatest event for the labour movement in this country was the Dublin Lock-out.  What happened during the Dublin Lock-out?  Sinn F&eacute;in did not turn up.  On the first day of the Lock-out, 31 August 1913, when Jim Larkin, James Connolly, Helena Moloney, Rosie Hackett, Thomas Foran and so on were leading the workers who had been locked out, where was the leader and founder of Sinn F&eacute;in, Arthur Griffith?  He was in his back garden reading ancient Irish poetry.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Members should reflect on that.  I understand that parties reinvent themselves and historical circumstances change.</p></speech>

I will not go back beyond the last election, save to say that I am proud to be a member of a party that engages with the duty of government once in a while, rather than throwing stones from the Opposition side.  Our party engages with ideas and seeks to move them forward just as, I am happy to acknowledge, Sinn F&eacute;in is doing in Northern Ireland at the moment.  After a long period of not engaging in government it is now in government there.  Sometimes decisions are difficult in government, as those in Sinn F&eacute;in in Northern Ireland would accept.</p><p>  One of the darkest moments of the last election for me was meeting a man in a housing estate between Ennis and Clarecastle.  He was packing up a car to drive to England to begin to try to find work there.  He was a tradesman.  He was not a happy man, he was desolate about leaving a mortgage, a wife and children behind.</p><p>He pointed to a common area in the estate in which he lived and said that he could not even mow that grass.  There are community employment schemes in the area but they do not employ him or many others.  </p><p> I am proud that this Government has increased the number of community employment schemes.  I take pride in this initiative which has been criticised so much on the Opposition benches.  I am not saying that painting walls, mowing grass or fixing roads are jobs that anybody should be forced into.  The dignity of such work, however, should not be belittled in this House because many people undertake such jobs.  If they did not do so, our communities simply could not exist.  </p><p> Councils can and do pay for work but there is much work that needs to be done in our communities that councils are not paying for and have never paid for.  Even in the boom times of illusionary surpluses and full employment, those works were not done.  It is important to bear in mind that this Gateway scheme has been agreed with the trade union movement to ensure there is no job displacement.  Gateway is facilitating works in our cities and rural areas, including smaller towns and villages across the country, that otherwise would not get done.  Such works improve the living standards of all in society.  </p><p> Like the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in talks a lot about rights on both sides of the Border.  I agree to some extent with them that it was the lack of respect for rights, though not only that, which contributed in large measure to the instability in Northern Ireland.  In considering rights in any republic, we must also look at duties.  We all have a duty to pay our taxes.  There is a lot of talk at the moment about philanthropists.  It is all well and good to be a philanthropist and give money once in a while over and above that which one has a duty to give.  However, every citizen in this State has a duty to pay his or her taxes.  In addition, every company resident in this State - I do not believe in so-called non-resident companies - as part of the social contract has to pay its taxes.  That is the way in which people fortunate enough to have employment can fulfil their duty to the common good in our Republic.</p><p> What most annoyed the man to whom I spoke in Ennis was that he could not even contribute to society.  Not alone could he not get a job, there was no mechanism by which he could contribute.  There was no way he could go out every morning and do something useful to make his community a little bit better.  To the extent that the Gateway scheme achieves that, I am quite proud that the Government has introduced it and I make no apologies to anybody for that.  Of course, I would be against slave labour or any of the draconian measures the Opposition would like to portray this scheme as, but that is simply not what it is.  </p><p> The Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion points out that &quot;when the Government came to power 55.1 per cent of those unemployed were long-term unemployed, after three years of this Government 61.4 per cent of those unemployed are now long-term unemployed&quot;.  I do not dispute the veracity of that fact, but that is all the more reason to give people who are long-term unemployed something to do if they so wish.  We should give them a mechanism by which they can contribute to their areas and society generally.  Some people on these benches may not want to avail of that mechanism but some of the people I met while canvassing for the last general election did want to avail of such a scheme.  They were quite annoyed by the fact that there was no such mechanism, but there is now. </p><p> As regards the figure for the long-term unemployed, if we can learn anything from the 1980s it is how detrimental is long-term unemployment.  There is an absolute necessity to introduce labour-activation measures to give people hope and a mechanism by which they can contribute to society if they cannot get a job at the moment.</p></speech>

I will support anything that helps to get people back into employment, including a vehicle allowing them to improve their skills-set and restore the confidence and self-esteem of the long-term unemployed.  In the past I urged Ministers to introduce more CE, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes.  Gateway is on the same lines.  We need more rather than less schemes of this kind.</p><p>  When I saw initially that 80 schemes had been allocated to the local authority in Mayo I asked whether we could not have obtained more.  I have made representations to Ministers about the T&uacute;s scheme to try to get it extended from one year to two.  That is because people on the scheme were enjoying what they did and contributed to the organisations they worked for.  </p><p>  Schemes can always be improved and fine-tuned.  If there is something wrong with Gateway when it is rolled out, let us change it or tweak it.  Sole traders do not currently qualify to take on internships even though they would not be replacing anybody else, so that needs to be tweaked.  In recent weeks, new social protection offices were opened in my constituency, but an area in east Mayo is without a community welfare office as a result.  That situation needs to be tweaked because the area concerned is bigger than some counties.  Mayo is the third biggest county so that matter needs to be re-examined by the Minister for Social Protection.  I urge her to take a look at it.  </p><p>  I was listening to what Deputy Jim Daly said yesterday about the North of Ireland where there is a youth employment scheme.  Under that scheme unemployed youths receive an extra &pound;15.38 per week in addition to their benefits.  I assume that is something like the situation here, but if I am wrong I apologise in advance.</p></speech>

When we came into Government three years ago the biggest issue facing us was unemployment, and it still is.  While or intention to create many more jobs is proving to be successful, we have simply not yet created enough.  The overriding ambition would be not to need a scheme like this and that no one would be two years unemployed.  We would prefer if that situation had never happened and that is what we are trying to get back to.</p><p>  We would also like to believe that anyone working for 22 months on this scheme will not last the full period, in that they will move on to another job at some opportune point.  That proviso is built into the scheme and we are moving towards it.  As we all know, local authority staff have been reduced so a lot of work that would normally have been done by such staff is not being done at the moment.  That is causing huge concern in a whole range of issues.</p><p>  For a scheme such as Gateway to work, we will have to ensure that councils have as many resources as possible.  There is simply no point in creating opportunities like this unless they are sufficiently resourced so the work can be carried out.  I implore the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to put as much money as he can into local authorities so this work can be carried out.</p><p>Quite a number of people enjoy being on the schemes and want to extend their time on them.  Those who are unemployed cannot be classified in one group as there are a variety of backgrounds, ages and qualifications among those who are unemployed.  We must devise a system of schemes that will work for people.  Local authorities have a range of work and the Gateway scheme is one option.  I acknowledge that the issue of Garda vetting of participants in the scheme needs to be dealt with.  There is a vagueness associated with the system of Garda vetting which needs to be clarified.  The unemployment issue needs to be dealt with and this scheme is a step in the right direction.  I ask the Opposition to be careful of the use of language when speaking about this scheme.  The motion uses terms such as "forced labour", "hard labour" and "punishes".  This country is not like a North Korean prison camp.  This scheme is a legitimate effort to deal with an issue.  I do not have a problem with opposition to the scheme but some of the language used is over the top.  I suggest the Opposition should put forward some alternatives to see how people can get back to work because that is a project on which we can all agree.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.705" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200060#JJJ00200"><p>I commend the Minister for Social Protection on introducing a raft of new measures and schemes to encourage young people and those of all ages to go back to work.  Gateway is a scheme which aims to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.  I grew up in an area where the community employment scheme was part of what was happening in the community.  People who went on CE schemes were able to move into long-term employment within two or three years and still retain their employment today.</p><p>  Participants in the Gateway scheme will work for 19.5 hours a week and will earn &euro;208 a week.  Participants will also retain their secondary benefits, medical cards and their entitlements to those benefits.  The scheme aims to improve the employability of those people who have been long-term unemployed.  I welcome the &euro;2 million which has been allocated to support the training and equipment needs for those people who participate in the Gateway programme.</p><p>  This new scheme has attracted some negative publicity since its announcement but it does not pretend to solve the unemployment problem overnight or to provide permanent full-time jobs.  It is what it says on the tin, a gateway to employment, which will give people the incentive to go out to work, to gain new experience and hopefully to be able to build on their experiences and move into full-time employment.</p><p>  The scheme will help those who are long-term employed to build self-confidence, re-acclimatise themselves to the workplace environment, use their initiative and work as part of a team.  The scheme will benefit those individuals and the local authorities, most of which are struggling to fulfil their functions adequately because of lack of funding, retirements and the embargo on recruitment.  It will provide work opportunities for those who are otherwise unable to secure employment while ensuring the existing roles and jobs are not affected and duplication is avoided.  The work of Gateway participants is designed to complement the local authorities' core activities.  The scheme will cater for more than 3,000 participants nationally with an allocation of 295 in my local authority of Dublin City Council.  The type of work participation will include landscaping, control of animals, tourism ambassadors and village enhancement schemes.  Such work is essential in the creation of civic pride in the local community.</p><p>  There was criticism of the JobBridge scheme but 60% of participants secured full employment.  We should not knock schemes before giving them a chance.  I agree with the previous speaker about the Garda vetting arrangements.  I ask the Minister to ensure the Garda vetting arrangements are processed quickly to avoid a delay for participants who are anxious to join the scheme.</p></speech>

In 2011, when this Government took office, 1,600 jobs were being lost every week.  After much focus and progress, 1,200 jobs a week are being created but we still have more to do and more progress is needed.  Job creation is a priority for the Government.  I come from the Waterford constituency which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, not through any fault of its own.  Its manufacturing tradition became uncompetitive and there was a dependence on construction.  When both collapsed, there was a void which needed to be addressed.  To achieve progress and to create solutions, we need to hear from the Opposition as well as from Government about realistic solutions that will help to create jobs.  All I hear is the Opposition in a permanent state of protest constantly trying to undermine a Government that is working hard to create jobs.  I listened to Deputy Boyd Barrett criticising the Government.  I wonder what he has ever worked at in his life to be such an expert on job creation or whether he has ever worked outside of this House.</p><p>  There needs to be a range of options to assist those who are unemployed.  Gateway is not an isolated solution.  JobBridge is one option and 61% of interns who have engaged with JobBridge have achieved full-time employment on completion of the programme.  This information has been compiled by Indecon.  I refer to T&uacute;s schemes and CE schemes which have been very successful in acting as stepping stones for long-term unemployed people to get back into the workforce.  I refer to the MOMENTUM programme and the Steps programme for the self-employed and the back to education schemes.  The solution needs to be found by means of a holistic approach.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been critical of the Government with regard to the jobseeker's allowance and the Gateway scheme.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Members like to deny it but in Northern Ireland, 16 to 24 year olds are paid &pound;56.80 per week which is equivalent to &euro;67, yet they are very critical of this Government reducing the rate for those under 25 years to &euro;100 a week.  Those over 25 years in Northern Ireland are paid &pound;71.70 a week as jobseeker's allowance, which is equivalent to &euro;85, for a period of only six months, while in the Republic it is paid for nine months.  This is typical of Sinn F&eacute;in Members speaking out of both sides of their mouth.  I support Deputy O'Mahony's comments that Sinn F&eacute;in supports the youth employment scheme in Northern Ireland which pays &pound;15.38 a week in addition to benefits, yet its Members come into this House and are critical of a Gateway scheme that actually pays more.  This scheme is a stepping stone which is part of an holistic approach to getting the long-term unemployed back into the workplace.  It is solutions we need here and not just protests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/986" speakername="Michael Creed" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200060#JJJ00400"><p>I confess I have often sat here during Private Members' time and, having considered the motion, would have been able to agree with aspects of it but for obvious reasons I do not get the opportunity to agree with it.  I must say with complete conviction that on this occasion there is not a single iota of this Private Members' motion with which I can agree.  It is gratuitously insulting to people who are unemployed and to anyone who participates in Gateway, a T&uacute;s scheme, a CE scheme or JobBridge.  It is based on a flawed political miscalculation in that Sinn F&eacute;in believes a cohort of those unfortunate people, who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own, do not want to work.  I can tell Sinn F&eacute;in that in my political experience in my constituency office, as late as my clinics last Monday night, I had people who want to stay longer on schemes and who want to get onto schemes.  I have had conversations with supervisors who have constructive suggestions to make about how to improve schemes.  However, this motion is gratuitously insulting to communities who organise schemes, to local authorities who will provide a range of opportunities to participants on schemes, but it is insulting most of all to the more than 180,000 people who are long-term unemployed, for whom Sinn F&eacute;in Members allege to care but to whom, by virtue of their motion, they are giving a slap in the face.</p><p> The motion refers to the portion of the unemployed accounted for by those who are long-term unemployed having increased from 55% to 61%.  What is Sinn F&eacute;in's solution to this issue?  Deputy Clare Daly said that people need a job if they are to get back to work.  Of course they need a job.  However, it is clearly established that the prospects of getting a full-time job are significantly diminished the longer a person is unemployed.  That is what labour activation programmes seek to address.  It is about giving people a pathway back to work by offering opportunities to upskill and retrain.  If Members opposite were offering a constructive criticism of the schemes in terms of their training input, for example, there might be something to debate.  However, this pejorative language of "frog-marching", "forced labour" and "hard labour" is gratuitously insulting to those people who want to participate in the schemes and see them not as a hard labour, but as an avenue back to work.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in needs to get real.  I urge Members opposite to get in touch with the constituencies where unemployment is a serious issue and with the communities that are offering these people some hope of getting back into the workforce.  Our economic recovery is fragile.  Any local social welfare officer will say that employers are nervous but are gradually putting their toes back in the water.  These employers are saying they do not have sufficient confidence to take on a full-time employee, but they can offer two or three days work per week.  Participants who work for 19.5 hours per week under the Gateway, T&uacute;s or community employment schemes will receive an incentive to do so and can take up opportunities elsewhere on the back of the experience they gain.</p><p> In an ideal world, we would have work for everybody and there would be no need to debate these issues.  Unfortunately, ours is a far from ideal world and we cannot adopt the head in the sand, all or nothing approach of Deputy Clare Daly or Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are giving participants an additional &euro;20 per week.  I wish we were in a position to give an extra &euro;50 or &euro;100, but we simply cannot afford it.  Who would pay the taxes to support that increased allocation?  Employers are beginning to get up off their knees and offer people opportunities, but Deputies opposite want to nail those people to a lifetime on social welfare.  It is a betrayal like none I have ever seen in respect of people who are unemployed, and it is coming from a party that purports to articulate the needs of marginalised people.  In previous Opposition motions I have generally found elements that I would like, in my heart of hearts, to support.  In this instance, however, there is not a single shred of content that offers anything to the people it is claiming to represent but further long-term unemployment.  The bottom line is that we need labour activation measures to improve the employability of people seeking work.</p><p> I will conclude by offering a constructive criticism, which I hope the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, will convey to his colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton.  There is a proliferation of schemes, including T&uacute;s, community employment schemes and Gateway, which, because they were introduced at short notice, feature a degree of overlap and inadequate co-ordination.  I have spoken to supervisors who are crisscrossing County Cork, with one supervising a single T&uacute;s worker on a GAA pitch, for example, and another coming onto the same pitch separately to supervise three T&uacute;s workers or community employment scheme workers.  We need to extract from the current pool of supervisors people who will assume an oversight role in terms of the implementation and co-ordination of scarce resources.  We are putting &euro;19 million into Gateway.  I wish we could allocate &euro;90 million, but that is not possible.  This is a labour activation measure with significant merit.  As I said at the outset, the content of this motion from Sinn F&eacute;in is gratuitously insulting to long-term unemployed people and to participants in these schemes the length and breadth of the country.</p></speech>

As I understand  it, a sum of &euro;200 or so will be given towards health and safety aspects for anyone who is participating in the scheme, but there is no training and education budget and participants will not receive any qualification at the end of it.</p><p>  The website of the Department of Social Protection includes the following statement in its description of what Gateway purports to do:<blockquote>Work can only be undertaken on specific purpose projects or work that the County and City Councils used to undertake but no longer have resources to carry out...</blockquote>Every Minister and Government Deputy who has spoken in this debate denied that the scheme is about job displacement, but the facts are there in black and white on the Department's website.  We are talking about work which was formerly being done by the 9,000 local authority employees across the State who have left that employment.  They are now being replaced by people who will be paid &euro;20 per week for 19.5 hours of work.  That is the fact of the matter.</p><p>  The Department's website also states, &quot;The work opportunities are intended to benefit the local area and are identified and provided by County and City councils&quot;.  Local authorities, the website indicates, are to match the skills of those being offered positions with the work that requires to be done.  A series of Government backbenchers have pointed to this scheme as allowing participants to gain new skills.  There reality is that no new skills will be gained by anybody partaking in a Gateway scheme, because one of the criteria is that local authorities must match the skills of participants with the work that needs to be done.  When a work placement is matched with somebody who has a particular skills set, that individual is not learning any additional skills.  Claims to the contrary that have been spouted from the other side of the House are a falsehood.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara criticised Sinn F&eacute;in and other Opposition Members for belittling the work that will be done by participants in this scheme.  Far from belittling the work these people are being asked to do, we want to reward them by paying them properly for that work.  The only people doing any belittling are Members opposite who support these people being paid &euro;1 per hour.</p></speech>

People in that situation wake up every day dreading the bills the postman will drop through the door and worrying about how they will pay their rent, put food on the table and clothe their children.  That is all the encouragement they need to get back into employment.  In fact, they do not need encouragement; they need a damn job.

According to the criteria, as published on the website of the Department of Social Protection, one cannot avail of part-time work if it interferes with one's Gateway scheme.  Deputy Creed can shake his head, but I am merely referring to what it says on the Department's website.  I am not making this up.  If the Deputy has an issue with that, he can take it up with the Minister for Social Protection.  The reality is that if a person who is working almost four hours a day on this scheme five days a week, to make up the 19.5 hours, is given an opportunity to work on a building site next week to earn &euro;100, which is what they would get for five weeks' work on this scheme, he or she will have to turn it down.</p></speech>

One of the questions in the question and answer document to which I referred relates to whether participants have to adhere to the work that is set out for them when they are first recruited.  The answer makes it clear that there is some flexibility in this regard, as all areas of local authority activity can be considered.  It is not confined to areas which are not currently covered by the present workforce.  All areas of local authority activity can be considered.  I reiterate that those who want to contribute to this debate should inform themselves, rather than spinning falsehoods about what this scheme can and cannot do.</p></speech>

There has been a substantial reduction in staff numbers at local authority level.  I have discussed this with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on many occasions.  Some local authorities have lost up to 25% of their staff over the last four or five years.  That has resulted in huge gaps in services.  Local authorities in some areas are finding it difficult to mobilise crews of outdoor staff.  It has been clear recently that there are shortages in many areas, including housing maintenance, libraries, parks and - critically in the context of the recent storms - road maintenance.  The existing staff that work for local authorities across the country did Trojan work during the storm, especially in light of the resources that are available to them.  I know from the few counties I have contact with that absolutely powerful work was done by short-staffed local authorities.</p><p>  As I have mentioned to the Minister previously, routine maintenance has been absent in some areas.  A small amount of routine maintenance - clearing from gullies and culverts the branches of trees that have been washed downstream - would have prevented some areas from being flooded recently.  We need to start looking at preventative maintenance in this country.  The staff shortage to which I have referred explains why local authorities are being forced to take on 3,000 people under the Gateway scheme.  We saw the same thing when they took on 836 people under JobBridge placements.  It has been argued that this does not result in displacement.  I will explain what happens.  When a worker retires at the age of 65, or 66 as it is now, he or she goes out and is not replaced.  There is displacement through natural wastage, which is an awful term that is used to describe retirement.  If there are fewer positions and fewer workers, there is the same end result.  It does not make any sense.  The staff in the lower grades, as they are called, and the outdoor staff provide critical services in local authority areas.</p><p>  Anyone who took the trouble to read the full Sinn F&eacute;in motion will be aware that it recommends that proper training schemes, alternative activation programmes and intensive community employment schemes should be put in place.  I was involved in running two of these schemes in the late 1990s.  One of them, which was organised by a branch of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, was run on a &quot;rate for the job&quot; basis.  It was the same rate as community employment, but the difference was that one got the rate for the job.  In other words, if one was working side by side with another worker who was getting &euro;15 an hour, one worked for the number of hours needed to clock up one's total pay to that level.  The critical aspect of this scheme was that people got third-level qualifications out of it.  Almost all of them got jobs out of it.  The scheme had a huge success rate.  I want to highlight this.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see good activation and training programmes.  We want educational opportunities to be afforded to people.  I have been involved in this area in the past.  I have seen its benefits.  I benefitted from it myself.  I can see how it works.  I just think this is where we need to be going.</p><p>  Participants in this scheme will receive &euro;20 a week.  It costs money to go to work.  One has to travel to work, bring a lunch and pay PRSI.  When all of that is taken away, some people will lose money.  We do not want to disadvantage people who are already at the pin of their collar.  We want to help such people.  That is what the Sinn F&eacute;in motion is about.  The problem with the Gateway scheme is like the problem with the T&uacute;s scheme.  While the community employment scheme has some good aspects, Sinn F&eacute;in would argue strongly that it should be improved along the lines I have set out.  The problem with this scheme, like the T&uacute;s scheme, is that it does not do anything about activation.  The embargo is making activation in local authority employment impossible.  It is good that the Minister is here as it gives me an opportunity to remind him of the need to lift the embargo.  I appreciate that the state of the public finances means it is impossible for recruitment to be opened fully.  It would make sense at this stage for the embargo to be lifted gradually in crucial areas, such as the local authority sector and the HSE.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  I would like the Government to withdraw this scheme and put in place a proper intensive training scheme with proper activation measures that treats people with a little dignity.  These people have had their noses rubbed in it over the last three to five years.  They have been ground down.  They come into my constituency office all the time.  We need to help them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-03-12a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200063#MMM00100"><p>The Gateway scheme has nothing to do with jobs and everything to do with spin.  On coming into office the Government claimed that job creation was a priority.  Since the Government made that idle promise in 2011, its job creation strategy can be summed up in one word - emigration.</p><p>  It is important to dispel the myths about Gateway.  It is not voluntary; it does not involve training or upskilling; it does not lead to a real job; and it is not about putting something back into the community, as the Taoiseach would have us believe.  Far from being part of the solution, Gateway is part of the problem.  This Government programme is an attack on workers' rights.  While I can somewhat understand why Fine Gael might support this programme, I am shocked at the Labour Party's commitment to this workfare.  It undermines workers' rights by sending message that it is acceptable to pay &euro;1 an hour for someone's labour.  Trade unions must join us and send out a clear message.  Gateway is a shot across the bow of organised labour and we will organise to oppose it.</p><p>  Some 3,000 positions have been identified as available for Gateway.  If 3,000 jobs are waiting to be filled, these jobs should be filled in a transparent and proper fashion.  Gateway forces unemployed people to carry out work for local authorities through the threat of cuts and suspensions to welfare payments.  Gateway is not about creating real sustainable jobs.  There is no structured or formal training involved.  It is expressly intended that the participants will do the work that local authorities can no longer do as a result of the recruitment embargo.</p><p>  In my constituency of Cork East, people are genuinely worried that they may be forced to travel long distances to take up Gateway workfare.  As there is no travel allowance, the extra &euro;20 will have to be spent on travel.  Between Cork City Council and Cork County Council, a total of 325 places need to be filled.  One of my neighbours in Youghal could well be forced to take up a position with Cork County Council in Bantry, which is a total round trip of 262 km and a three-hour journey.  The extra &euro;20 would go nowhere to cover travel costs.  In fact, a person would be far poorer on one of these Gateway placements.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government to abandon the Gateway scheme and instead adopt activation programmes that are based on the principle of equal pay for equal work.  We welcome the passing of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion in Donegal which commits Donegal County Council to not using Gateway placements.  Gateway does not provide for brighter futures for those who are unemployed.  It does not include training or education mechanisms and as such does not enhance the employability of participants.  This reality is sharpened by the fact that local authorities cannot provide sustainable employment opportunities owing to the public sector recruitment embargo.</p><p>  The progressive, sustainable alternative would be to adopt an activation programme that has training and education at its core and which genuinely seeks to enhance the employability of participants.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that job creation must be the centre of our economic recovery.  To do this, we propose to ring-fence the money raised from the wealth tax to ensure every young person in the State can avail of a job or a training place.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes what amounts to a stimulus of approximately &euro;10 billion to be spent over three years.  This would help to create in the region of 100,000 jobs, based on Government estimates of between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs created for each &euro;1 billion invested.  In addition, we would make no further cuts to capital expenditure.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling on the Government not only to abandon the Gateway scheme, but also to abandon the mode of thinking that has produced a series of programmes which has ultimately led to the persecution of unemployed people in this State.  Gateway is nothing more than State-sanctioned slave labour.  It is a product of a Government that wants to massage the unemployment figures to suit its own political and ideological goal.  The Government want to use the recession and high unemployment to drive down wages and reverse any gains made by the trade union movement in the State.  I urge Government Deputies, in particular Labour Party Deputies, to think long and hard before they vote here tonight.  I urge them to support our motion and get focused on real job creation.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors who had the conviction to stand up and be counted, and supported the motion.  Councils across the State will get their chance to vote on similar motions.  Unfortunately, we are hearing that councillors in other local authorities are not similarly disposed.  It is clear that senior party figures have had a word in their ears and told them not to support this type of motion, which is unfortunate.</p><p>  It presents a huge challenge for the management in Donegal County Council.  As I said on that evening, it puts it in conflict with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, the council's management needs to stand with the members of that council who were unanimous in echoing the view of the people of Donegal.  It is important that the management comes down on the side of the people and not on the side of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and abides by the unanimous decision of the council.</p><p>  That council like many others has borne the brunt of cuts not only to services, but also to staff.  In 2008, the council had 1,243 core staff and today it has 810, a cut of 34%.  Some 433 core local authority workers have left that council in the past five years.  The Government in its wisdom has assigned 80 Gateway positions to the council.  This is a lucrative scheme that allows the council to fill posts that cannot be filled because of the recruitment embargo in areas that have not been serviced because of the imposition of the policies of the current and previous Governments.  The council will regard it as an addition to the 84 JobBridge places it has used in recent years, which is the second highest use of the JobBridge scheme among local authorities.</p><p>  My colleagues have pointed out that our motion proposes an alternative scheme, focused on intense training, similar to the community employment scheme.  We are suggesting alternatives despite what Deputy Creed and others might say to the contrary.  We are asking the Government to introduce activation schemes that respect those who are long-term unemployed and provide opportunities, and crucially training for those who are long-term unemployed.  It also needs to be non-compulsory, another area where this scheme fails.</p><p>  An issue that really gets up my nose is the issue of unfairness.  I heard Deputy Creed and others say they would love to give more than &euro;20 to these long-term unemployed, whom the Government is going to force to take up these schemes, but they say they cannot because they say they live in the real world.  I say this to those Deputies, some of whom may be sitting in their offices watching this.  Where was the real world when they had to deal with their super-junior Ministers of State?  Where was the real world for them?  They are on &euro;130,042 per annum.  However, for them, because they got the title of &quot;super-junior&quot; and had the privilege of attending Cabinet meetings with no other responsibility, they got an extra &euro;17,205 - and, of course, one went to Fine Gael and one went Labour.  Where was the real world for them?</p><p> Where is the real world for Richie Boucher on his &euro;839,000, which the Government refused to vote against last year, and he received the exact same pay this year?  Where is the real world for the advisers of the Ministers who bring forward these schemes and who breach their own pay caps?  This is something which really annoys me and many people.  It is disrespectful that the Government has two levels; there are those who need to be protected at all costs and the others who will be forced into these schemes without any training or real financial support.</p></speech>

I could cite many examples of how this has happened not only since the Government took office, but in the preceding years.  This is the mentality which lies behind the Gateway scheme and other such schemes or scams, call them what one will.  This is what is at the back of these schemes dreamed up by the Government which we in Sinn F&eacute;in quite rightly target in tonight's motion.</p><p>  This mentality was very much on show in the debate yesterday when Deputy Jim Daly spoke.  He proudly claimed Gateway as his idea.  Whether this is the case or not, he defended his statement on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, that the scheme gives people an opportunity to learn what it is like to get up in the morning.  He thinks this statement was taken out of context by us because he also mentioned going out to work, being part of a team and working as part of a group.  Last night, Deputy Daly repeated on the D&aacute;il record what he stated on &quot;Prime Time&quot; and it is still, irrespective of the change of setting, patronising and insulting to treat unemployed people, particularly young unemployed people, with contempt.</p><p>  Deputy Daly and others argue many people will be glad to take up places on this Gateway scheme and there will be high demand-----</p></speech>

When the expectations of unemployed people are lowered so much, it is to be expected that some people might welcome such schemes in the lamentable absence of better training, education and employment opportunities.  When Government Deputies point to whatever number of people might be willing participants in the scheme, they conveniently gloss over the compulsion attached to it and the penalties which will apply to those who do not take it up when required to do so.  They wilfully ignore the fact social welfare officers will select candidates for the scheme and not the other way around.</p><p>  Let us be very clear this is neither training nor is it a gateway to employment.  It is a cheap labour scheme.  It sends unemployed people to local authorities to do work many of the 25% of their staff laid off since 2011 would have done and would still be doing today if they were employed.  A scheme offering &euro;20 on top of a dole payment for 19.5 hours per week for 22 months, doing work once done by unionised workers in local authorities, begs the question if this is what the Labour Party has sold its soul for in coalition with Fine Gael.</p><p>  A community development activist in my home county of Monaghan has already done a study on Gateway and similar schemes.  He points out the State is a party to the Forced Labour Convention of 1930 and thus &quot;undertakes to suppress the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms&quot;.  This is what the State signed up to.  The European Convention on Human Rights states, &quot;No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour&quot;.</p><p>  What has the Government learned from schemes already in place?  It has learned nothing from JobBridge where a &euro;50 top-up applied.  Even the top-up is significantly less in the Gateway scheme.  It must go and new measures need to be introduced.</p></speech>

The youth employment scheme in Northern Ireland is a voluntary scheme to get people active before they are forced onto the steps to work scheme.  Initially, no top-up payments to benefits were made until a review was carried out.  Last October, a briefing took place and three Sinn F&eacute;in members were present in the Assembly for a meeting of the Committee for Employment and Learning.  Not one of them asked any questions on employment schemes, let alone why people are being forced - to use their words - onto schemes such as these for less than &euro;20 a week.  I agree with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien that one must be accurate about these schemes.  These are the facts in Northern Ireland and Sinn F&eacute;in should be consistent and implement the same philosophy in the Republic of Ireland if it is seriously interested in having an all-Ireland approach.  Obviously, it has an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach also.</p><p>  It is clear Sinn F&eacute;in has a different political philosophy to Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government.  I welcome this because we want people to be labour participants and gainfully occupied in society and making a contribution rather than doing nothing.  If Sinn F&eacute;in wants people to do nothing, why did it introduce a scheme similar to this in Northern Ireland?  However, it is opposed to this scheme in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>  We were honoured with a mandate from the people and we took it up on the basis that we would do everything we possibly could to get people back to work.  We have made significant progress, but not enough progress because one wants to do a lot more for any citizen who is unemployed.  Schemes are part and parcel of labour activation measures required to get people active in the community, maintain their skills, learn new skills and obtain full-time work.  The Ministers, Deputies Burton and Bruton, are doing this through Pathways to Work and the Action Plan for Jobs.  A total of 60,000 full-time jobs have been created in the past year.  The level of full-time unemployment will have reduced from 15% to 10%-----</p></speech>

This is what Sinn F&eacute;in wants.  The aim is to ensure Ireland's greatest resource, its people, will no longer remain on the live register for lengthy periods without an appropriate offer of assistance from the State in a voluntary way.  In return, individuals will be made aware of the responsibility to commit to a job search and other employment, education or training activities.  This is it, and there is no other hidden agenda which the Deputies opposite would have one believe exists.  If the growth in long-term unemployment is to be halted, and the number of people unemployed for more than 12 months reduced, trends must be reversed.  Put simply, no one who loses his or her job should be allowed to drift with no support into long-term unemployment.</p><p>  Activation policies should seek to increase the employability of jobseekers and encourage them to be more active in their efforts to find work.  In Ireland, we have traditionally adopted a passive approach to supporting jobseekers compared to other OECD countries, so internationally Sinn F&eacute;in is out of step.  One of the consequences of this passive approach was the development of a significant phenomenon of long-term unemployment, even in the midst of an economic boom, and the deskilling of many people in the labour market.  It is even more urgent we address these challenges in the current economic climate.</p><p>  The Government will place 3,000 people on the scheme this year through local authorities.  They will do work which must be done in every community in the country.  The Deputies opposite will make representations to ensure they get their constituents on these schemes.  I can see Deputy Ferris already making representations to Kerry County Council.  The people who will be on the schemes will be the better for it as will the people in the community.  Its environmental enhancement will be to the benefit of many communities.  The Government will do whatever it can to implement measures which will provide a stepping stone to full-time employment.</p><p>We will do so without the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, if necessary.</p></speech>

The unequivocal result is that the employment rate is seriously inflated by the number of people on activation schemes and, conversely, the headline unemployment rate is significantly understated in a similar manner.</p><p>  The recent report from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service considered what the real unemployment rate would be if jobseekers engaged in activation schemes were no longer counted as employed.  It looked at the period ending in the third quarter of 2013 and found that, in the absence of these schemes, the unemployment rate for that quarter would have been 15.9%, not the 13% reported.  The Government's new ecosystem of phoney activation schemes means that the rate of unemployment is a full 3% higher than reported.</p><p>  In the three years since the Government has come to power, 266,000 Irish people have emigrated.  That is over 80,000 people a year, 1,705 people a week, 243 people a day or ten people an hour.  This figure alone is a shocking indictment of the Government's job creation failure.  It is a stark figure and no amount of spin can soften it.  The vast majority of the people in this statistic have been ripped out of their family environment by economic necessity and thrown into an uncertain future abroad.  As far as the Irish economy is concerned, these figures reflect the effective inactivation of 250,000 Irish people by this Government.  Some 127,000 people of working age have emigrated since 2009.  Had these people stayed in the State, the unemployment level would be 19.7%.  If we add this figure to the Government's phoney activation schemes, the unemployment rate increases to 22.6%, double the one promoted by the Government.</p><p>  It is important to say that we in Sinn F&eacute;in are not against activation schemes <i>per se</i>.  However, the ones coming from the Government, such as Gateway, T&uacute;s and JobBridge, are objectionable on a fundamental level.  We are on record with regard to welcoming initiatives such as Intreo and JobsPlus, but with Gateway citizens are getting &euro;1 an hour to work alongside others who are on multiples of that wage for doing exactly the same work, and there is no training involved.  This is a coercive salary swipe.  The Government shed thousands of waged people in local authorities to replace them with 3,000 unwaged people.  It is blatant job displacement.  In fact, this programme costs real jobs in local authorities.</p><p>  While the Government is cynically busying itself massaging the unemployment figures, the real indigenous enterprise sector, the real engine of job creation in this State, has still not experienced the necessary reforms with regard to the dangerously distressed levels of credit provision, the cost of doing business and progressive rates.  Three years since the announcement of the much-heralded strategic investment bank, it is still in limbo, and promises to insulate over 1 million homes have yet to be seen.  Where is the necessary urgency on this issue?</p><p>  A total of 500,000 Irish families are the victims of the Fine Gael-Labour Government's and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government's economic policies.  I ask the Government, for the sake of these people, to focus on energising the real economy and stop massaging these unemployment figures.</p></speech>

It found a few backbench Labour Party Deputies who had not a clue what they were talking about, but the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, could not even attend.  The reason she cannot attend is that not only is this scheme wrong, but she has been misleading the D&aacute;il and the public in regard to it.  I will deal with this first before I go back into all of the other aspects of the Gateway programme.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, has repeatedly claimed in parliamentary debates and in replies to questions that participants will receive a &euro;20 top-up and that, basically, they will be &euro;20 better off.  That is the way she and all of the spin doctors have put it across.  However, she knows full well, yet fails to mention, that many will be far worse off due to taking part in this, and that it could cost some participants money.</p><p>  I received a document from the Department of Social Protection which shattered the Minister's &euro;20 claim.  I had raised concerns about the Gateway scheme because the supposed &euro;20 top-up could potentially be eroded entirely by PRSI.  The Department provided me with a table which specifically outlines each and every payment and which confirmed my fears.  That document demonstrates that the more children a person has who is on Gateway, the smaller the top-up, if any.  For example, after PRSI, an unemployed couple with one child will get a top-up of &euro;5.50 for 19.5 hours work, a parent of three children will get only &euro;3.11 for their week's work, while a parent of five children sees the entire top-up eroded to be only 75 cent.  If the person happens to have more children, it will cost them even more dearly.  There is no &euro;20 top-up.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to explain that to the Minister for Social Protection whenever she appears again.</p><p>  Once we strip away this supposed top-up benefit, it is hard to see what else is left, if there was anything there in the first place.  There is no soft benefit in terms of enhancing participants' employment prospects because, as I and others on this side of the House argued yesterday, this scheme involves no meaningful training and it actively displaces jobs, in particular paid employment opportunities in the local authority sector.  The public service recruitment embargo, which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is still responsible for, along with his Government, means there are no jobs in the context of those who are going to be on Gateway schemes in the host councils.  We also see there is no hard benefit in terms of financial recognition through the supposed wages of &euro;20 they are getting.</p><p>  Last night, I listened to Deputy Jim Daly and we had a bit of banter about it.  I thought he was perhaps a one-off.  However, I then heard the other idiots coming in here tonight to repeat it, which was scandalous.  At least, Deputy O'Mahony had the respect-----</p></speech>

Well-funded community employment schemes are one of the key elements in job activation but the Minister should not forget that his Government has already cut the training and education budget for those same community employment schemes.  Shame on the Government.  We also welcomed the introduction of JobsPlus, which is the subsidy given for the creation of full-time paid positions, but the Minister will not even listen to that.  There are activation schemes that are based on meaningful accredited training as in the case of community employment and much more could be done to enhance community employment and equal pay for equal work in the case of JobsPlus.  We have supported the likes of Springboard and Momentum in most cases.  They are relatively good activation schemes.  However, the bad activation schemes and the ones this Government has been responsible for - T&uacute;s, JobBridge and now Gateway - are not good activation schemes because they intend to punish the victims of the economic crash who will be targeted and compulsorily sent on these schemes.  </p><p>  This Government has misread the mood of the public because this scheme is a step too far even for those whom the Government says might have sat on the fence to date with regard to JobBridge.  Even for them, Gateway is very difficult to swallow because it is low-cost hard labour.  It is workfare and I make no apology for using that terminology.  Deputy Pearse Doherty has outlined how the councillors in Donegal have already acted on behalf of the public and rejected the Gateway scheme and this will happen elsewhere.  I urge the Government, backbenchers and particularly the Labour Party to do likewise and back off the unemployed.  Get off their backs, set up proper schemes and give them training opportunities instead of scams like this which is workfare.  It is an absolute disgrace that any party in Government but particularly the Labour Party would pursue such a scheme.  The Gateway scheme has no structured training, is compulsory, displaces jobs and is a breach of international law, namely, the Forced Labour Convention.  I demand that this Government look at that before it proceeds any further.  Otherwise it will probably end up in an international court.  A good activation scheme is one that does not exploit and displace existing jobs.  A good activation scheme is one that first and foremost offers meaningful training and experience to the participants, enhances their future employability and allows jobseekers to apply.  Shame on the Government.  I appeal to Members to vote for our motion.</p></speech>
