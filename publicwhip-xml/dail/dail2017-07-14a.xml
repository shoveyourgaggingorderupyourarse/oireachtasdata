    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400003#A00600"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>In page 5, to delete lines 16 and 17 and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;(3) This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister for Health may by order or orders appoint either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>The only amendment for consideration this morning seeks to amend section 7 of the Bill and to replace subsection (3) with text that allows for the Minister for Health to commence different sections of the Act on different dates.  This will allow the flexibility required to commence individual sections if they are ready to be commenced before others.  This is a standard piece of text and common to most Bills. </p><p>In the context of allowing for different sections to commence on different dates, I also remind Deputies that I stated on Committee Stage that I thought it likely that I would be bringing forward a small number of amendments on Report Stage.  However, there was not enough time between Committee and Report Stages to interrogate the proposals in the way we must and therefore it is my intention to bring forward any necessary amendments when the Bill goes before the Seanad.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400003#A00700"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his appointment.  This is the first opportunity I have had in the House to do that.  I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for facilitating the Bill which is being debated this morning.  Last year, I was honoured to be appointed Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on mental health.  When I was appointed, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked me to try to ensure real and credible change was brought about in mental health and to co-operate across the floor in trying to do so.  Yesterday, we saw the first step in that with the creation of the first Oireachtas committee on mental health.  Hopefully, today marks the second step.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to face significant challenges in the provision of mental health services and it has been known for many years that major reform is needed.  Too many of the recommendations in the A Vision for Change policy remain to be implemented.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Mental Health (Amendment) Bill before Members contains significant changes to ensure people's civil rights when they receive mental health care.  This Bill is fully supported by Mental Health Reform, an umbrella group which represents over 50 mental health groups.  I thank in particular Dr. Shari McDaid and Ms Kate Mitchell from Mental Health Reform for their relentless and daily pursuit of the cause of mental health reform.  This Bill also contributes to the fulfilment of the Government's international human rights obligations.  Fianna F&aacute;il's mental health Bill aims to reform Ireland's mental health services by insisting on the implementation of a number of the recommendations contained in the 2015 expert review of the Mental Health Act.  Regrettably, only one of those 165 recommendations has been implemented to date.  Demands for mental health services increased over the past six years and we must do more to protect the well-being of patients and to ensure the State meets its obligations under international human rights law.  </p>  <p>  I am hopeful that this Bill will act as a catalyst and I urge all parties and Deputies to support this legislation in order that urgently-needed reforms are implemented without further delay.  Ultimately this mental health Bill is about dignity and respect for patients and it gives them a voice in their mental health treatment.  I am glad to accept the Government's amendment to the Bill, which is a clarifying amendment.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Government and the other parties in the House that have supported the Bill to date.  It is positive to see people from across the political spectrum come together to support the call for better mental health.  The spirit of co-operation in advancing this issue of mental health was here before I came into the D&aacute;il and I am glad that everyone has continued in that spirit today.  I hope this spirit of co-operation will continue.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400003#A00800"><p>I commend Deputy Browne and welcome this legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the amendment as moved by the Minister of State and I join in congratulating him on his appointment to what is a very challenging and important brief.  I have no doubt but that he will go at it with considerable vigour and will bring much positivity to the role.</p>  <p>  Progress in mental health reform has been painfully slow and the challenges are great.  This legislation will be a step in the right direction for many but we all recognise it is merely a single step.  I commend the work of Mental Health Reform and acknowledge its tremendous advocacy on behalf of people with mental health difficulties.  I recognise and commend the many NGOs and community organisations in communities throughout the country that have become the difference between life and death for many people in many circumstances.  The acknowledgment of people's autonomy is the key to advocacy work.  They have the right to make decisions regarding the services they access and the care they need but for too many patients, this has not been their experience.</p><p>Far too many people feel coerced, disempowered and unsupported.  This is how incredibly vulnerable people can feel on admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit in Ireland today.</p> <p> This morning, I want to add my voice, and the voice of my party, to the demand by Mental Health Reform that the Government must now deliver on the recommendations of the expert group on the Mental Health Act.  There is a very real and long-term cost to kicking this can down the road any further.  Individuals and their families will continue to travel an unnecessary path of very deep distress and hopelessness, and this, in a modern country like ours, is absolutely avoidable and absolutely unacceptable.  The human and economic cost is tenfold and society as a whole is all the worst for it.</p> <p> Our State does not have a proud record on how we have treated vulnerable people, so when patients use words like "coerced" to describe their experience of psychiatric inpatient care, we as policy makers, legislators and Ministers need to sit up and take notice.  When I spoke on this legislation during mental health month, I called for advocacy services to be independent and fully resourced.  I argued that these services must be placed on a statutory footing so that every patient is guaranteed codified enforceable legal rights.  Patients must have a statutory right to advocacy, and I repeat this call this morning.</p> <p> Funding for advocacy services must meet demand.  We need a dedicated service for children, and this must be underpinned in law and vigorously enforced.  Research demonstrates that a robust advocacy system can be an empowering and encouraging experience, and, most importantly, a critical aid on the road to recovery.  Having someone in their corner can be everything to people who feel they have reached the end of the road.  It is now time for an ambitious programme of mental health reform, an underpinning of patient&rsquo;s rights and real resourcing of services and supports.  As we approach budget time in the autumn, let it be understood by everyone, particularly those Ministers with their hands on the purse strings, that we need more money.  We simply need more funding for mental health services.</p> <p> I have a word of caution following the establishment yesterday of the Oireachtas committee on mental health, which I welcome.  Committee members will be duty bound to deliver progressive rights-based priorities for mental health, but the committee members will be fighting with two hands tied behind their backs if the Government does not commit itself now to acting urgently on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  The committee cannot be a talking shop.  We want this committee to make a real and substantive contribution to improving mental health services in Ireland.  This can be the case, but we know it will only happen if the Government collectively commits itself to this process.  We welcome and support the legislation.  We will move some amendments in the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400004#B00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on his new position.  I also congratulate my colleague, Deputy James Browne, on bringing forward this very important Bill.  It is clear that our mental health services have been struggling in recent years due to a lack of investment and increasing demand.  We have no on-call service in many counties and, unfortunately, Cavan and Monaghan are two of these counties.  This is shocking and clearly demonstrates the patchy nature of our mental health services.  Vast swathes of the country are left without an effective out-of-hours service.  There has been increased demand for these services in recent years.  Despite this, we continue to underfund our mental health services.  This attitude needs to change, particularly when we consider the demographic changes that Ireland faces in the years ahead.  It is vital that the availability of out-of-hours mental health services for children is spread evenly throughout the country.  Every child should be treated the same and awarded the same services.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has already highlighted that underinvestment in services for children is one of the factors contributing to the continuing high number of admissions of children to adult psychiatric units.  This  practice is one which must come to an end.  The delivery of 24-hour emergency services for children is fundamental in helping to achieve this.  Children and their families find themselves in an unacceptable situation when children must be placed in an adult service.  Help and support needs must be readily available.</p>  <p>  According to the latest figures released, 47% of all positions promised under the national A Vision for Change strategy remain unfilled.  This is 51 posts in the north west alone.  I am deeply frustrated by the lack of urgency in adopting and implementing the A Vision for Change policy.  This strategy was published more than a decade ago, but we are falling well short of the staffing targets set out in it.  The scale of the staff shortages is very worrying.  It is becoming obvious that the service is struggling.  This will have a major impact on the outcomes for children and teenagers who depend on it.  The severity of the staffing shortages in CAMHS is unsustainable and, as a result, children and teenagers are at risk. There is still no out-of-hours service available for young people in the north west, and there is no timeline or target in place for one to be established.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State needs to take charge of this situation and fulfil the commitments made in A Vision for Change.  The time has come to step up to the mark and deliver the policies recommended in the strategy.  There are countless reports of children and young adults seeking support, especially during out of hours periods.  There is no one there to help or support them when they need it most.  We cannot allow vulnerable children and teenagers to be put aside any longer.  We need to see action on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400004#B00300"><p>I commend the Bill and Deputy Browne on bringing it forward.  I have said many times in the House there is no colour, class, creed or religion, and there should be no politics, when it comes to mental health and suicide prevention, because it affects everybody across the board.  We truly have an absolutely huge amount of work to do to improve the protection of the rights of patients.  This Bill goes a small but important way towards that goal.  It should be the beginning of a process, which is immediately followed by the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and all the reform thereafter to live up to that convention.  It is too long coming and we will not stand for any more undue delays.</p>  <p>  I ask that everyone in the House join me in this demand, especially members of Fianna F&aacute;il who have the ear of Cabinet.  A lot of work has been done to highlight the deficiencies in existing legislation by groups such as Mental Health Reform, which published an excellent point by point response to the expert group on the Mental Health Act, but even this expert review was largely ignored, with just one of the 165 recommendations implemented, as has been mentioned in the House already, and no expression of intent from the Government to change it.</p>  <p>  I said on Second Stage that we need an overhaul of patients' rights and an end to the violation of the human rights of patients in mental health services, as well as an end to the paternalistic system that places the final say in the planning of care in the hands of psychiatrists, regardless of the wishes of patients.  Involuntary patients do not necessarily lack capacity, which in itself is a somewhat problematic concept.  Involuntary patients deserve to be treated with dignity, respect and equality.  We would also like to see the inclusion of a statutory right for all people who enter an approved centre, voluntarily or otherwise, to be supported in drafting advanced health care directives that place consent and honesty at the centre of care.  We have an amendment on this which we will push on Report Stage in the Seanad.  I have spoken to the Minister of State on this topic, and I hope it can find support across the House, and I appeal to the House now as we need to improve services.  It is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the Bill published by Deputy Browne.</p>  <p>  I make a plea to the Minister of State, and especially to Fianna F&aacute;il, which holds great sway over the Government.  Do not settle for crumbs.  We need major investment in our services, as has been spoken about.  Those problems that are most acute are due to underfunding.  We have been stressing funding, but it is very simple: if we do not have all of the ingredients of the cake we cannot make the cake.</p><p>It is not rocket science.  I ask the Ministers, Deputies and all those listening to spend the next few months convincing people within their own parties and within the Government.  A figure of &euro;15 million or some other paltry sum does not do enough.  As it merely keeps the system standing still, we need more investment.  This is more important than any deal the parties do.  We will deal with the politics in the Chamber but when we are dealing with people, we must invest in our future.  It might be our children or, please God, our grandchildren.  We need to create a better, more educated and safer society where people do not get to a point where they have lost faith in the system, their own lives and their families and want to end it.  It should never happen.  We have a duty as legislators to drive this as far as we can.  If, some day, each one of us, not as legislators but as human beings, can stand here and say proudly that we supported this, we did the right thing and we saw it grow and come to fruition, everybody inside and outside the House can be very proud.  One of the most important things in life is that no member of any family should bury their children.  No child should end up having no faith in life.  They should be looking forward to living it to the fullest.  Again, it comes back to this Bill.  We must drive it forward.  If we are not clear in this regard, we will know it is our choice but, more importantly, it is the choice of the parties in Government.  We should remember that people will not be forgiving if we get this wrong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400005#C00150"><p>I have no issue with the amendment, which is common enough.  On the other amendments, the Minister of State indicated he did not have time.  I congratulate him on his appointment.  It is one of the Taoiseach's better appointments.  I think Deputy Jim Daly will make a very good Minister of State and I wish him the best.  I presume the amendments he intends to bring forward will not change the Bill substantially as otherwise they should probably be brought before this House before coming back but I presume they will not.  </p>  <p>  I congratulate Deputy Browne and his party on this very good Bill.  I do not believe in "new politics" but this is an example of something we can all support.  I was very much taken by a small nugget in Deputy Browne's speech when he said that there are many advocates for the change we are making here - those who came before the Deputy and those who came before me and, dare I say it, all of us here.  I know and appreciate what the Deputy meant by that.  He is dead right.  Many people before us have advocated for this change because ultimately, this Bill is about dignity, human rights and, most of all, autonomy.  It is a welcome change we in the Labour Party support and believe needs to be implemented in full.  It is about giving people respect, it is about dignity and it is about changing the way we treat and think about people.  It is a very good Bill.  </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas committee is all well and good but it cannot be a talking shop.  It actually has to do something.  I know because I have been part of many of these things previously.  I want the Minister of State to act rather than participate and I believe he will.  I congratulate and thank all those organisations that have been advocates for this change and further changes that will not be part of this Bill but for which they continuously advocate on behalf of people who suffer from mental health issues.  Let us be honest about it.  There is not a single family in Ireland, including my own, that has does not have members with mental health issues.  The people who advocate on behalf of those people are powerful people.  They are great people and I acknowledge them today.  </p>  <p>  A Vision for Change is a policy that needs resources to be implemented.  While everyone has talked about resources here, the lack of staff - the lack of positions being filled - across the country is deeply worrying.  We need to find out what is going on.  Sometimes we all say it is an issue of finance but I am not sure this is the case in this situation.  What is going on here with regard to filling the positions across the country?  We are all public representatives and we all try to help those who come into our clinics every week but I often find that the reason people cannot get help is because there are no people there to help them.  I do not believe it is actually about finance and funding these positions.  What can we do to ensure that these positions are filled to help the people who need help?  If the Minister of State could be honest with us and tell us that it is really about getting people who are qualified into those positions and that it is not about bureaucracy or money, it will be easy for us to explain because I believe that could be the reason.  </p>  <p>  The second issue concerns facilities across the country.  Part of A Vision for Change involves providing facilities across the country.  I represent Tipperary, which simply does not have facilities.  I am not alone in this regard as other Members are in a similar situation.  The principle of A Vision for Change is right but we lack the facilities on the ground to help people.  This must be considered and addressed and we need to rethink this a little because while the principle of the strategy is right, the actual facilities are not there.  </p>  <p>  What is going on with regard to filling positions because, ultimately, that is the most important issue?  Every week, I hear from people with family issues and concerns.  We simply do not have the professionals in the system to help these people.  I speak to senior people in the HSE and across the board.  I do not think it is a willingness issue.  I do not always want to come in here and give out because I do not think it is a willingness issue.  I think they are willing and wish to help but we do not have the people in the system if there are only 24 hours in a day.  Consequently, we should figure out what is the logjam issue here and if the Minister of State can help with that in the next few months, he certainly will make a huge improvement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400005#C00200"><p>I also wish the Minister of State well in his new position, as well as complimenting my colleague, Deputy Browne, on bringing forward this Bill and on the excellent work he is doing.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State is flanked by Deputy Neville, whose father ploughed a lone furrow for many years on this issue.  This must be recognised in this House.</p>  <p>  It is important that we get this issue into primary schools.  It is both an education and a health issue and we must integrate education and health.  We should look seriously at making mental well-being a compulsory part of the primary school curriculum because this issue needs to be tackled at a very early age and there is no better place than primary school.  I would like this to progress.  Possibly the relevant committee could look at those processes.  </p>  <p>  As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, I note that mental health formed a very large part of its report.  Some of the submissions we received were appropriate and pertinent.</p><p>The submission of Galway Early Years is that one of the most effective ways of tackling the mental health epidemic now and for future generations is to focus on improving mental health from the very beginning, given how significant this period is in laying the psychological foundations of later life.  Another submission came from Children in Hospitals Ireland.  In recent years, despite the publication of A Vision for Change, mental health services for children have not shown any notable improvement.  A submission from Mental Health Reform represented the views of particular groups, including the homeless, those with a co-morbid diagnosis of mental health difficulties and intellectual disability and those with a dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and substance misuse experience significant challenges in assessing appropriate care.  That is a snapshot of the difficulties that exist.  All Members know they exist.  Our job is to fund and co-ordinate a proper level of integrated services with money being spent wisely.  People have come to my constituency clinics seeking counselling for their children who are on six-month waiting lists.  When a child presents with a mental health issue, that need is immediate and must be tackled.  There are many very good organisations such as Jigsaw, Pieta House and so on which do excellent work but they need to be co-ordinated and linked in.  It is the job of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and the House to ensure that happens.</p> <p> The EU average percentage spend on mental health is that approximately 12% of the mental health budget goes to mental health facilities while in Ireland it is half that figure.  That needs to be increased.  If the Government invests in this area, there will be significant savings in the system further up the line because hospitalisations and so on will be prevented.</p> <p> I agree wholeheartedly with the point made by Deputy Kelly regarding positions and vacancies.  A constituent of mine is a qualified counsellor who studied as a mature student and cannot get a position in the HSE despite being told that it is crying out for counsellors.</p></speech>

The positions are there but they are not there and there are no interview processes.  The Minister of State could spearhead that issue in his early time in his Department and get it sorted out.  If staff are in position, there is a chance of getting people treated.</p>  <p>  Once a person who is experiencing difficulties reaches the age of 18, he or she is in a different category.  He or she is the same person with the same problems but the transfer is very difficult for him or her.  There needs to be a seamless transition from a child to an adult service which is not currently in place.  That needs to be considered.</p>  <p>  I hope to sit on the committee.  The Minister of State will have my full support.  It is the job of all Members to get this area properly funded and serviced.  I look forward to working with Deputy Browne, the Minister of State and other Members in getting this issue tackled in a proper setting and dealt with in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400006#D00400"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this very important subject and I congratulate Deputy Browne on his very important work and the Minister of State on his appointment.  I wish him and the committee well.  Mental health is a very intricate subject with which every Member has had some dealings in his or her constituency.  It is still very much an enigma in some cases and, when something happens, people often ask why it has occurred.  They ask themselves whether they should have been more alert, spotted something sooner and whether there should be more support facilities.  Every person in public and private life can become an advocate in the area of mental health without imposing their inquisitiveness on others by being alert and confidential in terms of dealing with and advising people in a helpful rather than critical way.  That applies to individual households and affects young children.</p>  <p>  A couple of years ago, I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue and was shocked to discover the number of children under ten and between ten and 14 who had self-harmed and been referred to accident and emergency departments on more than one occasion.  That indicates a need to address the subject and follow it up, which is hugely important.</p>  <p>  All Members have had dealt with situations in recent years involving economic pressures arising from house repossession and people who are stressed by dealing with mortgages and mortgage arrears.  The mental health of some people throughout the country has been detrimentally affected by the downturn in the economy.  The doubt, insecurity, concern and worry of people about their futures was hugely exacerbated by the economic situation that developed.  Unfortunately, many people succumbed to that.  As Deputy Browne said, support facilities need to be alert, constant and accessible around the clock in a way in which people can rely upon them and avail of them without further stress being caused by having to search for services.  All Members have dealt with people who required services and sometimes felt those services were not as available as they ought to be.</p>  <p>  Other people require ongoing treatment.  One problem is that some people need supervision and some do not.  Supervision should be put in place for those who need it for medication because there is a difficulty if they do not take their medication, if it is not available or if it is not clear that an effort must be made to take it.  Everyone tends to take the easier route no matter where they are in life, but that does not work in this situation.  I hope that we will build upon the unfortunate experiences we have had in recent years and previously and try delicately and sensitively to put in place the support services required as the need arises.</p>  <p>  It is an honour to be here in the presence of Members who have shown an interest in this issue.  Former Deputy Dan Neville spent many years highlighting this subject.  It is to his credit that he kept a focus on it throughout his political life.  Approximately 20 years ago, the focus was rightly changed from institutional care to community care.  The only problem was that community services were not provided to the extent required.  The effects of that are still being felt.  Many of the housing problems that exist result from one service being scaled down for good reason, but the support and replacement service not being put in place or is insufficient.  Members should realise that in a situation when an individual of any age feels threatened or insecure and is worried about the future, he or she needs a pillar to lean against and something to draw upon.  To be stabilised, he or she needs the strength of an institution or society that can be relied upon.  He or she needs security.  That has not been provided, which is a sad reflection on our society.  We ask ourselves why these things continue to happen and reflect poorly on society.  We have to bite the bullet and provide the resources.  It is costly.</p><p>We are going to have to do that now.  If we do not, we will find ourselves in years go come still dealing with the same situation and asking ourselves why does this problem of mental health issues and instability not go away.</p> <p> There will always be societal pressures on people to a greater or lesser extent depending on their particular economic situation.  I go back to what I said in the beginning, and what others said as well, on the question of support.  Put in place something that is reliable and supportive for people and that they are secure and happy with and that we do not pull the plug on as economic circumstances change.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Browne for bringing it forward.  Indeed, d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire St&aacute;it freisin.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for accepting this amendment and for having cross-party agreement.  We all know how difficult and how challenging it is.  Indeed, Deputy Durkan mentioned the former Deputy, Dan Neville, who was a wonderful champion.  While I was in this House, up to the last election, he was always - he still is - an advocate and did tremendous work.</p>  <p>  It is a sensitive and delicate issue.  It is the poor relation within the HSE.  We had great expectations back when I was a member of Deputy Browne's party and the then Minister of State, for Deputy John Moloney, brought forward A Vision for Change.  It involved a lot of planning.  I suppose A Vision for Change was the appropriate phrase but, unfortunately, it has not delivered.  We were sceptical at the time.  The ring-fenced budget, famously, of &euro;50 million, for several years was never ring-fenced by successive Ministers.  We were always told it was ring-fenced but it was not and it was taken off and put into different areas year after year.  I remember being here when it was voted through, changed and amended and that is not good enough.</p>  <p>  We all hear in our clinics and in phone calls every day of the week from distressed parents of youngsters and teenagers about the lack of services.  We ourselves meet people who present to us.  We are not - certainly speaking for myself I am not - adept at dealing with people in those situations.  One picks up the phone or goes to whatever index to contact whoever one thinks one should ring and there are no services and certainly none after hours.</p>  <p>  We see the situation with the CAMHS issue with young children and teenagers.  It is a vulnerable age, anywhere between eight, nine and 14, 15 or 16 years.  It is terrible: parents come in who do not know where to turn, living through hell and fear, and on 24-7 watch.  There is desperation that they cannot get services.  They cannot get appointments.</p>  <p>  In my area in south Tipperary we had a fine mental hospital, St. Luke's, which was closed.  It covered all the county long-term.  Many of those patients - I still meet them out in the community - are doing fine but some, quite frankly, did not do fine.  One cannot decide that people who have been institutionalised for so many decades will live in a community setting, because they are not able to adapt.  It is a huge challenge.</p>  <p>  Then we had a short-stay facility, St. Michael's, which was attached to St. Joseph's.  A 40-bed unit, it was a life-saver for people from all over Tipperary.  It also was unceremoniously closed.  The former Minister of State, Ms Kathleen Lynch, at the time would not listen to anyone - the patient advocates, patients themselves who came up who were good ambassadors who had recovered and may have slipped in there as a fall-back place for some therapy and treatment once or twice a year.  That was a wonderful unit of 40 beds.  They abolished it.  They just closed the doors on it, with no services provided.  There were promises of services from a couple of community teams but they were not recruited.  This is the shameful part of it.  Deputy Kelly stated he did not think it was about money.  I do not know what it is.  If it is not money, it is downright carelessness and borders on blackguarding.</p>  <p>  We were told to go to Kilkenny.  People from Tipperary at the Limerick border were told to go to Kilkenny with no transport, no way of getting in and no beds in Kilkenny.  Then all the patients have to present to an accident and emergency unit, which is totally unsuitable with the chronic situation there.  If they are not in the best of form and have mental issues or any kind of psychotic attack, that is not the place to have them.  They are traumatised enough and the nurses are under enough pressure.</p>  <p>  Then there was a private taxi service that would being them.  A number of nurses would travel with them, if somebody presented with a psychotic attack.  That was pulled by email on a Friday evening.</p>  <p>  Now if they present themselves voluntarily at 5.30 p.m. any evening - if it is a Friday evening I do not know what they will do - they have to sit on a chair in the hospital until 9 a.m. the following morning until an ambulance arrives.  The garda fills in if it is an involuntary admission, but they have not the time either.  Therefore, there are no services in south Tipperary.</p>  <p>  I salute those who are involved in the services but it is so sad.  I wish this committee, chaired by Deputy Harty from the Rural Independent Group, well.  I honestly do.  We need to get them doing their work but we need to come in then, put our money where our mouth is and re-evaluate where A Vision for Change failed.  We have all these wonderful schemes - Deputy Mary Butler informed me that the Minister has now agreed to look at the cardiac situation in Waterford again and setting up a review - but we need to see these reviews, who is on them or who is giving them their riding instructions.</p>  <p>  A Vision for Change was a lovely document.  I am sure a lot of time and expert analysis went into it but it has not worked.  It could not work when we did not put the riders on board - we did not give it the staff.  We had funding there and it was not ring-fenced.  It was taken off for other areas in health.  Health is just gobbling up funding.</p>  <p>  It behoves us all because, as Deputy Kelly stated, there is not a family, parish, village or townland that has not somebody somewhere who is affected.  Increasingly, with the pressures that are on people now, it will be harder and harder.</p>  <p>  For young people especially, they need a fair start in life.  It is shameful.  We all must hang our heads in shame and accept that we have not demanded enough.  We have not fought enough for it.  We have not just kicked up enough of a row about it.  It is the same with people with disabilities who came up yesterday and were out here again.  They are neglected.</p>  <p>  Those are not, I suppose, glossy or nice issues, but they have to be confronted.  We have to police the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on the funding and that the appointments will be filled.  We see loads of advertisement and then we never see the places filled.  One is told one will wait three months or four months and when one goes back the next time, one hears the place has not been filled and someone retired, is out on leave or sick leave and one waits 12 months or 15 months which is totally unacceptable.  One should not be waiting 12 days for those kind of services, or 12 hours in some cases.  The services are just not there.  People are ending up in suicidal situations with many, many good lives destroyed, families tormented and huge trauma visited on a family and the community.</p>  <p>  We need to deal with this amendment - it is being accepted - and move forward in a positive manner.</p></speech>

It is, I am sure, a difficult time for them when this matter is discussed.</p>  <p>  It is also appropriate that Deputy Brassil mentioned the outstanding contribution of Dan Neville, both as a Senator and a Deputy.  I can remember many years ago listening to that in many respects lone voice constantly speaking on the issue and doing enormous work to help people.</p>  <p>  The contribution in recent years of Senator Joan Freeman and Pieta House must also be recognised.  We have a huge movement now in Darkness into Light walks with thousands of people all over the country joining that campaign.  Also, the former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, put extraordinary work into that report some years back.  I watched him debate and he was so passionate about that.  It was Deputy McDonald initially said we have to think of all these people who are not involved in the system, who are not being paid for work in the system but who just got up and did something because of their concern on the issue.</p>  <p>   No doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who I wish well, will take on this issue and give it everything.</p>  <p>  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Browne.  Since Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin appointed him, he has put many hours and days of work in to bringing this matter forward.</p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to the difficulties in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway.</p><p>An external review has been taking place for over 15 months and several deadlines have been missed.  In fairness to the HSE, it has made contact with the people who have been carrying out the review.  One point being made by them to the HSE is that so many people want to make a contribution to the report that they have been overwhelmed.  I do not want to pre-empt or prejudge the outcome of the report but I guarantee it will result in a lot of debate and talk in this House and throughout the country.</p> <p> Many people cannot get services and have been turned away.  I acknowledge that many people in the system are trying hard to help families.  I know of a family, including a parent, that drove to five hospitals only to be told at each that the hospital could not deal with the problem.  Eventually, it ended in tragedy at a health centre.  We always use the word "closure" when a report comes out.  There is never closure for families on this issue.  For those who lost somebody 20 or 30 years ago, there is never closure.  Many families will say the pain does not go away.  As already said, the questions are always asked among families and individuals, who ask why the person did what he or she did.  </p> <p> I am convinced a few simple things could help many people.  The art of talking or conversation has disappeared.  Social media bears significant responsibility in this regard.  Perhaps sometimes we, as adults, dismiss youngsters and tell them not to worry about what they are worried about but five minutes of conversation could change the focus of their minds.  Many more people than we imagine feel rejected.  It might be that engaging in the art of conversation would change everything for them.  That is vital.  We have silent conversation now because of social media in many respects.  There can be no such thing as silent conversation because it does not work.</p> <p> St. Brigid's in Ballinasloe is closed.  The services in Galway city are very poor for the region.  We do not have an adequate service at Roscommon hospital.  As others have mentioned, there is a gap between younger people and adults.  People are falling through the net at that stage, which I acknowledge the Minister of State understands well.  We are on a new plane in this regard as everyone in this House, irrespective of the side, wants this matter to improve.  We will not solve every problem but we must reach out to all people who are looking for the proper services and for staff to be put in place.  Perhaps we should consider more drop-in centres.</p> <p> Organisations such as For&oacute;ige, youth groups and Macra na Feirme have done considerable work in bringing young people together through their activities.  I would like to see the Government giving further support to such groups.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing this Bill before the House.  Unfortunately, no neighbourhood in the country has not experienced the horror of suicide.  I wish to focus on early intervention, which is crucial.  It can do an awful lot to alleviate the problem and influence the allocation of resources.  There is a crisis in the mental health service.  As with other Deputies, I have experienced that in my constituency.  The service is not improving but unfortunately continues to decline.  The workload for staff is increasing.  This is due to a lack of funding in the correct areas, especially early intervention.  There is confusion in the service, with roles not clearly defined.  On many occasions, patients are being referred to general practitioners or the Garda before the HSE is willing to engage with them.  They are ultimately the responsibility of the HSE.</p>  <p>  An after-hours crisis telephone service, whereby one can telephone a nurse, is available only until 3 a.m. but a patient in crisis can present at any hour of the day or night.  There is lack of proper communications systems at place at ground level in the HSE, and there is no proper use of the technologies available in other parts of the HSE.</p>  <p>  It is possible for a family member to commit a person to hospital.  The family often meets reluctance, be it from Shannon Doc, Caredoc or even HSE staff, because of their lack of knowledge of the patient.  A family member who has managed to commit a person to hospital can find it virtually impossible to have that person removed from that situation although the understanding and knowledge of the family member would make him or her best qualified to act in such cases.</p>  <p>  Sadly, the mental health service will allow a patient under care to go to the stage of becoming maniacal, which results in disruptive or destructive behaviour.  This becomes a safety issue for the patient and other members of the public.  Early intervention can avert crises in many cases and it is ultimately better for the patient and more cost-effective for the HSE.</p>  <p>  We all know someone in our community who is affected and the turmoil it brings to the family and community cannot be overstated.  Therefore, we must make change to ensure the most effective outcome for all.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on my constituency.  Two other Tipperary Deputies have spoken here this morning.  The lack of services in our county is absolutely frightening.  I understand that more Jigsaw projects are to be rolled out in the near future and I urge the Minister of State to ensure Tipperary gets one of those projects because this form of early intervention is vital.  It is impossible to imagine that a county the size of Tipperary has no psychiatric bed.  People in the south of the county must go to Kilkenny and people in the north of the county must go to Ennis, where accommodation is not available.</p>  <p>  A mental health clinic in my town services 34,000 people.  It is not properly staffed or resourced.  The scarcity of mental health services in our county is absolutely frightening.  I urge the Minister of State to take particular cognisance of my constituency and to try to devote some resources to it.  I would welcome the Jigsaw project as one of the first steps in ensuring that we start to rebuild the proper services in our county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400008#F00300"><p>I thank Deputy Browne for introducing this Bill.  I wish the Minister of State all the best in his new role.  Having worked with him in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, I know where he comes from.  He is visionary.  When he puts his mind to something, he delivers on it.  I expect the same regarding mental health.  It is great to see Deputy Neville in the Chamber because he is also a member of the committee.  The committee places great emphasis on children, youth and mental health.  One of the first items on the committee's agenda for the autumn is mental health.  This comes on the back of the Minister of State's view, expressed when he was Chairman, that the committee should focus on mental health, children and early intervention.  It is opportune for us this morning to focus the Minister of State's mind on what the committee, my party and I would like as we enter the recess in light of our position in the supply and confidence agreement.  We request support across all parties and none in securing early intervention, which is essential for children.  If we spend on early intervention, we will make savings a long way into the future.</p>  <p>  CAMHS is at crisis point, as the Minster of State knows.  Everybody has alluded to staffing.  Up to last April, 84 CAMHS posts were still not filled nationwide.  I compliment the Galway CAMHS team because it is doing so well in recruiting.  One must ask oneself, however, whether there are gatekeepers in the HSE who simply are not letting the people in.  People are actually applying for the jobs.  I know that myself.  It is okay being a gatekeeper but not at the expense of young people or anybody's life.  We need the staff working in the industry.  We are receiving some of the best curricula vitae but we are not recruiting.</p><p>We are advertising.  We are doing all we should be doing but we are not putting bums on seats or putting people in front of patients to look after them.  One of my suggestions relates to GP care.  We have a GP intervention system for adults but we do not have one for children.  GPs are the clinicians and they are on the front line.  Parents do their very best and it takes a lot for a mother or father to come to the point of presenting at a GP surgery when his or her son or daughter is in crisis.  If the clinician identifies that an immediate intervention is required, I need to know there is a dedicated phone line so parents can contact the local CAMHS team directly and get an on-the-spot referral.  I am not talking about an accident and emergency intervention or writing a letter of referral to CAMHS.   There has to be a mechanism to get somebody straight on the road to intervention.</p> <p> I am also talking about 24-hour crisis support.  There has to be an on-call support service for GPs and it cannot be just the accident and emergency route.  When I talk about crisis intervention, there are 45 beds in Galway outside of CAMHS.  There are eight CAMHS beds and 45 in the hospital.  Referring a child to accident and emergency to put them in an adult ward is not the way we should be doing business.  The Minister of State and I both know it is not.  We need to ensure that GPs are supported so they can make the correct interventions and have the right signposts to get the right support for families.  It is crucial work which every GP in the country would welcome.  It goes back to the plan for supporting communities.  It would support families.  When we talk about children and early intervention, CAMHS is dealing with crisis cases.  Every case that comes before CAMHS involves a crisis.  Yet there are 2,400 children waiting to get to be seen by CAMHS.  The figures are startling.  The Minister of State has the budget.  Hopefully, this year we will see that &euro;35 million budget.  If the Minister of State cannot spend the budget within the realms of the HSE because of staffing and recruitment issues and how long it takes to resolve such issues, let us work with the advocacy groups because they are best positioned.  Many advocacy groups have trained clinicians working with them for them and they have good teams.</p> <p> Deputy Cahill referred to Jigsaw in Tipperary.  Jigsaw also operates in Galway and I can tell the Minister of State about the wonderful work it is doing.  It is doing outreach work because we are trying to open an outreach unit in Gort in south Galway.  Jigsaw has the base and it knows how matters work.  People voluntarily walk into Jigsaw offices.</p> <p> I wish to talk about the youth work counselling service in Galway.  The Minister of State was very good to us.  In the past week, he has shown his leadership in the area of mental health.  He heard us debate the issue here during Topical Issues.  Within a week we were in front of the HSE and by yesterday the email was back on our desk saying it will be supported.  I will ask the Minister of State's Department to talk to the other Departments and to learn to engage with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE.  They should all work together because the joined-up thinking is missing.  The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, understand the point of such thinking.  Perhaps we need to get that understanding further down the ranks within the Departments and among the officials in order to break down the bureaucracy.  We have to start working together.  The Youth Work Ireland project in Galway was on its final lap until the issue was raised in the House.  It was the Minister of State's intervention and that of the CEO of the HSE in Galway that pulled it out of the fire.  I thank the Minister of State for that.  I wish him well.  Early intervention has a huge part to play.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on his elevation.  I worked with the Minister of State on the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  I look forward to working with him.  I acknowledge Deputy Browne for bringing this forward.  When he contacted me about it a number of months ago, I believed it was a no-brainer.  I sit on the cross-party mental health group.  We have all tried to work apolitically on this issue.  There is a spirit of that within the group.  I understand politics will creep in from time to time.  We are politicians who belong to political parties so we have to call it how it is.  I will be mindful of my comments and sensitive in my speech for those in the Gallery and those watching proceedings.  I thank Mental Health Reform for its guidance and help over the past year since I have been on the cross-party group.  I thank Deputies for and acknowledge their comments regarding the former Deputy, Dan Neville.  He would not want extra credit for this.  He just saw it as part of doing his job as an elected Member.</p>  <p>  Today is a watershed in driving this debate.  I welcome that we will have a joint Oireachtas committee on this.  It will be something with a bit of teeth so we can start getting stuck in, obtain some quick wins and send a message to the electorate that we are trying to tackle this as best we can.  It is a very complex area.  The biggest challenge is that it is dynamic.  The issues that put pressure on people today were not issues ten or 15 years ago.  Social media is an example.  It can be very positive but there is also a negative side to it.  There are also cultural changes.  Reference has been made to younger people.  When I speak to teenagers, I take heart from their attitude and perception of mental health.  Their openness to it is very different from generations ahead of them.  We have to take heart from that.  We have to take that seed and allow it to germinate.  As part of the committee's work, we have to start listening more to younger groups - such as Macra na Feirme and For&oacute;ige - and the ideas they put forward.  Younger people come at this matter from a completely different perspective than we tend to do.  I will speak for how my generation is approaching it.  We have come from a time when it was brushed under the carpet to a point whereby we now speak openly about it.  It is all part of eradicating stigma.  We have to keep concentrating on eradicating stigma.  There has been much work done on this issue in recent years but it is still prevalent.  We need to gather intelligence on where it is most prevalent.  Is it a generational, cultural or socioeconomic thing?  We need to get that intelligence and data to be able to formulate policies to tackle it.</p>  <p>  The other matter we need to address - I have been doing a lot of work on this - relates to co-morbidity and dual diagnoses.  It is an area we need to tackle.  There is growth in that area.  There is a lack of understanding on joined-up thinking on it.  There is a "No Wrong Door" policy in respect of dual diagnosis in north Tipperary and Limerick.  There are some working documents on that.  There is a multidisciplinary team from both sides because what happens is the patient falls between two stools when it comes to dual diagnosis.  Is it the substance or is it a mental health problem?  That has been a challenge all along.  There is a document on the policy and there is also a working group.  If we put the resources in, we can use that policy and find the positives and start to roll it out.  It is a huge challenge.</p>  <p>  To return to the issue of young people, there has been a growth in drug culture in Ireland that was not there before, particularly in the context of synthetic drugs.  We need to drive education in that area.  I have looked at the drugs strategy.  We need to stop shying away from that area and look at educating young people on what is happening on the street and the challenges they will face.  Education on mental health, cultural change and the use of drugs is key.  We need to tackle this issue head-on.</p>  <p>  I welcome that there has been a drop of nearly 20% in the suicide rate over the past six years.  We still need to get the figures relating to why that is happening.  Are preventative methods responsible?  Is it just that there is intervention taking place at the final point?  Limerick Suicide Watch, which has just received charitable status, does a huge amount of work in Limerick.  Intervention is happening there at crisis point.  Is the drop in the suicide rate due to intervention at crisis point or is it a result of preventative measures?  We need the intelligence on that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the work Jigsaw is doing in Limerick.</p>  <p>  The cross-party committee worked extremely well.</p><p>I want to see that work continue.  I want to send a message from the D&aacute;il to our younger people.  As our younger people do not vote, other Members and I probably do not engage with them as much and they do not see that engagement as much.  Those younger people, particularly teenagers, from their perspective have different ideas from mine because I come from a different generation and background.  That really needs to be tapped into.  They have ideas on the use of other methodologies and treatments, such as the creative arts and sports, and moving away from the clinical approach.  While we need both, we need a philosophical debate on the creative arts and what they can do.</p> <p> Deputy Eugene Murphy mentioned the art of conversation and that people do not talk.  What is more, the sense of community has broken down.  Sporting organisations and artistic organisations can bring that sense of community back.  Our focus should not be geographical because we move around much more, but should be on interest areas.  This is probably more of a philosophical debate that we should have in the committee as well, but we need to start sending those messages out there because they are messages of hope.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1303" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400010#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Browne for introducing the Bill.  I wish the Minister of State all the best in his new role.  I really hope he makes a difference because there is scarcely a person in this House who has not been touched in some way by suicide.  Scarcely any family has not experienced suicide or some form of mental health issues.</p>  <p>  The rate of suicide in this country, particularly among young people from 14 to 30, is one of the highest in Europe and the world.  We have not gauged the full extent of suicide in this country because there are many deaths on roads that could be attributable to suicide and there are no statistics to back that up.</p>  <p>  One of the biggest problems I have encountered is people being turned away from hospitals.  That has been an absolute disaster.  I have experienced it many times.  My son is in the psychiatric services at the moment and I am fairly familiar with the process that takes place.  The mechanism of reporting by going to a hospital accident and emergency department first has proved to be very difficult.  Another mechanism is for people to go into Garda stations.  That can be problematic because often no psychiatrist is at hand.  A psychiatrist could be covering ten Garda stations and by the time he gets there the person might have calmed down and ends up getting released, which is an absolute tragedy.</p>  <p>  Many young people have ended up in adult facilities, which is scandalous.  There are issues with the welfare of children and we cannot allow that to continue.  We need to have facilities to deal with that.  I have never seen so many young people, especially young women, in the psychiatric services.  I have been there constantly over a number of years.  Recently I have noticed a huge surge in the number of young women, which is very worrying.</p>  <p>  In one case a person actually ended their life in hospital while there for psychiatric reasons.  It was an absolute tragedy and how it happened is another matter.  I have come across many cases of people being turned away.  A young lad was turned away even after his mother pleaded for him to be kept in the psychiatric services.  Unfortunately when the woman left, the young lad was let out.  He was found two weeks later; he had killed himself unfortunately.  It is one of many tragedies we have all come across.</p>  <p>  It is not just a lack of money; other things can be done.  We need major investment.  We obviously do not have enough front-line staff.  It is also clear that we do not have enough psychiatrists.  It is noticeable that the number of nurses and people leaving the psychiatric services is higher than in any other health service area.  We need to find out what is driving people out of those services.</p>  <p>  Sometimes even basic things such as blankets and pillows are not available and patients cannot get those extra items in the hospital.  Such things should never happen when one is dealing with people who are very vulnerable.</p>  <p>  In terms of dual diagnosis, it is my experience that a particular attitude is taken to people who are taking alcohol or drugs.  We need to address that.  We cannot just turn people away.  Many people turn to drugs and alcohol because they have psychiatric problems and that has to be addressed.  That requires education on the effects of the drugs being used.  Many of them are highly psychotic and are adding greatly to the problem.  We need to get the message across that drugs such as cannabis and cocaine are extremely dangerous.</p>  <p>  We also need to have a 24-7 service and not a 9-12 one, which seems to be the Government's position.  We want a round-the-clock service.  People do not just get ill, or have a breakdown or a psychotic incident between 9 a.m. and midnight; it happens round the clock.  We must deal with that.  We also need to review the facilities for people on leaving the psychiatric services.  Many of them want to live alone.  Many of them need supported services and we need supported housing for those people because they deserve a quality of life as much as anybody else.</p>  <p>  We depend on groups such as Mental Health Reform, Pieta House and other advocacy groups.  As many of them are obliged to fund-raise themselves, the State is being let off the hook in respect of funding.  We underestimate the extent to which our communities have many volunteers and youth organisations whose work is helping people with psychiatric and other problems.  I take my hat off to these organisations, which have done a massive job not just in my area but throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The committee has been set up and we have defined the ratios of people from different parties.  While we have not determined the committee membership, it is important to have service users, as well as the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a small but significant step.  We need to build on it and we need the resources to do it.</p></speech>

I have done that because I recognise the importance of mental health and hopefully this will raise awareness.  Today is important.  I am only reflecting what I deem to be the view of Members of the House.  I say this because I think Members will have said what they want to say on Report Stage.  Without curtailing anybody, I call Deputy Butler.</p></speech>

The Bill is important in putting the person first.  As Deputy Buckley has said, this has to transcend politics and we need cross-party support.  </p><p>We cannot play politics with this as there is not a family in Ireland that has not been affected by it.  I listened with interest to what Deputy Neville said.  We are fighting the battle against the stigma associated with mental illness.  The new generation is much more open to talking about mental illness.  I see that with my own children in college.  I have two children going through the college system.  My daughter was in Mary Immaculate College last year.  Unfortunately, one of her group of friends took his own life.  That had an impact on the group of friends and the entire class.  There was some help but it was not enough.  The suicide had a big effect on them.  Most of the students felt guilt that they did not see the signs or read the signals that this young chap was going to hell and back.  He was out socialising with them and attending college.  His death had an effect on the rest of his classmates.  They did not see the signs.  They felt guilty and felt that they should have been able to help more and they did not.  That is something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.  I met the Union of Students in Ireland.  There is some help in third level institutions but it is not enough.  That is one area we need to target.<br/><br/>Another area I wish to pinpoint today is something I have come across a lot and which has been alluded to by other speakers, namely, staffing levels.  It is one of the most important issues.  There is not a moratorium <i>per se</i>on replacing staff going on maternity leave, but the Department must work within its existing budget.  Nine times out of ten it is not in a position, financially, to replace the person who has gone on maternity leave, and that is causing a huge issue.  In Waterford we have 2.6 psychologists, which is not enough to deal with the children.  Currently, one member of staff is on maternity leave.  The HSE did find the budget to replace the person, but because it was only a temporary position, it was very difficult to fill the place.  That is a significant issue when one has 2.6 posts for child psychology, one of those is on maternity leave for six to nine months, and the person cannot be replaced because it is only a temporary position.  No one is going to uproot from another side of the country to come to work someplace else for nine months.<br/><br/>People have also come to me about the lack of continuity in treating children with mental health issues.  They need continuity of care.  If the person treating them leaves due to maternity leave, to which they are entitled, and we have all done it, or if the system changes, children find it very hard to adapt.  An adult will adapt more quickly.  That is another issue we must address.<br/><br/>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about children trying to access a mental health bed.  Currently, we have 58 mental health beds for children in this country.  That is not enough.  It is a scandal that a child with mental health issues would have to go into an adult ward or facility.  Imagine putting a child of seven or eight into an adult ward.  In many cases adult wards have a mix of men and women.<br/><br/>We must compliment the likes of Jigsaw and Sugru that do fantastic work throughout the country.  The spirit of volunteerism within those organisations is fantastic.  I echo what Deputy Cahill said, that we need a Jigsaw and Sugru in every county in Ireland.  They cannot be based in just one or two areas.<br/><br/>Many facilities are city-based, but many people live in isolation in rural areas.  Mental health comes to the fore there, but the services are not as easy to access.  There are many good people working in the system and they are very fair, but the problem is there are not enough of them.<br/><br/>My final point is one on which I speak from experience.  When a member of one's family is admitted to a psychiatric ward and they come out well after being looked after, that is good but the follow-up care is very poor.  There is a lack of aftercare.  If someone leaves hospital after a stay of between six and eight weeks, family members can see the signs of it happening again, ahead of a medical person because when one lives in close proximity to someone who suffers from mental health issues, one does recognise the signs.  The follow-up when someone leaves hospital is inadequate because there are not enough staff in place.  I compliment those working in the system because there are some very good workers.</p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Brown on bringing the Bill before the House and compliment him on the work he has done so far.  It is a great privilege for a Member to bring such a Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il this morning because every Oireachtas Member deals with mental health issues and suicide within his or her constituency every day.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to my colleague and friend, former Deputy Dan Neville, who for many years highlighted the need for mental health facilities and resources.  At the time, many people were listening but, unfortunately, we did not have the resources or some of the support systems that are in place at present.  I congratulate the new Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  He has a very difficult portfolio.</p><p>The concerns we are expressing are also being expressed on a daily basis in so many areas throughout the country.  So many people have been touched by this issue.  It is vitally important that the Minister of State take heed, and he will.  I know the man and he is very anxious that we get results in respect of what is required.  Mental health services are needed, not just for five days a week but on a 24-7 basis.  I have attended many meetings and health forums in recent times and on many occasions I heard some of the complaints that have been made, including in respect of continuity of services at weekends and at night.</p> <p> This issue is extremely important for people.  Deputy Neville mentioned concerns regarding drugs and alcohol. On visits to schools and when speaking to teachers and parents, the amount of bullying that can take place within schools has been brought to my attention.  This is very concerning for parents and teachers.  We must start with national and secondary schools.  Young people must be made aware, first, of the dangers of drugs and alcohol and, second, of what can be and is said on social media in respect of bullying of friends, colleagues or classmates.  I find that issue very worrying.</p> <p> We hear about the various services that are in place, such as Jigsaw and CAMHS.  I represent the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, which contains many rural areas.  As some of the previous speakers have said, there are a lot of people living alone with mental health issues who must be listened to.  They must have the services they require daily and weekly.  We must provide those services.  In the cities, all the services are provided.  In the rural areas, there are concerns.  Only recently, I met a father whose young daughter took her own life some time ago.  He and his family appealed to me to do whatever I could as an elected representative to highlight the suffering and pain this family is going through.  There are many families in every part of the country that are suffering as a result of young people committing suicide, both in terms of mental health and because of the fears they have that the services are not there to provide for young people.</p> <p> I congratulate Deputy Browne and plead with the Minister of State and all of the relevant agencies in the context of the services we have in each of our constituencies and nationally.  I ask first that we fill existing vacancies.  There are services crying out for additional help and support.  I support this new committee that will have numerous decisions to take in the coming period.  I would certainly like to be associated with the comments made during this debate in respect of Deputy Browne's Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400012#K00200"><p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Browne, on the work he did in bringing the Bill to the House.  I welcome the conversation we are having and I also welcome the opportunity to contribute.</p>  <p>  Mental health issues are endemic in our society and are growing, particularly among younger people.  By that, I do not only mean teenagers but also children as young as five or six who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  I think this problem has developed in recent times and was not always as bad as it is now, although we recognise that the position has improved and that there is better reporting in respect of it.  We have children of national school age who are self-harming and presenting with stress, anxiety and depression.  We need to do a lot more research to help our own understanding as to why that is happening.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy McLoughlin that while drugs and alcohol certainly play a role, social media has to be a major factor in creating those problems.  A child as young as seven or eight might have a smartphone.  Children are constantly contactable and are under constant scrutiny, although they may not realise it.  They are either being excluded from or included in particular conversations.  They are being tagged in photographs and commented on.  There is constant commentary on their appearance, how they conduct themselves, whether they meet the standards of the group or school they are in.  There is immense and constant pressure on younger people.  There have been conversations more recently about having screen-free time.  Parents should perhaps be better educated.  Maybe we need to put in place education programmes to highlight the importance of having screen-free mealtimes.  There should be a time when the phone is not accessible, perhaps at night when children go to bed.  It certainly cannot be in the interests of children to be on their phones last thing at night before they close their eyes and first thing in the morning when they wake up.  That has to have an impact.</p>  <p>  I am reminded of a young lad and I think I can mention his name because what happened to him was quite widely reported.  I heard Deputy Butler speak about the impact that the suicide of a friend has on the wider group.  I refer to a young man by the name of Ben Garrett, from my town of Castlebar, who was a very close friend to my sister and brother.  He was involved in the boxing club where my brother and sister still box.  He went on to become a member of the Defence Forces.  I am spokesperson for defence and this affected the defence community as well.  He took his own life in County Galway where he was posted.  I can see Deputy Rabbitte nodding because it was quite widely reported in counties Mayo and Galway and, indeed, nationally.  I recall the search effort that went on for in excess of a month.  People from the boxing club and all of his school friends were involved.  They were walking along the edge of the River Corrib in Galway searching for his belongings and searching for Ben.  I recall the impact that had on those younger people, my brother and sister in particular.  I also recall that Ben's mother took them all aside and said they must remember the impact that this has on families, they must tell others about the difficulties they are having and they must for God's sake stay away from drugs and alcohol.</p>  <p>  People have spoken about not recognising the signs.  Ben gave the impression of confidence, happiness and things going very well.  It is clear that underneath he was in a lot of trouble.  If only we had taken more time to talk about it.  If only there was not such stigma attached and it was more okay to talk about mental health.  We are definitely getting to a stage where it is okay to talk about it.  We want people to talk about it.  Certainly, his group of friends in Castlebar and in the boxing club needed to talk.  We had the Ben Garrett memorial cup not so long ago and we are all having a conversation now about mental health.  They are all talking about it.  If we are looking for a positive out of that horrific situation, that is one.</p>  <p>  We have to look at services, particularly in rural areas.  I know of one lady who had to go to Pieta House in Tuam to get counselling services because there were none available in County Mayo.  I know our population might not be as large as some of the other counties but we still need services.  As a result of the geographic size of our county, and because basic counselling services are so expensive, the lady had travel to County Galway because that was the only place she could get them.  This is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Deputy Rabbitte has mentioned the out-of-hours services.  Unless one presents with difficulties between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday to Friday, the options are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the accident and emergency department.  If a young person is hugely distressed, presents at an accident and emergency department and then has to sit for six or more hours in a very pressurised environment, with bright lights, lots of stimulus, and various other people attending with different illnesses and ailments, it puts additional stress on that individual.  We know people are being sent home.  We need additional supports for youth mental health services out of hours.  There needs to be a 24-7 response and facilities for those people.</p>  <p>  We also need to address the cost of treatment.  We often hear about the worst cases and those who present with the worst levels of depression, anxiety and mental health stress.</p><p>Many people are experiencing some level of anxiety.  I would say every second or third person is experiencing social anxiety, pressure or stress in his or her life.  There are no real services for mild mental health issues.  The only services that are available are private ones.  People are being encouraged to seek out cognitive behavioural therapy to deal with difficulties associated with anxiety.  The average cost of an hour with a specialist in cognitive behavioural therapy is &euro;80.  This puts such services way beyond the reach of ordinary people.  The cost of treatment needs to be addressed.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has a very difficult job.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that he is well placed to take on this role.  He has a genuine desire to do a good job in this area.  I think he appreciates the particular difficulties being encountered by young people and children.  I wish him well in this role.  I am sure he will have the support of this House.  I agree with Deputy McLoughlin that the investment of resources needs to start at national and secondary school levels.  Teachers, who are very often to the fore in terms of recognising the signs of mental stress and mental health issues in younger people, need to receive training.  In addition to looking at how we treat the problem and how we respond to issues, we need to look at the source of the problem to see how we can prevent these issues from developing in the first place.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Browne for bringing the Bill before us.  I welcome the opportunity to support it and to speak more broadly on this issue.  When I hear people whose bona fides I do not question speaking with heartfelt emotion about the problems on the ground, they say we need to talk and listen to young people and give them an opportunity to talk.  I cannot help feeling a certain frustration because the time for talking - not for young people, but for those in government - is over.  Successive Governments have utterly failed to deal with the mental health crisis.  I have a passion for this issue, having previously worked as a psychologist.  I know exactly what the problems are on the ground.  They remain the same unfortunately.</p>  <p>  In 1984, a new vision was introduced in the Planning for the Future document, which, believe it or not, recognised all the problems.  However, there was a failure to deal with the recommendations in Planning for the Future.  We got a new document, A Vision for Change, in 2006.  I could not find fault with its ten-year vision for the period 2006 to 2015.  That period ran out more than a year and a half ago.  A Vision for Change set out every single thing we are talking about today.  It set out the crisis in suicide and, more importantly, set out exactly what needed to be done.  I have said on the record that nobody believed that any Government would implement that strategy.  For that reason, an independent implementation body was established.  It sat for two three-year periods and did some tremendous work.  It monitored the implementation of A Vision for Change.  While some things were done under A Vision for Change, the vast majority of its recommendations were not implemented.  The implementation body was ultimately abolished and its work finished.</p>  <p>  I suggest that since January 2016, the D&aacute;il has had more open debates on mental health than on any other issue, with the possible exceptions of housing and health.  We have talked and talked, but the review of A Vision for Change, which has been promised since the day we were elected to this House, has not been published.  The Minister of State's predecessor was very interested in this subject and could not be faulted, but nothing happened.  The review was not published.  A new implementation body was supposed to be established to monitor A Vision for Change, but that has not happened.  Even though the timeframe it covers has come to an end, its recommendations are still extremely pertinent.  On the last day of term, we are talking again about young people, the lack of services and the high rate of suicide.  All of that is accurate, but we should really be debating why successive Governments have not implemented A Vision for Change.  I am afraid the current Government is on the rack now.  Why has it not undertaken the review that was promised?  Where is the independent implementation body that is needed to ensure appropriate mental health services are provided?  It needs to be taken out of our hands.</p>  <p>  The economic cost of mental health issues is absolutely frightening.  As we do not have precise figures for this jurisdiction, we can extrapolate from Northern Ireland and other countries that over &euro;2.5 billion is lost to the economy each year through lost productivity, additional hospital admissions, etc.  That figure is increasing.  A figure of &euro;12 billion has also been mentioned.  I find that extraordinary, so I am taking the lower figure.  There are many problems going down through the generations because of the failure to change.  I am using the language of economics to make the point that it is much cheaper to prevent and treat mental illness.  I have made a similar point about domestic violence.  Perhaps I might be able to get through to the men who are responsible for this issue on that level.  Generally speaking, it tends to be men whose view of these issues is dominated by the economic perspective.  There are some women who share that view.</p>  <p>  On a practical level, we will save money in the long run by dealing with this issue.  As a result of our failure to do so, there are just 45 beds in Galway.  The Mental Health Commission visits every single year and has been called in more often.  It has said in its reports that there are no individual care plans.  Last year, patients in the unit in Galway had to sleep on the floor.  All of these things have been set out by the Mental Health Commission.  I thank Deputy Rabbitte, who has spoken about this issue, for taking action as part of her hands-on approach.  A number of Deputies had to raise this matter on Topical Issues to ensure a service on the ground that caters for young people between the ages of 12 and 21 was kept open.  It is operating on a shoestring budget of &euro;42,000.  I hope it will be announced that this service will receive a minimum of &euro;62,000 in the budget for next year so it can expand to Gort, Carna and Clifden.  Is airgead suarach amach is amach &eacute; &euro;62,000.  It is a ridiculous amount of money to give those who are providing this wonderful service.  Over 190 young children and adolescents have gone through the hands of this service since it opened in 2012.  There is no doubt that it has saved lives.</p>  <p>  I would like to conclude by talking about drugs.  A unit in Galway burned down and was not replaced.  Counselling services for drug and alcohol addiction have been reduced to a level I do not want to think about.  If we are seriously interested in this issue, we need to work together and move the debate on to the implementation of A Vision for Change or its successor strategy.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to tell us why the new strategy has not been published.  When will it be published?  Has the independent implementation body been set up?  Go raibh mile maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Browne for introducing this important Bill.  It is important to discuss this issue and give it the attention it demands and requires.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for facilitating that.  I acknowledge the leadership of the Ceann Comhairle in organising the symposium on mental health that will take place in Dublin Castle in 19 September.  As a result of a decision that was made in recent days, the Oireachtas committee will be up and running before that event, which is important.  It has to be acknowledged that our colleagues on the Business Committee, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, collaborated to reach consensus on this issue.  There will be difficulties if leadership does not continue to come from this House and from the Seanad.  We have consensus and collaboration.  This shows that we can work together on difficult issues.  My colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and Deputy Neville, will work closely on this collaborative effort through the joint committee over a 12-month period.  I look forward to the outcome of their work.</p>  <p>  We live in an electronic and technological world.  Like everyone else, politicians are now very accessible.  The more I see the mediums, mechanisms and avenues that are available to us for communication, the more I think we are less connected at a physical level.</p><p>It is something of which people will be conscious when deliberating over this report.  In Ireland in particular, if one brings it back to a parish or county level, the face-to-face, shoulder-to-shoulder and people-to-people physical interaction is very important and cannot be ignored.  I always think back to an event in Letterkenny in 1996.  It was a youth seminar in my days as a youth worker.  I remember a young group of teenagers from Lifford who came onto the stage to make a presentation on what they felt was necessary to address the gap in youth provision.  I remember they came onto the stage and remained silent for a number of minutes.  We wondered what they were going to do.  We did not know there were placards on the floor.  Eventually the group, of about a dozen, lifted up the placards on which were the words &quot;Why talk when nobody listens?&quot;, which I found to be very powerful and we must be conscious of it.  I do not have any teenagers at the moment but I know parents struggle with that interaction.  Being there in person for them is very important.  When I think back to my own days as a teenager, I battled it out with my father, even though, when we were battling, we were still communicating and he was always there for me.  It is something that we have to be conscious of.<br/><br/>Ba mhaith liom mo aitheantas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; f&aacute; choinne a gcuid oibre ar an &aacute;bhar thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Ba mhaith liom freisin aitheantas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht a cheannasa&iacute;ocht agus a chomhoibri&uacute; le linn na hoibre seo.  My final point - mo fhocal scoir - is that last year, as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I got a chance to go to Africa and such places, and I came across a bit of Swahili, <i>umoja na nguvu</i>, which is the Swahili for &quot;together stronger&quot;, and it is no different to our n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile, meaning there is no strength without unity.  I believe we have the strength and unity of purpose on this issue.  I wish the joint committee on mental health well over the 12-month period from September and am confident that we will make progress on this issue in the future.</p></speech>

I have a meeting at 12 noon.  I very much welcome the discussion.  I also commend the Ceann Comhairle on his proposal that we would have the symposium in September.  I commend Deputy James Browne on legislation that essentially takes us further towards removing the stigma regarding mental health and recognising the legitimacy of people having mental health problems and not dealing with them in the sort of cruel and inhumane way that was the case once upon a time.  Today, notwithstanding that the reasons are often slightly different, the wrong approaches to dealing with mental health issues are still taken.  I do not doubt the bona fides of people who spoke.  I think all of us have been touched by this.  I certainly have been touched, losing some very close friends to suicide.  I believe all of us have an interest in resolving this issue.</p>  <p>  I want to input something.  I am a big fan of Sigmund Freud, having been a student of psychology in university, although not of everything he said.  He was a revolutionary in that he was the first to move away from the schools of psychology that imagined that, if there was a mental illness, there was something fundamentally wrong with that person.  There were schools of thought at the time that Freud was developing his theories that believed that nails should be hammered into certain parts of the heads of people with mental health issues.  That was how barbaric it was.  That went along with the schools of incarceration and dehumanisation and simply locking people away or categorising them as beyond the pale of mental normality.  We have moved a long way from that, but there were a couple of absolutely critical things about Freud's revolutionary understanding of mental health without which we will not grasp how to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  He understood the absolutely critical importance of children and babies being nurtured and of their early relations.  He understood that the essential character of the human mind was a conflict between two things.  Those are the basic needs of a human being - what he called the instinctual drives or the id - and the superego, which were the conventions of society, the rules, the norms and the pressures.  In the middle was the ego, that is, you or me, in between those two things.  How that balance was reconciled between the basic needs of human beings and the pressures of society would determine the mental health or otherwise of a human being.  He identified the basic instinctual drives that had to be met but were often frustrated by the pressures of society, including the need to eat, to drink, to have a roof over one's head, to reproduce and have sexual relations - basic things - and to interact with other human beings.  This was absolutely essential to what we were.  There was also the creative impulse, which was absolutely central to Freud's understanding of human psychology and health.  He pointed out that when these drives were frustrated, and pressure was denied or negated, it caused problems.</p>  <p>  It is not difficult to see how all of this applies today.  I do not think it is just about a fleeting technological change, because mental health issues far predate any of these technological things, although there is no doubt that they can exacerbate them.  They can produce higher levels of alienation and pressures.  These pressures come from everywhere, such as the pressure to put a roof over one's head but not being able to, the pressure to pass exams, the pressure to get a job that pays well, the denial of basic human relations and the alienation of human sexuality.  All of these things have intensified and can do tremendous damage to our mental health, and in particular to young people in their development.  Critically, Freud was the first to understand that the starting point of good mental health was first to ensure that those basic needs were satisfied and, in so far as people had mental health issues, he was the first to understand the talking cure.  That is basic interaction between human beings, not pills or drugs - I am not saying they do not have some role - not nails in the head, not incarceration but to talk, one human being to another or a few human beings together, in order that there is real human engagement, a thing our society often denies us or puts pressure on us to deny, to become alienated from one another.</p>  <p>  Where this comes down to real practicality is when one considers what is the biggest problem with the mental health services or indeed what is the problem with many of the services that would help to enhance health.  There are not enough people to talk to other people.  That is the big gap.  In child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, we do not have enough human beings.  That is why we do not have the beds open.  We do not have enough human beings in the classrooms with our children, so their relationships are alienated.  There are not enough teachers or special needs assistants.  We need human beings.  We even want to remove human beings from train stations, where the guy at the window talks to a person in the morning, and replace them with machines.  We have to remember that if economic efficiency and all that are important as some people might say and if that begins to replace human beings or not make human beings available to do those jobs, we will be on a road to nowhere and we will not be able to solve these problems.  That follows right through to the 24-hour services, dual diagnosis - recognising the difference between somebody who has certain types of mental health problems and others - having people in schools to talk to our young people or not having children in adult wards.  All that requires human beings to provide for all these specific needs, interactions, human relations and engagement, that can allow us to really get through to people, talk to them and deal with the issues that they are facing.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the work of my colleague, Deputy James Browne, in introducing this Bill to deal with such an important and relevant issue for so many families and individuals who are suffering in this area.  Before we get further into the discussion and the debate, I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in his role and acknowledge the wonderful work done by so many people in this service area who are perhaps sometimes caught between a lack of resources and a lack of supports, on which we can dwell in a moment.  It is important to acknowledge all the positive work done while at the same time acknowledging where the gaps are and that we must try to work together positively to put better supports and resources in place to help the many vulnerable people who suffer from mental illness.</p>  <p>  As previous speakers have said, the issue of mental health involves that famous old slogan, "It is okay not to be okay."  The reality is that no matter the age group to which people belong, if they suffer from mental health illness, they sometimes feel embarrassed or find it difficult to speak about it because they feel that if they speak about an issue, they are somehow letting themselves down or letting down people around them.  Of course, this is not the case at all but, unfortunately, that is a barrier and an issue.  We must get the message out more strongly to people that it is okay not to feel well and okay to have discussions on a number of sensitive issues, whatever they are, and that there are people there, whether friends, family or someone qualified to whom they can speak, to help them overcome these problems.</p>  <p>  This leads me to the constituency I represent, Kildare North.  I have raised this in the House on a number of occasions and I raised it with the Minister, Deputy Harris, yesterday afternoon when he was kind enough to meet me.  We are still without a primary care child psychologist in that constituency.  The population of Kildare North is approximately 110,000 and we do not have that post filled yet.  It has been vacant for perhaps 18 months now.  If we are serious about trying to help people, deal with the issues and prevent the problems everyone has spoken about this morning, we need to put those very simple and basic services in place to help people.</p>  <p>  I wish to speak about a particular case and how the service does not work sometimes.  I have a constituent who is 15, was suffering mental health issues and taking drugs and had many problems, so much so that it was out of control and his family was not able to control him.  At the May bank holiday weekend, the garda&iacute; had to arrive at his home, remove him and put him into a foster care environment.  The very disappointing aspect of the case was that the service providers engaging with him and looking after him on behalf of the State allowed him to commute unsupervised from his foster home to the service by public transport even though he was on suicide watch, and he went missing for nearly five days and could not be found.  Most alarming was that when he was found, the service provider looking after him on behalf of the State did the very same all over again, and he went missing again.  Then the problem was that we had to work tirelessly with everyone, when he was found, to get him into care.  It is only in the past two weeks that we have broken all the barriers and the family is now happy with the supports that are in place for this 15 year old to the extent that they believe he will not do the awful thing and commit suicide.  This is why I wished to acknowledge the positives at the beginning of my contribution.  However, there are negatives and massive gaps in the service that need to be addressed.  As my colleagues have said, the problem is that the HSE operates on a 9 to 5 basis, Monday to Friday.  It shuts down at 4 o'clock on a Friday and opens up at perhaps 10 o'clock on a Monday morning, and we see this across a myriad of services.  This does not work in particular cases and for particular services and it did not work here.  Even after the bank holiday weekend, when we expected services to kick in, they did not.  That is a problem.</p>  <p>  There is a group operating in my town of Celbridge called the Abbey Community Project.  I have met the previous Minister and the HSE about the group, which operates on a voluntary basis.  It has 40 cases on its books and carries out dual diagnoses.  It gets referrals from the State agencies and, to date, has not got one bit of support from the State by way of funding or anything else.  I have met and spoken to the HSE to advocate on the group's behalf.  I got a hugely disappointing letter two days ago more or less saying the case was closed, the HSE will keep the matter on file and it cannot do anything to help.  That is terrible.  These are counsellors qualified in dual diagnosis providing an incredible service for 40 clients whom the public health services said they could not help.  The HSE told us to come back in three months or six months or whatever if we wanted its help.  That is too late for some of these people, as others have said, because they need the help and the intervention now.  The people operating this voluntary service in Celbridge refer its clients on for further help and support but they are the first to assist them and keep them safe, and now we hear there is no support for the service.  They are looking for very modest support, not hundreds of thousands of euro.  If they close their doors in the next number of days, and it is looking like they may do so, 40 cases will be put back into the system which could not deal with them in the first place and which referred them to the Abbey Community Project.</p>  <p>  My colleague, who has now left the Chamber, said it is time for us, as politicians, to stop merely speaking, and I genuinely believe this is true.  We need the public looking in on this debate to keep talking if they have issues in this area in order that we can help and support them.  However, as politicians, we need to stop merely speaking about this now and we need delivery and action.  Of course it is hugely important to speak about the issue and bring it to the attention of everyone in order that we get the resources and supports put in place, but now we need delivery.  I have identified a number of cases this morning in respect of which direct action by Government, Department and HSE would make a massive difference to people whom we want to be able to access these supports.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State well.  I hope he will contact me after this contribution in order that we might get real and help in those areas we spoke about, particularly with the group in Celbridge that may have to close and send 40 clients to a service that sent them to that group in the first place.</p></speech>

It is obvious that this legislative measure has the widespread support of the Members of the House.  It is an extremely important issue, to say the least.  Regarding the comments made by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, in far too many instances the only services available are those provided by voluntary organisations that must continually fund-raise and try to provide a service where, unfortunately, the statutory agencies are not providing the services they are mandated to provide.  I wish the Minister of State well in his work.  I am sure he will put the energy and commitment into it that is needed.</p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments about the pressure on people to pass exams, we all know from speaking to teachers, school principals and their support staff of the awful pressures on children at second level, in particular, and at third level as well.  The step made by the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, of cutting the ex-quota career guidance allocation was very regressive and retrograde.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party made a particular point in its discussions with Fine Gael regarding the confidence and supply arrangement of the provision of an adequate career guidance service in our schools.  We know from speaking to career guidance teachers that they put an enormous amount of time and energy into assisting students going through difficult patches in their lives.  This resource within the education sector needs to be provided with better funding, needs increased numbers and needs the resources to deal with the complex problems that students present with today.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to a group called Inspire that provides disability services and mental health services throughout our island.  They spoke to me recently about the possibility of extending their services, in conjunction with the HSE, throughout our jurisdiction.  They spoke to me in particular about the pressures on students and the programmes they have put in place at third level.  They spoke to me in the context of the potential and the opportunities that exist for all of us to deliver services on a North-South basis.  We could make improvements to the area of mental health if we were to tackle the issues and deliver programmes on an all-Ireland basis.</p><p>I heard Deputy Eugene Murphy speaking earlier about A Vision for Change and the huge commitment, work and leadership that our former colleague in this House, Mr. John Moloney, gave in his role in the Department of Health at that time.  It was a very good strategy that unfortunately has not been fully implemented.  There is no point in merely talking about this.  Strategies need to be put in place but they also need to be implemented.  A lack of resources has curtailed the implementation of strategies at times but whatever strategy is put in place, an implementation plan should be put in place at the same time. </p> <p> We have national obligations to bring in legislation.  We also have international obligations because we are signed up to international agreements and international frameworks.  Again, there is no point in us signing up to these agreements unless we implement them.  We must have full compliance with all our legislative requirements.  Those of us who represent rural constituencies are conscious of the complete lack of adequate services such as, for example, services after 5 p.m. or at the weekend.  Those services are non-existent in many cases and Members are familiar with the pressures that are put on individuals and families when problems arise in a home.  </p> <p> I wish the Minister well in his work and again take the opportunity to compliment our colleague, Deputy Browne.  He has had widespread consultation with many particular interest groups in the area of mental health and has brought forward a legislative measure that, when implemented, will make a real meaningful and positive contribution to the enhancement of services, which we all desire.</p></speech>

Today's debate and the work that has been done over the last 12 months is testament to the fact that we listen to the people who we represent and that we endeavour to represent their views and are trying to improve the situation on mental health.  I particularly welcome that the Ceann Comhairle has indicated that there will be a symposium on the issue the day before Members return after the recess.  The precedent was set last year with the symposium on Brexit and it is a worthwhile initiative to inform and involve those in the services.  I compliment those who provide those services, in many cases with very little financial support.</p>  <p>  I will focus on the lack of professional people to deliver the services.  This applies not just to mental health but right across this country, whether it is in education or health, people are crying out for myriad services.  We need to address the point that many people are working in the private sector rather than coming into the public sector.  I was a primary school teacher for 35 years, and when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, was appointed I engaged with her on what I view as a major reform of the curriculum, incorporating life skills into classrooms.  Mental health has always been an issue but the mental health of younger people is something we have not spoken about enough.  I attribute much of that to the boom.  There is a need to bring life skills into the curriculum.  For instance, the Stay Safe programme, which provides sex education for children, had a huge impact when it came into the schools.  There are myriad programmes on mental health, not just in this country but across the world.  They can be delivered to younger people to make them safer and healthier.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 15 years ago, under the old health board regime it was proposed - and implemented to a degree - that programmes be integrated in order that they would be available to schools.  This included programmes on healthy eating, and I remember the B&iacute; Foll&aacute;in programme distinctly.  That work was done and a teacher on secondment was paid for to ensure that the programmes were available to the schools.  A difficulty arose within the Department due to copyright issues and schools were not allowed to use the programmes.  I raise that as an issue.  There are myriad programmes out there but it is important to make use of them.  There must be greater flexibility within the curriculum to teach life skills, and we should talk to children at a young age.  Talk may be cheap, but it is very important when it comes to mental health.  </p>  <p>  I again commend Deputy Browne.  Many other people were mentioned because of their great work down the years.  I am not going to name them again, but I commend them.  We need to keep these issues to the fore.  I have had discussions with the Ceann Comhairle on championing the issues of mental health and disability and the issue of climate change.  We are sending out a much better message now about how we will deal with mental health.  As a Deputy representing the constituency of Louth, I make the point that the many organisations involved in mental health need our support.  This does not just involve financial support, but general support to encourage them to deliver a better mental health service.  </p></speech>

I understand it has all-party support, which indicates this is one area in which all parties can work together to enhance the service and bring about real and meaningful reforms.</p>  <p>  I am struck by the fact that Members are talking about mental health services again.  It was one of the first topics debated following the election and we had statements in the Chamber in March of last year.  There has been no noticeable improvement in the service, unfortunately.  In fact, there are certain services in certain areas where there has been a decline and this is a consequence of the State failing to provide the necessary resources.  In certain instances in which there are State failures, local charity groups take up the slack.  An organisation called Good 2 Talk provides a service in Mullingar and in Longford.  After the revelations about Console the consequence was that its money was pulled because there rightly was a crackdown on how money was allocated to a charity that was not doing its work, to put it mildly.  However, other charities and community groups established in other areas have suffered negative consequences.  I understood from the Minister's predecessor that a review was to take place to investigate where we would get the best value for our money and what services were providing good services and would continue to be supported into the future. </p><p>Where is that review?  When will it be completed and when will services know and have the confidence that they will be funded for some years into the future?  It is very bad practice that the State, which should provide these services, leaves these providers waiting till the middle or end of the year before they know how much money they will get.  We should see a more streamlined approach to services which are doing invaluable work, engaging and intervening at very critical stages.  They need the support of the State.</p> <p> I welcome the fact we are debating this area today, that it was one of the first debates after the last election and that we have had many Private Member's motions and debates on it.  That is positive and removes the stigma from mental health problems, but unless there are tangible benefits, the people who need access to the services can get access to them, and we radically reduce the waiting times and increase their availability to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we will be failing.  There are many who need the services and cannot afford private therapy.  They are left waiting too long.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State luck in his role and ask him to make sure the extra money committed to the service in the programme for Government for next year will be given, that it goes to the people who need it most and that he works with the community groups, who do invaluable work, to make a difference to the people who rely on the service.</p></speech>

He is a very fine advocate.  I also commend his predecessor, Deputy McEntee, on her work.  I commend Deputy Browne on the work he has done on this Bill.  I pay tribute to all those in the House who have been advocates, Deputies Neville and Buckley and all who have contributed in a positive and unified way.  It is important to note that and their ideas.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McHugh spoke of the pressures on young people from social and electronic media and the simple matter of talking to his father and having that line of communication open.  There are pressures on parents as well, trying to understand that dynamic and change.  There should be help and support for them.  Many parents are not aware of the pressures on their own children.  I am not talking only about teenagers.  Deputy McHugh spoke about teenagers but very young children are also exposed to those pressures.  Someone said earlier in the debate "if only we knew".  Parents and guardians of children need a lot of help and understanding.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister of State, the Government and all parties are committed to working to achieve real progress in this sphere.  It is frustrating that the good work the Minister, the Government and House do is not replicated by those delivering the services.  This time last year I spoke in the House about the services in my county and pressed hard to see that they were retained.  Nine months after the closure of the acute psychiatric unit in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, there is not a fully operational mental health day service there.  The closure last September was part of a plan to provide a centralised acute service at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which I disagreed with.  A mental health day hospital should have been opened following the closure of the unit in Navan in order that some local supports would be available, but the HSE admits that it does not have the full-time staff or facilities in place for this service to operate.  That is very disappointing, and the head of mental health services in our county has admitted that, but there is no plan to do that.  There is a willingness and determination on all sides in the House, but the reality on the ground does not match that.  It is deeply frustrating that having raised this with the Minister of State a year ago that the service is not in place nine months on.  Will the Minister of State look into that?  I wish him well in his role and hope that real change does happen.  If a mental health service day centre cannot be operational nine months after the closure of a unit, there is a gap between the policy and the reality.</p></speech>

I worked with him on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills and know how committed he is to this area.  I do not doubt that he will make a difference.  I also congratulate my colleague, Deputy Browne, on his motion and his work in the past 16 months in this area, which has been quite incredible.</p>  <p>  I have spoken several times on this topic in this Chamber.  We never talk about it enough.  We could spend every day speaking about mental health and what we need to do to promote positive mental health and to help those in crisis.</p>  <p>  The committee had a special session on promoting positive mental health in our educational services, formal, non-formal and informal education.  What goes on outside the school day is very important in different settings.  Is school preparing our young people for life or for a life of tests?  The committee recommended that stress management and resilience should be taught rather than caught.  There is an idea sometimes that young people will develop those skills in an educational environment.  Some will, but there are many who are vulnerable and will flounder and need help to find their inner strength.  Is our system focused on the head?  We need to think about education of the heart and the soul.  If we do that, we will equip our young people for life.</p>  <p>  I recently had an incredibly enlightening conversation with a careers guidance teacher in the Patrician Brothers Secondary, PBS, school, Sean Nolan, at the Cycle for Suicide rally in Newbridge.  He coined the question whether we are preparing children for a life of tests or for the tests of life.  There is great resonance and significance in that for us to ponder.  Managing stress and building capacity to cope with tough times are vital skills for our young people to survive and thrive.  The great poet Robert Frost said, "In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on", but it does not go on for everyone.  It should do.  When we hear day after day, week after week, about young people taking their own lives, we realise life does not necessarily go on.  It behoves everyone in the educational system, and us as legislators, to ensure schools and teachers are given resources, training and extra supports.</p><p>The groups that take on a lot of this work outside of schools also need the support.  I refer to groups such as Kildare Youth Theatre, Griese Youth Theatre and many different organisations that work with young people to help them develop the skills they need.  We have many excellent community organisations that work with people who are vulnerable to try to get them centred again.  Places such as Hope(d) in Kildare need extra supports and help.  There are many excellent volunteers helping to run these organisations but they need to have seed money.  I would like to see a situation where they are supported financially through the Exchequer.</p> <p> It is fair to say that we probably all are born with fears and feelings of inadequacy about ourselves.  We tend to think that we are not good enough ourselves and that we are going to fail.  Sometimes this can happen, but we are born with enough and we are born with the inner mechanisms that, with help and support, we can develop into the necessary life skills in order to thrive.</p></speech>

There can be a lot of attention placed on things that do not work in the D&aacute;il but this is one initiative where we can have a collaborative approach and it shows that some things do work well.</p>  <p>  While it did not present scientific statistics, we all remember the roadshow that Vincent Browne took around the country prior to the general election - some of us were targets of it - and I took note of some of the key issues raised.  At all those meetings there was one constant, which was suicide-mental health.  It was the only topic that came up on every, single programme.  It is an issue right across the country.  People came along and raised this issue voluntarily in those debates.  It was interesting that suicide-mental health was raised in this manner.</p>  <p>  Public representatives see people who come through our offices for whom the system has failed, right across the spectrum.  People might turn up with a housing difficulty and with other associated problems but the most difficult cases are when those people may also have a mental health problem.  I can see significant failures in the system and I do not doubt that this is the case nationwide.</p>  <p>  There are things that we absolutely need to do.  One particular aspect of mental health policy we should tackle is the service distinction between addiction and mental health.  Substance abuse and mental health issues often go hand in hand.  The first point of contact with a service provider for individuals with a dual diagnosis should seek to tackle both in a holistic fashion.  A UK study has suggested that 75% of users of drug services and 85% of users of alcohol services experience mental health problems.  Obviously there is a need to have that holistic approach.</p>  <p>  A woman from my locality approached me to point out an issue in respect of youth suicide and at every opportunity when the issue of mental health has come up, I have raised the same issue.  This woman tragically lost her son through suicide.  There were four young lads in the same class who also committed suicide and it was a particular tragedy because of that.  This mother was looking for some meaning in what happened and how it could be resolved.  She pointed to the Connecting for Life strategy and how Ireland is out of line with the EU regarding youth suicide and the problem with suicide clusters.  She made the point that young people are talking to each other in a language of emotional immaturity and that wider engagement is needed.  She suggested that a structured coping mechanism is needed in schools to provide for that kind of engagement.  This mother is calling for an initiative of this sort to be made mandatory.  At present, the language in the strategy is to "encourage" measures, but it is not mandatory to do so.  Such an initiative was taken on teen pregnancies and the HSE has argued that it had worked well in that regard.  This mother could see no reason why the same positive approach would not be taken on suicide.  In-service training for teachers could include a module that gets people talking about the issue as opposed to not talking because they fear the topic.  This is what she sought and I paid great attention to a person who had been touched so personally by the issue.  I would like to see some meaning for that family.</p>  <p>  A clinical psychologist contacted me about her frustration over how people in her category are recruited.  When applicants are put onto panels it almost constitutes a discouragement to be employed.  There are hundreds of people on the panel and it lasts for a year.  All of a sudden the people have to reapply.  A clinical psychologist can do very meaningful work in a very short space of time.  Instead, people are languishing on lists and perhaps are not contributing to society in a way they would wish.  It is very short-sighted to not have an easier approach to recruitment and the matter should be looked at.</p></speech>

It is such an important issue that has been spoken about quite eloquently and passionately over the last few hours in the Chamber.  There is not a family in the State that has not been touched by mental health or suicide, and I include my own family.  In Wicklow we are blessed to have a group of dedicated people, and young people in particular, who have worked extensively on promoting positive mental health.  They have done Trojan work in recent years.  Be Well Bray and Be Well Wicklow promote positive mental health within our young people.  The groups have worked with the local partnership in Bray where a sub-committee is dealing with mental health issues.  A need has been identified for the Jigsaw service to be rolled out to cover County Wicklow.  While I am aware that a lot of areas are applying pressure to have that service rolled out, Bray and Wicklow have been identified.  The groups have worked extensively with Jigsaw, which has committed to rolling out the service in the Wicklow area.  We are, unfortunately, stuck in a situation where all the agencies agree that it needs to happen but they are stuck without a premises.  A vacant premises has been identified within the county, namely, an old courthouse in Bray.  It is an ideal premises.  The Courts Service has been approached but at the 12th hour, it has thrown red tape in the way.  The old courthouse in question is no longer in use as a dedicated new courthouse was built in the Bray area.  We have been told that a review is currently under way of the Courts Service in Wicklow and while it is ongoing the old premises will not be made available to see the roll-out of the Jigsaw programme.  To be fair, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is across the issue and has been trying to help but the red tape is blocking the roll-out of this critically needed service.</p><p>I appeal to the Minister of State.  Separate to the Bill, this is something practical, tangible and meaningful that can be done immediately.  The commitment is there on the part of all the agencies in the context of seeing this rolled out, but red tape is stopping it.  When it comes to mental health, red tape should not be an issue.  It is badly needed and it must happen.  It needed to happen 12 months ago if not 12 years ago, but the red tape is in the way.  I ask that the red tape be cut.  The premises has been lying empty and not been in use for seven or eight years at this stage and there was no notion of it every being brought back into use until Be Well, the partnership and Jigsaw made approaches.  Then, all of a sudden, a review is initiated into possibly bringing the building back into use.  It needs to happen.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this and to get that premises in use so that Jigsaw is rolled out in Wicklow.</p></speech>

That latitude is very important in an issue as important as mental health.  I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on organising the important mental health symposium to be held towards the end of September, which shows the importance the issue of mental health is to both him and the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The contributions have been passionate and well informed.  As Deputy Buckley said, no one - regardless of background, age or where a person is from - escapes the impact of mental health issues.  Absolutely everyone is affected.  I thank Deputies McDonald, Kelly and Paul Murphy for their contributions, as well as everyone else who contributed to the debate on this important Bill.  There is a lot of negativity about Deputies and the D&aacute;il.  However, this was a straightforward amendment that was expected to take probably no more than 15 minutes this morning but we have had almost three hours of contributions on it on the last day of the session.  This shows the real determination that people have in the area of mental health.</p>  <p>  There are two things the Minister of State could take from today's debate which could be done quite quickly and which are quite practical.  The first would be to reinstate the implementation body that was abandoned by the previous Government.  That would be a hugely important step.  The second would be to publish what is effectively a scoping review on A Vision for Change.  That could be published.  I understand it is ready to go.</p>  <p>  The Bill has been carefully thought out.  I appreciate that amendments may be tabled in the Seanad but it is important that any amendments do not threaten the Bill.  It is quite a targeted and well-thought-out Bill and I hope that it moves through the Seanad quickly.</p></speech>

It shows the importance of talks at Stormont and the successful completion of talks.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was involved in the Fresh Start talks in his then capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is unfortunate, as we meet here now and this legislation is passed, that we do not have a functioning assembly and an Executive in Northern Ireland.  We sincerely hope that all the parties in both Governments will ensure that some urgency is given to the talks.  We have a lacuna and an interregnum.  This is at a time when many critical issues face all of this island, particularly Northern Ireland and not just our State.  In terms of Brexit, we need a strong united voice from Northern Ireland regarding the particular challenges that it faces economically and socially, as well as those in the areas of health and education.  They are the same problems that we face in our jurisdiction, and in some areas they are greater.</p><p>I appeal to the Minister, his Government colleagues and the British Government and the political parties represented in Stormont.  There is a particular onus on Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, as the two major parties, to ensure that the issues that have been outstanding and left Northern Ireland without a Government or an Executive since January of this year are dealt with.  I know from my interaction with neighbours of my constituency in counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh that they are disillusioned that they do not have a functioning assembly or an Executive working for them.  They went out and cast their votes in the assembly elections last March.  Those people want an Executive that is working on their behalf, representing them and making decisions at local level.  Mr. Brokenshire is quoted in the newspapers this morning as saying that he will be making decisions regarding the budget in Northern Ireland.  We want local Ministers making decisions in regard to the Six Counties.  I appeal to all the parties and the two Governments to ensure that a momentum is given to the talks in order to ensure that we have a functioning Assembly and working Executive back<i>in situ </i>as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is a pity that many of the promises in previous agreements have not been delivered as quickly as this one as we would not be in the current lacuna in terms of setting up the Executive.  It behoves all of us in the House, and outside it, to be as constructive as possible rather than squeaking from the sidelines to try to ensure that progress is made, that we have a working assembly and Executive and that we can move forward as was intended in a number of agreements going back as far as the Good Friday Agreement.  In particular, we are moving towards an all-island approach in this legislation.  If we did that in all of our endeavours, we would be a lot further down the road towards the stability and peace that was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and which is intended by this Bill.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill's passage and I hope that it will add to our society rather than detract.</p><p>However, it is only part of both the work we must do and the apparatus necessary to bring us to the point that was envisaged when people in this State and in the North voted for the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.</p></speech>

It is important that we make provision for the Independent Reporting Commission, which was established by the agreement between the Irish and British Governments known as the Fresh Start agreement.  Following the enactment of this legislation, we will be able to move forward on the important issue of the eradication of the legacy of paramilitarism both North and South.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith commented on current developments in Northern Ireland.  I agree with him and I acknowledge his role as Chairman of the committee, as his party's spokesperson and as a Deputy representing a Border area.  In recent years, the D&aacute;il has continued to operate very much by way of all-party agreement in this regard and I welcome that.  It is important that this should continue.  I acknowledge what has been said about the failure of the parties to agree on an institutional framework in Northern Ireland since the election of 2 March.  It is disappointing.  However, there are good grounds for optimism given the parties' engagement, albeit of a somewhat paused nature over the summer weeks.</p>  <p>  I still believe that if the political will exists, the parties, with the assistance of both Governments, will be in a position to advance matters with a view to forming an Executive in the autumn.  That is important for a number of reasons, not least of which is the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  Should the Executive be restored to its full authority in Northern Ireland, one of its first engagements will be an early meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  That is essential as there has not been a meeting for some time.  It is essential in the context of good relations between North and South, particularly in the context of Brexit and for communities in the Border areas.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies and I look forward to the enactment of this legislation.  It will play an important role in the ongoing framework of political engagement and the process of reconciliation towards the goal of having a normalised society in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

This includes enabling the ombudsman and the bank to enter into a memorandum of understanding.  Section 77 provides for co-operation, as well as the exchange of information, between the ombudsman and the regulatory bodies of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Pensions Authority.  There is substantial overlap between the sections.  Specifically, they both contain provisions facilitating requests for information from the ombudsman by certain regulatory authorities and granting the ombudsman the power to make recommendations to those authorities.  In light of this overlap it is proposed to merge section 77 with section 18.  This merger will avoid needless duplication within these sections and increase the cogency of the Bill.</p><p>The first drafting change as a result of amendment No. 1 is the inclusion of new subsections (1) and (2) into section 18.  These subsections essentially transpose subsections (1) and (2) of section 77.  The new subsection (1) defines regulatory authorities as the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Pensions Authority.  These are the bodies with which it is proposed the ombudsman may share information under this section.  The inclusion of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as a regulatory authority is necessary because it authorises credit intermediaries who provide financial products such as hire purchase agreements and deals with any complaints regarding the advertising of such products.  The Registrar of Credit Unions is no longer included as a regulatory authority because credit unions are regulated by the Central Bank and it is, therefore, already included.</p><p>The new section 18(2) mirrors a similar existing provision from section 57CQ(1) of the Central Bank Act 1942, which currently governs the co-operation between the council and the Financial Services Ombudsman with the Central Bank.  This subsection was in section 77(2) but, from a drafting perspective, we have decided to merge the two sections to eliminate duplication.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 also updates subsections (3), (4), (5) and (9) by providing that individual references to either the Central Bank, the Registrar of Credit Unions or the Pensions Authority be replaced by a reference to the &quot;regulatory authorities&quot;.  As the ombudsman's duty to co-operate and its ability to make recommendations extends to bodies beyond the Central Bank and the Pensions Authority, it is necessary that he or she be able to provide information to all the defined regulatory authorities under the scope of this section.</p><p>Section 18(3) allowing information to be transferred despite any other enactments was previously section 18(1) in the Bill as published.  Section 18(4), relating to requests for records, was previously section 18(2).  Section 18(5) was previously section 18(3) and is further updated by including the &quot;Council&quot; as a body that is able to make recommendations to certain regulatory authorities regarding specified matters, in addition to the ombudsman.  This brings this section into line with the text of the equivalent provision in the existing legislation, section 57CQ(2) of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The inclusion of the council is also consistent with its review and advisory functions as contained in section 40 of the Bill.</p><p>Section 18(6) is a repeat of the original section 18(4), a standard clause which provides that the discloser does not incur liability for defamation.</p><p>Section 18(7) is a repeat of the original section 18(5) providing that nothing in this section affects an obligation to provide information in any other enactment.</p> <p> Section 18(8) is a repeat of the original section 18(6) where the bank may validate information regarding the calculation of the industry levy.  The final drafting change made by amendment No. 1 is to expand the scope of the topics covered by memorandums of understanding between the Ombudsman and the regulatory authorities to all matters contained in subsections (2), (4) and (5)(a) to (c).  In other words, the authorities' memorandum of understanding can cover matters relating to promoting the best interests of consumers, the provision of records or information, or recommendations regarding persistent patterns of complaint.  This change to section (9) ensures consistency with the existing rules regarding such memorandums of understanding, as currently contained in section 57CQ(3) of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p> <p> As a consequence of the changes proposed to be made to section 18 by amendment No. 2, the provisions contained within section 77 have become redundant.  Therefore, amendment No. 16 necessarily removes the entirety of section 77 from the Bill as it is now replicated in section 18.</p></speech>

The Minister of State discussed amendment No. 2 and a consequential amendment, No. 16, which is a technical amendment.</p>  <p>  I welcome amendment No. 2, which replaces many of the provisions of various Acts and strengthens the level of co-operation between the Ombudsman, the Financial Services Ombudsman Council, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  For some time, there has been confusion as to where responsibility for consumer protection lies.  For example, protection in respect of car insurance lies with the Central Bank as opposed to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, although the Office of the Ombudsman also has a role in this area.  The proposed measure strengthens co-operation between the various bodies in respect of information exchange.  However, we must do much more in this area and provide for clear lines in respect of who is responsible for what as well as ensuring there is no passing of the buck.  These provisions are a welcome step in ensuring recommendations can be made and information exchanged between the relevant bodies.  I hope the bodies in question will do this vigorously for the benefit of consumers.  </p></speech>

The provisions in this area have been improved and we are satisfied that the terminology used in previous legislation introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct.</p><p>In the existing legislation set out in the Central Bank Act 1942 and in section 60 of the Bill, the Ombudsman must make a decision in writing on completing an investigation that the complaint is substantiated, not substantiated or partly substantiated.  Following recommendations from FLAC's 2014 report, Redressing the Imbalance, the categories of decisions that the Ombudsman can make, as originally set out in 57C1 of the Central Bank Act 1942, have been revisited.  Sinn F&eacute;in changed the categories of decisions in its Private Members' Bill to make the outcomes more transparent to consumers and less misleading.  Previously, as far as I understand, consumers may have been told their complaint was partly substantiated when in actual fact it had been mostly rejected by the Ombudsman.  It is argued that this may have given a misleading impression of success rates.  I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for his work and research in this area and his recent decision to revise the third category of decision from substantially rejected to partially upheld, as we discussed on Committee Stage on 29 June.  As I said during that debate, I am happy to now align the categories of decisions in the Government Bill with the revised categories in Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.  It is important to maintain as much consistency as possible across the two Bills where they overlap.</p><p>If my amendments in this group are accepted, the following will be the categories of findings made by the Ombudsman in future: upheld; substantially upheld; partially upheld; and rejected.  Amendment No. 11 proposes to update the categories in section 60 to these four categories.  Sinn F&eacute;in submitted amendment No. 2, which is similar to my amendments Nos. 11 and 13.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 follow on from amendment No. 11, changing the references in section 60 from the old categories of &quot;substantiated or partly substantiated&quot; to &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot;.</p><p>Section 60 deals with complaints and redress in respect of financial service providers.  Section 60(2) sets out the grounds for reaching certain decisions and updates a complaint found to be &quot;substantiated or partly substantiated&quot; by substituting the term &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot;. </p><p>Section 60(4) sets out the redress available when complaints are upheld.  The terms would, in future, read &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot;.  The rest of the amendments in this group are consequential changes as follows.  The proposed amendments No. 3, 4 and 6 seek to update section 25 to delete the reference to decisions that are &quot;substantiated or partly substantiated&quot; and substitute &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot;.</p><p>Section 25(6) deals with the &quot;name and shame&quot; provision.  If, in the preceding year, three complaints about a regulated financial services provider are made to the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Ombudsman finds them to be upheld in some manner, such providers will be named publicly by the Ombudsman.</p><p>Section 25(11) sets out the procedure when a party appeals a decision, updating the text to contain the new categories of &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot; decisions.</p><p>Amendment No. 15 updates section 72.  Section 72(2) concerns the power of the court to grant injunctions in cases were the Ombudsman made a decision.  It also proposes to delete the words &quot;wholly or partly substantiated&quot; and substitute the words &quot;upheld, substantially upheld or partially upheld&quot;.</p><p>The Minister for Finance was also concerned about providing more transparency for consumers on decisions.  Section 62 includes a provision for the publication of the Ombudsman's financial services decisions with names redacted, which is maximum transparency in any case.</p></speech>

I submitted identical amendments to amendments Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 13 to 15, inclusive.  I assume the reason the amendments are in the Minister's name is that the wording is identical.  They are identical because they replicate the provisions of the Bill recently passed in the Seanad.  With two Bills proceeding through the Houses at the same time, it is crucial that the terminology used is identical, especially given the uncertainty about whether the Bill before us will be passed in the Seanad before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  I welcome the amendments.  </p><p>They introduce a new finding, as the Minister of State has said, of "partially upheld".  I am pleased the Minister of State has adopted the proposal put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in on widening the number of findings that could be made.  The amendment is about changing the text from "substantially rejected" to "partially upheld", which is a more positive way of reflecting the decision by the ombudsman.</p> <p> The amendments also capture the issue of the name-and-shame provision that is already in place.  These amendments allow for a third group of findings on the ground for naming and shaming to be dealt with.  This will help consumers to make sense of the provisions because the findings are more accurately described as "partially upheld".  This will reflect cases where the financial service provider was in some way at fault, however minor.  Now, with four different categories, that will be far clearer.</p> <p> The Minister of State referenced amendment No. 12, which is in my name.  It is identical to amendments Nos. 11 and 13 combined, which are both amendments of the Minister of State.  I put the two amendments into one but otherwise it is word-for-word identical.  I will withdraw amendment No. 12 and allow the Minister of State to bring through amendments Nos. 11 and 13.  It makes no difference which of them goes forward.</p></speech>

The range of findings that will now be available to the ombudsman's office represents a positive development.  Some of the issues are nuanced but I believe it is progressive.  It is critical that we avoid any mismatch, as I indicated earlier in the course of this Bill, between the Government legislation and the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation.  They have to mirror each other exactly.  I am unsure which will be signed into law first.  As I understand it, if the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation is signed into law first and subsequently the Government legislation becomes law, then Government Act revokes the Sinn F&eacute;in Act.  The Minister of State might clarify that point.  It is important that they mirror each other on the range of options now open to the office.  That is my understanding of what is proposed and we support it.</p></speech>

The text was not transposed into the Government Bill in error.  The proposed amendment seeks to address this gap.  It is a technical amendment to restore the position to that which currently exists.</p><p>There are separate existing superannuation schemes, one covering the Ombudsman and deputy Ombudsman and another covering the staff of the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau.  The administration of these schemes comes under the aegis of the council at present and will pass to the ombudsman under the amalgamation.  The intention is that surplus funds in these schemes will be paid into the Exchequer with a view to these funds being returned when they are needed to pay superannuation benefits.  However, section 3(2)(b) only permits the Minister to make payments in respect of complaints regarding pension providers.  This additional enabling provision is required to allow the Minister to make these payments in respect of the superannuation schemes.</p></speech>

The merits of mediation as a form of dispute resolution have been discussed numerous times during the passage of this Bill and Deputy Doherty's Bill through the Houses.</p><p>Mediation is a process whereby the parties to the complaint try to reach a solution through agreement with the assistance and support of a mediator rather than through an immediate investigation of the complaint and a decision from the ombudsman on the complaint.</p><p>If it works well, it should be a less onerous, faster and more amicable means of reaching an outcome for both parties.  Not long ago, the cases that were resolved by mediation in the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau were at a level below 1%.  Following a strategic review and re-organisation of the office, I understand that the number of cases resolved via mediation is now close to 60%.  I am keen to encourage such improvements in the levels of mediation.  For this reason, and for the avoidance of any doubt about the support for mediation as a conflict resolution tool, I am reverting to the original text on mediation in the existing legislation, which obliges the ombudsman to try to resolve a complaint by mediation as far as possible.  The previous text in the Government Bill, as passed by Committee, stated that the ombudsman &quot;may&quot; try to resolve a complaint by mediation in circumstances where he deems it appropriate.  I prefer the drafting of my amendment as it fits neatly with the other provisions.</p><p>Section 12 refers to possible resolution of complaints by informal means, which may happen immediately on receipt of a complaint.  Therefore, I prefer the wording in amendment No. 9 rather than the wording in Deputy Doherty's amendment No. 10.</p></speech>

We had a discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  I took the view that the mediation section that the Government has put forward is welcome.  I echo what the Minister of State has said in terms of welcoming the positive results that we are seeing from the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau in terms of the use of mediation.  It is a voluntary process.</p>  <p>  The change in subsection (1) that would have removed "shall" and replaced it with "may" could have been used by some financial institutions as a way of trying to avoid mediation.  That was the reason for some concern.  We tabled an amendment, but we are happy to accept the Government drafting.  It is identical in function, but the drafting, as the Minister of State pointed out, fits more neatly with his legislation.</p>  <p>  For full information, amendment No. 9 has exactly the same text that appears in the Seanad Bill, which is the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  On that basis, we will not proceed with amendment No. 10.</p></speech>

We all accept that, where possible, it is preferable for disputes to be resolved by mediation.  We should bear in mind that all of the cases that go before the ombudsman's office have already been the subject of an internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned and it has not been possible to resolve the issue.  Where possible, mediation should be given every opportunity to work.  It is the most desirable outcome, but it is not going to be possible in all cases and the full powers of the ombudsman will have to be deployed to resolve those issues.</p></speech>

My Private Member's Bill has provided an impetus and put a bit of energy behind the Government pursuing this legislation.  At its core, the legislation is about the merger of two offices, the Ombudsman's office and the Pensions Ombudsman's office.  Crucially for the consumer, the measures in the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Member's Bill are replicated in full in this legislation.  It will give greater consumer protection to those who have been locked out of the system as a result of the six-year rule.  When we pass my legislation in a couple of minutes, thousands of people will be able to access justice as a result.  If this legislation passes all Stages of the Seanad, I will be happy that when it repeals the provisions in my Bill, it will insert the provisions into this.  I am glad of that and thank the Government for its support.  It is important to say that the core element in this Bill is the six-year rule.  Not only is it contained in my Private Member's Bill but Deputy McGrath had a similar Bill on it.  It is something on which there is cross-party support and it is crucial we have it through before the end of this term.</p></speech>

From our point of view, the key issue from a consumer perspective is the six-year rule.  The reality is many consumers have been denied recourse to the Ombudsman because of the constraints imposed by that six-year rule.  It is a vital reform and I hope this or the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation can be enacted without further delay.</p></speech>

It is important to note it is the first Bill initiated by an Opposition Member to pass the D&aacute;il.  More important is the fact that thousands of people each year are denied access to justice because of the six-year rule.  We have figures from the ombudsman's office that tells us that in certain years up to 1,000 people were denied having their case heard because of the six-year rule.  We know that many others do not even make the complaint because they are not aware of the six-year rule.  This legislation will open the doors of justice to many individuals who believe there has been wrongdoing carried out against them by large financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies in the sale of long-term financial products.  Many consumers have contacted my office down through the years, particularly in recent months as this legislation was passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is retrospective in nature.  Individuals who have made a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman which it was not able to hear because of the six-year rule will be able to resubmit their application as soon as the President signs this legislation into law.  They will be able to have their case heard and they will be able to access justice once and for all.</p>  <p>  I am delighted this Bill has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be wrong for me not to point out the work that the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has done on this legislation, in particular by researcher and analyst, Paul Joyce.  FLAC produced a report a number of years ago, entitled Redressing the Imbalance.  It has provided a huge service to the State down through the years.  This legislation comes from its report so I welcome the work of FLAC and its senior policy analyst, Paul Joyce.  There has been great co-operation across the political divide and support from the departmental officials to bring this Bill to the point where it can pass into law.  Without that assistance, it would not have been possible.  I thank everyone for their help during this process, including the staff in my office, especially Declan O'Farrell.</p></speech>

This Bill has been in the making for quite some time.  There was also a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill which we withdrew because there were essentially three Bills proposing to do the same thing.  It is very fine work by Deputy Doherty and his staff and team.  I commend them on that work and acknowledge the support and co-operation of the Minister, the staff in the Department and the Oireachtas finance committee.  It is an example of how the system can work.  It is slow and tedious and it takes too long at times but it is fine work.  It will help individuals to get access to the ombudsman and hopefully get the justice they deserve.</p></speech>

I said when I took up office that I would do the best I could to facilitate the passage of legislation I thought to be good legislation.  It was improved upon and we discussed matters on each occasion and did not go beating each other up.  We improved on this Bill and the Government one time and time again.  As Deputy McGrath said, the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill was withdrawn.  It is an example of how the process has worked better.  It is the first Opposition Bill that has gone through in this way.  I thank Deputy Doherty and his staff, Deputy McGrath and Department officials.  There was a lot of toing and froing and getting it back.  To some extent we were breaking new ground.  We have broken new ground and we have brought forward good legislation.  On this occasion the political structures have worked.  It is retrospective, dating back to 2002.  The six years will now apply and if people had cases, they will now have the opportunity to present them.  I thank everyone concerned, including the Bills Office, Department staff, Deputy McGrath and, in particular, Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400024#W00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to introduce the Bill to the House.  As the rather unwieldy Title indicates, the Bill contains measures which will amend the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004.</p>  <p>  The Long Title of the Bill also reflects the breadth of issues which I and my Department are dealing with.  Since taking up office a few weeks ago, I have been struck by the scale of the operations being undertaken by my Department.  It is fair to say, that in one way or another, the work of my Department touches on the lives of every person in the State.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us today reflects this very point.  It incudes, for instance, a measure which confirms the special position within the welfare code of guardians who take on the responsibility for caring for children who have been orphaned or whose parents are unable to take care of them.  The Bill includes a measure supporting people with a disability who take up employment.  The Bill will seek to offer greater protection to people who are members of defined benefit pension schemes.  The Bill also provides for amendments relating to the Civil Registration Service, which covers key life events.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us today is, in a sense, a work in progress.  Many Members present will be keenly aware of the issues affecting the defined benefit pensions sector in Ireland in recent times.  I will be introducing amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in this area.  Given the complexities involved, it simply was not possible to have these included in the published Bill.  While we will have an opportunity to consider the amendments in greater detail, the fundamental point I want to make now is that the key purpose of the amendments is to better protect the benefits of scheme members.</p>  <p>  Until now, there has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to engage with trustees and members to address proactively deficits in their defined benefit schemes, nor have conditions been put on employers, who wish to terminate their liability, to contribute to their defined benefit schemes.  That will no longer be the case.</p>  <p>  As Members know, defined benefit schemes have been facing substantial challenges over the past two decades.  To put it simply, the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the investment returns earned by pension schemes.  I acknowledge that many employers and scheme trustees have made great efforts to ensure the ongoing viability of their schemes.  The best outcomes are achieved when trustees, employers and members negotiate to reach agreement on what is needed to secure the scheme's viability.  The amendments I will be tabling on Committee Stage seek to underpin this approach.</p>  <p>  The amendments will not permit an employer to walk away at short notice.  They will provide for a 12-month notification period to enable negotiation and discussion between all sides.  Where a scheme is in deficit, it will require the employer to enter into dialogue with the trustees to develop a plan to sustain the scheme.  It is only where these steps have failed and no funding proposal is in place that the Pensions Authority will determine a funding obligation in the form of a schedule of contribution amounts and dates by which those amounts have to be paid.  These measures will encourage employers to engage with trustees and members to ensure schemes are well funded and managed.  I should mention also that the provisions will allow for entitlement, in certain circumstances, to a spouse&rsquo;s pension for civil partners and same-sex spouses who are members of occupational pension schemes.</p>  <p>  As Members know, the general scheme of the Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny on 1 June, and I thank the Chairman, who has just arrived in the Chamber, and members of the committee for the manner in which they engaged positively in that process.  The committee, in its report, highlighted concerns about heads 4 and 5 of the general scheme which dealt with measures designed to reinforce the Department&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to deter fraudulent claiming of welfare payments.  Having had the opportunity to reflect on head 5 of the Bill and also having listened to the concerns of the committee, I decided to drop this measure entirely from the Bill.  Regarding head 4 of the Bill, Members will know that I have secured the agreement of the Government to accept a proposed amendment from Deputy O&rsquo;Dea of Fianna F&aacute;il which will provide that only the names of individuals convicted of fraud in excess of &euro;5,000 would or could be published.  Obviously it is up to the House to determine whether to accept that and we will talk about it in the course of this debate.</p>  <p>  The Bill contains 19 sections and I will give a brief overview of its provisions.  Sections, 1, 2, 10 and 13 are standard provisions relating to the Title of the Bill, any necessary commencements, and definitions of certain terms used throughout the Bill.  Section 3 is an administrative amendment which simply provides certainty on the payments to guardians.  In line with policy and practice in my Department, it provides that payments to a guardian in respect of an orphan do not affect the rights of the guardian to claim welfare payments in his or her own right.</p>  <p>  Section 4 provides, from the beginning of 2018, for the quarterly compilation and publication of the list of persons who have been convicted of an offence under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 or welfare fraud related offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  The aim here is simply to increase public awareness of the consequences of such activity.  After three months the list would be removed from the Department&rsquo;s website which will be refreshed.</p>  <p>  Section 5 introduces a number of changes to the arrangements governing the use of the public services card, PSC.  It will allow for a cardholder&rsquo;s date of birth, solely at their own request, to be inscribed on the PSC, in order that it can then be used by the cardholder as an age related identity card if they so wish.  This section also allows the cardholder, on a voluntary basis, to use the card to confirm their identity in certain circumstances.  Currently, a body that is not explicitly specified in the Act is prohibited from accepting the PSC as proof of identity. even in circumstances where the cardholder voluntarily tenders it for this purpose.  This amendment will permit a customer to use the PSC at his or her own discretion without causing the person or entity accepting the PSC to be guilty of an offence.  The section also clarifies that the ownership of a PSC is at all times vested in the Minister for Social Protection, in line with the practice for the use of other documents such as passports and driving licences.</p>  <p>  Section 6 provides for the repeal of section 282 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which provides for reduced cost life event certificates, such as birth, marriage and death certificates.  This provision will be formally introduced in parallel with the commencement of sections 27(a) and 30(a) of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014.  Consequently, the powers to set the level of reduced cost fees will lie with the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Section 7 provides that decisions to award a social welfare benefit or payment which are to the benefit of a claimant can be made by an automated information system.  Importantly, it also provides that decisions which deny entitlement to a benefit or payment must in all cases be made by a deciding officer.  In other words, IT decisions will be in the affirmative only.  All others will have human interaction.</p>  <p>  Section 8 is concerned with the arrangements governing the recovery of benefits from compensators, typically insurance companies, in cases where a compensator is paying compensation in respect of the same injury, accident or disease that gave rise to a claim for a social welfare payment.  This section provides for the inclusion of supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, in so far as it relates to payments paid as a result of a personal injury, on the list of benefits which may be recovered from the compensator by the Minister.  The inclusion of SWA in the list of specified recoverable benefits will enable full recovery from the compensator of the basic supplementary welfare allowance payment, together with any exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments that arise as a consequence of the injury, accident or disease that gave rise to a claim for compensation.  This section of the Bill also provides for the adjustment of the period within which the Minister must respond to a request to provide a statement of recoverable benefits to the compensator from four weeks to 25 working days.</p>  <p>  Section 9 addresses the fact that, under the existing legislative provisions, recipients of disability allowance, blind pension and certain supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme only benefit from the disregard of earnings from employment where the employment, or self-employment in the case of disability allowance, has been certified by the recipient&rsquo;s general practitioner as being of a rehabilitative nature.  In line with the recently published report of an interdepartmental group established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the Make Work Pay report, this section dispenses with the practice of distinguishing between employment of a rehabilitative nature and work more generally.  We view all work to be of a rehabilitative nature.  In addition to benefiting recipients of the schemes mentioned, this change will also reduce the administrative workload for GPs and the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Section 11 provides for some of the necessary amendments to section 43 of the Pensions Act to underpin the annual preparation of actuarial funding certificates and funding standard reserve certificates and to require the submission of such certificates to the Pensions Authority within six months of the effective date.  Further changes will be introduced on Committee Stage to complete the changes required.</p><p>Section 12 provides for amendments to section 49 of the Act to specify that funding proposals must be submitted to the Pensions Authority within six months of the effective date of the actuarial funding certificate or funding standard reserve certificates to which it refers.</p> <p> Sections 14 and 15 provide for the deletion of the provisions in the Civil Registration Act 2004 concerning the terms of office of an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, Registrar General, and an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir C&uacute;nta, the Deputy Registrar General, as those are unduly restrictive and unnecessary in practice.</p> <p> Section 16 addresses a gap in the current legislation by providing a role for a "qualified informant", usually the next of kin or relative, in the registration of a death where a coroner is involved.</p> <p> Sections 17 and 18 extend the existing legislative provisions which provide that records of births, deaths and marriages may be shared by the General Register Office with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to provide that those records may also be shared with a body under the aegis of that Minister.</p> <p> Section 19 provides that the country of birth and the country of citizenship of a deceased person are to be added to the particulars of a death to be entered in the register of deaths.  This provision, as well as providing a richer source of data in the records of deaths held by the General Register Office, also responds to the State's obligations under EU regulations in this area.</p> <p> I had hoped to be able to bring this Bill into law before the summer recess but that will not now be possible.  In the intervening period, my officials, together with their counterparts in the Office of the Attorney General, will be working to refine the text of the amendments, in particular around defined-benefit schemes, which will be introduced on Committee Stage in the autumn.</p> <p> The reason we are here to talk about this particular Bill today arises from four different Private Members' Bills introduced by Members of this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  One was from Deputy Willie O'Dea of Fianna F&aacute;il, another was from Deputy Willie Penrose of the Labour Party and there was one from his colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, and the fourth Bill was from Deputies John Brady, David Cullinane, and Denise Mitchell of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Bill is an amalgamation of issues that have been recognised by all parties in this House.  I acknowledge everybody's contribution and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies from all sides of the House on the content of the Bill in the course of the Second Stage debate and in particular when we get to Committee and Report Stages, please God in the autumn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400025#X00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister on her elevation to high office and wish her the very best in persuading her colleagues, in particular her colleague at the Department of Finance, to make adequate provision to ensure that the progressivity we managed to get reintroduced in budgets last year is continued.  She can be assured of our unstinting support in that regard.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il does not intend to oppose Second Stage of the Bill but, nevertheless, a number of issues arise in regard to the Bill.  The first relates not to what is in the Bill before the House today but to what is not in it.  The Minister has told us that the provisions relating to defined-benefit pensions, which are extremely important, will be debated on Committee Stage and amendments in that regard will be presented in the autumn.  Members will recall that the pre-legislative stage of the Bill was debated approximately eight weeks ago and at that stage we had proposals on pensions but they have been taken out.  In spite of the committee's recommendations, in the interim period the Civil Service was not able to reflect the views of the committee in writing and we must now wait until the autumn.  When those Committee Stage amendments are finally drafted could the Minister let us have them as soon possible because the issue is extremely important?</p>  <p>  The heads of the Bill that we debated in the Joint Committee on Social Protection would have given rise to unintended consequences and in some cases unwelcome unintended consequences not just for the various categories of pensioner but also for current employees of a company.  In so far as I can ascertain, what the Department is trying to achieve is that if an employer is a position to maintain a defined-benefit pension scheme he or she should not be allowed to walk away from it.  Second, if an employer is in a position to partially maintain a defined-benefit pension scheme he or she would not be able to afford the full amount but a lesser amount could be afforded and that should be strongly encouraged and in the last instance, compelled.  It is difficult to get the appropriate wording and to get the balance right and I wish the Department every success in that regard but I would like to see the amendment as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The argument is put consistently that there are two types of employer in that context.  First, one has the employer who deliberately sets up a defined-benefit pension scheme, which will benefit the contributors when they retire, and second, one has the employer who does not bother doing that, and who does not take on that responsibility.  The argument is that if employers take on that responsibility why should we put extra burdens on them because they have taken it on voluntarily, as it were, and they are at a competitive disadvantage to those who have not taken on that burden.  Unfortunately, that does not tell the whole story.  The defined-benefit pension scheme was the usual type of pension scheme in operation when a lot of companies were set up, or at least when they established their pension scheme.  In so far as defined-benefit pension schemes are concerned, employees have been paying into them, sometimes for a lifetime, with certain legitimate expectations at the end.  It is wrong for an employer who is obviously wealthy enough to maintain those payments without any danger to the company or the future of the company to be just allowed to walk away from them.  Where an employer can afford to partially maintain a scheme, he or she should be forced to do that.  I agree with those objectives but I look forward to seeing precisely how the Government wishes to achieve them.</p>  <p>  In my Bill, to which the Minister referred, there was a provision whereby the Minister would ask the Pensions Authority to look at how minimum funding standard is determined, because that is at the root of a lot of the problems.  In many cases that has created an artificial deficit in pension schemes.  My proposal was that the Pensions Authority would be asked to look at that and come back to us with its views, observations and recommendations within six months.  The previous Minister, Deputy Varadkar, undertook to ask the Pensions Authority to do that but he said there was no need for legislation.  To the best of my recollection that was more than six months ago.  What is the status of the authority's examination?  Perhaps the Minister would advert to it when she responds.  We would like to see the results as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The clarification on guardian's payment is welcome.  A guardian's payment is a payment for the child although it goes to the guardian.  The issue of maintenance payments was raised during our pre-legislative discussions on the heads of the Bill.  The answer given by the Department's officials at that stage was that the maintenance payments were for the individual maintained and therefore it would be wrong to disregard those.  However, my understanding is that in a lot of court cases and in out-of-court settlements one will find that a specific portion of the maintenance payment is given specifically for the child so I think the question of disregarding that should be looked at.</p>  <p>  There was an extraordinary provision in the heads of the Bill that was originally published, namely, that if one had defrauded the Department of Social Protection one would go before the courts and be punished in the same way as anybody else who committed a criminal offence but there was an extra provision whereby the Department could punish the person as well.  It was a parallel system of punishment, which was very strongly opposed at the committee.  The opposition to it was very well articulated by Senator Kevin Humphreys of the Labour Party who is a former Minister of State in the Department.  I applaud the Minister for taking out the measure.  It was not necessary and quite possibly was unconstitutional.  I welcome its absence from the Bill before us today.</p>  <p>  The Bill also contains a provision on earnings disregard for people on disability allowance, blind pension and supplementary welfare allowance.  The rule up to now was that in order to get the earnings disregard one would have to have a medical certificate to state that the work would rehabilitate the person in some way.</p><p>That was standard.  In my long years of experience, I never came across a case in which the doctor refused to issue such a certificate.  The fact is that work is by definition rehabilitative anyway.  I welcome that.</p> <p> I point out to the Minister that my colleague, Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has suggested foster care payments received from the United Kingdom should also be disregarded.  I think the Department was not entirely ill-disposed towards that suggestion.  The officials were prepared to consider it.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know the position on that when she is replying.</p> <p> According to the Department, the changes introduced for the public services card are designed to make people's lives easier.  If one's date of birth is inscribed on the public services card, it can be used for all sorts of transactions and interactions with public bodies, such as motor taxation, passports etc.  Broadly speaking, this is welcome.  However, the view has been reiterated many times that the Irish are not in favour of the idea of a compulsory identity card.  This was raised at the committee and the officials gave us an absolute assurance that we would never arrive at a situation in which the public services card would be used in respect of commercial transactions or to prove one's identity to private operators.  I would like the Minister to reassure us again on that matter.</p> <p> The original head in respect of automated transactions was somewhat unwieldy.  I welcome the change in the legislation before us.  I ask the Minister to address the question of how secure the data will be in view of the dangers of hacking.  As I understand the section, the change in respect of births, deaths and marriages simply clarifies which Minister is responsible for setting the charges. </p> <p> I must confess that I still have some concerns about section 8.  The general law currently is that if someone who is pursuing a civil case for damages, as a result of an accident for example, has to rely on social welfare in the meantime, once the damages are awarded the amount paid by the Department of Social Welfare is recovered and the damages reduced by that amount.  As I understand it, the Bill seeks to include supplementary welfare allowance in the amount recovered by the Department, which was not previously included.  I am worried about the possibility of a double deduction.  When somebody is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and waiting for a social welfare benefit to come through, provided they qualify for a payment, the benefit will be granted and backdated to the time of application.  The supplementary welfare allowance paid is then deducted from the arrears of the benefit.  In the case of an award of damages, I do not want a situation in which the full benefit and also the supplementary welfare payment is deducted from the award.  I want to make sure that is clear in the section as I am not sure that it is currently.</p> <p> One of the most controversial provisions in the Bill lies in the couple of sections in respect of publishing the names of people who have been found guilty of defrauding the Department of Social Protection.  I said at the committee and reiterate today that I am totally opposed to social welfare fraud.  It is a particularly despicable form of crime.  I have seen instances in the media of people who deliberately set out in a planned and calculated manner to defraud the Department of Social Protection.  Given that we spent about &euro;20 billion or so on social protection last year, which comprises a very large chunk of our public expenditure, this is a reprehensible crime.  Nevertheless, I am not quite sure what is going to be achieved by naming and shaming.</p> <p> In the usual situation, if somebody is taken to court and convicted of defrauding the Department of Social Protection, it is going to be in all the newspapers and is certainly going to be publicised locally.  I have seen several of those cases published nationally as well.  The person convicted will also be subject to whatever penalties the court decides to apply and will have to pay back the money, which is only right and proper.  The previous Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said the reason for naming and shaming was to deter fraud.  If the possibility of being dragged into court, having one's name plastered all over the newspapers to the knowledge of all one's neighbours etc., and accepting whatever other attendant penalties the court wanted to impose, is not a sufficient deterrent, I really do not think the extra possibility that, three months afterwards, one's name would be published on some sort of list as a social welfare fraudster is going to make a difference.</p> <p> There was also some misunderstanding, some of which I am afraid was deliberately created, of the figures.  A figure of &euro;500 million was mentioned.  To be honest, that figure is laughable.  The way the Department operates, as I understand it, is that the provisions from savings come to something in excess of &euro;500 million.  These come about, for example, if somebody who is in receipt of the pension dies and the pension stops.  That is a saving.  If somebody in receipt of jobseeker's allowance happens to win the lottery, he or she is no longer entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  That is a saving.  When we add it all up it comes to about &euro;500 million.</p> <p> Sometimes the person who wins the lottery might continue to draw jobseeker's allowance for a few extra weeks or months or whatever, in which case there is an overpayment.  The figure for overpayments, which are also included in the &euro;500 million, is about &euro;110 million.  Of that &euro;110 million, however, fraud only accounts for &euro;41 million.  That is not &euro;500 million.  The figure is small in the context of a departmental budget of over &euro;20 billion.  Of course, &euro;41 million is a considerable sum and is not to be sneezed at.  There are a lot of good things the Minister could do with it.  However, I do not think the figure for fraud is going to go up or down because of these name and shame provisions.  Three years ago, I understand, the figure was about &euro;61.5 million.  It has dropped quite considerably.  The systems in place in the Department are working.</p> <p> I agree with the Minister's suggestion of an amendment to take out people whose cases involve less than &euro;5,000.  I do not want to be seen to be doing any favours for people who are calculatedly defrauding the Department of huge sums of money.  Nevertheless, I am not moved from my viewpoint that the provision is going to make no difference in practice.  Furthermore, the provision has a negative side.  It reinforces a stereotype and a negative impression that has been put out, particularly by certain sections of the media, that the vast majority of people on social welfare, or a huge chunk of them, are defrauding the system.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  My colleague, Deputy John Curran, who is chairman of the social protection committee, recently submitted a parliamentary question as to how many cases were dealt with in 2016, the last year for which figures are available.  The answer he got was that there were 130 cases for which a punishment was applied by the court.  Of those, 41 were in respect of under &euro;5,000.  There were 36 more cases in which the Probation Act was applied, of which 15 were under &euro;5,000.  If we include child benefit - of course we can have fraud in that area as well - payments from the Department of Social Protection are made to almost 2.5 million people and out of that group 166 were convicted of fraud.  That gives the lie to the notion that there is widespread fraud.</p><p> There is no suggestion that lists of those involved in other types of fraud, including white-collar crime and financial fraud, or in more serious crimes such as murder and armed robbery should be compiled and published on a regular basis.  It would not do any good because the people in those Departments know it would not provide any deterrent, just as it will not in this case.  It has been mentioned that lists of tax cheats who owe the Revenue Commissioners money and are forced to pay interest and penalties are regularly published, but that is different because, by and large, such cases do not go through the courts.  The public would never know the identities of such people if such lists were not published.  That is not the case here because details of social welfare fraud prosecutions are published all over the newspapers.  Lists of tax cheats are published so that the public can know who is involved in such activity.</p> <p> I understand that it is the Department's intention to publish a list within three months of the end of the quarter in which the conviction occurred.  Serious and searching questions have been raised about how other organisations will be prevented from republishing or sharing that list on a regular basis.  For example, I have been asked to ascertain from the Minister whether the information will be removed from the Department's search engine.  The Department gave the joint committee an absolute assurance that there would be no question of this list being available for any further use.  When the Minister replies at the end of this debate, I would like her to indicate the precise measures the Department is taking in this regard.  It has been suggested to me that the stated reason for these provisions - that they will heighten public awareness of the consequences of social welfare fraud - will not be sufficient to pass muster with the Data Protection Commissioner.  Has the commissioner been consulted about these provisions?  What observations, if any, have been made by the commissioner in this regard?</p> <p> I would like to bring a number of issues that are not covered in this Bill to the attention of the Minister because they will need to be dealt with in the social welfare Bill that will follow the budget.  An ESRI report this morning recommended that the retirement age for pensioners should be increased to 70.  The increase in the retirement age from 65 to 66 has created enormous problems.  I know people in my constituency who have worked for over 40 years.  Having been forced to retire at the age of 65, they find it extremely difficult to have to sign on for the labour every week.  It is outside their normal experience.  God knows what the position would be if they had to sign on until the age of 70.  Many people cannot work beyond a certain age because of the type of work they do.  It would be preposterous to expect people who do heavy manual work to work until they are 70 years of age.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in both drafted and introduced Bills to end the right of employers to compel people to retire at a certain age.  We deferred to Sinn F&eacute;in because its Bill was introduced first and because we were anxious to bring into law the abolition of mandatory retirement at the discretion of employers.  In general, there is no law that says one has to retire at a certain age.</p></speech>

On 15 June last, the committee was addressed by a group that wants to be brought within the terms of the Dr. David Parris case.  I understand that the circumstances are exactly the same.

I was asked to come in at the last minute.  I have a background in this area, having served as my party's social welfare spokesperson at one point.  As a hardworking Deputy, I deal with many social welfare cases every day.  I am pleased that we have been given an opportunity speak on the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  I welcome a number of aspects of it.</p>  <p>  Section 3 is a sensible proposal that seeks to ensure the individual welfare rights of a person who is the guardian of an orphan are not adversely affected by payments that are made to him or her in that capacity.  I think that clarification is very welcome.  I know from my past experience of dealing with this area that one of the difficulties encountered by parents and others in caring roles, including guardians who are looking after children, is that there is a difference between the foster payment and the guardian's payment.  The child being cared for by the person receiving one of these payments is required to have been abandoned.  This issue arises quite frequently in the Dublin area, with which I am most familiar.  It probably arises in other areas as well.  If one of the parents of someone who is on drugs is dead and the other parent is living a chaotic life, that person's child might be taken in by his or her grandparents.  I think it is unfair for the abandonment stipulation to apply in such cases.  Regardless of the frame of mind a parent is in and the awful things that are happening in his or her life, the idea of signing something to say that he or she is abandoning a child to its grandparents is problematic.  Perhaps the Minister for Social Protection can look at this at some stage in her new role.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.</p>  <p>  I would like to speak about the section of the Bill that deals with the rights of people with disabilities to work.  As we know, in Ireland people with disabilities are half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  Collectively, we agree that this needs to change.  People with disabilities should not be in fear of losing medical cards and disability supports because they want to enter the workforce.  I think we are going in the right direction in this regard, but we are doing so slowly.  When we talk to people who have impairments, they tell us that this frustrates them the most.  They cannot move out of the poverty associated with this area of social welfare because of the supports they need.  Changes in this area are very welcome and will be of great benefit to citizens with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I want to take issue with other aspects of this legislation, such as the controversial section of the Bill that provides for the publication of the names and addresses of people who have been convicted of welfare fraud.  I do not think we should do down this road.  I will outline some of the reasons I am uncomfortable with it.  When these cases go to court, they are generally reported on in local newspapers.  The details are published by the courts.  This is being proposed as a further deterrent.  I am aware that the names of tax defaulters are published by the Revenue Commissioners when the total amount of tax, interest and penalties owed exceeds &euro;35,000.  We are talking about allowing the names and addresses of those involved in fraud to the tune of &euro;5,000 to be published.  From where did the &euro;5,000 figure come?  I would be interested to know why this is happening.</p>  <p>  Certain problems in society are viewed from two different viewpoints.  I am not justifying the behaviour of those who are involved in criminality such as white-collar crime or social welfare fraud.  Two different approaches are taken in cases in which people owe money to the Department.  If someone discovers after many years that he or she has been underpaid and the fault lies with the Department, there is a sunset clause that ensures the Department does not have to pay after a certain period has elapsed.  If an individual owes money to the Department because he or she made an error when filling in a form or something of that nature, the Department will follow that person to his or her grave to ensure that some sort of agreement is reached or ceiling is set about the debt that is owed.</p><p>This needs to be looked at as it is unfair.  There seems to be one approach for the Department and the mistakes that it made, and another approach for the welfare recipient or the person that is redundant.</p> <p> This whole idea of the welfare fraud campaign was based on figures that were nowhere near the actual figures involved.  The figures for savings in 2016 went from a headline figure of &euro;506 million to an actual figure of &euro;41 million.  There is a view that calculations were made that were based on flawed, utterly bizarre assumptions and make-believe numbers were created.  There is a view held by many on this side of the Chamber that it was to give someone a lift in the leadership bid for that person's political party.  The social welfare fraud campaign labelled a whole cohort of people and suggested that somehow, everyone who is in receipt of social welfare payments had something suspect about them or a question mark over them.  It feeds into the negativity that those people do not want to work, like to spend all day in bed at home, are wasters or are just not interested in contributing to society.  As we know through our own lives, our own work and from those who are in receipt of social welfare payments, the vast majority of people who are reliant on this payment have no choice.  They would prefer to be out of this position and back in gainful employment but for various reasons, including the lack of employment opportunities, lack of education and all sorts of other reasons, they cannot do that.  I am uncomfortable with that campaign.  We need to change the narrative that people in receipt of social welfare payments are somehow taking all the time.  In many cases, I know of such people who still contribute to their communities.  They work in community centres and help out within the community itself within the parameters of what they are allowed to do under social welfare regulations.</p> <p> How was the figure of &euro;5,000 arrived at?  Has the Government consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner on this provision?  When this Bill was considered by the committee during pre-legislative scrutiny, a number of provisions were in place for people on defined benefit schemes.  These were not perfect but provided some support for members and some sort of long-awaited Government response to the crisis in the defined benefit scheme as witnessed in the case of Independent News and Media and that is now unfolding in Irish Life.  These protections have been wiped out in the Bill.  The question to ask is why it happened.  One need only consider the situation in Irish Life with the defined benefit scheme to know that stronger provisions are necessary.  Our view is the Government is hanging workers out to dry, is facilitating companies walking away from their own pension commitments and is letting them away with ripping off their employees.  The Irish Life pension scheme has a huge surplus.  It has assets of &euro;1.2 billion and has never been in deficit, yet the scheme is being wound down.  What is the Government saying to such companies that simply decide to take the liability off their balance sheets and renege on their pension obligations?</p> <p> Every year, this Bill gives an opportunity to do something positive for the most vulnerable in society and the Bill contains a number of tidy-up measures and some anomalies will be fixed in this Bill, which is welcome.  For lone parents, however, the Government could have ended the child maintenance scheme being calculated as an income for rent supplement and that money could be classed as something for the child.  For young jobseekers, the Government could have ended the ongoing discrimination introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and continued by Fine Gael where their age determines that they receive &euro;102 or &euro;147 a week and they are expected to live off that.  For older people, I touched on the matter of the farce of the 65 year olds being asked to go on to jobseeker's payment.  I find in my constituency that individuals come in who were unaware of this until the point at which they thought they were going to get the payment and who were then put in this situation where they must sign on.  I do not know how many people I have had in tears in my office.  The idea of very proud people who have never received a social welfare payment in their lives but who were looking forward to retiring being obliged to sign on is wrong.  This issue needs to be reconsidered.</p> <p> A Bill has been put forward by my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, which proceeded to Committee Stage.  The difficulty is that as it needs a money message from the Department, it is really going nowhere.  Everyone who comes in asks if it is going to be resolved.  I say that I believe it will be, that it is the will of the House and that everyone here, including the Government, the Opposition and everyone else, wants it to happen.  I acknowledge there is a cost factor related to it but we need to collectively agree that it needs to be moved on.  The idea of people being obliged to sign on at that age, who have never been in that circumstance, is wrong.  The other way it used to be was to put people on community employment, CE, schemes or such for the year.  It is an anomaly.  We all collectively agree that it should be a choice.  If people want to work on, they should be given that opportunity and in many cases they are not because of the regulations that have been put in previously.</p> <p> There is a huge amount of anomalies within the Social Welfare Act.  They are not being addressed.  Perhaps some can be addressed on Committee Stage, but the fact that we pushed it and had this conversation here today is healthy, since we can raise the issues and give some sort of idea to the Minister of some of our concerns.  There is concern about section 5(2), which deals with the public service card.  I agree on the need for checks and balances but it seems that the card is being rolled out for everything.  The previous Minister was keen to tell us that this card was not compulsory.  However, to engage in any way with social protection systems, it is becoming increasingly mandatory.  One even needs a card now if one wants to do a driving test or to apply for one's first passport.  It is a piece of identification that is looked for now.</p> <p> There is a move towards including a cardholder's date of birth on the card.  Why is that necessary?  The concern from civil libertarians would be that it is a move towards a national ID card.  What is the idea?  I know that an identifier is needed but it is all information for fraudsters or anyone else who sought to rob a person's identity and so on.  If they have that, they would know a person's date of birth.  It raises serious questions about individual privacy and data protection.  Digital Rights Ireland has expressed serious concern that this is an attempt to introduce a national ID card by stealth and if it is, it has enormous implications for civil liberties and privacy.  That probably deserves a debate of its own.  In the Bill as published in May, there were aims to ensure that same-sex couples would enjoy the same rights and entitlements when it comes to occupational pension schemes as would any other couples.  Will the Minister explain why this provision has been removed?  It is a technical issue but what is the Government's intent in this area?</p> <p> There are other areas on which we hopefully will see action in the forthcoming budget.  I already mentioned that women are still facing discrimination in the State pension.  The changes being made affect 36,000 people, mainly women, who are on the reduced State pension.  It is to do with a person not having enough stamps or enough contributions and it is a huge issue.  People are shocked to find it out.  They plan in their minds.  Not everyone goes down the route of checking that they have everything.  They just believe that they have worked for all their lives and while there might have been a short gap, people are under the impression that they will get their pensions.  I urge the Minister to make pension equality for women a key priority going forward and all the parties in the House would work with the Minister on that.</p> <p> Another issue is tackling discrimination against younger people on jobseeker's allowance.  Consideration should be given to moving towards reversing this unfair discrimination.</p><p>I presume that will be a budgetary matter.  It was an unfair and cruel cut and it is being felt right across communities.  When I knock on doors and there are young people in the houses, I see the fact that the son or daughter is caught up in this situation is one of the issues for many families in financial difficulties and creates a huge burden and huge hardship for those families.</p> <p> As I stated at the outset, there are elements of the Bill that I welcome.  I have raised some of the issues that require greater scrutiny.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, on her elevation.  I have no doubt but that she will be ambitious in the role.  I think she will do a good job.  She is out of the traps quickly and at least ahead of her predecessor: there seems to be a far more sensible and realistic adoption of issues raised by the Opposition and I am glad to see she has already incorporated some of them into the Bill.  That is the way to make progress.  There is no use being antagonistic and setting up false rows at the beginning.  I will point out a couple of these issues to the Minister.  Many of the provisions in the Bill are effectively designed to tidy up other provisions, to streamline matters and to deal with some anomalies that have arisen in the social welfare code.  For the most part, we all welcome these provisions.  Where there are issues outstanding, we will address and debate them in a civilised way.</p><p>Section 3 is a change that carries with it much import.  Payments to guardians in respect of orphans clearly should not have affected guardianship rights, specifically the right of a guardian to claim social welfare payments in respect of the child in his or her own right.  This should never have been included or even contemplated for inclusion in the legislation.  Of course, this mirrors what happens in the taxation code regarding child benefit, which is where this anomaly was first addressed.  The social welfare code is therefore belatedly catching up with the taxation code in respect of child benefit, which is specifically for the child and should not be considered as the income of any of the parents involved.</p><p>I have already indicated my dislike and displeasure - even in person to the Minister - of the measure contained in section 4.  As someone who practises in the courts and who often defends people in this area, I know it is a big ordeal to be prosecuted and brought to court, particularly for those who often may not have a third-level or even a second-level education.  It is difficult and a fairly traumatic experience.  Very often one makes the plea <i>ad misericordiam</i>on behalf of these people.  Quite frequently, a case appears in local news media, including newspapers, and the whole neighbourhood knows.  Very often, these people may have young children under the age of nine or ten and this affects them at school or wherever else.  If a taxpayer defaults, he or she is an adult and can take it on the chin: he or she does the crime and so must obey the rules and pay up the interest and penalties.  Then if his or her name appears in public as a tax defaulter, the person is an adult.  However, this measure would affect young children who may be at school.  Willie Penrose may meet a child and tell him or her that he saw his or her daddy's or mammy's name in the newspaper, and this affects people.  There is nothing more to be gained in this regard; the punishment has already been levied and the case has been advertised.</p><p>The good thing about this is that, after a week or so, the case disappears or it goes on and something else takes over.  I do not use Facebook or any of that social media stuff.  I do not believe in it and have no time for it all because the way people are going, they are trying to eliminate the postal service.  People send emails and all that.  No one knows how to write a letter nowadays.  Everything I send goes out in written form and in the post.  I do not just come in here and speak balderdash about supporting people in the postal service or post offices; I actually act.  Everything I send goes out by letter.  That is how we save the post offices.  I know about this so I am very eager that the post offices be saved.  Anyway, the Minister knows my view on section 4.  If one is a tax defaulter, the sum the Revenue Commissioners accept must be over &euro;33,000 under the Taxes Consolidation Act before one's name is published.  Why should a person in receipt of social welfare be treated any differently?  To hell's blazes, the Minister will do another good deed if she takes section 4 out.  People are already being punished, and rightly so.  Anyone who commits fraud deserves the punishment he or she gets, but the courts are already dealing with them.  The courts are a public forum and there are no <i>in camera</i>sittings for these types of cases.  The public knows, and that is the end of the matter.  I understand that old faddish ideas come into people's heads and that individuals like to come forward with innovative ideas.  People would see that those ideas are as mad as be damned if they would only examine them closely.</p><p>I agree with my colleagues that there are data protection issues and I am of the view that these must be addressed.  I do not deal with much of that stuff but I do not think those issues have been addressed or adverted to.  The Data Protection Commissioner may well have something to say about them.  However, I stay away from that type of thing because I have no interest in it.  I am the last of the Luddites, I suppose.</p><p>Head 5, which the Minister's predecessors tried to introduce, sought to provide the Minister with the power to punish someone convicted of social welfare fraud in our courts - an additional punishment.  Mother of the Divine Institutions, it has not been possible to do that since the Conroy case and that was heard nearly before most of us were born.  No Minister has the power to do that.  Deputy O'Dea, who is a former Minister, will remember the East Donegal Co-operative case.  He had to study it as part of his law degree course.  It curtails the power of the Executive.  The Minister cannot do anything in this regard; only the courts are empowered to judge citizens.  The powers the Minister was seeking were arbitrary and not properly defined.  There is already a procedure in place to recover payments as a result of fraud over a period.  Then the Minister was going to assess the gravity of offences in individual cases along with other relevant factors - Mother Divine - and impose a punishment afterwards.  At least the Minister is an intelligent person and got rid of this.</p></speech>

The administration of justice in criminal matters is constitutionally confined to the courts and the selection of a penalty following conviction is an integral part of the judicial function.  I was disappointed this got through because if one goes back to Cox <i>v</i>. Ireland in 1992, it was a case of game over, out to hell with it and it should not have been brought in.</p><p>I welcome some of the other measures in the Bill.  I do not want to get caught up in some of them.  Section 9 is a sensible provision.  For anyone who gets out of bed and goes to work, that is rehabilitative in itself.  This is why I want community employment, CE, schemes to be reviewed in order to allow people to avail of this.  It is very important to people who have nothing else to go to.  The very fact that they go to CE schemes and do their 19 hours is very important in rural parts of the country, and there are many people who do that.</p><p>What I am really concerned about is the pension situation.  My colleagues, Deputies Brady and O'Dea, and I have introduced Bills on this.  None of us claims to have the monopoly of wisdom or virtue, but we had to cry stop to an untrammelled gallop to the headlands to get out of defined benefit schemes.  These schemes were healthy from a financial perspective and an employer's perspective.  Of course, at the end of the day, many of them cleverly rushed to the headlands so they could distribute dividends to their shareholders.  That is what much of this was about.  The unfortunate people left behind were the contributors.  We had to cry stop.  A bit like the late John Healy, we were out crying stop well in advance.  It took a bit of convincing, and I know the officials in the Department of Social Protection might have been quite reluctant.  The people in the Office of the Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator would be doubly reluctant-----</p></speech>

It goes without saying that a significant and worrying crisis has developed over the past few years pertaining to defined benefits pensions, and the Minister mentioned this.  As I said, if things keep going as they appear to be going, it is a trajectory that will ultimately lead to a meltdown.  They will all be wiped.  Hardly any of them are left in any event.  They are being wiped out by the day.  Deputy O'Dea spoke about the minimum funding standard.  The standard, as designed, clearly overstates the scheme's liabilities and facilitates some employers taking advantage to welch on defined benefits.  They had this beautiful way of doing it.  I recall attending an ICTU conference and Fergus Whelan and those guys had this down to a tee.</p><p>There was a comprehensive analysis of the problem.  How can we prevent the demise of the defined benefit provision?  It was a compelling analysis of where the blame lies for a situation which will mean that hundreds of thousands of people at work today in our country are likely to be significantly worse off in retirement than they anticipate, having done the right thing all their lives by putting aside significant amounts of their hard-earned income into pension funds.  Our defined benefit pension deficits are calculated on a buy out basis, which means that a scheme is deemed to be in deficit unless it has enough assets at any one point in time to purchase annuities for each of the beneficiaries.  I do not know where this was made up, but it is leprechaun economics.  The current minimum funding standard overstates liabilities.  If we look at the UK, they do not apply anything like the minimum funding standard that we apply.  They think that we are crazy over here.  The regulator there regards the projections as misleading as they are based on deficits calculated on a buy out basis, reflecting exceptionally low bond yields, a cost to capital buffers and a profit margin for insurance companies built in.<br/><br/>Many schemes are unwell.  Many employers are very responsible and make contributions under the section 50 schemes.  Workers and unions work together.  As long as the regulator insists on valuing liabilities on the basis of German bond rates and annuity buy outs matters will only get worse for what is left.  Nobody in the UK is forced to buy annuities.  The only people who are actually forced to buy into Ireland's dysfunctional annuities market are the defined benefit schemes in wind up.  The people with defined contributions do not have to purchase them.  We have to end this.  We should call in all the pension regulators and tell them that it is time to stop.  The good work of trustees, the unions and employers mean that we can salvage something.  They have salvaged the section 50 agreements already.  There are many good employers out there and we cannot tar them all with the same brush.  However, that will all be rendered useless unless we stop this.  That is why this legislation is important.<br/><br/>I regret that we are not passing this legislation in full before the summer, because I am worried that in the eight, nine or ten weeks that we are off unscrupulous employers will run to the headland and say goodbye and leave the unfortunate workers, or their partners or wives, in the lurch waiting for pensions.  It is desperately important that we get our act together here.  There is no excuse.  They need not be crying wolf.  Some 90% of these defined benefit schemes are now closed to new members.  We are trying to protect those people who have already paid in.  Everyone believed that the defined benefit schemes were the best place to invest their funds, and if there was any risk the scheme, or the responsible employer, was to carry them.  What has transpired is that, just like the defined contribution schemes, it is the worker that carries the burden of risk.  We also have the issue of the defined benefit schemes being tied up with the State pension schemes.<br/><br/>Let us be clear.  The Government made the rules as to how those defined benefit schemes were to operate.  The Government introduced the legislative measures, for example revaluing the deferred pensions, the cost of which is added to the burden of active members.  The workers make their contributions and pay for the regulatory system, but their pensions were not protected.  Who is at fault?  The workers pay for everything, including the regulatory system, and the regulator's function appears to be just to adhere to the minimum funding standard, even though it might not be in the best interests of the members of the defined benefit scheme.  The FRS17 came in in 2002, and there is now the IAS19 of 2011.  The assumed liabilities scheme appears on a company's balance sheet.  My Bill was going to deal with that nicely.  Neither myself, Deputy Brady or Deputy O'Dea are experts in the area, but we are circling the wagons so that there will be no more escapes.  I proposed crystallising events to meet this.  When we introduced that Bill on behalf of the Labour Party last spring opportunistic companies were availing of the situation.  To repair their balance sheet resulted in dividends being payable to the shareholders, and the only losers would be the workers.  The company suffered no pain.  Events which have transpired on the defined benefit pension scheme over the last six month have lead me to question why the regulator insists on valuing liabilities on German bond rates and annuity buy outs.  Currently even the defined contribution members would have nothing to do with an annuity.  The UK Government changed its rules last year concerning personal annuities.  In any event, the question of whether there is a functioning annuities market in Ireland today arises.  ICTU stated that annuity prices in Ireland are a mathematical exercise in a non-existent, dysfunctional market.  Annuities are not affordable or good value for money, so why should defined benefit scheme members still be compelled to buy overpriced annuities?  That has to be reviewed.  It has to stop, and if legislation is required to enable this to happen then legislation amendments should be brought forward.<br/><br/>I have to mention the equality provision in this Bill.  My colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, brought forward a Pensions (Equal Pension Treatment in Occupational Benefits Scheme) (Amendment) Bill 2016.  That was intended to deal with what is now in place under head 14 of this Social Welfare Bill.  Senator Bacik brought that Bill forward last March as a result of the David Parris situation.  When this scheme was introduced she was very grateful to the then Minister - now Taoiseach Varadkar - for adopting the words of our Bill and placing them into the social welfare heads.  It is important to ensure equality for the small group of LGBT couples who have been denied equal treatment and pension rights.  Recently in the English courts this particular provision was applied.  Whatever little worries people may have had, we are under the same common law and so we can utilise the precedent.  It is a legacy issue left over after the marriage equality referendum was passed.  There are a small number of cases, as Deputy O'Dea referred to - I would support other cases if they are out there - where retired employees who were not legally permitted to marry persons of the same sex before a certain date were denied certain pension benefits.  The Parris <i>v</i>. TCD case, which went to Europe, included an argument that the TCD pension scheme was discriminatory because a TCD employee's partner would only be entitled to a survivor's pension if the employee had married or entered into a civil partnership before reaching the age of 60.  This is a very important but significant step towards rectifying continued discrimination against a small number of individuals who faced the same difficulty as David Parris under the pension schemes despite the passage of the equality referendum.  I believe that Senator Bacik was in contact with the Minister and received confirmation from him.  She was very grateful that the Committee Stage was included.<br/><br/>I read the heads of the Bill and had a discussion with the Minister, and was fortified in my view.  The heads of the Bill had some very interesting, forward thinking material, but it is disappointing that they did not reach the Bill.  There are sections in the Bill relating to actuarial calculations which are welcome, but they are very confined and it is important that we widen those.  Section 13, which gives pension authorities the power to determine a scheduled contribution for defined benefit schemes where they are in deficit and the employer is not engaged with trustees, is particularly engaging and exercises me most, because in my view it was the most important amendment.</p><p>It enabled the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of contributions that would restore the defined benefit pension schemes which do not satisfy the minimum funding standard or funding standard reserve to an adequate funding position in circumstances where the employer has not engaged with the trustees to develop and agree a funding proposal.  This scheduled contribution was enforceable as a debt by the trustees before the civil courts.  It would have meant that an employer could not walk away from a defined benefit scheme that did not meet the statutory minimum funding standards.  Without this amendment, the current statutory minimum funding standard means little when a scheme goes belly up.  The consequences of this for members of a defined benefit pension scheme have been and will continue to be catastrophic.  I am heartened to see that will be one of the most important amendments the Minister will bring forward, together with heads 11 and 12, requiring employers to give minimum notice of 12 months to members of defined benefits schemes, trustees and the Pensions Authority for ceasing contributions to defined benefit schemes whether that scheme was in deficit or not.  I know there can be a shorter time period, if it is agreed, but that would have prevented employers from making arbitrary and unilateral decisions to close defined benefit schemes without any notification to the members of the scheme.  That is extremely important.</p> <p> The proposed amendment also provides that where a scheme is already under a funding proposal the employer must continue to contribute during the contribution period at the rate agreed under the funding proposal.  That provides members of the scheme with some security heading into the wind up.  That is extremely important.  I look forward to those amendments.  I congratulate the Minister and have no doubt that she will work hard.  Like Deputy O'Dea, I would like to receive the amendments during the summer because it would be helpful to review them then. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400031#DD00200"><p>Like other Deputies, I read the earlier version of the Bill.  There are substantial changes between the draft and this version.  The hate campaign and class bias demonstrated by the former Minister in his attempt to win the leadership of Fine Gael, the campaign for Leo, however, remains as an attack on those who are allegedly committing welfare fraud.  The other striking change is in the means to be used to protect defined benefit pensions.  The balance of changes made and not made says much about the priorities of Fine Gael and this Government.</p>  <p>  It would be wonderful to see the Government devote the same outrage and energy to go after corporate fraud and tax evasion as it demonstrated in its campaign to go after social welfare fraud.  Instead, it is spending millions of euro to protect the Apple tax owed to us.  I am stating the obvious.  There is less interest in collecting tax revenue from some sources than there is in hounding a certain set of welfare recipients that seem to preoccupy the Government, and particularly the former Minister for Social Protection, for some time.  The campaign does not paint the reality.  For example, I have come across a few people being examined for social welfare fraud.  One family in Ballyfermot was examined in a confrontational and threatening way.  The result of the examination showed that they received an overpayment of &euro;60 per week.  It was not said but this should come out in the statistics, the same family is saving the State a fortune by caring for an elderly parent on a full-time permanent basis.  That woman should, or could otherwise, be occupying a bed and the services of the State but there is a family taking care of her and they are being overpaid a paltry &euro;60 a week and were given a hard time.</p>  <p>  Approximately a year ago I asked the previous Minister how much he estimated was unclaimed by people who were otherwise entitled to some sort of social welfare payment but he never answered.  We do not seem to know or estimate what goes unclaimed in this State.  When the UK began to estimate the unclaimed entitlements it found they far outweighed the levels of fraud in the social protection service.  I think this would be the same in Ireland.</p>  <p>  There are several steps that could have imposed some limitations and barrier on the widespread attack on defined benefit pensions.  They would have put some manners or delays at least on employers withdrawing from the schemes and stopping others contributing to them.  All of us here would have supported that and would like to see that happen because so many companies have moved away from defined benefit schemes.  In many, as we have seen recently, the pension schemes are in surplus.  They are very healthy.  Two have been mentioned, Irish Life and Irish News and Media, INM.  Workers at INM recently saw their pensions cut from an expectation of &euro;24,000 a year, to &euro;18,000, then &euro;12,000 and some now expect approximately &euro;6,000, having paid all their lives into a defined benefit scheme.  The scheme, however, is in surplus.  The same is true of thousands of workers in Irish Life.  They are under attack and this is the subject of dialogue and negotiation with the union which should not be the case.  Irish Life is the leading seller of pensions in this country.  If it gets away with withdrawing from the defined benefit scheme all the other pension companies will follow suit.  A pension of this nature is deferred pay.  It is money owed to workers because it was taken out of their income, put away and allegedly invested.  What is really going on is that pension companies are getting less and less return on their investments because they are investing in equities and bonds that are not paying what they used to because the system is yielding less.  Instead of bearing the brunt of that because their profits are big enough they pass the cut on to the workers who are owed it.  This is a savage attack.  Legislation is needed, similar to that in Britain, which would stop any attempt by a solvent company to stop or reduce contributions to a defined benefit scheme.  We hope to amend the Bill in the autumn.</p>  <p>  I note the Citizens' Assembly has recommended that there should not be a compulsory retirement age of 65 and that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has been quick off the blocks to say people should not receive their old age pension until they are 70.  I hope the Minister will resist that sort of inverse attack on the old age pension because while there are workers who do not want to retire at 65 there are a hell of a lot more who cannot wait to get out of their dull, dreary and often physically taxing jobs and they deserve to be treated with more respect by the State. </p></speech>

Her predecessor ran a campaign entitled "Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All".  It was wholeheartedly condemned by the majority of Deputies on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection as vindictive, malicious and mean spirited.  It goes against everything we are trying to do for social justice.  It was an affront to anybody on social welfare.  I do not condone fraud but it is a pretty horrible measure that the name of anyone convicted of fraud is included in a register for three months.  I know people have said that register can be online for only three months but who is to stop anybody using that name on social media and sharing it?  Deputy O'Dea says there should be an excess of &euro;5,000 but I think it should be got rid of.  Last year, at a meeting of the committee I asked an official from the Department of Social Protection how many were convicted of fraud.</p><p>I asked an official what was the least amount owed by any of the 126 people.  The least amount was &euro;726.  Had this person been convicted, he or she would have been on a register.  I believe wholeheartedly that this is very unfair.</p> <p> Another reason people are up in arms about this proposal is that we can see the other comparisons in society.  Look at what is happening in the corporate sector where people evade taxes and are, literally, robbing the State.  They do not seem to get any justice.  It sticks in people's craw.  We have a system that is a class bias system, with one law for the rich and one law for people who are trying to get on.  I hope this measure can be taken out of the Bill completely.  Some parts of the Bill are progressive but I hope the D&aacute;il can exclude this measure.  It would give rise to unintended consequences for data protection and for the liberty of the person.  It is a horrible measure and I have no doubt that it was the idea of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  It was his vanity project to get elected.  That is his legacy and I hope the Minister, Deputy Doherty, looks upon this and makes it her good guidance to take it out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400032#EE00200"><p>Much of the Bill is uncontroversial.  It is technical amendments to legislation etc.  As other Deputies have said, there are elements of this Bill which display a contempt and despisement for the poor and working-class people or those who may be reliant on social welfare.  I will come back to the name and shame policy shortly as I want to refer to a couple of other sections first.</p><p>Section 5 allows for the public services card to have dates of birth on them in order that the card can then be used as ID.  A proposal such as this requires further debate.</p><p>Section 7 allows for certain welfare payments to be awarded on the basis of an automated information system rather than through the scrutiny of an actual human being who is familiar.  This could also lead to a lot of problems.  Clearly, this is about reducing staffing levels and the trade unions should be very aware of this.  The automated system is also much more likely to be extended to more complex decisions than those it is already being used for.  Currently it is being used for requests such as increasing child benefit for the second or subsequent child.  It will lead to a poorer service and it is very likely to lead to people not being given the benefit they seek.  This is an issue about which people contact our office a lot.  It would leave applicants then having to appeal the decision, which is a very daunting prospect for many people who do not have the means, literacy or wherewithal to do that.  This will lead to people being potentially underpaid, overpaid or accused of the type of fraud the Minister appears to be so obsessed with.  The Bill in the context of the Pensions Act is also something we will take up further in future contributions on the Bill.</p><p>Section 4 contains the name and shame policy for people who are found guilty of welfare fraud by the Department in each quarter.  This carries out the campaign policy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, when he was bidding to become the leader of Fine Gael and appealing to his base.  It is now to be carried out quickly before the summer, even though there are many other pressing subjects waiting to be legislated for.</p><p>Let us look at the reality of this welfare fraud.  In a recent survey by <i>thejournal.ie</i>, it has been calculated as &euro;51.9 million.  This is 16% of the inflated estimate that came from the Department.  A former welfare inspector, fair play to the woman, Bernadette Gorman, estimates the fraud level to be lower again at &euro;41 million.  A former welfare inspector has come out publicly and spoken of the kinds of people who are found guilty of getting these overpayments.  She has condemned the Minister's policy as being unnecessary and politically motivated.  The numbers of overpayments due to fraud have been declining in recent years.  The loss in State funds due to overpayments is minimal and is largely due to genuine errors.  Total overpayments for last year amounted to &euro;110 million.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has said his Department recovered &euro;82 million.  If most of this money is repaid, what is the need to publicise people's names?</p><p>We can contrast the massive resources going into the this detection versus the resources the Minister, Deputy Doherty, and her Government put in to detecting underpayment of tax by business.  I will give a few statistics.  Of 385 audits on companies in 2013, additional liability was found in 77% of cases.  In the south west, it was discovered that of those audited, 89.9% had underpaid their tax.  Revenue received &euro;61 million in underpaid taxes from 276 hospital consultants who were audited this year.  Despite consistently bringing in large amounts of undeclared tax, Revenue&rsquo;s risk-based audits have decreased by 30% since 2012.  The Revenue Commissioners are doing less with regard to tax fraud by companies.  Clearly, the Government is not interested in resourcing the audits in this area, even though it would bring in much more revenue.</p><p>Given that the Minister only seems to be concerned with so-called fraud by the poor, I want to ask her a few questions.  Does the Minister believe that businesses that, for example, do not pay their creditors should be named and shamed?  Does she believe that individuals who owe money to Revenue should be named and shamed?  Should companies which do not keep proper books of accounts be named and shamed, as deemed by auditors who investigate those companies?  Should owners of companies who take loans from those companies, in contravention of company law, be named and shamed and made to pay everything back?</p></speech>

I will continue.  Should companies that are struck off by the Companies Registration Office for not filing accounts be allowed back on the register very quickly?  The reason I ask these questions, as the Minister is aware, is that the hypocrisy is rank.  It is not just the Minister, Deputy Doherty.  There are many Deputies in this D&aacute;il who have been involved in this kind of thing.  The Minister was involved in just one company, but it is a little bit rich that she is now going after people who owe minuscule amounts compared with &euro;286,000.  When people are caught for social welfare fraud or overpayments, they repay the money.  Companies do not.  What happens? They get write-downs of their debts, they go into liquidation, the bank writes down some of it and the creditors must forgo whatever they are owed.  Companies never pay the full amount but the people who do end up getting it docked for the rest of their lives until it is paid off, as the Minister is proposing, are to be named and shamed.  Here is the real Fine Gael.  It is not the cute socks and running in the park with world leaders.  This is the Fine Gael that despises the poor and has one law for the rich.  It is the bear-toothed, Tory Fine Gael coming out very clearly for anyone to see.  Fine Gael under-resourced the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which led to the likes of Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick getting off the hook.  There were many other reasons but certainly under-resourcing was an aspect.  The Government was asked six times for extra funds and staff for that but it was not interested.  Instead, we have this high-profile policy to attack the poor being proposed, and the hypocrisy is rank, while in here we have Deputies who owe money left, right and centre and they are let off the hook, including the Minister, Deputy Doherty.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael was asked several times to take a more serious approach to white-collar crime, but it has demonstrated that it is going to put all the light in one direction.  No one condones anyone ripping off the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>However, all the arguments have been made and the Government seems to be only concerned with poor people, many of whom are women who are overly dependent on social welfare, who might owe money back and, as has been said, putting their names out to be shared on social media, something the Minister is hugely conscious of herself.  The Minister needs to stand up and answer for her hypocrisy and that of Fine Gael.  For her promotion, she is faithfully carrying out the policy the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, promised in the election.</p></speech>

We will take ten minutes each.</p>  <p>  I will make a number of observations on the Bill but first I will make the general point that most of its provisions are non-controversial as they contain technical amendments to the Social Welfare Acts.  However, I am concerned about a number of the Bill's provisions.  The public services card is an issue.  Many people do not want to see the national use of a public services card.  There is a data protection question around this as well.  I believe we are moving ever closer to a mandatory identity card and by changing this a little at a time, it will become part of the system.  Most people in this State are opposed to that.  Has this been checked with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner?  What is its opinion on it?  Can we have a written reply from that office?  It would be good to have it on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  We had an important debate in the committee on equal treatment and the occupational pension.  Pension Equality, which represents retired LGBTI public servants who cannot access a survivor pension for their same-sex spouse because they could not marry before they retired appeared before the joint committee.  That provision was in the original Bill.  Where is it now?  Will it come in at a later Stage or will it be contained in separate legislation?  That group was given an indication by the Department that it was not a problem to deal with the issue, that the Department would deal with it and that it would be part of the Bill, and the representatives were quite pleased.</p>  <p>  Like other Deputies, I am also concerned about section 4 of the Bill.  I welcome the removal of the provision about the 25% because it was clearly controversial from the point of view of even the courts system.  The State was playing an arbitrary role in this regard whereby a trial having taken place and a judge having given a penalty, the Department of Social Protection would then be adding on another penalty.  I think this would have been illegal and we would have sought clarification on whether it was legally permissible.</p>  <p>  I take the Minister to task about the Taoiseach's campaign against so-called welfare cheats.  Many people referred to how he was the main problem.  He used that campaign to win his position in the Fine Gael Party as he was seen as the man who was going after all the cheats out there and those working-class people who were of that part of society.  It was a disgraceful and shameful act on the part of a Minister.</p>  <p>  As has been already stated, Bernadette Gorman, a former social protection officer, has come out in opposition against what the Taoiseach said, as well as against the comments of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  Ms Gorman's comments came after the new Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, indicated that tackling fraud will continue to be a priority for the Department.  Speaking about the controversial campaign headed by her predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, the Minister stated "anybody who's claiming money that they shouldn't be claiming that would deny other people who should be claiming the money is obviously going to be a priority".</p>  <p>  I have no problem with anyone being brought to court for maliciously defrauding the State.  That is not a problem for anyone in this D&aacute;il.  Everyone has made that quite clear.  However, here we see a heightened and hyper campaign that the then Minister led.  The current Minister for Social Protection went on to state it is "interesting that every single TD yesterday from the left stood up and challenged the Taoiseach over that [welfare fraud] campaign when it's defrauding money from the State".  Ms Gorman spoke to "Newstalk Breakfast" on the following Friday morning to defend the Department's anti-fraud practices.  She quite rightly said, and it has always been the case, that staff had been extremely effective at stamping out fraud.  She said that on listening to the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, one would imagine he had magicked the notion into the social welfare code of anti-fraud activities.  She said the reality is there had always been highly efficient anti-fraud activities within the Department's structure and statutes.  She queried whether the Minister was telling her that the methods whereby the fraud was policed for all those years was inefficient.  Ms Gorman, a former social protection officer, stated this was not the case.  She went on to state there had not been &euro;500 million worth of fraud in 2016.  She noted that was a projected figure and there has always been a projected figure every year.  She stated the true figure is &euro;40 million but that when one factors out unintentional fraud and administrative errors, it is around &euro;25 million.  She said that is a very small amount and it has to be dealt with.  It is obvious that it must be dealt with but to inflate it to the point to which it has been inflated is absolutely outrageous.  It is targeting a certain section of society that is very vulnerable.</p>  <p>  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, has also condemned this campaign and welcomes the removal of the proposed 25% deduction.  The organisation has stated it should be taken out of the Bill.  I agree and intend to put down an amendment to delete that section of the Bill.  I am sure everyone else will be doing the same.  The INOU also believes that the publication of names and addresses is an issue requiring consideration under the Data Protection Act and has gone through a number of points that we will raise on Committee Stage.  Therefore, the Minister should be aware that several organisations also have huge concerns.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly has a lot of experience in dealing with and information on defined benefit schemes and she intends to table amendments in this regard.  I will not say too much, except to say such schemes should be protected.  No company should be able to dissolve such a scheme, particularly when it is in surplus.  There is also the question of what happens when they do run into problems.  That the Pensions Authority is using money from the defined benefit schemes to pay for itself to continue to look at the schemes must be examined.  Delaying this will give companies some additional time to ascertain how such schemes can be wound down quicker.  It would have been better if it had been more defined in the Bill at this stage of the game.</p>  <p>  My last point relates to pensions.  As has been discussed at the committee, we have produced three reports to date.  One is on lone parents, one is on the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Services, MABS, and the third, on the pensions contribution, is being finalised at the moment.  Members of the committee, including me, would like a reply regarding the Minister's position on the reports on lone parents and MABS report but have not got received such a reply yet.  We will produce a report on the contributory pension issue and the points coming out of it are very important.</p>  <p>  Mick Clifford wrote an article entitled "It seems this is no country for old women".  He makes the point about the changes that Deputy Burton, the so-called leader of the Labour Party and the working people, introduced in 2012.  He refers to a worker who retired on 31 August 2012 with an average of 21 annual PRSI payments throughout his working life receiving a contributory pension of &euro;225, while a worker who retired two days later and who had made an average of 29 contributions per year, got only &euro;196.  This affects women in particular.  We know that given the way in which the bands were changed.  This must change as soon as possible.  </p><p>It was pointed out that the tax relief given to private pensions could be reduced to 33%, which would give the State approximately &euro;180 million to offset against paying back the moneys owed to women from 1973 or even from 1994.  That should be reviewed.  The Minister should examine that and refer back to it on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400034#GG00200"><p>When this Bill was made available to us last week and we were asked to facilitate it passing all Stages prior to the recess in order to protect workers' defined benefit pension schemes, I thought I was on another planet and that this was something on which we could wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the Government.  Then, of course, I woke up and all of the good and welcome provisions in the Bill were gone.  What is happening gives incredible clout to the belief that the big employers and others nobbled the Minister and, perhaps, the committee.  Despite what people have said to assure me otherwise, it has not left a good taste.  More importantly, it has left vulnerable workers in defined benefit pension schemes continuing to face a nightmare.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that when one talks about pensions, people's eyes tend to glaze over and they sort of lose the will to live.  The pensions industry thrives on that because no matter how boring pensions are, the fees paid to the pensions industry continue unabated.  We hear sporadically about the pensions time bomb that is going to explode due to the fact that 70% of retirees will depend on social welfare.  In other words, they will get just over &euro;200 per week in non-contributory pension payments.  Undoubtedly, there is a need for an urgent discussion on pensions and on the need to supplement the poverty-level amounts with which people will end up in their retirement years.  This Bill does not refer to that.  It concentrates on just one aspect of pension provision, namely, occupational defined benefit pension schemes in the private and semi-State sectors.  That is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the history of pensions.  There was a time when an unco-ordinated occupational defined benefit scheme was regarded as the Rolls-Royce.  The worker contributed a modest percentage of his or her wages and the employer made up the difference to ensure that the employee, whom it was assumed would give 40 years of loyal service, got up to two thirds of his or her final salary when he or she retired.  The worker could rely on the State pension as well.  That Rolls-Royce has been replaced by a banger that would not even pass the national car test, NCT.  It has been stood on its head completely.  The clawback or undermining began with the introduction of co-ordination or integration of defined benefit alterations.  In short, one's benefits were reduced by the full value of the State contributory pension.  That significantly and disproportionately affected lower paid workers as against those on higher salaries.  It accelerated the decline and the Bill does not address that.  An increasing number of defined benefit schemes are being wound up, are having their benefits drastically reduced or are closed to new entrants.  The acceleration of this process has been phenomenal.  It is incredible how much the landscape has changed.  At the end of 2008 there were 1,271 defined benefit schemes, but this year there are 628.  Over 150,000 people have gone from those schemes in ten years.  It is absolutely incredible, and it is more probable than possible that many more will join them.</p>  <p>  We must consider why this is happening.  The official line from the pensions industry is that it is due to historically low German bond yields, low interest rates, the high cost of annuities and so forth.  Annuities are defined as the amount of pension the retiree receives regularly throughout their retirement.  I will give an example of how costly annuities have become.  Less than 20 years ago, it would have cost approximately &euro;130,000 to buy a pension of &euro;200 per week.  Today, it costs &euro;270,000, which is a massive increase of 108%.  However, the people selling the annuities get 2% commission.  Even in the case of a small pension of &euro;200 per week the pension provider picks up a fee of &euro;5,400 for a few hours work.  It is absolutely scandalous and unregulated.  Low bond yields, low interest rates, the higher expense of purchase of pensions and the fact that people are living longer are undoubtedly contributing factors.</p>  <p>  The elephant in the room which we never officially discuss and which is causing the death - not just the terminal illness - of defined benefit pension schemes is the funding standard.  The funding standard for defined benefit schemes is quite simply mad.  The Pensions Authority works on the ridiculous principle that all of the schemes must have the money to pay out all pensions to active, deferred and existing pensioners today.  That is the standard.  Has anybody ever heard anything so ridiculous?  Let us apply it to the housing market and to a couple in my constituency who wish to buy a nice house in Swords.  It will cost them &euro;280,000.  If they go to the EBS for a mortgage, it will inform them that it will consider their application but that it must apply the Pensions Authority rules.  Before the EBS will provide the mortgage, the couple will have to prove, beyond all doubt, that they can meet their monthly mortgage repayments for ever and, more importantly, they must also have the &euro;280,000 stashed away already before the application can be approved.  How in God's name could that be reasonable?  This is what is causing the death of many of these pensions schemes.</p>  <p>  To add salt to the wound, there are 100 defined benefit schemes that do not play by that rule and that do not have the funding standard hanging over them to collapse them.  What schemes are these?  Interestingly, one of them is the Pensions Board staff superannuation scheme 1993.  Another is the Labour Court (members) superannuation scheme 1971 to 1998.  There is also the National Standards Authority of Ireland superannuation scheme 1996.  There are 100 schemes of similar bodies on the list.  It is a case of do as I say, not as I do.  It is criminal.  This is the reason used for closing down many schemes and there is nothing in the Bill to address it.  Some 164 of the remaining defined benefit schemes are insolvent based on the stupid, ridiculous rules in place.  The rules are being used to wind up schemes and erode the retirement conditions of workers.</p>  <p>  I do not have time to go into detail about the appalling robbery that was unleashed on the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, pension scheme, which was arbitrarily abandoned overnight by the employer, the CRC.  I have spoken many times in the House about the carnage in Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority after the wind-up of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, and the attacks on existing pensioners, deferred pensioners and members at that time.  Despite the assertions of the actuary that the scheme is on track, I have proof that it continues to be insolvent and will remain so.  In fact, the pension scheme people are paying into now will be effectively worthless.</p>  <p>  If that is not bad enough, we now hear through the grapevine that CIE wants to get in on the act.  It has jumped on this funding-standard-and-pensions-in-trouble bandwagon and now wishes to restructure its defined benefit scheme.  Among other things that will include, of course, closing off the scheme to new entrants.  To make matters worse, management in CIE is threatening to cut workers' trade unions out of the negotiating process.  Not only was there the affront to retired members from Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority in the past few years when they were excluded from a process that decided their livelihoods in their retirement, now existing workers in CIE are being told that their unions cannot represent them.  What has happened in Irish Life was the proof beyond all doubt, if that was required.  That staff scheme was shut down despite the fact that it was perfectly healthy, even with mad regulation.</p>  <p>  What we should be discussing here is properly regulating defined benefit pension schemes.  The industry and many employers are trying to eliminate them and replace them with defined contribution schemes, which put all of the risk on the hard pressed workers.  It is unacceptable.  I am sorry that the T&aacute;naiste is not present because last November, on Leaders' Questions, I called for an investigation of this pensions debacle.  Since then, 38 other regulated defined benefit schemes have closed down, causing huge uncertainty to workers in their retirement year.</p><p> In the time remaining, I wish to call on the Minister to do the following in no particular order, namely: reinstate heads 11, 12 and 13, as originally set out; introduce a statutory order precluding any further winding up or restructuring of regulated defined benefit schemes until the full legislation has been enacted; and establish a commission on adequate pension provision to investigate and make recommendations on securing fair, affordable and reasonable retirement benefits for workers, including more than 1 million employees who do not have a pension scheme and rely on the welfare system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400035#HH00200"><p>I have to wonder why we are discussing this Bill, which is only a skeleton of what we were promised.  The general scheme of what was then the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 was launched in May to great fanfare, including a press statement from the previous Minister and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  The general scheme promised significant reform of the pensions area.  For example, we learned that a sovereign employer would not be allowed to walk away from its pension liabilities for a defined benefits pension scheme where the scheme did not meet the minimum funding standard and funding standard reserve.  We were told that any outstanding liability would become an enforceable debt on the employer payable to the trustees.  This signalled that significant progress was being made and the Government was finally listening to what had been said for some years in respect of the large gap in pensions legislation.  It was a very welcome development.  It was somewhat surprising, therefore, to see the Bill before us being quietly slipped out by the Department last Friday afternoon.  It was not, as far as I am aware, accompanied by a press statement and has been very much kept under the radar.  The attempt to have all Stages of the gutted Bill brought through the D&aacute;il this week leads one to wonder what is afoot.  The promises made in the general scheme in May have been reneged on.</p>  <p>  We know there is a serious problem in respect of pensions because it has been signalled for many years.  Successive Governments have dodged their responsibility to provide for a fair, equitable and sound pensions regime.  On the one hand, exceptionally generous tax reliefs are available under the private pension regime for those who can afford to stash away large amounts of money for their retirement.  The cost of this arrangement has fluctuated over the years but amounts to between &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;3 billion per annum.  Under this arrangement, substantial tax benefits are provided to a small number of people, with estimates suggesting approximately 20% of the population enjoy approximately 80% of its benefits.  On the other hand, a similar amount of money is allocated for the remainder of the population through the State pension.  For a long time, it has been argued that we need a fair pension regime based on an enhanced State pension.  However, we continue to wait for such a regime to be introduced. </p>  <p>  In the middle of the private and State pension systems, we have private occupational pension arrangements, both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.  In recent years, we have become acutely aware that many of the thousands of workers and retirees in defined benefit schemes have been left high and dry by the State as a succession of employers took the disgraceful decision to walk away from their responsibilities to their retirees and employees.  The State has stood idly by and allowed this to happen.  One by one, employers have wound up their schemes and walked away, leaving people with little or no pension cover and Governments appear to believe this is somehow okay.  Despite many calls to address this area, very little has been done.</p>  <p>  Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and several other companies decided to wind up their defined benefit pension schemes and walk from their responsibilities.  The most recent high profile company to walk away from a defined benefit scheme was Independent News and Media, INM.  Its decision attracted considerable publicity at the time.  Having paid into the pension scheme over many years, employees in the company were left to swing in terms of their pension entitlements.  It was particularly galling to them and everyone else that the Government saw fit to bail out INM to the tune of approximately &euro;130 million, yet no safety net or protection was provided for employees and retirees.  Unfortunately, the then Minister and current Taoiseach refused to address the problem when he had an opportunity to do so in the social welfare legislation at the end of last year.  Despite efforts from a number of sources to address the issue, including through the tabling of a number of amendments, he refused to take the necessary action. </p>  <p>  The scheme of the Bill before us was welcomed when it was announced because it appeared that it would address these problems.  I cannot understand the reason the Minister has presented this legislation, however, as it is clearly not ready and the key provisions set out in the scheme are absent.  The Bill is much more notable for its omissions than its provisions.  I listened to the Minister make further promises in this area.  Why is action not being taken now?  Why is the legislation not ready?  Why did the Minister's officials not address this problem given that it was signalled long ago and has been a glaring omission from pension legislation?</p>  <p>   The Minister signalled that she may do something in future.  That, in itself, is extremely dangerous because it gives notice to employers who are considering walking away from their responsibilities.  Giving these companies notice that she may do something about this issue in four or five months is no way to behave in terms of the Minister's responsibility to the many hundreds of thousands of workers who will be directly affected by her inaction in this area.  I am concerned that she is giving notice to employers and failing to make the necessary legislative changes at this point.  If the legislation had provided for the necessary changes, the Minister would have received full co-operation from all Deputies on this side.  We would have been happy to stay here until midnight or to sit next week and spend whatever time was necessary to pass all Stages of the Bill, close off the loophole that exists in legislation and provide the essential protection workers require.  The Minister has reneged on her responsibility to do this and is leaving a major gap which will place many thousands of workers in an even more precarious position in the coming months.  That is unforgivable.  I do not know who is advising her but the Minister has been very misguided in her approach to this legislation.</p>  <p>  There are serious gaps in Irish pensions legislation when compared with the legislation in place in the United Kingdom.  I cannot understand the reason for the reticence shown by the Minister and her two predecessors regarding the introduction here of the same type of legislative regime for pensions that exists in the UK.</p><p>Protection is provided in most other developed European countries such that employers cannot act irresponsibly in this regard.  Basic pension entitlements should be allowed for workers who pay substantial amounts of their income into a pension scheme over tens of years during their working lives.  There is simply no justification for allowing this unacceptable situation to continue.  I believe we will pay a severe price for the Minister's failure to act on this.  I hope that I am proved wrong, but I have serious fears about what will happen in the coming months.</p> <p> There are two other key omissions in the legislation.  These omissions need to be addressed but are not being touched at all.  The first relates to bogus self-employed people.  This applies to workers, especially in the construction industry, who are forced to become sole traders in order to be hired by their employers.  They actually operate as employees but they do not have the protection that employees generally have through employment legislation.  This means they are deprived of all those protections, for example, unemployment benefit, sick pay, holiday pay and so on.  The key point of having this bogus regime is that employers do not have to pay PRSI.  It is a fraudulent situation.  It is a scam really and it needs to be deal with as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> Last year, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimated that this scam costs the State approximately &euro;80 million per year.  That corresponds to State revenue but, of course, it costs the people who are forced into this situation dearly indeed.  It is estimated that there are approximately 27,600 such fraudulent sole traders in the construction industry alone.  This is a glaring problem in the way our employment legislation operates.  This area needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> The other omission concerns a point raised by a number of other speakers.  It relates to the failure to deal with the many women who feel very much short-changed as a result of changes in respect of pension entitlements over recent years.  A substantial number of those women are now in their 60s - perhaps they are 63 or 64 years of age - and approaching retirement.  They are checking out their entitlements.  Many are only now finding out that they do not have an entitlement to a full State pension in spite of the fact that they have substantial work records.  Many have pointed out to us that they are being penalised for working in their early years.</p> <p> Many women went out to work in insurable employment at the age of 16 years.  They would have worked for many years to put themselves through school, college and so on.  Of course we should encourage people to take on properly insured employment.  However, these women are being penalised now because of the way of calculating contributions.  They point out that people who did not work for decades and then took up legitimate insured employment in more recent years have entitlements to full pensions while they are denied them.  It is a major pressing issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There are basic equity and family issues involved.  Most of these women gave up work and were encouraged to do so to tend to family responsibilities.  They are being penalised for that and they feel hard done by and sore about it.  This needs to be addressed urgently and I encourage the Minister to take action in this regard as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> It seems that section 4 is being provided as cover for the Taoiseach to somehow justify the nasty and disingenuous campaign that he ran while seeking the leadership of Fine Gael.  The idea of highlighting fraud and making a big thing about suspected fraud in the social welfare system is something successive Ministers have turned to when they have needed publicity.  We saw Deputy Joan Burton and Mary Hannifin doing it when their profiles were low.  They needed publicity and needed to be seen to be talking tough.  They talked about large numbers of people defrauding the system.  Of course none of that was ever found to be justifiable and there was little or no basis to it.  However, it encouraged people to snitch on their neighbours, often in situations where there was a misunderstanding about someone working and getting some type of payment and so on.</p> <p> Most of those complaints came to nothing but they imposed a significant additional burden of work on the Department of Social Protection at a time when the Department was leaving people waiting six or nine months for their claims to come through.</p> <p> It is something of a nonsense.  It was disappointing that the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, decided to engage in this.  The sensible thing to do at this point is simply to drop section 4 altogether.  We have already seen a campaign that is estimated to have cost &euro;200,000.  The provisions relate to anyone found to have defrauded the system by as little as &euro;5,000.  No fraud is acceptable or justifiable, but we need to ask what the point of doing this is.  The numbers are particularly low.  Deputy Curran cited the figures recently - they amount to fewer than 100 people.  Those cases go to court anyway.  If a person is found guilty, the case is covered and there is publicity in the newspapers, in the main.</p> <p> The idea of setting up a separate website to be maintained by the Minister is nonsense, but that is what the legislation provides for.  It states that a new website will be set up and will be maintained by the Minister.  We need to ask what this will actually cost.  Who is going to maintain it in the Department?  Are the necessary resources available?  What is the point in doing all that?</p> <p> An interesting point was made earlier about the impact of this.  Whatever about the person in question - if a person deliberately defrauded the Department, then that is absolutely wrong - this will have ramifications for any children as well.  Significant data protection issues arise.  What is stopping any agency or company from using the data, for example, the banks.  They could record what is on the Department website.  What is stopping them from keeping a database of anyone who was ever found guilty of a &euro;5,000 fraud?  What about employers getting access to that data?  I imagine there are significant data protection issues that would need to be addressed.  What is it all about at the end of the day?  Does it actually achieve anything?  The most sensible thing by far is to simply drop the section altogether.</p> <p> Two aspects of concern arise relating to the public services card.  The first is that many people believe the card is not secure and some agencies do not accept it as identification.  There is a general view that they can be reproduced, like the free travel card, and that there is a certain market in them.</p> <p> The second concern relates to the requirement to produce it.  When was that decided?  I encountered a case recently in which someone who wanted to do a driver theory test was required to produce the public services card.  Apparently, it was the only identification acceptable.  I was unaware this requirement had come in.  Certainly, there has been no debate about it.  This particular young person wanted to do a driver theory test.  The person was in employment, did not have a public services card and ended up having to take a day off work to get the public services card to do the driver theory test.  In my view that makes no sense at all.  If this regime is to continue, the least the Minister should do is make provision for people to get their public services cards outside normal working hours.  The Minister should not require working people to take time off work to get their cards.</p><p>It could be dealt with through extended opening hours.  </p> <p> I will refer to a number of positive provisions.  The question of payments to guardians not being taken into consideration is important.  On the question of disability, there is a sensible reform in this where work does not have to be rehabilitative.  That makes sense.  The recovery of benefits from compensators is positive.  I spent a long time highlighting that.  The State was forgoing &euro;50 million a year as a result of its failure to do that in respect of standard payments.  I do not see why SWA was not brought in when other payments were brought in quite recently.  In spite of that it is a welcome development.  Overall, this is very disappointing.  I do not know why we are here today doing this when it is a Bill that has been filleted in terms of what was expected.  I have concerns about its implications over the summer months.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400037#KK00200"><p>I wish the Minister well in her new role.  I have a degree of sympathy for her because the Bill was initiated by the previous Minister.  The concept at the time was to have the Bill enacted before the summer.  What we are presented with here is incomplete.  Other speakers have alluded to that.</p>  <p>  Before I refer to the Bill, I will correct a comment made by Deputy Coppinger when she spoke about Deputies who were in business.  She talked about businesses generally and that they could go into liquidation and have to wind up.  I have been in business for a long number of years and many people I know have run small businesses.  They get a bad press.  The Deputy failed to indicate that most people running small businesses give personal guarantees.  That is how the businesses functions.  I am a director of a local enterprise centre and I see people constantly risking everything they have to run their businesses.  This is a side of the argument that was not put here today.  The argument put here today is a misportrayal of the situation.  We should be encouraging our entrepreneurs.  Small businesses give huge employment to hundred of thousands of people in this country and we should not be as dismissive as were the comments made earlier.   </p>  <p>  I will refer to the issue of pensions and in particular the State pension.  A number of people have referred to it this afternoon.  The committee has looked at it and this afternoon laid a report before the Minister.  The Taoiseach, who was the Minister, appeared before the committee and informed us that the Department is looking at a new model.  The committee found the current system inequitable.  Two people can have paid the same contributions and get different rates of pension payment.  The averaging system has an in-built unfairness.  The earlier a person works, the probability is that his or her pension will be somewhat less than someone entering the workforce later and having a full record.  Whether it is a total contribution system or a universal system, I urge the Minister to act on it with some urgency.  One of the specific things that compounded the situation, in particular for married women who have left the workplace, was the 2012 change where the number of bands was increased.  The committee is specifically recommending those bands be reverted until the new system, whether it is a total contribution or universal pension scheme, is introduced.  Those changes have adversely affected married women who left the workplace because they dropped down a band as a result.  There was some margin of error in the bigger banding system.  By introducing new bands, many people have fallen to a level they would not have anticipated.  It is unfair on them and as a temporary arrangement it should be reversed.  It is not my view, but that of the committee, that it should be reversed until such time as a new scheme of pensions is introduced which should be fairer from the outset.  This one was not in that regard.</p>  <p>  I will not refer to every section of the Bill.  I will refer to a number of them that received particular attention at committee.  The first relates to the guardian payment which is section 3.  The committee welcomed it.  Deputy O'Dea quite adequately explained the guardian payment was directed at the child and consequently would not have an impact on means testing.  When the committee was considering this, the members welcomed the change for guardians but concerns were raised that the same principle was not being applied to maintenance payments.  People may argue that the maintenance payment is a general payment.  I am asking the Minister, now that she has time over the summer and before we come back to committee, to reconsider the issue of maintenance payments where a payment is directed towards a child so that a maintenance payment would receive the same rights as the guardian payment.  I am making the point where the maintenance payment is directed at a child.  </p>  <p>  Section 4 has received a great deal of discussion and debate.  This relates to the publication of the names and addresses.  Certainly from the committee's point of view there is very significant opposition to it.  The Minister heard all of the arguments here earlier today, in particular on data protection and secondary or other unforeseen consequences of publishing those names.  I will read the numbers into the record because people have used them time and time again.  I tabled a question to the Department and the officials gave the numbers.  The scale is important.  While people have expressed concerns about producing a list and naming people, the people who spoke are very clear they are totally opposed to fraud and that fraud deprives someone else.  We are very clear on that.  It was in that regard I asked the question so we could have the scale and the context.  The Department very kindly provided the information on the value of overpayments in cases finalised in the courts during 2016 where prosecutions were taken under the Social Welfare Act.  It found there was no overpayment in two cases; under &euro;1,000 in no case; between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000 in 39 cases; between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 in 25 cases; between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 in 33 cases; between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 in 19 cases; between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 in nine cases; and above &euro;100,000 in three cases.  Of those in which the Probation Act was used, the figures were under &euro;1,000 in no case; between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000 in 15 cases; between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 in nine cases; between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 in eight cases; between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 in three cases; and between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 in one case.  The reason I read those figures out is that we sometimes think they involve a couple of thousand euro here and there.  To get up to a level of overpayment of &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000, some of these cases had to be going on for very extended periods.  This needs to be dealt with sensitively and proportionately but it should not become the centre of the Bill because it has the potential to dominate the whole discussion.  I wanted to read those figures into the record so that if somebody wants to look at them or comment on them, they will be commenting on facts.  It is mind-boggling when one thinks of somebody receiving overpayments of &euro;20,000 or &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000.  They are astronomical figures.  The Minister can read into it as she will.</p>  <p>  Head 5 has been removed; it is not a section in the Bill.  It was to do with the reduced payment following conviction of fraud.  When I saw it deleted from the Bill I was pleased because if somebody goes to court and receives a sentence or a fine that is the punishment.  This seemed to be an arbitrary additional punishment.  The standard rate for reclaiming an overpayment is 15% and this proposed up to 25% which seemed excessively punitive.  Will the Minister confirm that, while it is not in the Bill as published, she has no intention of reintroducing that provision?  I will leave it at that.</p>  <p>  The one concern that came up about the public services card was that it would become mandatory the more it is used and the more common it becomes.  That is the concern members have.  Perhaps as the Bill develops it is important that issue is dealt with.  The real glaring omissions are the ones around the pension.  I will not go over the debate that took place in committee.  The original heads of the Bill were published in May.  As a committee we were conscious that once the heads of the Bill were published the cat was out of the bag and everybody knew what would be done.     </p><p>The committee was very concerned to facilitate the passage of that Bill as quickly as possible because we did not want an employer or a pension fund taking advantage or jumping ahead of what was being proposed.  Like others here, I express the concern that commencing a Bill today which will not be completed for several months is not ideal.  I hope my concerns are not realised and that people do not take advantage of the situation.  However, it is a cause of concern.  Once the heads were published in May, the clock started ticking.  People are looking at it and know the Minister's intention.  They do not know the detail of how she will get to where she is going, but they know her intention.  That is a weakness and I share the concern of others.</p> <p> I wish to refer in a little detail to what was contained in heads 12 and 13.  While they are not in the Bill as presented, we know the Minister intends to introduce amendments similar to these.  Head 12 sought to address the problem where employers may cease making contributions to defined benefit schemes without prior notice to members.  Such notice periods are normally set out in trusts of deeds, and rules and vary from scheme to scheme, with some trust deeds making no provision for a notice period.  The head would require employers who sponsor defined benefit schemes, whether those schemes are in deficit or not, to give 12 months&rsquo; notice of their intention to cease contributions.  A shorter period may be agreed between the trustees and the employer, following consultation with the members and in circumstances where it is not contrary to members&rsquo; interests.  The purpose of the 12 months&rsquo; notice is to ensure employees and trustees are properly notified that it is to occur and that they have time to plan accordingly.  Where a scheme is in deficit, employers will be obliged to enter into discussions with the trustees of the scheme to agree a funding proposal if one is not already in place.  Employers will be obliged to continue contributions in line with the current contribution rate during the notice period.  If there is a funding proposal in place, the employer will be obliged to continue to pay contributions in accordance with the terms of that proposal for the duration of the 12-month period.</p> <p> Head 13, following on from the Pensions Act, provides for the submission of a funding proposal by the trustees to the Pensions Authority where a scheme is in deficit.  In some circumstances, however, employers are not engaging with this process and a funding proposal cannot be agreed, thus triggering the wind-up of the scheme.  Head 13 was to provide powers to the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of employer contributions to restore defined benefit pension schemes which do not satisfy the funding standard to an adequate funding position in a specified set of circumstances, most notably where the trustees have not submitted a funding proposal or where the employer has not engaged with the trustees to develop and agree a funding proposal.  The schedule of contributions specified by the Pensions Authority will be an enforceable debt on the employer.  I will not read any more, but those provisions form the crux of it.</p> <p> While the committee did not deal with this at pre-legislative scrutiny, I suggest that the subsequent meeting with representatives of the Pensions Authority and IBEC would be worth referring to.  The representatives of the Pensions Authority stated they did not seek these new powers.  The employers' concern is with the enforceable debt.  From this point of view I can see why the drafting has not been concluded.  The legislation, as proposed, makes no reference to whether the employer can afford that payment in terms of the viability of the business to meet the funding.  That needs to be dealt with specifically.  There is a voluntary scheme into which employers have entered.  There is a funding standard which may or may not be appropriate, but that is the standard to which the Pensions Authority is working.  When that funding standard is not being met, the company has to make up the shortfall as dictated to by the Pensions Authority without due reference to the ability of that company to do so.  That has to be included.  It is not possible to have one or the other.  It has to be a combination or else the whole viability of the company is threatened.  If two companies are in competition and one is funding a pension scheme and the other is not, the costs to the company that is funding can be significantly higher.  I am not advocating that companies do not meet their liabilities.  However, from a legislative point of view it is important that a balance is achieved in terms of what the company has to do to meet the funding standard, but on the other hand, it should not jeopardise the existence of the company.</p> <p> I also want to talk about head 14, which is not included as a section at this stage, but I understand it is to be included.  The committee met representatives of Pensions Equality, who have also been in direct contact with the Department.  I welcome that they have been advised that appropriate amendments will be introduced.  Head 14 was to provide for a measure seeking to ensure same-sex spouses and civil partners of members of occupational pension schemes with marriage age clauses will be able to obtain, in certain circumstances, a spouse&rsquo;s pension.  I understand this applies to a relatively small group of people - perhaps 20.  The representatives of Pensions Equality made their case very well at the committee and have made it directly to departmental officials.  I hope the Minister will be able to introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</p> <p> I started by mentioning the pensions report we brought here.  I finish on pensions generally.  As others have mentioned, the majority of people are reaching retirement at 65 and the pension age is 66.  That is why one of the biggest age cohorts of people in receipt of job seeker's payments are 65 year old people.  We need to address that properly.  One of the proposals - it is not the only proposal - is the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to address that mandatory retirement age.  The Government needs to consider how that could be addressed in a speedy way.  Someone suggested that it might require a money message.  I find that hard to see.  I really do not know what the blockage is.  I would like to see that Bill done in parallel with the Minister's Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-07-14a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017071400038#LL00800"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am presenting the Legal Metrology (Measuring Instruments) Bill 2017 to the House for Second Stage discussion.  This technical Bill is required to transpose Articles 1 and 3 of Directive 2014/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments.  The remainder of the directive will be transposed into Irish law by way of ministerial regulations under the European Communities Act 1972.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the directive is to establish the requirements that measuring instruments have to satisfy with a view to their being made available on the market and-or put into use.  The Bill applies to the putting into use of measuring instruments that are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  These instruments are: water meters; gas meters and volume conversion devices; fuel dispensers, for example, for petrol; measuring systems on road tankers; measuring systems for loading road tankers; measuring systems for milk; automatic weighing instruments; taxi meters; material measures of length and capacity-serving measures; and exhaust gas analysers.</p><p>For all these instruments, the requirements of Directive 2014/32/EC apply for the putting into use for the purpose of levying taxes and duties and fair trading, except for exhaust gas analysers, which is for the purpose of protecting the environment.  There is not any change in policy, and the Bill is merely required to transpose the recast directive into Irish law.  These measuring instruments are the same ones that are currently subject to this type of regulation.  The deadline for the transposition is overdue and, in light of that, the Bill was prioritised in the legislative programme.</p> <p> The Department has also consulted with the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which decided on 21 June last that it would not undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I thank the committee members for their input.</p> <p> By way of background to the Bill, the Attorney General's office advised that the optional provisions in Articles 1 and 3 of the directive must be transposed separately through primary legislation by means of a stand-alone technical Bill.  A Schedule is attached to the Bill, setting out the categories of measuring instruments and prescribed uses to which the directive will apply.  The other articles of the directive however, can be transposed by way of a ministerial statutory instrument by making regulations under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  The Bill and the statutory instrument should both come into effect on the same date.</p> <p> In relation to legal metrology itself, it is primarily concerned with measuring instruments used in trade which are themselves legally controlled, and the main objective of legal metrology is to assure citizens of correct measurement results when used in trade and commercial transactions.  This is a short technical Bill to transpose Articles 1 and 3 of the directive.  There are no technical changes arising from the Bill affecting the instruments concerned.  The aim of the recast directive is to improve compliance with existing legislation relating to harmonised products in this area.  The only additional burden on operators will be the requirement to have a more detailed and standardised itinerary of instruments.</p> <p> We have been in contact with the European Commission on a regular basis to update it on the transposition of the directive.  We are making every effort to transpose the directive into Irish law as soon as possible.  As I outlined, the Bill and the statutory instrument should both come into effect on the same date.  I hope Deputies will support this Bill, which I commend to the House.</p></speech>

Metrology is a topic to set the heart racing, clearly in a measured way.  Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill.  I acknowledge the role of the library and research service.  The more I read into it the more excited I got - perhaps excited is to overrate it a little, but it is the final day and a day is a unit of measurement which is accepted by everybody.  The Minister's speech was delivered in an accepted formal structure, namely, an A4 page, which is an international measurement.  There were sentences of a particular length using font and other measurements.  The whole world is kept ticking over by metrology.</p>  <p>  I again thank the library and research support function in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I read the information which was contained in a reference link I came across an example of metrology at work using different measurements.  Apparently, our body only contains about 5.5 l of blood but our heart pumps more than 7,500 l of blood, which is about 2,000 US gallons, which is enough to fill almost 48 oil barrels.  That is metrology at work in different international understandings and measurements.</p>  <p>  I have one you will be interested in, a Cheann Comhairle.  Apparently, the average adult speaks about 16,000 words a day.</p></speech>

It is interesting because the recent article about speaking time in the D&aacute;il in The Irish Times seems to accord a high priority to those who have spoken the most.

We know metrology is the science of measurement.  Apparently, it is the oldest science in the world.  I came across an anecdote in the Bills digest from ancient times which indicated that:</p><blockquote>The death penalty faced those who forgot or neglected their duty to calibrate the standard unit of length at each full moon.  Such was the peril courted by the royal site architects responsible for building the temples and pyramids of the Pharaohs in ancient Egypt, 3000 years BC.  The first royal cubit was defined as the length of the forearm from elbow to tip of the extended middle finger of the ruling Pharaoh, plus the width of his hand.  The original measurement was transferred to and carved in black granite.  The workers at the building sites were given copies in granite or wood and it was the responsibility of the architects to maintain them.</blockquote><p>Anybody who has ever seen the pyramids knows it is an absolutely astonishing work of metrology never mind architecture.</p><p>As we know, other measurements came about as a result of conquest.  The British were particularly good at it and that is from where we got the imperial system.  Apparently, in 1875, things had advanced to a point where the first diplomatic treaty on the metre was signed by 17 countries in Paris.  The Minister adverted to the fact that every day in our personal and business lives we engage with metrology, from measuring the coffee in our morning cup to weighing ourselves on bathroom scales - I think the metrology in my weighing scales at home is dodgy.  I am suspicious of, in particular since I was elected as a Deputy, metering our electricity and gas usage.  I will not mention water.  Metrology is also vital to science &ndash; measuring temperatures among other things.</p><p>As the Minister pointed out, the activity of metrology we are covering today is legal metrology which covers not just legal measurements but scientific measurements, dealing with the organisation and development of measurement standards and with their maintenance; and industrial metrology.  Legal metrology originated from the need to ensure fair trade, specifically in the area of weights and measures.  These issues affect us at a domestic level.  In the context of bin collections, constituents have asked me who oversees and checks that the weight of refuse for which they are being billed is correctly weighed by the bin collection companies.  I understand those companies come under the remit of the NSAI, the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</p><p>The global economy relies on measuring instruments and weights such as petrol pumps and taximeters and we need to know they can be trusted, are internationally accepted and do not form a barrier to trade.  I have lived with three currency systems.  The euro was one of the greatest exercises in metrology, as was the dollar originally in the United States.  The euro is an internationally accepted form of financial exchange across the European Union and a form of exchanging money for goods.</p><p>Legally controlled measuring instruments should guarantee correct measurement results under normal working conditions, throughout the whole period of use and within given permissible errors.  In the Measuring Instruments Directive, MID, 2004/22/EC, the European Commission in 2011 stated:</p><blockquote>The MID applies to around 345 million units of measuring instruments sold annually in the EU [which is a phenomenal amount of measuring units] with a total sales value of around &euro;3.25 Billion.  Around 900 manufacturers operate in the 10 sectors covered by the MID not including the large number of SME operating as distributors, importers or providers of repair services.  The number of employees in the sector [we use metrology to do this] is around 175,000-205,000.  Around 20-25% of measuring instruments in the EU27 are imported while 25-30% of measuring instruments produced in the EU27 are exported to third countries.</blockquote><p>One of the reasons we are dealing with this issue today is that the EU undertook to review the legislative framework some years ago to see whether the harmonisation of existing legislation had worked.  The conclusion was that, overall, harmonisation had been largely positive but a number of shortcomings were identified.  They included a significant number of non-compliant products reaching the market.</p><p>To remedy these shortcomings a new legislative framework, NLF, was introduced in 2008.  That is our CE brand, which people will know, although I do not think many members of the public would know what the CE mark attempts to guarantee.<br/><br/>The manufacturers are declaring that the product with the CE stamp complies with the essential requirements of European health, safety and environmental protection legislation.  It indicates to government officials that the product may be legally placed on the market.  It ensures free movement of the product within the European free trade area and EU Single Market.  It permits the withdrawal of the non-conforming products by EEA customs and enforcement authorities.  These are really safeguarding issues for the consumer.<br/><br/>A main objective of the European Commission, and the reason we are dealing with this Bill today, is to bring product harmonisation legislation in line with the reference provisions of a decision of the EU in 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out, the directive regulates the marketing and use of ten categories of measuring instruments.  She has outlined what are the categories.  In terms of everyday use, they include gas meters, water meters, taxi meters, automatic weighing machines and so on.  It is interesting for the public to know that there are methods of measuring what they are using and being sold and that those methods are accurate, and also that there are penalties for those who mess around with these standards of measurement.<br/><br/>The Bill digest provided by the Oireachtas library and research service gives two very reassuring examples of legal metrology court cases, which it is important to put on the Official Record.  One took place five or six years ago in respect of overcharging for petrol, where the NSAI investigated a petrol station in Dublin and levied a significant fine.  In fact, the inspectors went back a second time on foot of complaints from consumers.  They found that the fuel pumps were significantly under-measuring petrol and diesel sold to consumers and prosecuted them on that basis.<br/><br/>The second case concerned the over-exploitation of fish stocks in March of this year.  A Donegal fish processing plant and a company director were fined a total of &euro;45,000 for offences against the Metrology Act 1996<i></i>by the Donegal Circuit Court.  One of the individuals was given a six month suspended prison sentence.  This followed a joint investigation by the NSAI and Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, which found that flow scales used for weighing incoming fish catches could be knowingly switched off using a fitted electric switch.  This allowed the fish to pass over without being weighed.<br/><br/>As I said to the T&aacute;naiste, although it may be hard to believe, the more I delve into this, the more interested I get.  I am capable of speaking at considerable length about the topic.</p></speech>

That is, if one dickies up the emissions measuring system or has software capable of bypassing that system when it is being tested.  That is what they did and they absolutely conned consumers.</p>  <p>  Metrology is a really interesting topic.  It is the last day of the session and I meant to criticise the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, for taking so long to bring this metrology legislation to the D&aacute;il.  The deadline has well passed.  The T&aacute;naiste may consider herself reprimanded by the Opposition on that issue.  I have read in her notes the reasons for the delay and the exceptions leading into it.

When I started looking at the issue of metrology I did not know much about it.  I read the digest provided by the library and research service.  I commend the researchers for what is an excellent digest.  It was a very good read.  Deputy Lahart took the best line out of it, which I was going to use myself.  I might still use it anyway; we will see how we get on.</p><p>While it is not the Minister's fault, I want to raise the concern about the delay in producing the Bill, which has turned its passing into a matter of urgency.  This is why it has come before us today as the final Bill of this session of the D&aacute;il.  Quoting directly from the Bill digest: </p><blockquote>The deadline for the transposition of Directive 2014/32/EU was 19 April 2016 and as this deadline was not met, the European Commission issued Ireland with a formal infringement notice on 26 May 2016 and with a Reasoned Opinion on 8 December 2016 giving two more months to transpose.  If not transposed urgently, Ireland may face fines from the European Court of Justice.</blockquote><p>Can the Minister confirm whether Ireland was served with a fine or any other sanction due to the delay in progressing this Bill?</p><p>People might wonder what this Bill is about.  I do not think it was in any of our election manifestos or anything we spoke to the public about.  Although not the most thrilling legislation, it is really important.  It transposes two sections of an EU directive into Irish legislation relating to the legalities of measuring instruments.  What is metrology?  As Deputy Lahart said earlier, citing the Bill digest, it is the science of measurement and is one of, if not the oldest science in the world.  This anecdote from ancient times may explain the topic and highlights its importance through the ages: the death penalty faced those who forgot or neglected their duty to calibrate the standard unit of length at each full moon.</p><p>Each day in our own lives, we engage in metrology, from drinking a pint or watching the pump as we fill the car with diesel to weighing ourselves on the bathroom scales and monitoring our electricity and gas usage.  Metrology is also vital to science, measuring temperature changes due to global warming, earthquakes and their aftermaths, and pollutants in the air, water and soil.  This law will ensure that inaccurate measuring instruments are prevented from reaching the market for sale in Ireland.  The Metrology Act 1996 established a legal metrology service which currently provides consumers with reassurance that measuring instruments in everyday life, ranging from taxi meters to petrol pumps, are regulated and legally accurate.  This legislation will extend protection for consumers in this area.</p><p>It is a very short piece of legislation and is needed to transpose two articles of the directive that cannot be transposed through a statutory instrument.  It will bring Ireland into line with European standards in this area.  I know the lateness of the Bill is not the Minister's fault.  For future Bills, I ask her to ensure they are brought to the House before EU deadlines run out to ensure that the committee has time for pre-legislative scrutiny and to allow adequate time for debate, regardless of how technical or controversial the Bill is.  I remind the Minister of my question as to whether Ireland was served with any fine or sanction due to the delay in progressing this Bill.</p><p>I wish the Minister the best over the summer recess.  While the D&aacute;il will be in recess, I am sure she, like the rest of us, will be working really hard.  I hope she gets to spend some quality time with her family and friends and comes back refreshed in the autumn.</p></speech>
