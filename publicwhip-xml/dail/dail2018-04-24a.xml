I asked the Taoiseach if he found this unacceptable, if he thought it was appropriate behaviour, whether it was correct of the Minster to do that and whether it was normal practice.  The Taoiseach dodged the question and added the view that the Minister did not give any confidential information to the lobbyist concerned.  In fact, he blamed the lobbyist for hyping the matter and over-egging the description of this information as confidential.  We now know that it was confidential because the Minister confirmed this.  We know from the record that, three weeks after he made the call to the lobbyist, the Minister replied to questions from two Deputies on the issue by saying, "I have not made my views known and I am not going to."  Of course, he had already made his views known to the lobbyist in question, who told his superiors in Heneghan PR, who told the chairman of INM, who then told the largest shareholder.</p><p>No other shareholder was told.  Celtic Media, the subject matter of the acquisition, was not told and the D&aacute;il was not told.  In fact, the D&aacute;il was misled and the Minister should apologise to the House for giving misleading information and correct the record because clearly the two do not tally.</p> <p> Does the Taoiseach still hold the view that the Minister did not give confidential information to the lobbyist?  Most objective observers found somewhat farcical the Minister's statement to the D&aacute;il last week and the idea that he expressed a purely personal view that this would be the likely course of action he would follow.  Deputy Howlin summed it up last week when he said a Minister performing a statutory duty is always a Minister and one cannot separate out what is personal, particularly in the context of a statutory decision.  Surely the Taoiseach accepts that basic principle. </p> <p> The Minister's officials must have warned him in advance on this issue given their experience with the Moriarty tribunal and the awarding of the State's second mobile phone licence to Esat Digifone.  We know that experience traumatised officials in the Department considerably and obviously left a mark in the Department.</p> <p> It is clear to me and most people that the Minister made a serious error of judgment and his defence to date in respect of that serious error has been very poor.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister made a basic error of judgment and that what he did was wrong?  Does he accept that the D&aacute;il was misled, perhaps not intentionally, and the Minister needs to apologise and correct the record?  Does he accept that the information the Minister gave to the lobbyist was confidential and not shared with anyone until the decision was ultimately publicly announced?  Have queries been made as to how the lobbyist got information regarding the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's decision prior to the Minister getting it and was able to tell the Minister and then seek his response?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400004#B00200"><p>I will start by joining the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my condolences to Canada and the Canadian people on what was an appalling attack in Toronto yesterday.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has been in touch with the Canadian authorities to pass on the regrets of the Government.  I would like to use this opportunity to express solidarity with the Canadian people and our revulsion, as a State, at what happened in Canada yesterday.</p><p>I am conscious in speaking about this matter that it is before the courts and relates to an affidavit that none of us has seen.  We have been warned by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly that the matter is <i>sub judice </i>and we all need to have regard to that warning and be careful what we say in the House on a matter that is before the courts.  It is also important to state that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, did not do any favours for anyone.  He did not do any favours for Independent News and Media, INM, or Denis O'Brien.  In fact, his action was to delay the proposed merger between INM and Celtic Media by referring it to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I presume that is not what INM would have wanted.  Presumably, it would have preferred if the Minister had not deferred the merger and referred it to the BAI.</p><p>With regard to the telephone call with the lobbyist, Mr. &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in, which I believe was brief, the Minister indicated he would follow the law and be guided by official advice, which is what any Minister would do.  I am not sure if that constitutes confidential information but in my mind it does not because that is what Ministers will do, namely, follow the law and be guided by official advice.  The Minister cannot be held personally responsible for what other people do with that information.  It may be the case that somebody gave that information to some shareholders and not others but that was down the line and it is not fair to expect any individual to be responsible for what third, fourth or fifth parties may do with information that was imparted to them.</p></speech>

He accepts it was a political mistake which he regrets and for which he has apologised today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400004#B00500"><p>I find the Taoiseach's response somewhat incredible.  I did not ask if the Minister did any favours to anybody.  What he did, by the way, was keep one party informed and nobody else.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said, he did not speak about advice.  The Minister said last week: "I expressed a purely personal view that the likely course of action would be a referral to a phase 2 assessment."</p><p>He told them the decision he was going to take.  He told nobody else.  He did not tell D&aacute;il Deputies, who asked the same question in here three weeks later.  He told nobody else.  When one gives that commercially sensitive information to one party, one is actually responsible for what happens with it down the line-----</p></speech>

By giving it, one knows there are consequences in giving it, in particular in giving it to a lobbyist for a key party to the deal.  Of course, that information was going to be used.  He was keeping that party on side, no question.  In terms of the ultimate decision, he took that decision but he gave confidential information.</p>  <p>  I find it difficult that the Taoiseach finds it difficult to find the words to say this was a wrong thing to do.  All he has to do, at the very minimum, is admit that what he did was wrong.  One cannot have a personal position.  He did not state he gave advice or that he told him that he would take advice".  He said "I expressed a ... personal view" that the "likely course of action" was that it would be referred, not that it may be referred.  Can the Taoiseach not differentiate between right and wrong?  It is as simple as that, in terms of a decision like this.  It is fundamental in terms of the approach of the Minister and the Government to all these basic issues.  Does the Taoiseach accept it was confidential, by definition?  He told the D&aacute;il he had told nobody and he was going to tell nobody.  However, he actually did.</p></speech>

When he took this unsolicited phone call, the matter was not before him.  It was the lobbyist who informed him that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission had made its decision and the matter was not before him.  By the time it arose in the D&aacute;il, it was at a different point in time and a different point in the process and the matter was before him.  He had no official advice or information to pass on.  He has made that clear in his statement already.  However, he accepts that it was a mistake and he has said he regrets ever taking the phone call.  He has apologised for that today.  The Minister has accounted for this, said he regrets it, said it was a mistake and apologised for it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400005#C00800"><p>There are serious issues with the sentences handed down for sexual crimes perpetrated against women, children and men in the State.  This evening, RT&Eacute;'s "Prime Time" will air a programme which underscores this truth.  The programme centres on the rape of three young girls at a foster home in County Galway between 2003 and 2007.  The girls were all under the age of ten when they were subjected to the vilest assaults at the hands of Keith Burke who lived in their foster home.  There are serious questions as to how the HSE handled the initial reports of abuse and how children were left to live with Mr. Burke after these reports were made.  I have no doubt but that more details of the handling by the State and the HSE of these cases will emerge.</p>  <p>  What we know is the gravity of the crimes committed by Keith Burke against these young girls.  We also know the leniency of the punishment handed down by the courts.  From an initial 70 charges reduced to 39 sample counts, Mr. Burke was found guilty on 23 counts.  At a sentencing hearing two weeks ago for the rape and brutalisation of these children, he received seven and a half years' imprisonment with one year suspended.  Nobody with an ounce of common sense or compassion would argue that this sentence was in any way proportionate or that it represented justice.  We could try but I doubt we could imagine the burning anger and heartbreak of Keith Burke's victims at this sentence.</p><p>The leniency of sentences for sexual crimes fundamentally undermines public confidence in the administration of justice.  This is a most serious matter.  How we address this deficiency in our criminal justice system is a big challenge for us, as legislators.  I have asked the Taoiseach on several occasions to consider the introduction of sentencing guidelines which would be drafted by a sentencing committee.  Making such a proposal does not encroach on the separation of powers or the autonomy of the Bench.  It would ensure, however, that prison sentences are proportionate with the crimes committed.</p> <p> Our justice spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, has tabled amendments to the judicial appointments Bill in line with these proposals.  We wish to be constructive on this matter.  We want to work with the Government to resolve these issues.  The Government must take into account how badly these young women, and many others, have been failed by our justice system.  I am of the view that our amendments are critical to achieving the best possible outcome in the interests of the public at large and, in particular, for the victims of rape and sexual abuse.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the Government will support our amendments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400006#D00200"><p>Like everyone in this House, I abhor crimes of this nature.  Sexual crimes are among the worst that can be perpetrated against anyone.  Crimes against children are also among the worst that can be committed.</p>  <p>  On sentencing, it is important to acknowledge that there is a separation of powers between the D&aacute;il, the Government and the Judiciary.  Ultimately, it is judges and juries who hear cases, who sit for days hearing all the evidence and the arguments and who make decisions based on that.  We need to be careful not to do anything to second-guess decisions by judges in this regard.  However, the Government believes it is appropriate we should move towards sentencing guidelines.  The best way to do that is through the Judicial Council Bill, which is making its way through the Houses.  The purpose of this legislation, as part of our reforms, is to establish a judicial council which can be a body that engages in training and upskilling judges and dealing with other matters relating to them.  It can also be the body which forms and issues sentencing guidelines.  The Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, will be happy to work with other parties on that.</p>  <p>  I do not believe the right vehicle for sentencing guidelines is the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, which deals with judicial appointments.  The right way to deal with this issue is by establishing a judicial council and giving it the function of drawing up sentencing guidelines rather than having this done by politicians.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400006#D00300"><p>In no way am I seeking to second-guess anybody.  I have stated clearly the necessity of the separation of powers and the autonomy of the Bench.  Neither do I believe, however, that we should second-guess the testimony of people who have come through the judicial system and the consistent message that they feel let down and that they have been failed.  One of the victims in the case I set out to the Taoiseach said, "I was very angry.  I thought I was fine but six-and-a-half years, seven-and-a-half years with one suspended, that is nothing [for] what he put us through."  That is a brave and truthful testimony from this woman.  We have entered an amendment to the Judicial Council Bill.  I must correct myself because I misspoke earlier.  I meant to refer to the Judicial Council Bill.  The legislation, as currently drafted, allows for the circulation of information.  We need more than that; we need a capacity to formulate sentencing guidelines.  We do not need mandatory sentencing but, rather, guidelines which will give parameters to the Judiciary.  Crucially, such guidelines will also address a real crisis in public confidence in terms of how the State, the system and the Judiciary regard these crimes and punish, or fail to sufficiently punish, them.  Will the Taoiseach support our amendments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400007#E00100"><p>I understand that the sentences handed down in this case were concurrent sentences of seven and a half years and six and a half years, with 12 months suspended.  That was on foot of several grave and egregious offences committed against these women.</p>  <p>  The Government's view on sentencing is that the best way is not through mandatory sentencing, and we are agreed on that, but through sentencing guidelines.  As a Government, we want to empower the new judicial council, once established, to be the body that will set those guidelines and in that way we can have much greater consistency across court decisions.  People want perpetrators of violent crimes, whether sexual offences, murder or other violent crimes, to face the full rigours of the law and receive stiff sentences so that they are put away for the safety of others.  They also want to see consistency in sentencing across court rooms.  Our view is the best place to do that is through the Judicial Council Bill and we would welcome support from other parties.</p></speech>

This showed that the average cost of sending a senior infant to school was &euro;355, an increase of &euro;15 on the previous year.  That increases to &euro;395 for a fourth class pupil and an astronomical &euro;800 for a second level pupil.  Parents stress the burden they face in meeting those costs for uniforms, shoes, books, stationery, trips and so on.  There is also the so-called voluntary contribution.  The survey found that the average cost of so-called voluntary contributions was &euro;80 per child in senior infants rising to &euro;150 for a second level pupil.  Yesterday, the Catholic Primary School Managers Association published another report which showed that the current capitation grant of &euro;170 per pupil covers just 52% of the running cost of schools.  It also showed that parents spent &euro;46 million to subvent that shortfall.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to increase capitation payments which has not yet been delivered upon.  We have an action plan for education but we do not have an action plan to ensure that the State meets its fundamental role in providing what is set down in law, namely, free primary school education.  In each of the last two alternative budgets produced by  the Labour Party, we committed to increasing the rate, beginning last year with &euro;10 per pupil.  Alongside this, we proposed a further &euro;10 per pupil if the school agreed not to ask for or accept voluntary contributions.  That proposal had a modest cost of &euro;15 million, but unfortunately it was not delivered in the budget.  In the context of the education expenditure, that amounts to 0.2% of the Department's budget.  Tomorrow, my colleague, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in, will publish our plan to ban voluntary contributions and place the onus on the State.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that so-called voluntary contributions should not be a feature of our school system and should be banned and that there should not be a supposedly voluntary requirement to make contributions to meet day-to-day costs?  Will the Taoiseach commit to increase the capitation available to schools in the next budget?</p></speech>

Part of the Government's role is to assist parents with those costs through measures such as child benefit and increases in family income supplement and the working family payment which came into effect in recent weeks.  In the past two years, we have increased the back to school clothing and footwear allowance twice.  I did that as Minister two years in a row, my predecessor in the Deputy's party having reduced it two or three years in succession, if I am not wrong.</p></speech>

The latter is because we know that 50% of children who are disadvantaged do not attend DEIS schools.  We have also done other things such as subsidising childcare, bringing in a second year of preschool and ensuring that everyone gets the two full years of early childhood education.  These are just a few examples of what the Government is doing to assist parents with the cost of rearing children and sending them to school.</p>  <p>  On voluntary contributions, the Minister for Education and Skills issued a circular to all schools in April in order to ensure a greater emphasis on reducing costs for parents.  The approach will be underpinned by law in the education (parent and student charter) Bill and will require that schools publish financial statements showing how all voluntary contributions are spent.  Voluntary contributions are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of any compulsion to pay, that in making a contribution they are doing so under their own volition and that they are not under pressure to do so.  Apart from those recognised fee-charging second-level schools, recognised primary and post-primary schools are precluded from charging school fees.  No charge may be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation, other than in respect of activities in which all students are expected to take part.  It is, however, permissible for schools to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities such as those which are not obligatory and in which individual students can choose whether to participate.  This is all outlined in Circular 0065/2010, which clarifies what charges can be requested from parents.</p></speech>

We all share responsibility for those decisions.  The problem now is that they have not been restored at a time when other things have been.  Before we left office, we restored social welfare payments as best we could.  There is a commitment in terms of pay.  We negotiated pay restoration.  The capitation grant is simply not a priority for the Government.  That is clear.  I acknowledge that it is only one of the issues which need to be addressed in order to make free education truly free.  The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is also a factor and should be increased further.  We should have a truly free book scheme in every school because, in truth, not only do we not have free education, we do not have equal education.  The capacity of parents in some schools to make so-called voluntary contributions is infinitely greater than in others.  Without making political points this time, the Taoiseach might say that this is a priority for the Government and that we will actually have free education in this country, as is supposed to be the case in accordance with the law.</p></speech>

It is the second time this art has had to be removed.  The cause for concern is that it was done under threat of loss of funding from a State body on the grounds that it was political.  This country has an inglorious record of censorship, both artistic and political, and this Parliament should be clear: a piece of art was removed from an arts building in 2018, in a ruling more reminiscent of the Committee on Evil Literature of the 1920s.  George Orwell stated "The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude."  Is it also the Taoiseach's belief that art should not argue for social change and that charities should not either?  The assertion by the chief executive officer, CEO, of the Charities Regulator that a mural with the words "Repeal the 8th" with a heart around them is outside the brief of an arts centre is a subjective one by the CEO himself, someone who has a long connection with the Catholic Church and a history of writing Catholic texts.  Will the Taoiseach investigate and review this decision - including how the mural came under orchestrated attack with all the complaints being lodged on one day - and send a message that we have broken with Ireland of the past or are we back to the old days of de Valera, when the arts had to keep to the holiest traditions?</p></speech>

Perhaps even the fact that it has been removed means more people saw it than might have otherwise seen it had it not been removed.  While one can paint over a mural, one certainly cannot paint over an issue.  The issue is that nine women every day in Ireland are forced to travel overseas to end their pregnancies and three women in Ireland every day - the number will only rise into the future - import pills online and take them without medical supervision and guidance, often in their own homes.  What we are putting to the people on 25 May is an opportunity to change this, to stop turning a blind eye, to stop turning a cold shoulder, to face up to the reality of abortion in Ireland and to change our Constitution in order that we can provide those services that many women need in our own country.</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il and the Minister for Health should set the record straight.  For example, a foetus at nine weeks is 0.9 of an inch and at 12 weeks is 2.13 of an inch.  It says something about the fear of the Irish establishment in this country that it has allowed these laws to completely narrow political expression and political art in this way.  We had a situation in the D&aacute;il where a group of Deputies wore repeal jumpers and in jig time the committee ruled out the wearing of any political slogans.  What do the Taoiseach and others think is so offensive about this image I am holding that it should be banned by a State body?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I assume the Charities Regulator would have taken the same approach had it been an anti-abortion or pro-life mural relating to the forthcoming referendum.  I want to emphasise that the authority is independent in carrying out its functions and in making any decisions on taking enforcement matters with respect to these issues.</p>  <p>  My personal point of view is that I do not find the mural in any way offensive, but I do not think it is murals or posters that will change people's minds or convince people on this issue.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach will know, last month the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, rejected a request by the Government to find that the men had suffered torture at the hands of the British army and the RUC special branch.  The 14 men involved were tortured for seven days, using brutal in-depth interrogation techniques, including being placed in stress positions, subjected to white noise, sleep deprivation, deprivation of food and water and receiving beatings and death threats.  It was torture plain and simple.</p>  <p>  The men have urged the Government to appeal the ECHR's decision.</p></speech>

The report, RT&Eacute; Orchestras: Ensuring a sustainable future, was welcomed by both the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  They welcomed in particular a recommendation that the National Symphony Orchestra should be a national cultural institution in its own right and within the National Concert Hall.  Section 114(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 states that it is a statutory objective of RT&Eacute; &quot;to establish and maintain orchestras&quot; - I stress the plural.  Does the Government intend to amend that legislation in order that the National Symphony Orchestra becomes a separate national cultural institution?

They want to know when this D&aacute;il will do its job and pass legislation that stops employers who are in good health and whose pension schemes are very wealthy walking away from such schemes and pushing defined benefit schemes out of the equation.  Ireland seems to be unique in not having legislation that prevents employers from ditching and undermining pension schemes.  In January, I asked the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection when the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would be processed through the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  By 30 June, Irish Life will ditch the defined benefit scheme for these workers unless their strike wins and unless we, in the D&aacute;il, complement that by pushing forward legislation.  It does not just have the effect of undermining the pensions of workers in Irish Life, but there are more 110,000 workers on 460 defined benefit schemes.  Open season has been declared on these schemes with &euro;41 billion in assets.  What sort of greed does it show that we are allowing that to happen?  We are unique in Europe in not having legislation that protects workers in these schemes.</p></speech>

It is important that we learn lessons from that.  One way the Taoiseach can show that he has learned some lessons is by giving effect to the many recommendations that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has made in recent years with regard to tightening up the position in resect of lobbying.  I ask him to give that area priority.</p>  <p>  In the context of promised legislation, the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, the purpose of which is to consolidate ethics legislation and give effect to the many recommendations from various tribunals, has been awaiting Committee Stage since before the most recent election.  It appears that there is little or no political will to progress these ethical issues.  To date, there has certainly been no evidence of that on the part of the Government.  I invite the Taoiseach to indicate that he has learned lessons from the events of last week and that he will give priority to supporting SIPO and bringing the legislation forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

All they have to do is print "ES" for Spain or "DK" for Denmark on the packaging and then confuse consumers by including an Irish name and a picture of our national flag.  The latter makes it seem that what is contained in the package is domestic meat when it is, in fact, of foreign origin.  If these companies import meat and slice it, they can then state that it Irish meat.  It is like our Lord turning water into wine.</p><p>It is ridiculous and wrong.

One has to put the country of origin on a product but producers may sometimes use clever branding to disguise where a product comes from and to mislead people, perhaps by using particular colours or names that people associate with one country.  The best thing people can do is look at the label, which has to indicate very clearly the country of origin.</p></speech>

Is there not a special emergency fund that can be accessed from the EU?  Many farmers on good land are only now leaving out some of their animals, as grass has now started to grow, but in County Kerry and all of the west, farmers cannot get their animals out.  Will the Taoiseach do something for them or give them a subsidy?  Their backs are to the wall and they have never been in a worse position.  The Taoiseach is not listening to them and that is very wrong.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is from very close to where I am from, but he is not aware of what the people in Kerry are going through.

When Storm Ophelia struck last October, over six months ago, many phone lines were knocked down, as would be expected with any storm, but in quite a number of rural communities many customers were left without a home phone service for up to two months.  The residents of Sherkin Island, off Baltimore and Skibbereen in west Cork, have had no home telephone service since last October.  Up to 100 residents live on the island and this has led to a loss of business.

Can Eir be asked to explain how it can leave customers for over six months without a telephone connection and still can bill them?</p></speech>

Many community services have been taken away.  In Dundalk, the births, deaths and marriages service has been withdrawn in the town, which is one of the largest in Ireland, and the Dunleer social welfare office has closed.  The Minister who is sitting beside the Taoiseach indicated on local radio that this was only a temporary measure.</p></speech>

It relates to a community being denuded of its services.  In the programme for Government, we and the Taoiseach committed to providing both economic and social services as the economy improved, but the Government is taking services away from people who require them.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, clearly said on local radio that it was a temporary measure and that the service would reopen.  I ask her to indicate that is what will happen because it is not what is being said by people in the social welfare offices in the region.</p></speech>

There is 15% outstanding to all farmers in receipt of that payment.  In light of the difficult circumstances that farmers are experiencing because of the weather crisis, it would be a generous gesture to come forward with that 15%.  It is money that is due.  Farmers are crying out for some support and this is something that can be done without the need for new budgets or extending any Exchequer figures.  I ask the Taoiseach that this be done immediately.  It would be of great help to the thousands of farmers in receipt of that payment.</p></speech>

I note that constituents in the middle of my constituency have been without a phone service since the last storm as well.</p>  <p>  I am raising the commitment in the programme for Government to make Ireland have the best education service in the world by 2026.  The issue that has reared its head this week is the scramble last night by the State Examinations Commission to find examiners and superintendents in the Dublin area to supervise the State examinations.  This is related to the issue of teacher shortage, which we have raised repeatedly and which has been denied by the Minister.  Almost exactly a year ago, the problem was denied.  It has reared its head and the chickens have come home to roost.  The State Examinations Commission cannot find examiners.  The Minister needs to set out his plan to assist it. </p>  <p>  While I am on the subject, it is also the case that just a fortnight ago, politics students in the leaving certificate - a subject that has been much heralded by the Government with others coming down the track - were landed with the news that about 27 of them will be obliged to sit three subjects in a single day during the leaving certificate examinations.  While that happens from time to time, these students had no notice of it and it is essential that the Minister intervenes in this regard.</p></speech>

I have taken steps to increase enrolment at both undergraduate and postgraduate level for teaching supply.  One of the significant reasons there is pressure is that in the past two years, we have recruited 5,000 additional teachers.  That has put pressure on areas like substitution.  We are determined that in areas of subject shortage, we will respond and we have a group working on that.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission is an independent body that schedules its examinations.</p><p>It seeks to accommodate people to the very best of their ability and looks at any suggestions that are put forward, but it has to try to arrange exams within a limited designated period, and it does its best to facilitate people in every why it can.</p></speech>

A lady in my constituency is the only person in Ireland suffering from Degos disease.  The Department of Health is well aware of her situation.  She is unable to access any treatment for that disease.  ME Advocates Ireland plan to hold a protest outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Thursday, 10 May, for a number of hours.  That protest will be the 12 month anniversary of a protest it had last year.  Myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, is recognised and has been classified as a neurological disease by the World Health Organization, WHO, since 1969.  However, the HSE is yet to recognise or acknowledge it as a disease and is yet to introduce an adequate treatment plan for sufferers of ME.</p>  <p>  In light of the commitment in the programme for Government to assist people with rare diseases, when can a patient who is the sole sufferer from Degos disease in Ireland, and patients suffering from ME, expect to get some help and assistance and access to healthcare from the Government?</p></speech>

There is a shortage of GPs throughout the country.  Some 600 are soon to retire, and a recent survey of GPs by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>found that 64% were no longer taking new patients.  Young families and older people are finding it increasingly difficult to get access to GP services and are falling back on on-call services.  These too are being capped.  In turn, families and other people are having to go to accident and emergency departments for basic services.</p><p>The Ballagh, near Enniscorthy, County Wexford, is one area facing the prospect of no longer having a GP.

This Bill was intended to deal with issues around grandparents' access to children, and sought to provide for the continuous development of the relationship and bond between a grandparent and his or her grandchild.  The Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 was enacted.  The problem I have, and the Taoiseach also stated in his reply that he had the same issues in his constituency, is that grandparents who have fallen out with in-laws have no access to their grandchildren.  On 7 March, the Taoiseach promised a more detailed answer.  Grandparents have called to my constituency office and want to know what is the reply.  The Taoiseach stated that he was aware that the matter is deeply upsetting for them.  When can I expect a more detailed reply to the question I asked on 7 March?</p></speech>

The report from this review was accepted by the Government on 27 March and published on the same date. </p><p>The report finds that there is significant benefit to be realised by implementing the communications reform programme which had been led by the SCU.  Furthermore, rapid progress had been made by the SCU in implementing its Government-approved work programme and it has played a very important role in improving cross-Government communications.  In regard to Project Ireland 2040, the report finds no evidence of a breach of the Civil Service code by civil servants in the SCU, whether by seeking favourable coverage for Fine Gael candidates or otherwise.</p><p>However, the report also notes that dealing with the intense political and media interest in the work of the SCU had come to dominate much of the time of the staff of the unit and of senior management.  By way of illustration, the SCU had, at the time of the review, been the subject of 203 parliamentary questions and 63 freedom of information requests, as well as a number of other debates, Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il and a large number of press queries.  This intense focus had been impacting my Department&rsquo;s ability to focus on its everyday work and strategic priorities.  This situation was not sustainable for my Department if it was to discharge its core functions.</p><p>In light of the aforementioned considerations, the Secretary General of my Department has made the following recommendations, which will be implemented over the coming months: that the SCU should be wound down; that the Department should revert to a reformed Government Information Service model, with a smaller budget, fewer staff and a more limited role than the SCU; that measures should be put in place across Departments which preserve the valuable and necessary reforms to ensure value for money, professionalisation and modernisation in Government communications activity; that there will not be any new national campaigns run by the SCU, with GIS continuing to have a co-ordinating and supporting role for national cross-Government communications, as has always been the case, but with such campaigns led and funded by the relevant line Department, if there is one; that international communications such as Global Ireland, the Security Council campaign, or the diaspora will be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; that the future communication of Project Ireland 2040 will be the responsibility of the new Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, which will be led by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government; that a number of aspects of the communications programme, such as the single Government identity programme, the migration to one single web portal, <i>gov.ie</i>, the capacity-building work for staff and the research survey will continue to be implemented; and that there will be a managed reversion to the more traditional GIS model, with a transition period until July 2018. </p><p>This transition is now underway and will conclude on schedule.  The reassignment of staff is being dealt with as a confidential HR matter by the management of the Department in consultation with each individual staff member.  As outlined in the review, surplus staff will be given the opportunity to be reassigned to another post either within my Department or in other Departments or agencies.  In some cases, the duties of staff will not change as they either predated the establishment of the SCU or their work will continue in a reformed GIS.  There will be no redundancies arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the review.</p><p>The 2018 funding allocation for the unit has been reduced from &euro;5 million to &euro;2.5 million to reflect the fact that the mandate ends in July.  The result will be that my Department's Estimate in total will be 9% less than it was in 2017.</p></reply>

First, I welcome the publication of the report on 27 March by the Ard-R&uacute;na&iacute; of your Department, Mr. Martin Frasier.  I think it is insightful and it is useful in examining the mistakes made in the establishment of the strategic communications unit, SCU.  I welcome its principal recommendation, for the SCU to be wound down by July.  I have a number of questions, however.  The report mentions on page 7 that the SCU engaged a company to carry out research work involving a public opinion survey.  The report says that given the express concerns by Opposition parties, it would be useful if they received a briefing and gave their views on the content of that survey before it is carried out.  This has not happened.  When will it happen?</p>  <p>  On the final page, the report further states, in stronger language, that the survey should only proceed once Opposition parties have given a view on the content.  That is an absolute necessity.  The report also recommends that the Government Information Service should continue to have a co-ordinating and supporting role for national cross-governmental communications, as has always been the case.  Do that finding and that recommendation not highlight the fact that the establishment of the SCU was a flawed decision in the very first instance?  Do they not highlight that if, as the Taoiseach has said on more than one occasion, the idea was for Government as an entity to initiate cross-departmental information campaigns and the like, the infrastructure was already in place to do all of that?  I note also the final recommendation of the report, that the issues raised in the review might usefully be considered by the Oireachtas.  I want to ask, therefore, if the Government intends to allocate time to discuss the review in the D&aacute;il.  It strikes me, given the lessons to be learned, that this would be a very useful endeavour.</p></speech>

Will he outline the specific changes that have occurred since the announcement on 26 March that the Secretary General's review had been accepted?  What specifically has occurred and what staff have been redeployed to date?  How many staff will be retained in the Government Information Service, GIS?  The Taoiseach indicated that offers of redeployment would be made.  Will staff be redeployed in his Department or across the public service generally?</p>  <p>  I am also interested in learning what will happen to the research that was carried out and that which was planned.  A sum of &euro;160,000 was allocated for this purpose.  We were informed in response to a parliamentary question that the research had not yet commenced.  According to the reply, it is intended to run a citizen survey "to assess public awareness and understanding of Government services."  As Deputy McDonald noted, the Secretary General made clear that this research should proceed only after Opposition parties had been briefed and had given their views on the contents of the survey.  When will that process take place and will the research proceed?</p>  <p>  On the overall budget, the Taoiseach indicated the budget of &euro;5 million was to be reallocated, with &euro;2.5 million to be retained to meet existing financial commitments.  I understand from his reply that the remaining &euro;2.5 million will be a saving to be rebated at the end of the year.  Is that the case or will this money be reallocated for other specific purposes?  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the matters I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400018#Q00200"><p>I have made clear from the outset that the strategic communications unit was a bad idea and wrong.  Wittingly or unwittingly, the SCU involved the politicisation of the public service.  Advertorials featuring Fine Gael Party candidates appeared in newspapers.  While we do not seem to understand how that happened, it is a fact.  Taxpayers' money should not be used to pay for such advertorials.  The nature of many of them was promotion rather than providing information.  The purpose of expensive advertisements placed at bus stops and in newspapers was promotion and in some respects propaganda, rather than providing citizens with information, as one would normally understand that function of government.</p>  <p>  I welcome the amount of information provided in the report of the Secretary General in which he recommended the winding up of Taoiseach's pet project, the strategic communications unit.  However, I encourage more people to read the detail of the report as it is in stark contrast with many of the comments and claims the Taoiseach made about the unit.  From the beginning, we were informed the SCU would be established in line with worldwide best practice.  The sole business case made was that the unit was best practice.  Documents show, however, that only two countries were reviewed and independent information or opinion was not sought on whether such a unit should be established or what it should do.  The reason was that this was the Taoiseach's idea and he proceeded to appointed the head person.  Incredibly, the two countries reviewed both indicated that the agenda for such a unit should be set by the public rather than politicians and should emerge from public consultation rather than being set to fit political parties.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated originally that the objective of the research was to inform the work of the strategic communications unit.  However, that work proceeded and &euro;2.5 million was spent before any research was carried out.  Will the Taoiseach explain how &euro;2.5 million was contracted, with millions more planned, without any public consultation on the agenda?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also informed the House that &euro;178 million was being spent in a fragmented manner on advertising and needed to be rationalised.  As we learned from the report, two Departments account for 60% of this expenditure, namely, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The bulk of this was spent by independent agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Bord Bia.  The Taoiseach emphasised in the House that it was never intended that the unit would oversee the advertising budgets of these two Departments, although none of this was said in the aggressive, not-an-inch defence of the unit we heard for weeks and months.  Would it not have been reasonable to supply this information before contracting millions of euro in new advertising?  Will the research proceed?</p></speech>

By the time the Government's programme had reached its zenith, the unit employed 15 staff and we had not been given a figure on its expenditure at that point.  However, I understand from the Taoiseach's response that the cost of the unit in the months until May was &euro;2.5 million.  In other words, half of the budget was spent in four months.  The SCU was a runaway train.  We advised the Taoiseach as best we could that he had stepped over a line.</p><p>Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>includes a nice historical feature on which the following is printed: &quot;A series of special supplements supported by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht&quot;.  Inside, the publication features a nice photograph of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, and a page of commentary from the Minister.

Were contractual agreements or indications of contracts made at any of these meetings?  Why are we being left hanging on?  How much did the study carried out by the Secretary General cost?  One of his senior officials helped the Secretary General with his work.  This has been a fiasco.</p>  <p>  Will each Department revert to having its own public affairs function and press officer, as was the tradition?  Is the Government Information Service being restored and, if so, on what basis?  We deserve to know the answer to that question.  If the GIS is commissioning studies, will they be made available to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann given that the D&aacute;il votes for funding that is to be spent for this purpose and it is to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and all of its parties and Members to which research should be made available?</p></speech>

As outlined on 18 October 2017 and again on 22 November 2017, the research commissioned is to inform Government communications.  It is intended to help the Department learn more about public awareness and understanding of Government services.  As outlined in the Secretary General's review, the intention is to continue with the citizen survey after Opposition parties have had an opportunity to be briefed and to give their views on it.  The research will inform best practice and support evidence based decision making on communications policies and approaches across government.  When I last checked, work on this had not commenced and, as such, no survey has been done as yet and nothing has been done in the field.  We have given a commitment that Opposition parties will be consulted on the questions before a survey is carried out.  The issue has been de-prioritised.  While it is still intended to carry out the survey at some point in the future, it is not a priority at the moment.</p>  <p>  It is not necessary to do research in advance when it comes, for example, to finding out whether people know about Project Ireland 2040.  How could people possibly know about something that had not yet been launched?  I am sure the same approach was taken with regard to the national development programme and Transport 21.  We do not need research to tell us that people did not know about Transport 21 before it had been launched because it would not be possible for people to know about something that was a new policy or programme.  That is, therefore, a rather facile argument.</p></speech>

However, it is intended that the Government Information Service will have a role in co-ordinating cross-departmental campaigns, for example, Healthy Ireland, which cuts across different Departments.  Project Ireland 2040 will be handed over in large part to the management board consisting of officials from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>As for specific changes, activities have been pared back and planned campaigns have not happened.  Other things have continued, such as the regional and sectoral launches of Project Ireland 2040.

The other &euro;2.5 million will be rebated to the Exchequer.  It is anticipated that my Department will underrun in its spending.  I have fewer advisers than the three previous taoisigh and mine is one of the few Departments that has reduced its budget this year.

As Deputies will know or should know from the report, all editors confirmed that they included those photographs on foot of their own decisions and were not asked or pressed to do so by anyone.  That is, of course, in stark contrast to the false allegations that were made in the House.  I regret that nobody has withdrawn any of quite a number of false allegations that were made regarding the SCU.  I regret that we have not seen any Member withdraw those false allegations.  It was also found in the report that no member of the Civil Service and no public servant breached the Civil Service code of conduct or favoured a political party in any way.  Again, that was a false allegation that should be withdrawn by those who made it and who accused civil servants and public servants of engaging in political work or promoting the interests of one particular party.</p><p>I am afraid that I cannot advise Deputy Burton on the particular supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i>.

Members are appointed in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010, that is, 15 members are nominated by the five sectors - business and employer, ICTU, farming and agriculture, community and voluntary, and environmental; six are public servants and there are seven independent members.  Appointments also comply with the guidelines on appointments to State boards.  Currently, four vacancies exist on the council in the independent category.  These vacancies were advertised on <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>on 31 January last.  The process of seeking expressions of interest and assessing suitability for appointment was managed by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and has now concluded.  Just before Easter I received the names of those deemed suitable for appointment by the PAS assessment panel and I am considering these at the moment.</p></reply>

The closing date for the receipt of applications for these four vacancies was 21 February.  The Taoiseach says the process has been completed and that he has a list of proposed appointees.  When does the Taoiseach propose to announce who the individuals are?  I imagine there were any number of applications for these vacancies and posts, given the nature and function of the council.  How many applicants were there from whom the Taoiseach had to choose the four successful candidates?  How many were on the list that was handed to the Taoiseach for decision?  I seek a bit more detail on the numbers.</p>  <p>  One current area of work for the council is on land use, land value and urban development.  I note a recent workshop on the issue in late February, which focused in particular on housing affordability.  There were presentations and examples from the Netherlands and Austria where Vienna boasts one of the best housing systems of any capital city globally.  Given the Taoiseach's love of all things European, can we expect recommendations from the NESC to enhance State and local authority involvement in affordable housing?</p></speech>

There are a lot of infrastructural bottlenecks, as the Taoiseach has been telling us.  In particular, the Minister for Education and Skills has significantly slowed the refurbishment of older schools and almost completely abandoned their refurbishment in favour exclusively of brand-new schools.  The NESC has done valuable work in the past on identifying priorities.  It is fair to say that the way the Government is approaching housing is a mystery to everyone.  For instance, a small problem which could be addressed and an area in which the NESC could show us the way involves all of the vacant sites in the possession of Dublin City Council.  These include O'Devaney Gardens, the bottom of Dominick Street and about 40 others I could list.  That is not to mention the pervasive dereliction in the north inner city, which looks like an individual with two front teeth and gaps everywhere else.  The Taoiseach was in the north inner city recently and he could not have failed to spot this.  Given the brain power in the NESC, it might be in a position to advise the Taoiseach on some way out of the housing situation, wasted empty sites and the failure of local authorities to do anything.</p></speech>

As he knows, Ministers, or in this case the Taoiseach, set out the criteria to determine eligibility for a vacancy.  What was the set of skills the Taoiseach looked for to fill these vacancies?</p><p>Three current issues are being examined in the work programme of NESC, namely, jobless households, climate change and land use.  We all agree the most pressing issue is Brexit.  Should the economic, transport and other implications of Brexit be considered by NESC?  Has the Taoiseach asked for people with the expertise in this particular area to supplement the existing skill sets of members of NESC?  If he has not, will he consider doing so, as this probably will be the most important economic issue we will face for the next decade or does he believe those skill sets already exists on the council?</p></speech>

N&iacute;l an Rialtas ag cur aon bh&eacute;im ar an gcomhairle seo.</p>  <p>  The delay in appointing independent members of NESC seems to suggest the Government has not been eager for the council to be as active as it can be.  That is a great shame, given how important NESC has been in the past in producing common-sense yet detailed reports.  Yesterday, the council began a joint lecture series on homelessness with Focus Ireland.  This is operating at a high level of independent academic expertise on the dynamics of homelessness.  The Taoiseach will agree that the failure of the Government to even understand homelessness figures demonstrates a serious problem.  It is now six months since the Taoiseach told his own party, "we have a plan, the plan is working".  For the past two months, however, record numbers of people caught up in homelessness show the plan is not working.  Will he accept that the statement from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that he does not know why the figures are so high and has asked for a report does not suggest he is on top of it?</p>  <p>  Before the Taoiseach starts quoting rough sleeper numbers again at us, those numbers are down purely because of the exceptional efforts of voluntary organisations during the extreme weather.  When will the Taoiseach be able to explain why announcements in January that everything was fine have been followed with record increases in homelessness?</p></speech>

What role will the council play and is the Taoiseach putting the need to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis as a central urgent priority?  There may be issues competing for the title of the most pressing economic and social issue but I believe it is the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, a bus driver, who would be on the average industrial wage, came to my office because he and his family are now facing homelessness due to rent increases.  He cannot find housing anywhere.  If people on average industrial earnings are facing homelessness because there are no council houses, rents are out of control and their earnings will not allow them to get a mortgage, one can hardly state that the Government's housing policy is working.</p>  <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council, which People Before Profit certainly does not control, passed a motion stating Rebuilding Ireland had failed.  Wexford County Council passed a similar motion.  The evidence is there for all to see.  The fact that the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland, Simon and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions took to the streets as part of a national demonstration recently is also evidence there is simply no faith that the Government's housing and homelessness policy is delivering.  How much of a priority will this be for the Taoiseach and the role he will assign to NESC?</p></speech>

There were 31 applications in total which were short-listed to eight by the Public Appointments Service.  It passed these on to me with the various curricula vitae.  My intention in approaching these appointments is to have regard, first, to gender balance as there is a degree of gender imbalance in NESC at present.  Deputies will be aware that 52% of people appointed to State boards last year were female while 48% were male.  I intend to ensure two of those four appointments go to women who were short-listed.</p>  <p>  They largely come from academic institutions.  Accordingly, I do not want to appoint all four from the one part of the country or the one academic institution.  I will have regard to the advantages of having people from different parts of the country and, perhaps, even having members from Northern Ireland or outside of the country.  Having representation from Northern Ireland or international expertise could add to the skill mix and skill base that NESC has.</p>  <p>  I tend to see NESC as a think tank for the Government.  We have many different ways of engaging with different partners through the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, the national dialogue and various other mechanisms.  NESC has produced some good work over the past several months.  For those who have not read it, I commend its report on the circular economy.  It is worth reading.  I read its draft land use study over the past couple of days, which it will publish soon.  It provides valuable analysis as to what additional policy actions on better use of land around the country could be put in place.</p>  <p>  The Government has taken two actions on derelict sites.  The first was the creation of the derelict site levy, which is starting to take effect.  It was never going to take effect overnight because we were required for constitutional and common-sense reasons to give people notice that their sites would be levied if they did not develop them.  That is kicking in now this year.  Anecdotally, I am told it is making a difference in some places in terms of a vacant sites being brought into use.</p>  <p>  We also announced we intend to establish a land regeneration agency, which is part of Project Ireland 2040.  We will have more details on that in the coming weeks and months ahead.  Our intention is to use that agency to take existing State land and acquire additional land for development.  It would be following something similar to the model being used by the Grangegorman Development Agency and, before it lost the run of itself, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in actually using State lands and adding private land to that to make it available for development.</p></speech>

In simple terms, the bioeconomy involves the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products such as food, biopharmaceuticals and bioenergy.</p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group, bringing together the Departments and agencies involved in the bioeconomy and chaired by my Department, was established in November 2016.  This group carried out a detailed scoping exercise to identify current and potential activities in the area, as well as stakeholder workshops and a public consultation.</p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement and consultation, officials in my Department prepared the first national policy statement on the bioeconomy.  The Government published the policy statement on 12 March.  This delivered on commitments given in the Action Plan for Jobs and the Action Plan for Rural Development.</p>  <p>  The Government's vision for the bioeconomy is for Ireland to be a global leader through a co-ordinated approach that fully harnesses Ireland's natural resources and competitive advantages.  The statement sets out some guiding principles and several strategic policy objectives aimed at expanding the bioeconomy.  It focuses on three pillars, namely, investments in research, innovation and skills; development of markets and competitiveness; and reinforced policy co-ordination and stakeholder engagement.</p>  <p>  It seeks also to build on the recently launched Bioeconomy Research Centre funded by Science Foundation Ireland in conjunction with industry investment.  The centre will be a catalyst for the future development of the bioeconomy in Ireland.  There will also be a focus on availing of funding to the maximum extent possible from the European Commission and combining this with resources from the private sector.</p><p>The Government has established an implementation group, jointly chaired by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to ensure there is coherence between all sectoral strategies which impact on the bioeconomy; identify regulatory and other barriers to growth and how these might be overcome; and examine specific opportunities for development.</p> <p> The group will submit its first report to Government on these matters by the end of 2018 through Cabinet committee A which deals with matters pertaining to the economy, jobs and rural development.</p></reply>

However, there is one particular prerequisite to building the bioeconomy which the policy skates over, although, to be fair, it does mention it, namely, enhancing the supply of domestic clean energy sources.  This is not only desirable from the perspective of energy security, but is also key to tackling climate change.  The national planning framework contains only vague aspirations which give very little clarity on this matter.  The plan states that there will be energy research funding into solar and biogas.  These are already well established power sources worldwide.  We are past the research stage; we need to use them.  We need to be very specific about what energy sources will replace fossil fuels.  The phasing out of peat is an aspiration, but there is no plan about what will replace it.  If it is biomass, we need to plan to promote the indigenous growing of biomass to become an industry in the midlands to replace the peat industry.  Currently, Bord na M&oacute;na imports biomass from across the globe to burn with peat.  Why is this not being adequately promoted in Ireland?</p></speech>

However, we are coming late to the party and the statement is somewhat general and lacking in specific detail.  We need to move to real projects and investment which will make this a reality.  Biological waste is a resource but we are not using it while doing things that militate against it.  Building a huge incinerator in Dublin, for example, militates against developing a circular economy and a bioeconomy.  Why develop a bio and circular economy - a sustainable economy - when there is a big incinerator where one can just burn everything?  That militates against it.  Cities such as London, Paris and Munich have all discovered that privatising waste collection and recycling services does not help develop sustainable circular economies and bioeconomies, which is why those three cities have taken waste and recycling back into public ownership.  We see from waste companies, the factor that dictates what they will or will not recycle is whether something is profitable, not whether it is good for developing a sustainable, circular economy and a recycling industry.  We need to take those services back into public ownership, as those cities have done.</p>  <p>  Finally, if we are going to develop biorefining, biomass and so on, we must dramatically increase forest cover in this country, which is currently pathetic.</p></speech>

I expect most people do not have a clue.  Perhaps people studying science at an advanced level, whether for the leaving certificate or in college would understand it.</p>  <p>  Regarding the future of Bord na M&oacute;na, the way people in Ireland use turf is changing dramatically.  It involves major economic and social pressures in rural areas, yet Fine Gael has given no indication of what it sees as the future for Bord na M&oacute;na.  Over the past three or four decades, Bord na M&oacute;na has shown a very considerable capacity to change and workers have shown a capacity to co-operate with change.  However, the Government has no vision of how this will happen.  The Lisheen mine has come to the end of its life and been abandoned.  That is in a rural part of Tipperary.  Will the Taoiseach indicate in simple language, whether in English or Irish, what vision, if any, Fine Gael and the Government has for a bioeconomy at Lisheen?</p></speech>

It extends across a range of sectors and disciplines, from what can be seen as quite traditional sectors such as farming and agrifood, as well as energy suppliers, to novel protein production and biopharmaceuticals.  It is about using advances in technology to put renewable biological resources, including those which might previously have been discarded as by-products of waste, back into productive use.  Biological resources could mean things such as crops, forest, fish, animals and their by-products, micro organisms and also industrial feed stock resources such as solid waste and wastewater.  I hope that is in straightforward enough language to satisfy Deputies.</p>  <p>  On the Government's actions, much of this is set out well in Project Ireland 2040.  A decision to stop burning coal at Moneypoint in 2025 will see Ireland become one of the first countries in the world to take coal off its grid as a source of fuel.  Between now and then, a decision will have to be made on what will replace it.  It might be natural gas, which is a fossil fuel but is considered a transitional fuel in moving away from heavy carbon fuels, or it might be biomass.  We must bear in mind that biomass must be largely imported and there are costs associated with that, including environmental costs where it has been transported over large distances.  It could also displace other agriculture in Ireland, so we must consider that one consequences of growing more biomass in Ireland is that we have to grow less of other things.  </p>  <p>  We decided that, as of next year, the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will no longer buy vehicles for their fleets other than low or no emission vehicles.  Peat will continue to be used as long as the public service obligation exists but we envisage that it will also come off the grid in time.  We have indicated that in 2030, we will end the sale of diesel and petrol cars, preparing for their replacement by electric vehicles and other vehicles.  As part of Project Ireland 2040, we have also committed to electrifying some of our busier existing train lines which will help to decarbonise our transport system.  </p>  <p>  Forestry was mentioned.  It is correct that forest cover in Ireland is much lower than in other European countries but it has also increased considerably in recent decades as a result of the forestry programme.  We have indicated that the forestry programme will continue and there will be a new programme on the completion of the current programme.  Forestry acts as both a carbon sink as well as creating rural employment and, if managed correctly, can benefit tourism. We have also indicated the establishment of the climate action fund, a fund of over &euro;500 million to support innovation in the area.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.267.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400022#U00100"><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy in respect of national roads.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects on national roads is the responsibility of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the relevant local authority.  More specifically, the statutory powers to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s request has been considered in conjunction with TII and it has been determined, with some degree of regret, that the slip road tolls in Drogheda should not be removed.  A number of factors have influenced this decision.  Any loss of toll revenue incurred by lifting the road tolls for Drogheda during August 2018 would have to be paid by the Exchequer to the road toll company.  Lifting the tolls would also create a precedent for any other toll charges to be lifted where an event was organised near a toll plaza.  In addition, it would be administratively impossible to distinguish between those attending the fleadh and those simply avoiding the toll.</p>  <p>  TII conducted studies on the removal of tolls at slip roads entering Drogheda.  These showed that removal of the slip tolls would lead to diversions from the M1 to this junction to avoid the mainline toll and would attract traffic that currently avoids the junction because of tolling.  North-facing ramp flows would increase from 3,000 to 18,800 vehicles per day, leading to a significant increase in light and heavy vehicular traffic on the Donore road, the Duleek road and the R152.  The residents living adjacent to these roads would experience higher levels of congestion and associated negative impacts on the road pavement, air quality, road safety and noise.  These roads do not have the capacity to carry the additional 15,800 vehicles per day.</p>  <p>  In any event, those attending the fleadh and travelling north along the M1 can avoid tolls by diverting at junction 7, Gormanstown, onto the R132 and into Drogheda.  Traffic travelling south along the M1 can also avoid tolls by diverting at junction 10.</p></reply>

As the Minister knows, it is an internationally recognised festival with massive tourism potential.  I contacted the Minister and we had our first meeting on 31 January.  He was to get back to me by the end of February.  I have contacted his office for a follow-up response on five occasions.  That is a cowardly way to do business.  I had to table a priority question today in order to get a response from the Minister.  At my request, he gave a commitment that he would personally meet Celtic Roads Group to plead the case.  Did he do that?  What case did he make?  Did he even press for a reduction in the tolls during the fleadh?  We are talking about a one-week festival.  The Minister said that there would be engagement with the Garda and the local authorities in respect of the effect of the slip road toll.  I had told the Minister that there would be queues for miles up the M1 during the fleadh, when 400,000 people are expected to visit Drogheda, if he does not lift the toll on the slip roads for the duration.</p></speech>

I did say that it is with regret that I have decided that this request will have to be turned down.  I made a pledge that I would contact Celtic Roads Group, CRG.  The Deputy is absolutely right about that.  I made a pledge that I would be in contact with TII about this.  The Deputy is absolutely right in that regard.  I met the Deputy to discuss this matter at some length and I have taken trouble with it.  I contacted CRG and TII about it in recent weeks.  The conclusions are those which I outlined in my response.  CRG would certainly need compensation if this was to be done.  TII supplied the information I have provided to the Deputy, which simply says that this would set a precedent TII would find difficult to stand over in other cases.  It has to be funded from somewhere.  If it was done for Drogheda, it would have to be done for a large number of other places located close to tolled motorways and where fleadhs are held.  While it would be wonderful if we could open the roads without tolls, it would have to happen in other cases as well.  That is why I reluctantly feel that it would not be a good decision.</p></speech>

There is no precedent to be set here at all.  The Minister is responsible for both transport and tourism and he has put absolutely no effort into securing the removal of the slip road toll in Drogheda for just one week.  He has put absolutely no effort in.  Again, he is afraid to upset private business.  He is putting private business before people again.  He has said that compensation would be necessary but, by his own estimation, it would cost between &euro;115,000 and &euro;130,000 to remove the toll for the duration of the fleadh.  When compared to the sports grant of &euro;150,000 the Minister gave to Wesley College for parochial purposes, the removal of the slip road toll during the fleadh would have an enormous effect of tourism and would benefit Drogheda, the fleadh, the people of Louth and, in particular, the 400,000 visitors who will come.  Those visitors will mainly be families, but also voluntary musicians not just from Ireland but from right across the world.  The Minister has let the people of Drogheda and the people of Louth down and he has also most definitely let 400,000 potential visitors down.</p></speech>

I am sorry we cannot lift tolls for everybody everywhere all the time.  TII tells me that it has received numerous requests for local tolls to be waived when festivals are being held.  Such festivals have included the Waterford leg of the Tall Ships Races, Limerick City of Culture 2014, the Dublin leg of the Tall Ships Races in 2012 and various other festivals.  Tolls have never been waived for such events.</p></speech>

It is fair to point out that Drogheda is the only town which has a tolled slip road leading into it.  However, it is also served by toll-free access points.

What is the status of the ongoing pensions issue at CI&Eacute; group involving approximately 16,700 members and what steps has the Minister taken to address this issue, which has been brought to his attention on a number of occasions?  My colleague, Deputy O'Dea, brought the matter to the Minister's attention in November.  The Minister was to revert back to him.  I do not think he did so.  We had a discussion on this issue at a recent meeting of an Oireachtas committee.  What steps is the Minister taking to address this issue?</p></reply>

It relates to a matter which is exercising the minds of a large number of active pensioners at CI&Eacute;.  He is right to raise this up in the House, even though it is not one with which I am very directly involved.  However, I think the information that will come out of this debate will be useful to many of those people involved in the scheme.  Issues in relation to CI&Eacute; &rsquo;s pension scheme are primarily a matter for the CI&Eacute; Group, their employees and the trustees of the pension scheme.  The schemes are also subject to independent regulation by the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  The employees of CI&Eacute; are provided pension benefits on retirement from one of two defined benefit schemes; the regular wages scheme and the superannuation scheme.  In common with the overwhelming majority of defined benefit schemes, they are facing significant challenges in maintaining solvency to ensure prudent provision is made to fund the cost of future pensions in a low interest rate environment.  As I have pointed out previously in this House and elsewhere, CI&Eacute; is on record at the Workplace Relations Commission as making two significant commitments.</p><p>First, CI&Eacute; has committed that it will not impose any change that it proposes without the agreement of the active members of both schemes.  Second, CI&Eacute; commits that it will continue to contribute to both schemes in accordance with the rules of the schemes.  These commitments are important and reassuring.</p> <p> I have previously outlined the challenges faced in addressing the solvency of the schemes and the process under way to address the deficit.  The process involves detailed discussion between CI&Eacute; and employee representatives, facilitated by the WRC.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware that members of one of the CI&Eacute; pension schemes have highlighted particular concerns.  These were communicated to public representatives and raised in the House, with the Committee of Public Accounts and with the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I understand that CI&Eacute; issued a comprehensive response to these queries on 22 February.</p> <p> As the Deputy knows, CI&Eacute; also appeared before the joint committee on 7 March to discuss the matter, explain its position and set out the facts.  Following that meeting, CI&Eacute; has written to the committee formally conveying the company's willingness to pursue two measures that could help support constructive engagement between the company and the unions regarding the pensions issue.</p> <p> In its letter CI&Eacute; has made it clear that it is willing to fund independent advice for the trade union group.  This would help determine matters of fact, whether through a process facilitated by the WRC, or alternatively through some other mutually agreeable process.</p> <p> CI&Eacute; has also indicated to the joint committee its willingness to participate in a process, chaired by a suitable independent professional person or body appointed by CI&Eacute; and the trade union group, TUG, with a view to determining past matters currently at issue.  In the event that the parties fail to agree on a mutually agreeable body, CI&Eacute; proposed that the Director General of the WRC could be requested by the parties to appoint such an independent body.</p></speech>

However, since the amalgamation of the five schemes into two by way of primary legislation in 1994, that responsibility has been there on a statutory basis in respect of how these schemes must be funded.  As the sole shareholder in the CI&Eacute; group, the Minister has a responsibility to ensure that the CI&Eacute; group adheres to the legislation as agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1994.  When the groups were before the Oireachtas committee earlier this year, SIPTU representatives produced a document which, it is alleged, came from the CI&Eacute; group.  They themselves suspected in 2009 that CI&Eacute; had a minimum legal requirement to fund its two pension schemes by an additional &euro;11 million but that it may also be legally necessary to fund its two pension schemes by an additional &euro;26 million.  Has the Minister ever found out whether this document originated or was brought about by CI&Eacute; itself and whether it compiled the document?  Furthermore, the Minister said today that the CI&Eacute; group indicated that it was prepared to give funding for independent legal advice.  From engaging with representatives of this pension scheme, that is not my understanding.</p></speech>

My understanding is that CI&Eacute; is prepared to fund that, provided it is independent advice, but I will check the matter with CI&Eacute; after Question Time because there is obviously a complete and fundamental difference of opinion there.</p>  <p>  The question the Deputy asked before that was whether I will investigate the governance of two CI&Eacute; pension schemes.  Members of one of the CI&Eacute; pension schemes have highlighted particular concerns and made allegations which they have communicated to public representatives, who have raised them in the House, with the Committee of Public Accounts and with the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  CI&Eacute; is willing to engage in an independently chaired process with the unions to determine past matters that are currently at issue regarding the pensions situation.  As the Deputy knows, CI&Eacute; made that proposal to the joint Oireachtas committee.  It would likely be a very technical exercise, so a mutually acceptable professional person would be needed to chair it.  If the two sides are unable to find a suitably independent chair, CI&Eacute; is prepared for the WRC to nominate a suitable person to investigate that.  I am sure the unions will agree to this.  I hope they will.</p></speech>

That would not be independent advice, to my mind.  The representatives of the pensioners wish to seek independent legal advice to be able to get their own legal opinion, which CI&Eacute; would fund.  On obtaining that independent legal advice, they then wish to have an independent body with the relevant expertise in pensions to adjudicate on behalf of both themselves and the CI&Eacute; group.  If that is something that is on offer today and that the Minister is confirming the CI&Eacute; group has relayed to him, that would be a welcome development.</p></speech>

Obviously, I want to see this resolved amicably and in a mature way.  Any offer of an independent expert advice to the trades unions to help them clarify facts regarding the pensions issues should be welcomed.  That offer, as far as I know and am told, is still on the table, and I hope that all parties in this dispute will get together and do this.  I also hope that the funding proposals to the Pensions Authority go ahead to get the schemes back on track.  We have a very serious situation here, which the Deputy acknowledges, for the workforce and I have a great sympathy for them.  I will do anything I can without intervening to encourage them to get back to the WRC and discuss these matters, which of course affect their future and the future of other people.  It is certainly my duty, not so much as a Minister but as a public representative, to see that their fears are assuaged.  They have the legitimate fears of anyone who is in such a pensions trap, and it is not unique to CI&Eacute;.  I was even looking at some of the pension funds and the comparison between the performance here and the funding gap in CI&Eacute;.  It is not unusual and it is one they share with a large section of the workforce.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400023#V01000"><p>This is not a new question but it is one in respect of which the reply should be updated regularly.  The Deputy is right: there are short-term problems which must be addressed and the medium-term steps are equally important.  I know he regularly says we do not have a vision and we should have both a long-term and a short-term vision of what will happen.  I think we can offer that to the Deputy today.</p>  <p>  The Dublin City Centre Transport Study, published jointly by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, in 2015, recognised that a rebalancing of the available road space would be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking.  Through a multi-agency approach by NTA, DCC, and TII working in conjunction with the various public transport operators, the measures set out in the 2015 study are being progressed so as to ensure that the Dublin city transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times, and that it facilitates the city's continued development and growth.</p>  <p>  The NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-35 provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades.  The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  Recent investment in public transport, allocated through the NTA, was targeted to provide additional capacity and alternative choice for private car users.  This included investment in new cycling routes and expansion of public bicycle share schemes, integrated ticketing and real-time passenger information, renewal and expansion of the bus fleet, commencement of city centre rail resignalling, opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, the progressive and ongoing introduction of city centre traffic management measures, reorganisation of bus services and the introduction of Luas cross city.</p><p>Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period from 2018 to 2021.  The national development plan, which was launched earlier this year by the Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, confirms a number of key investment priorities.  These will be delivered progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network to match transport demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.</p></speech>

If one considers capital investment in transport, it was &euro;3.8 billion in 2008 but fell to &euro;1 billion in 2016.  Congestion costs the State millions of euro every year and it robs people of their lives by ensuring they spend long periods commuting to and from work.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, only advises Dublin Bus annually on what funding it will get.  It cannot plan even 12 months in advance in terms of ordering new buses, for which there is a lead-in time of nine to 12 months.  The Minister spoke about cycling and increased investment in cycling infrastructure.  This is factually incorrect.  The Minister's reply to another parliamentary question I tabled stated that in 2015, a sum of &euro;18.8 million was invested in cycling infrastructure whereas last week, the Minister confirmed at the committee meeting on the Estimates that in 2018, only &euro;8 million would be invested.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it is a very ambitious plan.  We will have additional Luas capacity, with new longer 55 m trams and lengthened existing trams being introduced on the green line.  There will be the introduction of a new service timetable to make optimum use of the new longer trams, which we expect to be fully introduced in service by the end of May, which is very short term.  We will commence the roll-out of BusConnects to overhaul the current bus system.  We will complete the city centre resignalling project.  We will deliver priority elements of the DART expansion programme.  We will manage the traffic flow on the M50.  We will invest in park and ride.  There will be an investment of more than &euro;750 million for BusConnects.  This is something the Deputy and I seem to have some sort of a constant disagreement about, but up to 2021 we will have investment of more than &euro;110 million for new urban cycling and walking routes in the greater Dublin area and in the Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford city areas.</p></speech>

He talks about BusConnects but that is 2027.  At present, 60% of new Dublin Bus buses are replacement buses, at a time when the number of passenger journeys on Dublin bus has increased from approximately 120 million to 150 million per annum in three years.  This year, 15 of the new buses are actually replacement buses.  The funding that has been spent on cycling infrastructure in the past three years has decreased from &euro;18 million to &euro;8 million.  The Minister spoke about longer trams.  Was the Department made aware of the technical fault?  It is my understanding these longer trams are the first of their type anywhere in the world.  Do we have confidence that when they come back at the end of May they will work satisfactorily?  When they come back at the end of May, will they provide the same chaos that was provided to other modes of transport in the capital city?  With regard to College Green, when will An Bord Plean&aacute;la adjudicate on the future plaza on College Green?</p></speech>

The public consultation on core corridors at the detailed level will happen in the third quarter of 2018.

It is one we have to address.  The Deputy is identifying a potential problem, which we are addressing in fact, but she is right to bring it up here.</p>  <p>  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017, currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, will introduce amendments regarding sanctions for owners of mechanically propelled vehicles who allow learner drivers to drive the vehicle unaccompanied.  There are nearly 250,000 learner permit holders in Ireland, many of whom are on their second or subsequent learner permit.  The Road Safety Authority envisages that the legislation will bring about an increase of between 53,000 to 119,000 driving test applications within the first 12 to 18 months of its introduction.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years, driver test applications have increased by almost 20%.  This has meant that the waiting times for customers for driver tests have increased.  The current national average waiting time for a driver test is 13 weeks.  The objective of the RSA is to have a national average waiting time of no longer than ten weeks.</p>  <p>  The RSA currently employs 103.44 full-time equivalent driver testers.  My Department has sanctioned an additional 28 driver testers since October 2016, and 23 are now conducting driver tests.  The remaining five testers will be in place shortly.  The RSA recently ran a recruitment campaign for driver testers and will have a panel of 100 candidates in place.</p>  <p>  The RSA has forwarded a driver test demand scenario planning submission to my Department, which seeks approval to appoint, on temporary contracts, 67 additional driver testers and 17 support staff on a phased basis for a period of 12 to 18 months to manage the possible surge in driver test applications.  My officials are considering this proposal at present, and it is my intention to have any necessary supports in place to handle an increase in driver test applications.</p>  <p>  The RSA is also undertaking initiatives to increase capacity to deliver extra driver tests.  These initiatives include the delivery of 120 extra overtime tests per driver tester who participates.  Other measures include initiatives to reduce the number of applicant no-shows at the driver test, and systems to reduce the number of no-shows and non-conducted driver tests.  The authority plans to introduce a new test booking system that will give test applicants much more control over their booking and appointment choice.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, recent figures have shown waiting times of up to 28 weeks.  It is seven months in Tralee, Cavan is next at 25 weeks and Cork and Monaghan are at 24 weeks.  Given the forthcoming legislation, as the Minister mentioned, on unaccompanied learner drivers, this is totally unacceptable.  The issue of rural areas where public transport is not reliable has been raised previously.  Somebody who needs a car for work cannot be left to wait upwards of seven months for a driver test.  The Minister said there are 28 new driver testers from a panel of 100.  This is far short.  What priority has the Minister put on this and when can we expect to see improvements in this area?</p></speech>

I think she was in favour of the amendment to the Road Traffic Act that actually tackled the issue of unaccompanied drivers.  I think she was in favour of that, as am I.  This is certainly one of the unintended consequences but we accept that it is better than having unaccompanied drivers on the road.  We are taking the appropriate measures, as the Deputy can see.</p>  <p>  I have set out the initiatives that I hope are a very proactive effort to bring the numbers down.  I understand why the Deputy does it but I think it is probably a bit unhelpful for her to always point out the worst cases.  The average is 13.  Yes, there are some areas where it is longer than 13 weeks but there are other areas where it is shorter than 13 weeks, which the Deputy did not point out.  This is why the average comes to 13.  It is something we are addressing aggressively.  As the Deputy will understand, the number of no-shows is large.  These are people who do not turn up for their driving test because their applications count in a way that is advantageous to them.</p></speech>

The Minister is right; I am fully supportive of his legislation.  The buck stops with the Minister regarding tackling delays in waiting times at driving test centres and the chronic shortage of driver testers.  Given that he has been forthcoming with the legislation, he should have pre-empted the increase that was obviously going to occur in respect of the number of people clamouring to take tests.  There is also a shortage of driving test centres.  There is no driving test centre in Drogheda, which is the largest town in Ireland, and there is a waiting list of over 2,500 there.  This figure has quadrupled.  In other areas, the increase is even larger.  What is the Minister doing about the backlog and about instructing the RSA regarding the establishment of more test centres to deal with the backlog?</p></speech>

To date, 6,600 extra tests were delivered in the six months to the end of March 2018.  There has been a reduction in the number of applicant no-shows at driving tests.  The RSA contacts applicants it identifies, from previous behaviour, as being likely to not show.  In other words, people who have not shown up before are telephoned by the RSA and asked if they are going to show up.  If they say they are not going to show up, which happens in a lot of cases, the RSA can fill these places with people who have an urgent need for a test for work or other reasons.  In cases where an applicant states that it is his or her intention not to attend, the RSA, with the prior agreement of the applicant, cancels the appointment and offers it to another applicant who has indicated a need for an urgent driving test.  Measures taken have reduced the number of no-shows by almost half in recent months.  There has been a reduction in the number of non-conducted driving tests.  Currently, 4% of driving tests do not proceed on the day because of various faults or issues with either the vehicle presented or the necessary documentation.  This is despite applicants being fully informed in advance of all requirements.  The RSA communicates with test applicants via text messaging and applicants' approved driving instructors and provides some key messages about the requirements closer to test appointment dates in an effort to reduce non-conducted driving tests.</p></speech>

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by Exchequer road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these moneys is a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  In this context, I wish to clarify the position regarding the basis for the figures published in the NOAC performance reports mentioned in the Deputy's question.  My Department has been supporting the development of a road asset management system for regional and local roads over the past number of years.  The Road Management Office, RMO, has been established as a shared service between 31 local authorities.  The RMO and the Department have been working with local authorities to ensure that the MapRoad pavement management system includes a record of all pavement-related works and information on road surface types and road pavement condition.</p>  <p>  The road pavement condition information generated by the MapRoad system actually forms the basis for NOAC performance reports.  It is the case that the performance reports show the impact of the significant cuts in funding for roads during the recession.  The reality is that until funding reaches a steady-state level and progress is made on addressing the backlog, there is likely to be a dis-improvement in the ratings reported by the NOAC.</p>  <p>  The objective of the MapRoad pavement management system and the NOAC reports is to provide the data needed for evidence-based prioritisation and management of both annual work programmes and multi-annual programmes by each local authority in its capacity as the statutory road authority for its area to enable local authorities to use the resources available to them as effectively as possible.</p>  <p>  As regards funding, the grant assistance provided by my Department has increased from &euro;324 million in 2017 to &euro;417 million this year.  The capital plan also provides for the gradual build up in capital funding over the next number of years.  The grant assistance provided by my Department does not, however, represent the total investment in regional and local roads.  Exchequer grant funding is in addition to the own resources local authorities invest in their roads.</p></speech>

I know people will say - the Minister has said it - that potholes are a matter for councils and councillors.  That is true to some extent.  However, when the problem is so wide-spread on a national scale and councils are so starved of money that they cannot afford to fix these problems, it is most definitely a matter for the Minister.  The fixing of the damage to our secondary roads is not merely an aesthetic choice.  It is a health and safety imperative.  We need to make our roads safer for our drivers to minimise accidents and reduce damage to vehicles.  In the league table presented by the NOAC, it indicated that 4% of Fingal's secondary roads were in need of restoration works.  As the Minister knows, Fingal is the biggest local authority in Dublin with a large rural area and a large population base of very heavy users of secondary roads, probably more so than any other local authority in Dublin.  We need a plan beyond what the Minister has given in his reply.</p></speech>

The local road allocation has been made for this year and there were very large increases, particularly for restoration.  I will provide some figures, which might indicate to the Deputy the importance the Government places on this and the generosity we have shown, although, obviously, it has not been anything like enough.  I acknowledge the need is there but it cannot be met to the extent required by the Deputy in this case.  In line with the financial position in the capital plan, there is a significant increase in capital funding for regional and local roads in 2018.  The increase is allowing a 18% increase in the allocation for road strengthening works and 17% for road surfacing from a combination of current and capital funding.  Under the 2018 allocation, there are restoration improvement grants of &euro;195 million, &euro;33 million for restoration maintenance, &euro;15 million for restoration maintenance supplementary and &euro;70.6 million for discretionary grants.</p></speech>

Freak weather events have a disproportionate effect on damaged roads.  Frost and ice permeate existing cracks and holes and make them bigger, deeper and even more dangerous.  I see evidence of this as I drive around.  We need a fund for these repairs and for a new priority to be placed on making these roads safe.  We are talking about road safety here.</p>  <p>  I ask that a fund be set up in order to allow for the remediation of secondary roads.  These are not big infrastructure projects whereby Cabinet Ministers cut ribbons and walk down new motorways, over new bridges or new overpasses or through new tunnels, they are the roads that connect our citizens to their shops, schools, families and places of work.  These are the roads on which tyres are being punctured and vehicle chassis are being damaged.  They are dangerous roads that present lethal conditions for drivers, passengers and pedestrians.  As part of this year's budget, the Minister needs to set up an emergency fund for allocation to local authorities.</p><p>As understand it - the Minister can confirm this - Fingal did not receive anything from the national fund.</p></speech>

It is indicative that the plea for more funds came very soon after the large increase they got.  Every local authority was told that it should make provisions for road maintenance and restoration or contingency items of this sort.  They have been given notice of this.  That is cold comfort to them because I know the local authorities feel the requirements on them are as great as those on the national Exchequer.  We have told them quite simply that they should certainly send in their clean-up costs, which they are doing at the moment, to the relevant Department.  While it is early in the year, as things stand no supplementary money will be going for damage.  That does not bode very well for those who are anticipating inclement weather or storms coming in the next year.  However, they should be aware now that the Exchequer has paid, as far as I know, up to its limit for these amounts.</p></speech>

My Department's role on tourism lies in the area of national tourism policy while the tourism agencies have operational responsibility for the implementation of this policy.</p>  <p>  The United States continues to be one of Ireland's strongest performing markets, delivering visitors who stay longer and spend more than average.  In the period since 2010, visitor numbers from the United States have more than doubled.  For 2018, Tourism Ireland already has a busy programme of targeted promotional activity under way in North America.  In addition, Tourism Ireland recently undertook a market review of the US which I was happy to launch in January.  The new strategy is the result of a comprehensive review and is designed to build on recent record levels of visitor growth, and identify the key opportunities and challenges ahead.  As part of the review, new research was undertaken to deepen and enrich the understanding of the journey prospective US visitors take when choosing their holiday - either on the island of Ireland or competing destinations - and to help to map their "path to purchase".  This analysis has generated new insights that informed the business plans of the tourism agencies for 2018 and will receive further input in future years.</p>  <p>  The strategy presents an overview of seven key strategic imperatives that need focus, resource and action in order to deliver upon future ambition and growth targets.  The majority of recommendations outlined in the strategy are aimed at the coming four-year period.  However, given the need to ensure the development of new products and experiences that meet the interests of the US traveller, the broader strategy has been developed with an eight-year horizon to 2025 to allow for longer-term planning and capital investments to be made.</p>  <p>  I have one piece of very good news on which we can all reflect.  Since 2010, the number of visitors from the US to Ireland has increased from just over 800,000 to 1.8 million, meaning that we have seen an extra 1 million visitors from the US to Ireland over that seven-year period.  It is a remarkable improvement in US visitor numbers.  As I mentioned earlier, they are high-spend and long-stay visitors.  That tourism market is very lucrative.  We want to increase it further and build on that success.</p></speech>

The US tourism market is of huge importance to Ireland, to the west of Ireland and to County Clare.  The availability of direct year-round flights to and from Shannon Airport is an essential component in growing our tourism industry.  This year Shannon is set to operate its largest transatlantic offering in 17 years with eight transatlantic services operated by six carriers across seven destinations.</p>  <p>  I welcome Aer Lingus's recent announcement that it is set to operate a year-round New York to Shannon service in 2019.  I also welcome the expansion of Norwegian Air's New York to Shannon service.  We will have two direct services between New York and Shannon.</p></speech>

It is one thing to secure a route, but without a collaborative approach in supporting those routes when they are there, they are very to sustain.  We are working on that.  My engagement with Tourism Ireland over the past ten months or so has been very positive.  It has been very impressive to watch it at work because it works very closely with the airlines, as does F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Having such an increase in the services into and out of the country in the past seven or eight years has led to the success story.  The scrapping of the airport tax is a help as is the 9% VAT rate.</p>  <p>  Last year, 2017, was another record year when we again had huge growth.  In the US market specifically, we increased by 16.3% on the previous year.</p></speech>

It is critical in terms of the regionality of the industry to have Shannon as a vibrant hub for North American activity.</p>  <p>  So far this year, the results for visitors from the US are very positive, with a 4.2% increase over the first two months of last year.

The legal advices have been provided by the Attorney General's office in the normal course of the service it provides to Departments.  I am advised that my Department's accounting system does not capture the cost of staff time in handling individual elements of work in the way that would be required to respond to the Deputy's question in any more specific terms.  I am also advised that my Department has not incurred any other costs associated with the regulation.</p> <p> I understand the Irish Aviation Authority may have incurred some costs in the context of exploring its role in implementing the noise regulation, when that was an option being pursued.  However, the company has not raised the matter of costs incurred with me or with my Department.</p> <p> As regards Fingal County Council, and as I have stated previously, it will, of course, be provided with the necessary resources to carry out this additional function.  Council officials have been told this directly and it will be reinforced in the draft legislation.  As far as I am aware, Fingal County Council has not incurred any expense to date in regard to its role as the designated competent authority.  Therefore, no funding has been provided to the council in regard to this role so far.  This is something that can be reviewed as matters develop during the course of the year.  No other organisation has received funding, nor do I envisage a circumstance in which any such matter may arise during the year.</p> <p> I understand the Deputy is asking whether any costs have been or will be paid to the council.  To give a very short response, at the moment no costs have been incurred but the Deputy should be reassured that resources will be made available by my Department where they are necessary.</p></speech>

Here we have a measure which was put forward to supposedly protect airport communities from airport noise through the establishment of a competent authority and which was years in the making.  The previous Attorney General gave different advice to the present one.  The Minister announced months ago that he had finally decided to appoint Fingal County Council and while many people locally are very unhappy with that, they would have expected some progress.  It is wholly unreasonable to expect Fingal County Council to take on this cost and not give it any money.  Of course, the contradictory part is that this competent authority, which was designed to protect communities, has actually been put up there as the vehicle which the DAA is going to use to undermine existing conditions which protect the community from the new runway.  People are seriously concerned.  What mechanism is in place to involve the local community in an active consultation role with the council or other bodies at this stage of the process?</p></speech>

Funding will be made available.  There is not going to be a lack of funding to Fingal County Council for this.  I have made it clear that while it is not yet clear what amount will be necessary, Fingal County Council will not be left short of funding because this is a matter of huge national importance for which we cannot afford to say there are no funds.  To say there is no progress being made is unfair because progress is certainly being made.</p>  <p>  To answer the question about stakeholders, the Deputy will be aware that the stakeholders will be met by the DAA, by the competent authority and by me.  The Deputy will also be aware there has been no hesitation on anybody's part that I know of to meet the residents and to attempt to accommodate them.  I have met several people from the area who Deputies have asked me to meet.  I have done this on many occasions and, in fact, I have never refused to do this, as it is a matter of great concern that we should have balance, and the criteria being used by the new competent authority will involve a balanced approach.  We must balance the national needs with the needs of the residents.</p></speech>

The problem is that things are happening or nothing is happening, and it is very hard to get a straightforward answer because the Minister appointed Fingal County Council.  I do not agree with that and many other Deputies and many people in the community do not agree with it.  In that sense, I am very happy it has not been given any money to advance this project because it should never be given any money, as it is not a suitable vehicle for a competent authority.  However, we have this EU directive which we need to bring in.  Fair play to the Minister for meeting the Traveller group, where he did listen and a good resolution for their situation was found.  While there is a lot of talk, however, the bigger picture is unfolding and people are not being consulted in that their input is not there from the start.</p>  <p>  The Minister might enlighten us as to when the legislation will be before us.  What the Minister appears to be saying is that he has the idea that it will be Fingal County Council but it does not have a budget for this and it is not being advanced, so, really, things are as up in the air as they were.  Everyone sits around and talks about it, but nothing actually progresses.</p></speech>

A decision has been made.  It is absolutely a final decision that Fingal County Council will be the competent authority and it has been given the go-ahead.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the appeals body.  That decision has been made and it is irreversible.  It has been approved by the Attorney General in this case and we are going ahead on that basis.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked why Fingal County Council was chosen.  It already has responsibilities under the EU environmental noise directive, which encapsulates responsibilities relating to noise caused by conurbations and major transport infrastructure, including roads, railways and airports.  In addition, having regard to its planning functions, it has considerable experience and expertise in the conduct of environmental impact assessments and appropriate experience in managing extensive public consultations.

This will be a new town with approximately 8,500 residential units of accommodation, as well as commercial centres, schools and so forth, located between Clondalkin and Lucan, with a population in excess of 20,000.  My question is very specific.  What modes of transport are being planned to sustain this new town?</p></reply>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in regard to public transport.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport in the greater Dublin area.  In 2016 the NTA published its transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2016-2035, which provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades.  As the Deputy is aware, the NTA has worked closely with South Dublin County Council on the Clonburris strategic development zone, given the public transport considerations for the scheme, such as the future of Kishogue rail station and rail services and bus services in the Clonburris, Lucan and Clondalkin areas.</p>  <p>  In regard to Kishogue station, this was built in 2009 but is not yet opened for rail services.  I understand the NTA has previously informed the Deputy that Kishogue station will be opened once development occurs in the residential areas near the station.  I am advised by the NTA that it currently envisages opening Kishogue station in 2020 as development in Clonburris becomes occupied.</p>  <p>  Turning to rail services, Clonburris will be served by the same number of trains that currently serve Adamstown, including those which are provided via the Phoenix Park tunnel which re-opened in 2016.  Looking to the future, the DART expansion programme, as provided for by the national development plan, will deliver significantly higher frequencies and capacity along the Kildare line.  This includes electrification through Clonburris to Hazelhatch-Celbridge.  In the meantime, improvements to the current service are planned in advance of the full delivery of that project.</p>  <p>  In regard to the provision of bus services that will serve Clonburris, the NTA intends in the short term to provide a new orbital bus service through the SDZ lands linking Blanchardstown to Tallaght.  As part of the BusConnects network review, a number of high-frequency local, radial and further orbital services are being considered to serve Lucan and Clondalkin, some of which will serve Clonburris directly.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Some of these can be adapted to serve Clonburris as development occurs in the future.  These proposals will be part of a series of public consultations on the BusConnects programme, which the NTA will be commencing shortly.  I am advised that the NTA will continue to provide support to South Dublin County Council and will remain closely engaged on transport considerations as Clonburris develops.</p></speech>

Clonburris is located between Clondalkin and Lucan where, in many regards, there are considerable transport infrastructure deficits currently.  The Minister's recently announced plan clearly indicated that the Lucan Luas line would not open until after 2027.  I am concerned about phasing the infrastructure to which the Minister referred.  The timelines are not very clear and the local authority is trying to build 8,500 units of accommodation without knowing when additional buses will be made available, whether they will be on city centre or orbital routes and at what stage they will be made available.  The Minister said the plans will evolve and that the NTA will stay in close contact with South Dublin County Council but that is not sufficient to plan a town of this magnitude and to make it sustainable in the future.</p></speech>

However, a sensitive response has been given to what is happening in the area.  It is being given the special treatment which is often accorded to such zones and it would not be fair to suggest it is being neglected.  I understand the frustration the Deputy has over the lack of detail but this is a couple of years away and we cannot anticipate exactly what will happen.</p><p>The role of the NTA is to develop the SDZ in south Dublin and it has engaged in a proactive way with South Dublin County Council to ensure appropriate public transport arrangements were considered for the sustainable development of the designated lands at Clonburris.  These lands were designated an SDZ on the basis of their economic and social importance to the State in terms of the provision of, <i>inter alia</i>, a residential development, educational facilities, commercial activities, rail infrastructure, emergency services and community facilities.  Public transport considerations are required to give improved transport for current residents of the area so that the development of Clonburris does not increase congestion on existing routes or services and to ensure that, as it is developed, it is matched with public transport services to ensure development occurs in a sustainable way.</p></speech>

However, I want a commitment on the level of transport infrastructure that will be made available in tandem with the housing development.  I am looking for a commitment that, as we hit milestones along the way such as 1,000 or 2,000 units of accommodation, the infrastructure, particularly bus and rail transport, will be made available in tandem.</p>  <p>  When I raised this previously the Minister gave a similar reply and referred me to the NTA.  The NTA said that, in terms of implementation, it would publish an integrated implementation plan for the greater Dublin area in the coming months but I do not think that has been published.  Has it been published?  The authority stated this would deliver a greater degree of certainty in terms of timeframes for the delivery of transport infrastructure and services, including those which support the development of Clonburris.</p>  <p>  It is the detail I am concerned about.  The two communities in Clondalkin and Lucan are already experiencing a transport deficit in infrastructure terms.  Can we have timelines to correspond with development on the lands?  We cannot do the two things separately and they have to be done in tandem but I do not get a sense of that being the plan from the Minister's reply.</p></speech>

That work is primarily focused on the interaction among noise regulation, the EU environmental noise directive and the planning framework.  When this is complete, the next step will be to engage the Office of the Attorney General with draft heads of a Bill. </p>  <p>  Throughout this process, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and his senior staff have been either directly involved in matters or advised of developments, and they continue to feed in their expertise as required.  It is obviously important that the proposed regulatory regime adheres fully to the requirements of the EU regulation.  It is also key that it dovetails with existing environmental and planning processes in a way that is implementable by the competent authority and understood by the regulated entity and all other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  At a point when there is clarity on the final regulatory model, including formal draft heads, there will be opportunity for a round of stakeholder engagements in advance of the pre-legislative scrutiny of a draft general scheme.  As regards the north runway project, I have already met with a number of residents' groups to hear their views and concerns and the Deputy will recall that I arranged for my Department to brief him and others about the Fingal proposal earlier in the year.  Those lines of communication remain open and available for future consultation as things move on.</p>  <p>  My officials have been involved with Fingal on a very detailed basis in recent times and will continue to be so.  I have been involved with stakeholders such as residents and the DAA but communication will continue to be at official level for the moment.  I am very willing to meet them when Fingal County Council and my officials feel it is time to do so.</p></speech>

Some 18 months ago we were told that primary legislation or a statutory instrument would be put in place to make the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, the competent authority.  In response to a previous question, the Minister said he hoped Members would keep asking this question so that he could keep coming in to keep us updated but we are no wiser than we were 18 months ago.  The only difference is that the competent authority has changed.</p><p>No legislation is ready.  No draft heads of Bill are ready and there is huge uncertainty.  There is uncertainty from the residents.  They have a fear about the capacity of Fingal County Council to implement this.  There is fear within the industry that not enough priority is being given to this legislation in order that it will be progressed at speed.  If the Minister was so concerned about ensuring this remains a priority and progressed as legislation, he would be meeting all key stakeholders - the residents who have grievances, the chief executive officer, CEO, of Fingal County Council, the Dublin Airport Authority and the CEOs of the various airlines who rely on this service.  He must ensure that it is progressed without any further delay because there have been too many delays and they are laid at the Minister's door.</p></speech>

The Deputy is fishing out there.  I have met the chief executives of any airlines whom I have wanted to meet or who have wanted to meet me.  There is no problem about that whatsoever.  I am continuously doing this.  I had a meeting with a group of all the major airlines in the country not very long ago.  I have met the heads of Ryanair and Aer Lingus and have met the head of the DAA on several occasions.  Sometimes they want to raise this subject and sometimes they do not.  I meet them whenever they want to meet me.  The Deputy should talk to them and ask them.  My door is open for them.  They do not want to meet me every day either.  They do not want me ringing them up every day about this, that and the other.  They have got business to do which is apart from Government, which is what I do.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the industry being worried about a slowdown, I do not get that vibe.  I do not know where the Deputy is getting that from.  There have been difficulties which the Deputy has certainly rightly pointed out in this House.  There have been delays, which have been very difficult to stomach for any party involved.  It is something we have now remedied.  We remedied that delay by appointing Fingal County Council fairly speedily after we got the information that the IAA was conflicted.  Very soon after that we did actually appoint another competent authority.  We did not want to do so with undue speed because this is too important an appointment to do without forensic examination of the possible candidates.  We could have appointed someone else but the Deputy would have said that was a mistake.  Fingal will do this job properly.  It has been selected on a meticulous, prudent and careful basis.</p></speech>

What I want to see happening is progress on this critical legislation.  The Minister comes in here and expects us to be satisfied that he has appointed Fingal County Council.  He appointed the IAA 18 months ago and for 18 months he came in here and repeatedly told us that work was progressing and legislation was imminent.  That did not happen.  Now he expects us to take his bona fides that everything is going to be okay with Fingal County Council.  I wonder whether it is satisfied that everything is going to be okay.  Has it been given written instructions as to what exactly is going to be needed of it to make sure it has the relevant expertise and resources?  It might be nervous about moving ahead based on what happened with the IAA.</p>  <p>  The Minister can be guaranteed that on this side of the House, we will continue to raise this issue because it is important.  It is a critical piece of national infrastructure.  Incidentally, two months ago when we met the Minister's officials, we were given a guarantee that they or the Minister would be back to us within a matter of weeks and we have yet to hear back from them.</p></speech>

It is an open door.  There is not a problem there at all.  The Deputy knows that and knows how I open I will be with him on these issues.  If he wants a meeting, he will have a meeting.  This matter is too important for him to be able to undermine it or to wish to undermine it.  This is an issue of national importance and information should be available to the Deputy of course, because of agreements that we have to act in the national interest on occasions of this sort.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked when we are going to see a Bill.  I assure the Deputy that a draft Bill to give full effect to the EU airport noise regulation is a top priority for me and my Department.  The matter is also being given priority attention in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which has an important role to play in regard to the effective interaction of the noise regulation and the planning regime.  Until the Government is presented with this and has agreed a draft Bill for publication, giving a firm commitment on timing is an exercise in futility.  It would be absurd to say it is going to be ready this month, next month or the month after.  It is an uncertain course but is a matter of extreme and national urgency.  It is a matter we will pursue with vigour and energy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400029#BB01400"><p>I have replied to a similar question to this already but I admit this is a somewhat different angle.  Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads rests with the relevant local authority.  The grant funding provided by the Exchequer is intended to supplement local authorities&rsquo; own resources.  The capital investment plan provides for the phased restoration of funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.</p>  <p>  I announced the 2018 regional and local road allocations on 29 January and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated.  The grants this year include provision for an 18% increase in restoration improvement moneys for road strengthening works, a 17% increase in restoration maintenance moneys for surface dressing works, the introduction of an important new grant for drainage works to the overall value of &euro;10 million and ring-fenced moneys for community involvement schemes, CIS, to the overall value of &euro;10 million.  Following an application process, local authorities will be advised of their grant funding for CIS within a few weeks.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme, taking into account available grant funding and its own resources.  In this context I continue to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads when allocating their own resources.  I have to work within the resources available to me and there is no additional funding available to my Department at present.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is liaising with local authorities on clean-up costs from the recent severe weather.  I have liaised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and will continue to do so to see if additional resources can be allocated to my Department to assist local authorities further.  For now, local authorities should progress their work programmes for the year as quickly as possible.  So far &euro;30.3 million in regional and local road grant funding has been drawn down from the total allocation of &euro;417 million. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400029#BB01500"><p>This year's funding allocation is still &euro;160 million or about one third below the steady-state level required to repair our local and regional roads.  The recent audit by the National Oversight and Audit Commission found that 70% of regional roads had some form of structural or surface deficit.  Poorly maintained roads are extremely unsafe.  They cost lives and cause damage to vehicles.  In the long term, they cost much more to the State to repair.  Sometimes people consider that regional roads are just outside the Pale.  Regional and local roads are the backbone of Ireland's transport network and account for 94% of the road network and 54% of road traffic.  They go from D&uacute;n Laoghaire right down into the south of Cork and up into the north of Donegal.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, we tabled a Private Members' motion on the Government preparing a response on exactly how it would deal with the National Oversight and Audit Commission report.</p><p>How is that report progressing and when will it be published?  The Minister needs to do more than liaise with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  He should put pressure on the latter to ensure that funding is secured in order that when the report is published, it will be backed with the resources required to implement its recommendations.</p></speech>

I recognise the need for more money for roads.  However, I also recognise the fact that there is enormous demand on the national purse and that this is only one example, albeit a very important one.  I also recognise that funding for national roads was cut by approximately &euro;6 million, to &euro;31.5 million, in budget 2018 and that the regional-local roads budget was cut by &euro;8.1 million.  The Deputy will recognise that the capital funding has increased by &euro;100 million and that the total has increased by &euro;93 million.</p>  <p>  As regards the impact of the cuts on regional and local roads, each year 5% of the network has to be strengthened and 5% has to be sealed by way of surface dressing works in order to avoid further deterioration in the condition of the network.  This represents 4,700 km under each heading.  This year, based on the estimated cost per kilometre of works, it is forecast that local authorities will surface dress approximately 2,300 km and strengthen approximately 2,100 km.  Given the importance of surface dressing as an early intervention measure to protect roads and the impact of an &euro;8.1 million cut in current funding for this year, it has been necessary to supplement the current surface dressing budget with capital funds.  I do not underestimate the problem.  The Deputy is pointing out a real challenge in front of us.  We will not reach steady-state levels until approximately 2021.</p></speech>

That has not yet happened.  That figure is still below what is required to achieve steady-state levels.  The Minister gave a commitment, in the debate on a substantive Private Member's motion that was brought before the D&aacute;il earlier this year, to the effect that he would come back and give a detailed response on how the Government is going to address the issues raised by the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  It is not me, but an independent body which is saying that 70% of regional roads have some form of structural or surface deficit.  When can we expect a response?  Can the Minister confirm that when that response is forthcoming, it will be backed up with the resources necessary?  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that it is the responsibility of the local authorities.  He knows that local authorities do the job and that they are funded to it by his Department.</p></speech>

The Minister commented that more money is going into capital infrastructure.  We welcome that, but there is no point in robbing Peter to pay Paul where the overall upgrading of our roads is concerned.  The roads in east Cork are so damaged that it is as if a bomb was detonated.  I have raised the issue with the Minister a few times.  It is all fine upgrading street paving in villages such as Killeagh and Castlemartyr and the main infrastructure from Cork to Rosslare.  However, the byroads are not being looked after.  They are falling way behind.</p></speech>

This Government decision was based on an assessment that Fingal represented the best available option for the timely and effective implementation of the airport noise regulation, which is in the best interests of all stakeholders and interested parties.  Importantly, the Government also decided to introduce primary legislation to give effect to the regulation and, therefore, it will fall to this House to help shape the final outcome.</p>  <p>  I have every intention of bringing forward a Bill that strikes a balance between the rights of local residents, the Dublin Airport Authority, as the regulated entity, and the broader national interest in recognition of the crucial importance of our primary national airport.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns of some local residents.  I am sympathetic to their genuine worries about this matter, particularly in light of the uncertainty there has been as to how the regulation will be applied.  However, I am confident that the merits and bona fides of Fingal County Council as the competent authority are strong and will be shown to be so in the course of the legislative process.  There will be a strong legal basis for all that Fingal will do as the competent authority, underpinned by national law and EU regulation, which will set out an open and transparent regulatory process.</p>  <p>  As a matter of principle, I cannot accept any suggestion that the exercise of regulatory roles by local authorities might be in any way compromised by their sources of funding.  It should be made absolutely clear that there will be no changing the Government's thinking on this issue and that there will be no reconsideration of this appointment.  It was made after due consideration, including of all the available alternatives.</p></speech>

The Minister knows that.  If he was on this side of the House, he would be doing exactly what we are doing.  In fact, the Dublin Airport Authority is the single biggest ratepayer to Fingal County Council.  I am not questioning the ability of Fingal County Council or, indeed, its relationship with the Dublin Airport Authority.  I am, however, stating that a relationship exists which is both important and commercial in nature.  The appointment of Fingal County Council as noise regulator gives rise to the potential for a conflict of interests to arise at some point in the future.  Like Deputy Clare Daly and other representatives from Fingal, I will continue to raise this matter in the hope that before the Minister brings legislation to the House, good sense will prevail and this decision will be reconsidered.  The Minister has to acknowledge the problem.  If he does not, then the whole of Fingal - indeed, the entire country - faces a serious problem.</p></speech>

There is a relationship between Fingal County Council and the Dublin Airport Authority.  The Deputy is correct.  However, it is not a relationship of huge significance.  The rates paid by the authority account for approximately 8% of Fingal County Council's overall income.  That is a large amount of money but it means that the council gets 92% of its income from other sources.</p><p> The figure 8% is, I suppose, of some significance, but I do not think it puts it in a position where it can put undue pressure on Fingal.  I understand the Deputy's anxiety, but when one looks at the raw statistics, one does not find that it is as big a problem as he is anticipating.</p></speech>

I disagree with the substance of that decision and indeed the manner in which it was carried out.  When the HSE informed the public it was abrupt, uncaring and showed a huge disregard for the local communities where these facilities were placed.</p>  <p>  Since then, we have heard the HSE apologise for the communication of the decision but defend its substance, citing a review commissioned by the MIDOC services into issues surrounding security, clinical expertise and the one-person staffing of these facilities.  The Minister of Health, Deputy Simon Harris, in response to a parliamentary question I put down last week, also supported the recommendations and ultimately the decision of the HSE based on that so-called independent review.</p>  <p>  I think it is only right that we put this local decision in a national context.  Two years ago, in the programme for Government the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and his colleagues pledged a decisive shift in health services towards primary care, with the delivery of enhanced primary care facilities in every community.  As part of this, they said "we will focus on developing an enhanced primary care system, and guaranteeing the future sustainability of GP practices in rural Ireland."  The programme for Government went on to say "We will reduce emergency department overcrowding following a four pronged approach", one aspect of which was "to reduce numbers coming into hospital by developing primary care services and integrating primary and secondary care services".</p>  <p>  On top of this is the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which the Minister of State and the Government support.  This report also endorses the shift to primary care.  The health service capacity review, published by the Minister earlier this year, projected that over the next 15 years there would be a 46% increase in primary care services.  It could not be more clear to the Minister of State and his colleagues in government that we need more primary care services.  Yet in Offaly, people are seeing the scope of primary care reduced with these closures in Birr and Edenderry.</p></speech>

The public had no say in this review.  We do not support this review because we think it has no credibility.  Therefore I have just three questions.  Do the Minister of State and the Government agree that the failure to consult the local community to date is and has been unacceptable?  Do they accept the need for a new, inclusive, independent review?  Do the Minister of State and the Government agree that this decision flies in the face of their own Government policy? </p></speech>

It is outrageous.  We will not accept it.  We are asking for solutions to be put forward and for our services to be reinstated, because we will not tolerate or accept this ridiculous decision, which puts patient safety at risk.  It was unacceptable for public representatives to learn of these closures from constituents who were unable to access the services a few short weeks ago.  People in Edenderry, Birr and north Tipperary depend on the vital basic services that MIDOC offers in these towns.  As I say, we will not be tolerating or accepting these closures, so what we want is a move towards reinstating and developing our health services to satisfaction in Offaly.  Like many rural counties we are being left behind and we need our primary care facilities developed.</p>  <p>  The closure of these services was met with great anger and frustration at a recent public meeting held in Birr and attended by hundreds of constituents.  Neither the HSE or MIDOC representatives attended this particular meeting.  This was another insult to the general public and to the public representatives.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State have a responsibility here.  I am calling for the Minister of State to intervene immediately to ensure that these services are not removed, but improved.</p>  <p>  As a TD for Offaly I will be pursuing this issue, seeking for the services to be reinstated and nothing less than that.  I outlined this position at a meeting with the HSE representatives and other public representatives from the county only last Tuesday.  It was disappointing that this meeting had to be adjourned due to the absence of MIDOC representatives.  We were informed at this meeting that a risk assessment had been carried out by GPs who had concerns about the practice of one GP working alone in the centres.  While we all agree that GPs should have a safe working environment, who is responsible for a risk assessment for our constituents as patients?  They run a risk too if this goes ahead.  Patient safety should always be of paramount importance and the closures will have a very serious impact on their safety.</p>  <p>  We are all aware of the GP shortage.  What plans does the Government have to address this issue?  What plans does the Minister of State have to develop primary care centres in Offaly?  I call on him to put forward solutions to address this shortage, instead of allowing MIDOC to close vital and basic out-of-hours services in our towns.  As the decision to close the services was not based on an independent review, but a review commissioned by the GPs, I am calling for the reinstatement of services.  It was not done properly. </p></speech>

I want to begin by reassuring the Deputies that there has been no reduction in funding or total GP clinical time allocated to the MIDOC services.  Second, I understand the decision to reorganise MIDOC services in Offaly was taken by participating GPs in conjunction with the HSE and that they believe the revised arrangements will ensure a better out-of-hours services can be delivered to patients, with increased availability for call-outs and home visits to patients where clinically indicated.</p><p>The MIDOC service was established in the west Offaly region in December 2002 by the HSE and the GPs who volunteered to provide the service.  A review of MIDOC services in Offaly was undertaken by the participating GPs in 2017.  The review identified a number of concerns regarding the satellite sites in Edenderry and Birr, concerning clinical risks, the ability to respond effectively to medical emergencies and risks faced by <i>locum </i>doctors working alone.  It is important to note that only limited out-of-hours cover was provided in Birr and Edenderry.  The service was part-time only and home visits from these sites were not possible.  On some days the service was only open for two hours and on other days no service was provided at all.  For presentations outside the limited operating hours of both satellite centres, patients already had to attend the nearest full-time treatment centre, which would have been in Tullamore, Athlone or Longford.</p><p>In light of these concerns, and to ensure the quality and safety of patient services, the decision was taken that from 2 April 2018 MIDOC would operate only one fully-functioning treatment centre in Tullamore that covers the entire Offaly population.  This is in line with other MIDOC centres across the midlands.  The HSE has reviewed the current monthly activity levels of the out-of-hours services in Offaly and I understand the Tullamore treatment centre will be more than capable of absorbing patients from Birr and Edenderry.  An additional doctor has also been assigned duty in Tullamore during weekends and public holidays to facilitate the more effective management of emergency call-outs to the entire county, including Birr and Edenderry.  Additional administrative support will also be provided to free up doctors' time, resulting in more patient contact and a more effective overall out-of-hours service.  As the Deputies will be aware, local HSE management met with the public representatives from Birr and Edenderry on 17 April to discuss the reorganisation of MIDOC services.</p><p>At this meeting, the Health Service Executive accepted the need for improved public communication around such service changes in future and this is undoubtedly the case.  The HSE has requested a further meeting between public representatives and Midoc and the Deportment has asked the HSE to keep it updated on developments.</p> <p> I again reassure the Deputies that there has been no reduction in funding or total general practice clinical time allocated to the Midoc service.  The HSE and the general practitioners participating in Midoc remain committed to providing a safe and effective out-of-hours service to all patients in County Offaly.</p></speech>

He sought to reassure the House that there had been no reduction in funding.  I assure him that despite the commitment in the programme for Government, Midoc services and facilities in Birr and Edenderry have been closed - period.  I assure him also that it is not acceptable to cite a report that contends the service could be closed because it is limited and operates part-time.  I do not accept that the review is to be trusted or was inclusive.  It is compromised and has no credibility in my eyes and the eyes of other public representatives in the county in which I reside and have the privilege to represent.  It failed to adequately consult representatives of the community, nursing homes, pharmacies and groups advocating for patients.  How can members of the public be expected to buy into or take ownership of the decision when their wisdom and rights were excluded from the process?</p>  <p>  Does the Government believe the review, which was instigated by vested interests, is inclusive of the public and the communities served by the facilities in question?  If not, will the Minister agree to establish a new independent commission that will reflect the views, aspirations and rights of taxpayers and ensure the service, which was established in 2002 to serve 50,000 people and enhanced in 2008 continues and its abolition by the Government, notwithstanding the meaningless commitments it gave in the programme for Government, does not proceed? </p></speech>

The Minister of State wishes to give himself a pat on the back for the great job he and the Government are doing, but he would be wrong to do so.  We have been informed that two basic and vital services will be withdrawn from our towns.  The Minister of State did not address that issue or the fact that the review to which he referred was not independent.  Apart from general practitioners, no one was consulted and Midoc and the HSE learned of it at a later stage.  The Minister of State did not address the crucial issues.</p>  <p> I found deeply worrying a statement made by the Minister in a reply to a parliamentary question that he is statute barred from engaging in the process initiated by the HSE to review the delivery of health services.  He is the Minister for Health.  As public representatives, we are the first line of communication between our constituents, as patients, and the Minister.  All of us are committed to mechanisms to achieve the best clinical outcomes for every patient, wherever they are in the country but particularly the most vulnerable and isolated citizens.  The Minister should note that these closures will not be accepted.  He must find an immediate solution and establish an independent review.</p></speech>

It has been in existence for more than 30 years and currently has 33 students enrolled.  Significantly, two pupils will do the leaving certificate examinations this year, three pupils are in fifth year and five pupils who will do the junior certificate examinations in June intend to progress to the leaving certificate.  The patron of the school is the Archdiocese of Dublin.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the Department of Education and Skills abruptly informed the school in recent days that it must close at the end of the current academic year, that is, in slightly more than one month from now.  This decision has shocked school management and staff and students and their parents.  I am aware that there have been problems in the school and the Department has carried out a number of inspections over the years.  Management and staff strongly believe the Department has consistently failed to engage with them to alleviate any ongoing concerns.  For example, a request for an additional teacher to facilitate leaving certificate students was consistently stonewalled by the Department. </p>  <p>  I am aware from my time in the Department that inclusion and integration are now key policies in respect of Traveller education.  However, St. Thomas's school is unique and still has an important role to play in the context of overall policy objectives. </p>  <p>  The trust of parents is important and the parents of the pupils of St. Thomas's school want to send their children to the school.  They have a real concern that their children will not survive in a mainstream school.  They will certainly not continue to do the leaving certificate examinations if the Department's decision is implemented.  The Department should show flexibility in its efforts to achieve overall integration.  A leaving certificate qualification is a passport to a better life.  While Youthreach is an option, if the students of St. Thomas's school wish to progress to the leaving certificate using the current model, they should be encouraged to do so.  They will not enrol in a mainstream school.  They are vulnerable and need more time to make the adjustment.  I fear most of them will drop out of the system. </p>  <p>  I know from first-hand experience the difficulties Travellers face in a mainstream school.  I am worried about the effect the Department's sudden decision will have on students who will sit State examinations in June.  It is disruptive and unsettling for them and all the other students in the school.</p>  <p>  I visited St. Thomas's school last Friday where I met the principal, teachers, parents and pupils.  As it happens, some of the students were doing practical examinations as part of the junior certificate home economics examination.  I was very impressed with what I saw.  Serious concerns were expressed and teachers and special needs assistants are also worried about their future.  This issue that will have to be worked out separately.</p>  <p>  I was surprised to learn that no formal face-to-face meetings had taken place between representatives of the school and departmental officials to work through problems.  St. Thomas's school was given short notice to close its doors.  As it is located in the Minister's constituency, I ask him at least to arrange a meeting between the school authorities and departmental officials to discuss these matters.</p><p>It is the Minister's constituency.  Will he, at the very least, set up a meeting between the school authorities and departmental officials to discuss these matters?  If the Department is determined to close the school, can it work out a plan to phase out the school over a number of years so all concerned have plenty of time to put in place alternative arrangements?</p></speech>

I understand his concern.  For a long time now, since 2006 in fact, the approach to education for Travellers has involved an integrated model.  The Department has been moving to wind back the segregated model which was in place and I understand this is the only remaining school operating on this basis.  There has been a consistent effort by the Department, working with the patron, to move to an integrated model.  The Deputy referred to assessments and engagements with the school where defects had been identified.  It is the Department's belief that the best future for these children is in another setting where they will do better, have a wider range of choice, get more support and be able to achieve more.  The approach of an integrated setting is strongly favoured and has been a consistent one on the part of the Department.  As to ensuring no child falls out of the system as a result of this proposal, I have insisted and the Department is determined to track each of these children to ensure each child gets a suitable placement.  We are determined to see that.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about giving this more time and winding the school down over some period, but a great deal of work has been done to adopt a different approach.  It has not been successful to date and the Department is of the view that continuing on with this process is not in the best interests of the young people concerned.  We have been successful in integrating young students in the system and there is growing rather than diminishing participation.  The belief is that this decision is the correct one.  Wider initiatives are being undertaken to ensure there is an enhanced uptake by Traveller children in education.  The Department acknowledges the weaknesses there.  As part of an integrated approach, led by the Department of Justice and Equality, in which we are participating, there are specific educational initiatives to be undertaken, including in our own area, to enhance the participation of Traveller children.  That is being done with the support of the Traveller community itself.  We have a better model in place and we are seeking to enhance it.  That is the backdrop to this decision.</p>  <p>  Obviously, it is the patron not the Department that closes a school.  It is the patron which makes the decision on a matter like this.  However, the Department has been working to see a better outcome and to move to a setting in which there is a wider range of subject choices and more supports.  That is the direction in which this is going.  I am acutely aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy.  Equally, I am determined that no child is displaced by this.  It is very important to work with Tusla and the patron through my Department and other schools to ensure these young men are supported in their continuing education.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, I was a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills with special responsibility for educational disadvantage as well as further education and training.  Decisions were made at that time on senior Traveller training centres and so on.  This school is a special one.  It has a very special model in its own right.  When I met some of the parents last Friday, their attitude was "Here we go again".  They see Travellers at the bottom of the pile with the school being closed in one month and their children, quite simply, being discriminated against again by officialdom.  I am also aware that the Minister has met at least one of the teachers in his advice clinic.  He might like to deal with that.  The teachers are obviously very concerned about the students, first and foremost, but they are also concerned about their own positions and those of the SNAs there.  A great deal of work has to be done.  To give one month's notice of the closure of the school is too short.  It has come as a shock.  The teachers and the parents are adamant that pupils simply will not go on to sit the leaving certificate examinations if they have now to enrol in a mainstream school.  They will leave.  I acknowledge the Minister's assurance that he will track each of the children, but looking at the local secondary schools, including Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh, which springs to mind, my experience suggests it is very difficult for Travellers to continue on to the leaving certificate.  That is the objective.  For all of those reasons, the Minister needs to give the school more time to put tracking measures in place, find suitable places and provide for supports.  What I have heard is that these children were encouraged up to this point, but they now feel totally let down by the system once again.</p></speech>

If I get the advice that we can do better for these young people and that prolonging this is not in their best interests, I have to take it seriously.  Ultimately, it is the patron that decides whether to close but the policy of moving to a better model has been in place for a long time.  The Deputy was in the Department himself in the period.  This school is one which has remained in place and defects have been identified.  There is no prospect of easily resolving those defects in the current setting.  If we can get a new setting, that is the best outcome for the students involved.  That is what I have been advised.  I am trying to ensure the best outcome for students is achieved.  I do not believe, on the basis of the advice I have received, that what the Deputy suggests would achieve that.  I share his determination that the interests of the students should be to the fore.  We need to work with them to ensure they get suitable placements and can fulfil their potential.  I take the Deputy's points and will engage with my officials to ensure we do the very best we can to get a good outcome.  I will report back to the Deputy to let him know how we are getting on with successful placement, which I hope we can achieve for the students involved.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, or CPSMA, released a study on foot of its commission to Grant Thornton to carry out an analysis of the funding situation in most of our primary schools.  The analysis highlights the major problems which have been caused to schools as a result of cuts in capitation and their accumulated impact since 2010.  The capitation rate was cut from &euro;200 per pupil to &euro;170 per pupil in 2010 and, unfortunately, no progress has been made to reverse that.  The report lays out in very stark terms the impact of the cuts and the fact that so many of our primary schools are struggling to meet their basic overheads and pay for heat, light, insurance and so on.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>These are basic overheads which are not fully funded by the State.  The reduction in the capitation grant has varied to some extent between schools, depending on the size of the schools.  In small schools, the capitation grant is worth about &euro;26,000, or 42% of their day-to-day spending.  In a medium school, the average capitation grant is &euro;57,000 which meets just over half of its spending.  In a larger school, the average capitation grant is &euro;114,000 which represents about 61% of spending.  The level of State funding for those basic items in schools falls far short of what is required to provide for a basic environment and conditions for students in order for them to function properly.</p> <p> We hear all the time how the economy has turned the corner and there has been impressive growth in the past several years.  We are told how matters are back on track while many of the cuts to pay and other funding have been reversed.  There has been an element of tax cuts and the Government frequently talks about how it hopes to introduce further tax cuts.  It is the height of folly in my view and highly irresponsible, however, to talk about the prospect of tax cuts when our primary schools do not have a basic level of funding that allows them to operate satisfactorily and in some kind of manner which one would have a right to expect in the present day and age.</p> <p> Over recent years, children have disproportionately carried the burden of the recession.  This is definitely borne out in respect of our primary schools.  The conditions and the climate in primary schools are completely inadequate in terms of providing the right kind of atmosphere for children to learn well.  Requests for voluntary contributions put significant pressures on children themselves and on their parents, while the shortfall in funding puts enormous pressure on schools.  Increasingly, principals and teachers have to engage in basic fundraising to cover overheads.  This is a diversion of attention from educational welfare and concerns to matters such as organising draws and sales of work.  In this day and age, it is time to end that.  Will the Minister give a commitment to reverse those cuts as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

In the past two budgets, I have secured &euro;1 billion extra for education, of which 85% has gone into our schools.  I have not been able to increase capitation grants but I have restored other important services needed in our schools.  I have been in a position to fund more than 6,000 additional teachers and 3,000 additional special needs assistants, SNAs.  Many of those teachers have gone to badly needed work.  We have reformed the resource teaching model, which included putting 1,600 additional teachers over two years into resource teaching to strengthen the special education model.  That was backed by an additional 3,000 SNAs.  We have also, for example, opened more than 300 special units for children with special needs, which provide a high level of pupil support.  We made investment in pupil places, which has to match the additional enrolment being experienced.  We have continued to fund the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level.</p>  <p>  While I agree we need to examine the capitation grant issue, under the programme for Government we intend to increase it.  Each year, however, we have to assess what other priorities need to be addressed.  Significant funds of up to &euro;1 billion have been provided, 85% of which has gone into schools.  This has been an important investment and has allowed us to enhance many services both at primary and second level.  It has allowed us to start investment in digital capacity, which is important to the quality of education provided.</p>  <p>  I looked at the study carried out by Grant Thornton and it will be an input into our consideration of budgetary matters in the year ahead.  We have introduced other measures to support schools in the management of their financial resources.  A schools procurement unit has been established, as has a financial service support unit, which work with schools.  They have helped schools to better manage issues that had been putting pressure on them.  Voluntary contributions, as the Deputy said, must be voluntary.  They cannot be required of a pupil to participate in education.  We are clear on that and have emphasised it to schools repeatedly.</p>  <p>  There are many legitimate needs in and demands on the education system.  As the Deputy rightly averted to, new entrant teachers are setting out their needs.  There is a need for new curricula, as well as investment in teachers and SNAs.  I try to balance those each year within the available resources.  I will continue to do that.  I recognise this is an important area of need.</p></speech>

It is shameful that almost 100 years since the foundation of the State, we still do not have free primary education.  How basic can one get?  This is in spite of the fact that Article 42.4 of the Constitution commits that "the State shall provide for free primary education".  Yet, we do not have that free primary education.  The programme for Government committed to investing in annual increases in primary and secondary capitation rates and that the Government would set three-year rolling programmes for the funding of schools.  None of that has been done.  The Minister published the glossy Action Plan for Education earlier this year, at the start of which he set out "our aim is to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe by 2026".  Those words ring hollow when the Minister cannot even provide the basic funding for items such as heating, cleaning, lighting and insurance in our schools.</p>  <p>  We need to get our priorities right.  Does the Minister believe in the principle of free primary education?  If so, why is he not delivering on it?  He talks about other areas of funding.  While this is all very welcome, those other areas of funding which have been increased do not pay the bills in primary schools.  Will the Minister give a commitment that he will, at a minimum, reverse the 2010 cuts in this year's budget?  Will he also look at the overall funding requirements for covering the basics and overheads?  What is provided only meets about half of the cost of running schools.  This should be the Minister's and the Government's number one priority.  We need to stop talking about tax cuts and other such measures when our children are paying the cost of the recession.  Will the Minister commit to reversing these cuts as a matter of urgency in this year's budget?</p></speech>

I have raised this issue several times.  I want to acknowledge that the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, raised this issue at the highest levels in Europe but the reality is that the EU policies are continuing, which lead to human rights abuse.</p>  <p>  This is a time when it is difficult to find a language to adequately describe the horror of the situation in Libya.  There are two aspects to it, namely, what is happening in the Mediterranean and what is happening in the Libyan detention centres, the so-called reception centres.  These two aspects are related.  It is no exaggeration to say that these centres are on a par with the concentration camps of the Second World War.  </p>  <p>  The information I put on the record today comes directly from a medic who has worked both on the Mediterranean and in these centres and who I had the honour to meet recently.  The situation was described as the highest level of human suffering that this medic has encountered.  The centres are places of severe overcrowding.  There are hangar-like cells with up to 3,000 detainees in each unit.  There is limited and interrupted access to water.  Illnesses range from TB, scabies, diarrhoea to violence-related injuries.  There is evidence of beatings, burnings, torture and rape.  This is happening in front of the staff and is also being done by the staff.  There is acute malnutrition.  Food can be a bread roll with a plate of pasta being shared by five people.  As female cells are being staffed by male guards, there are extreme levels of sexual violence, rape, enforced prostitution and girls being taken from the centres and sold into brothels.  Many babies are being born but there is no antenatal care.  Sometimes these babies are being born to girls who are mere children themselves.  This is a money-making operation as detainees can be sold at any time.  The guards decide who decide who avails of triage services and are in charge of medical supplies for money.  They also determine, for money, who can have access to the therapeutic food programmes.  That is what faces those who are being rescued in the Mediterranean.  This is what is happening there and being facilitated through Operation Sophia, in which Ireland participates.  </p>  <p>  I will now refer to the Libyan coastguards' so-called rescue operations.  The coastguards are aggressive and brutal in their actions, and there are eyewitness accounts of their brutality.  I was given one example where coastguards tried to capsize a boat.  Another eyewitness told of everyone on a boat being beaten.  Because of the behaviour of the Libyan coastguard it is now more dangerous for those trying to cross the Mediterranean.  What role is Ireland and its Naval Service, through the EU, playing in the training of those coastguards?</p>  <p>  I also have heard accounts of confrontations between the Libyan coastguards and humanitarian rescue boats.  Today, it is reported that an Italian court refused to release a dedicated search and rescue boat from a German NGO that was doing genuine search and rescue in the Mediterranean.  The boat had been seized and impounded by the Italian authorities in August 2017.  There was an NGO boat, which performed a rescue 73 nautical miles from the Libyan coast, in international waters, but the Libyan coastguard demanded that the people be transferred, under threats of violence.  That was resisted and the people were brought to a port of safety but the NGO boat and its crew were punished.  The EU is criminalising humanitarian organisations which are doing search and rescue.  That is creating a very dangerous precedent for the future of humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean.  The EU policy is one of interception and containment.  That allows the Libyan coastguard to "rescue" those in the Mediterranean and bring them to detention centres, both official and unofficial.  In that rescue, families are also being separated.  This is facilitated by Operation Sophia.  What role has the Irish Naval Service there?  How complicit is the Irish Naval Service in facilitating the Libyan coastguard in bringing people to those horrific centres?  Must the Irish Naval Service stand by while that is happening?  That would be completely at variance with our development aid policy.  </p></speech>

An Irish Naval Service vessel first deployed in the Mediterranean in May 2015 in Operation Pontus, a humanitarian search and rescue mission undertaken as part of a bilateral arrangement with Italian authorities.  In the three years since that first deployment, the Naval Service of the Irish Defence Forces has rescued more than 18,000 migrants.</p><p>In July 2017, I secured Government and D&aacute;il approval for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to serve as part of the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean, Operation Sophia.  In the course of the subsequent deployment of <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>from October to December 2017 as part of Operation Sophia, the crew took part in search and rescue operations rescuing 613 migrants and assisting with a further 107 migrant rescues.  </p><p>It should be noted that migrants rescued by the Naval Service are brought to a safe port or transferred to another vessel to be taken to a safe port.  In that regard, migrants rescued by Operation Sophia are brought to ports in Sicily.  In addition, the Irish vessel also undertook activities in support of the core task of the mission including gathering information on oil smuggling; patrols focusing on countering illegal arms trafficking; operations to intercept smugglers; and monitoring the effectiveness of the Libyan Navy and coastguard activity.  </p><p>Operation Sophia&rsquo;s mission is to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers; to prevent further loss of life at sea and to reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants by countering and challenging the criminal organisations engaged in such activities.  Operation Sophia is one element of a comprehensive approach to addressing the migrant crisis.  The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2292.  This imposes an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related materiel into that country.  </p><p>In February 2018, the Government again approved the continued participation of the Naval Service in Operation Sophia.  Two naval vessels will deploy this year for a period of approximately 30 weeks in total.  <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett</i>departed the naval base on 15 April to participate in Operation Sophia.  </p><p>Operation Sophia has been effective in discharging its mission, including to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers.  The mission is providing training to the Libyan Navy and coastguard and its presence constitutes an internationally recognised deterrent.  There has been a significant drop in the number of migrants being smuggled to Europe on the central Mediterranean route and the number of deaths reported at sea has decreased.  </p><p>The training being provided to the Libyan Navy and coastguard aims to improve the security of Libyan territorial waters; to enhance law enforcement at sea; and to improve their ability to perform search and rescue activities at sea.  I am deeply troubled by reports of the grave and ongoing abuses perpetrated against migrants and refugees in Libya, including in detention centres.  The T&aacute;naiste and his EU counterparts have discussed these concerns on a number of occasions at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, and the Taoiseach raised his concerns at the European Council in October last year.  I join my Government colleagues in calling on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations.  </p><p>The EU provides training, including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues, to Libyan authorities.  The EU is also working with the African Union and the UN to save and protect the lives of migrants and refugees in Libya, accelerating assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin and the resettlement of those in need of international protection.  </p><p>In conclusion, thanks to these efforts, the number of migrants in official detention centres has fallen from an estimated 20,000 in 2017 to 4,000 in March of this year.  A functioning and stable government for all Libyans is crucial to addressing the many challenges the country faces.  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN special representatives to facilitate a lasting political solution in Libya.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400036#JJ00200"><p>We know of the great work the Irish Navy did in those genuine search and rescue operations, the lives that it saved and the medical and humanitarian services it provided for those rescued.  The fall in numbers is because of the EU policy of containment, which means people are being brought back to those centres in Libya.  Ireland and the Irish Navy are now part of that and it is damaging the very fine and honourable reputation of our Navy.  There was an EU delegation to Libya recently.  I believe it was the Dutch foreign affairs Minister who, after she visited the detention centres, said they should be closed as soon as possible, but the EU is still standing by that whole situation.</p>  <p>  There are accounts of stand-offs between non-governmental organisation, NGO, rescue boats and the Libyan Coast Guard.  I know of one example where both spotted a boat in distress.  People in distress on the boat were jumping into the water and trying to swim to the NGO boat, away from the coastguard.  The Libyan Coast Guard became very aggressive and the NGO boat had to leave the area.  To clarify again, is the Irish Navy helpless when looking at the Libyan Coast Guard's so-called rescues of people in the Mediterranean?  Were there times when the Irish Navy stood by and supported the Libyan Coast Guard intercepting those vessels in order to bring those people back to Libya or will there be times when it will do so?  Is the Irish Navy leaving boats to be rescued by the coastguard knowing what it is rescuing people to?  Have any rescued people been transferred from ships involved in Operation Sophia, including Irish ships, back onto the boats of the Libyan Coast Guard?  The Minister of State accepts the reality of what I have said is happening in those detention centres.  If he does, then he is allowing our Navy, which is made up of very honourable fine men and women who have to obey their orders, to allow the Libyan Coast Guard to bring people it has rescued back into detention centres with inhuman and subhuman conditions.</p></speech>

To say they are brought back to Libya is totally untrue.  That is not happening.  Operation Sophia has been effective to date.  The main focus of the mission is security and interception operations to disrupt the operations of criminal organisations engaged in human smuggling and trafficking, organisations which prey on vulnerable people and which are exacerbating the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.  The number of migrants coming through the central Mediterranean route has fallen and action against illegal arms trafficking is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The recent statistics from the UN migration agency, the International Organization for Migration, indicate that 10,949 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea during the first nine weeks of 2018.  This compares to 20,051 arrivals across the region during the same period in 2017.  In 2016 the corresponding figure was almost 135,000.  Up to 7 March this year there have been 442 reported migrant deaths in the Mediterranean compared to 521 in 2017.  Thanks to all of the people involved and the efforts they are making the number of migrants in official detention centres has fallen from an estimated 20,000 people in October 2017 to 4,000 in March 2018.  There has been a significant fall in the number of migrants in these detention centres.</p>  <p>  This has been raised at the highest level.  It has been raised by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It has been raised by the Taoiseach at EU Council level.  I understand the Minister for State, Deputy Helen McEntee, has also raised this issue.  I know that both she and the Taoiseach have raised that issue here in the D&aacute;il and with their EU counterparts.</p></speech>

In particular I gave a commitment to rectify the errors in the measures inserted by the Oireachtas into the Road Traffic Act 2016, which was meant to create an offence for the owner of a vehicle where that vehicle was driven by an unaccompanied learner driver.  I also committed to introducing an amendment to enable an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain vehicles driven by unaccompanied learner drivers.  These measures, together with a few technical amendments which I am proposing, necessitate an alteration to the Long Title so that it will encompass the Road Traffic Acts 2016, 1994 and 1961.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400036#JJ00700"><p>It is not agreed, no.  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill which the Minister, Deputy Ross, has been introducing has taken some time.  We have had a number of set views of committees back.  This is a complete change to the construct of the original Bill.  I, on behalf of the Rural Independent Group, am fundamentally opposed to this Bill if some measures are not included to assist learner drivers and their families in accessing taxi services or some semblance of transport so that they are not locked in their homes unable to get to education or work.  As the Minister knows, we are struggling to rebuild the rural economy and now we are going to lock people up, unable to travel.  What kind of impact assessment has the Minister carried out on this Bill to see what impact this draconian measure will have on rural Ireland, and particularly on families in rural Ireland?</p>  <p>  I am not anti-road safety.  I do not want anyone to die on the roads but learner drivers and their parents are under pressure.  They have to wait for God knows how long to get a test.  In my county the wait is up to six months.  If they fail a test they have to wait a month before they can reapply.  This is totally unfair and discriminatory against rural people, especially in very rural areas.  Within 20 miles of Dublin there are plenty of small rural towns and villages and country land.  It is an attack on the rural populace and it is totally unacceptable.  It is my duty as a rural Deputy to oppose such legislation because, whether it is the case that the Minister is trying to confuse the Bill or to conflate it with something else, it is a total no-no until such time as we have some of the services the Minister has here in Dublin, that is to say, buses, taxis, the Luas, the DART and now a &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion underground project as well.  To hell with the people of rural Ireland.  It is as bad as the time of Cromwell - to hell or to Connacht with the people.</p>  <p>  It is totally insensitive, over the top and unfair at a time when people cannot get tests.  People are waiting six months to get tests in my county.  They are then waiting a month if they fail a test, sometimes for the most frivolous of reasons.  We have to have a whole overhaul of the test system.  If people fail on a very minor issue they should be able to get a restricted licence.  They should not fail outright for failing on one item.  I have spoken to people who went in for tests and who, because the reclining seat button was not working correctly they failed the test.  I have spoken to other people who have gone in for tests and, because there was fog, they were told to go home and that they could not do the test.  I was speaking to a lady recently who, after having driven 25 miles to the centre, was told to go home because it was too frosty.</p>  <p>  The testing system is outdated, draconian and totally ridiculous at this stage, as are the rules and regulations.  It would be a better fit for the Minister and his Department to try to introduce a progressive testing system.  There should be simulator programmes in schools.  The theory test should also be done in schools.  There should be a whole revamp of the testing system so it is not down to the fickleness and frailties of one individual at one snapshot in time during a half an hour of driving.  I oppose the introduction of this aspect into the Minister's Bill, which was already anti-rural from the start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400036#JJ00800"><p>Obviously I am a member of the committee which debated this Bill.  We debated it at pre-legislative stage and then it went through Second Stage and Committee Stage.</p><p>We knew the aforementioned amendment was coming but as there were some difficulties in ensuring it was technically correct, we are seeing it at quite a late stage, which we had expected.  It is not the ideal way to introduce an amendment.  Having said that, the motion is important and I will support it.  I think it is aimed at saving lives, including rural lives.  It probably came as a surprise to many of us that it was not part of the legislative framework to begin with.  The origin of this is the Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care on our Roads, ​PARC, group, which consists of families who have had a loved one - indeed, in some cases, more than one - killed by people who were not licensed to drive on their own.  We must keep them very much to the fore.  This measure is intended to try to ensure that some of these terribly sad cases do not reoccur.  In many ways, this legislation gives some degree of meaning to these awful tragedies in that at least the victims' loved ones, by making the argument, are trying to protect other people into the future.  For this reason, I support the motion.  I do not like the idea that we do not see significant measures such as these introduced when the Bill is first published.  I accept that things are added afterwards, usually on Committee Stage.  This is quite a late stage at which to add such measures, which is why the mechanism of having this debate in advance of proceeding to Report Stage is occurring.  There were some arguments to include other aspects in the Bill in respect of cycling, for example.  They were ruled out of order on the basis that they were not consistent with what the Bill was attempting to do.  I would make the argument that this is slightly at variance with the other aspects of the Bill, although I think they are all intended as a road safety and life-saving initiative.  Therefore, as I said, I will support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400037#KK00200"><p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to comment on this.  It is unusual procedure.  In my time in the House, I think I might have only seen it on one other occasion.  A whole range of important measures that are necessary to improve road safety have been introduced in this country.  It could be said that the Minister should have brought these issues before us in a more comprehensive consolidated Bill on Second Stage and then brought them to the committee.  The reality is that as of yesterday, 49 people have tragically died in road traffic collisions so far this year, I think just two fewer than this time last year.  While the 2017 figures were lower than those of the previous year, with 159 fatalities in 2017 compared with 187 in 2016, there are still far too many families and friends left totally devastated week after week and month after month because of injuries and deaths sustained in serious road traffic collisions.</p><p>There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>here because we thought, with the 2016 Act, that we had addressed the major amendments here, which are referred to as the Clancy amendments.  I was looking back at the 2016 Act earlier, specifically section 39, which I think was proposed by Deputy Munster to achieve legal certainty in respect of learner drivers.  The Attorney General, presumably, and the Minister felt this was not legally watertight and that it could not be commenced.  This means we have this sense today that we are going back over something we thought we had dealt with.  I also note in the 2016 Bill that we tried to address the issue of rickshaws in this city, which is an ongoing controversial issue.  It is there in the Bill.  What is the practice in this regard?  I know this is an unusual D&aacute;il in that it passes a measure and then it is simply not commenced.</p><p>I of course welcome amendments concerning drink-driving and I hope the motion will lead to a reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries on the road, especially in rural Ireland where, as my colleagues to my left know, alcohol is a factor in 81% of road traffic collisions.  The Road Safety Authority has compiled data on alcohol's involvement in fatal crashes, which show that between 2008 and 2012, alcohol was a contributing factor in 38% of fatal crashes.  Therefore, I believe that the attempts by my colleagues on the left of the House, Deputies Mattie McGrath, Danny Healy-Rae and others, to weaken the penalties for those caught drink-driving are the result of a misconception of these amendments and they must be rejected.  If one looks back through the figures year after year, there is no question but that the approach the Minister is adopting is the correct one.</p><p>I welcome the European Commission's recent road safety statistics, which show that Irish roads are now the fifth safest in the EU at 33 per 1 million inhabitants and that the number dying on roads around Europe is decreasing, although the 2020 target apparently will not be achieved.  Some 25,000 deaths are still happening year on year.  The figures still show that around 70 people are dying day in, day out on EU roads.  In the Gallery today we have some of the people whose lives have been altered forever due to fatal road traffic collisions.  These are the real people behind the statistics.  I know Ms Fiona Clancy is here with us tonight.  She tragically lost her mother, Geraldine, and her sister, Louise, in a fatal collision with an unaccompanied learner driver.  These are the people, those families and friends who are devastated, who we must remember.  For this reason I believe that, although the approach may be unusual, the best way is to proceed and to bring the Clancy amendments finally into active law.  As I said, we thought we had achieved this in the 2016 Act, and that gives us this sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.</p><p>Regarding the amendments and the 2016 Act - and the Minister might address this when he comes back - if the new learner driver laws are passed into law, whereby a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver will be seized by the Garda and the owner held liable, will the present law still stand whereby the unaccompanied learner, according to the 2016 law and earlier law, receives a fixed charge payment notice?  This became a penalty point offence in the 2014 Act.  Will the Minister assure us that there will not now be a loophole again whereby fixed charge payment notices, FCPNs, will not be issued where vehicles have been seized?</p><p>Looking at some of the issues on which, I hope, we will get a chance to speak in the hours ahead and tomorrow evening, it does make a strong case again for consolidation in order that we will not find ourselves in this kind of situation in the future.  The Minister's predecessors, Deputy Varadkar and Deputy Donohoe, and now the Minister himself have all welcomed work which they said had started and was ongoing in respect of consolidation of traffic law.  I think the Taoiseach told me one morning on Leaders' Questions that in areas such as company law and taxation law we have consolidated highly complex legislation and we then move on it year after year.  There is therefore surely a case - and the debate tonight from all sides surely shows it again - for a strong consolidation of traffic law.  Having said that, I am strongly in favour of proceeding with the Bill and allowing the Minister to bring forward these amendments, which would be a significant step forward for the safety of all road users in the future.</p></speech>

The Minister need not shake his head because it will affect them.  It has already affected one young fellow in Killorglin and a few more in different places.  He lost his apprenticeship because he could not get to work.  His father and mother could not allow him to take the car any more.  They would not take the chance on the journey from Killorglin to Kenmare.  Now he is at home and he has no prospect of getting another job.  I am opposed to this measure.</p>  <p>  Several other measures could have been put into the Bill that would help these young drivers, and every young fellow should get one chance.  I believe people are entitled to get a chance in this world.  We could fit the cars with speed limits and other modern techniques could be used to monitor people's driving and if they went over a certain agreed limit, they would not get insurance or their licence renewed.  We could have gone down several other roads, but what the Minister wants to do is to paralyse and isolate them, keep them at home and give them no chance.  It is very unfair.  The Minister does not care because he is here in a cosy spot in Dublin where he can get at taxi, a DART or a bus.  I do not begrudge people in the city who can do things like this, but people in rural places like Killorglin, Glencar, Cahersiveen or Lauragh have no other way to travel without a car.  This is the gospel truth and we are not making up lies.  I am defending their right to have one chance to go on the road.  If they do not get that chance, it is wrong, and the Minister is wrong in what he is doing.</p>  <p>  Why is the Minister trying to criminalise honest good living people in rural Ireland who have never done anything wrong to anyone?  It is sad to think people who are lonely will be made more lonely and more isolated because if people lose their licence in rural Ireland, they are stranded and cannot go to work or go to the shop.  With the Minister's new Bill, people will have no opportunity because he suggests people will be put off the road if they are caught in the 50 mg to 80 mg blood alcohol bracket.  There is no need whatsoever for this.  I asked the Minister at a committee meeting to prove the necessity for this, and he gave instances of cases from 2008 to 2012 and stated that in those four years 36 people were killed in incidents involving alcohol.  He did not come out and individualise the cases and prove it was not someone walking along the footpath after having a few pints and stepping in front of a driver who had no drink at all.  Could it have been the case that a young fellow who had one pint and was not over the drink-driving limit at the time met black ice and hit a bridge or a pole?  Could it have been cases like this?  The Minister never proved it.  He said data protection would not allow him to give the cases.</p>  <p>  I am saying to him, to everyone in the Gallery and to anyone who is listening that anyone who drank a pint and a half pint never caused a fatality or an accident.  No one in the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket caused a fatality.  Is this the price the Minister extracted from the Fine Gael Government?  Is this what he got from Fine Gael, to be allowed to introduce these draconian measures?  The Fine Gael Deputies, who are not here, have traditionally gone into farmyards and places in rural Ireland and rural Kerry and have got votes there, but I can tell the Minister that if he is anywhere near them they will get no vote at the next election, whenever it will be, because he is hurting people who never did anything wrong to anyone.</p>  <p>  It is sad to think that a farmer coming home from the mart will not be able to come into the pub to have one pint or maybe a pint and a half pint to tell people what he got for his animals or how the day went for him.  All of this will be gone.  People will have to stay inside at home.  They will be like rabbits inside a burrow when the fox or the harrier is around.  They are afraid to peep out because some fellow like the Minister will be outside.  This is no laughing matter.  This is what the Minister is doing to people in rural Ireland.  He is paralysing and isolating them and treating them like dirt.  The Minister has the facilities here.  He has buses, taxis, DARTs, trains and everything else at any hour of the day or night that he wants.  This is not available to people in rural Ireland.  This is what he and the Government that has him there as a Minister are going to do to the people of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am sad it has come to this.  I have tabled an amendment and I will move it when the opportunity arises.  This is the most hurtful and serious issue.  There has been a lot of talk since I came up here about rural Ireland, but it is only lipservice because everything the Government does hurts the people in rural Ireland.  Whether the Government realises it or not, that is what it is doing.  It is hurting the people in rural Ireland and the grand people in Lauragh, the Black Valley, Glencar and Knocknagoshel.  Let every man talk for his own county and I will talk for mine.  This is what the Government is doing to the people.  It is hurtful and I can tell the Minister, because the people will tell him themselves, they hate him down there and they will never forget what he is doing to them.</p></speech>

The constituency I represent is really concerned, worried and upset over what is being proposed.  I want to speak about the changes in respect of our young drivers.  In some of the places I am elected to represent, young people have no other way of travelling than to get their L-plates.  Whether it is to go to a part-time job or from Sneem to university in Cork, and whether they are from Tuosist or in Ardea, Waterville or Ballinskelligs, they need to be able to go to work and earn money to better themselves or go to college.  These people are worried that the changes being proposed will be detrimental to their parents, the people who brought them into the world and worked so hard to set them on their way.  The young people have stood up on their own feet and purchased a motor car with a bit of assistance from part-time work or their parents and all they want to do is get on in the world and have the same opportunity as all of us had.  I appeal for their voices to be heard.</p>  <p>  Being a Teachta D&aacute;la means one is a messenger of the people.  From the first day I was privileged to be elected to the D&aacute;il, I have always considered myself to be a messenger, doing my job for the people I represent.  I started travelling to clinics with my late father many years ago and many of the clinics we attended were in public houses.  I am very sorry to say that I have to pass the doors of those public houses now because they are closed.  I do not say it is the fault of the Minister because it started before he became Minister, but everything has had a knock-on effect and made it impossible for small businesses like the pubs to survive in rural areas.  Many of the pubs I go into for my clinics are only hanging on by a thread.  Glencar is a place I adore and where I know every house as I have been going there for years looking for votes for the council or D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We were very proud to have had a small hotel and two pubs there but one unfortunately closed its doors and I am very sorry that respectable publicans had to recognise that it was no longer financially viable to keep their doors open.</p>  <p>  The reason we are standing up to call for votes tonight is to express outrage over the changes that are being proposed and if I did not do that, I would be letting down the people who were good enough to back me over the years.  I know the way of life of these people; I have been there and I have been part of it.  It is a part of what we stand for and it is wrong to blacklist young people, or to criminalise their parents, no matter what part of Kerry they are from, just because they drive a car without a qualified driver with them.  I am from Kerry and I am an elected representative for the county so I have to speak out for these people.  I would not be doing my job if I did not stand up tonight and put their case on the record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  If other Members choose to sit down when a vote is called, that is their business.  They are elected to be answerable to the people who vote for them but I and my colleagues will stand up to voice our outrage by calling votes.  It is a sad sign in a democracy that we are not able to get enough people to stand up to allow a vote to proceed but I will abide by that.  However, I will not let the people of County Kerry down by not standing up for people in Brosna, Knocknagoshel, Lauragh, Ardea, Tuosist, Sneem, Cahirciveen, out in Valentia Island and all the way over to Killorglin and into mid-Kerry.  These are places I adore and which I have been travelling to day in and day out, week in and week out, and month in and month out.  I know every single person in those areas and I have to stand up for them tonight and say what they have been telling me as recently as this weekend.  They were talking about the Minister's Bill and I had to tell them I was disappointed that there were not more like-minded Deputies in the House so that we could at least put up a formidable battle against it.  Unfortunately, we are failing because there are not enough like-minded Deputies.  The major parties back the Minister, as do other Independents and Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Minister has a lot of support and it looks like he is beating us.  However, I have to have my say and speak for the people I represent.</p>  <p>  I deal with people in the medical profession and in the legal profession and they say the magic word is "discretion".  In the past, people knew other people's form and they knew who was sensible.  If the Minister wanted to shut me up now, all he would need to do is say that this is the law.  It has been the law but discretion was always allowed.  Insurance companies honoured young people who were driving if they had a L-plate on the car.  If there was not a person with a full licence on board, they were still insured if garda&iacute; stopped them.  There was a system of discretion to allow people to carry on driving their cars.  I believe these young people are highly responsible and are good drivers.  We all hear of cases where a person of any age drives recklessly and too fast.  Some of us have been caught speeding over the years and I speak for myself in this regard.  Anybody who says he is perfect is a liar and I will not tell lies here tonight.  I have made the same mistakes as anybody else.</p>  <p>  Our young people are very responsible.</p><p>Our young people adhere to the principle that if they are going out for a night, they would not dream of driving their motor car.  They cherish the idea that they have the right to get up in the morning and drive to college or to their part-time work.  All they are trying to do is get on in life.  If the Minister was a young person in any of the places I am talking about and if he was miles from the nearest village, never mind the nearest town, how could he as a young person tell his busy mother or father - who might be farming or working -  that he needs to go to college or to the fish factory where he was working and ask him or her to sit in the passenger seat for him?  The practicality of it just does not make sense.  </p></speech>

I really and passionately believe that.  The one thing I will stand up for - as long as there is blood going through my veins - is rural Ireland.  The Minister knows I will.  It would be very neglectful of me if I did not.  If our late father was here tonight, I know he would wonder whether they all had gone mad and what were they all doing.

After this, we are going to have Fine Gael Deputies going around and talking about rural Ireland.  They will say they did this, that and the other thing for rural Ireland.  If they are asked what they did about the Minister, Deputy Ross's Bill, they can mutter and they can stutter but the one thing they will be able to say is that they did not vote with the Minister.  When there is no vote on amendments like these, there is no record of them voting against the Minister but they can still say that they were not with him either.  They can do the thing that every one of us hates to see.  They will be able to walk both sides of the white line.  They will have one leg in one camp and one leg in the other.  They will be looking for support in rural Ireland and if the Minister wants my honest opinion, they will not deserve it.  I think they are letting their constituents down but it is not for me to criticise other politicians; they can speak up for themselves.</p>  <p>  I am really worried about what is going on here.  I am worried about the future of rural Ireland.  I have seen what has happened to our post offices.  It is happening today.  I am sure the Minister is aware that 390 letters went out today to post offices around the country telling them of their futures and offering them a compensation package to close their doors.  There has been a campaign throughout the past to close down rural Ireland.  We have had it with the small shops.  In the village I am from, there were six pubs and 26 shops.  There are now two shops and three pubs.  That is only indicative of every other small parish and every other small rural community.  They have knocked it away chip by chip.  Back in Lauragh there was a great public house, the Shebeen, and I recall the number of times over the years that our late father went there to do our clinics.

You are a man with your feet firmly on the ground and you know every single part of the constituency you represent as well as I know mine.  You know that your area also has been affected by what we call rural decline.  What are we, as legislators, doing here tonight?  Are we doing anything to halt rural decline?  We are not.  Are we doing anything to assist people living in rural areas?  We are not.  Are the consequences of tonight going to hurt the future of rural Ireland?  Yes they are.  Who is there to shout "stop" or to say we must have a vote on this?  I think the last time there were six people who stood up.  Out of all the legislators in here it worried six people enough that they thought they had better stand up and try to do something.  Are we not very weak up against the Minister?  The only thing about it is that we are passionate about what we believe in.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is the same as the closure of the rural rail network.  I would not dare name people who have gone to their eternal reward but at that time there were politicians who proposed that it was a good idea and a sensible thing to do away with the rural rail network.  I will give an example.  From the great town of Killarney going out through Killorglin, on out by Mountain Stage and down into Cahirciveen, we had a train.  Going out of Killarney through Kilgarvan on into Kenmare we had a train.  If we had those trains today, it would change the way business is conducted in those towns.  It would be financially viable to have a business operating because with goods inwards and goods outwards, rather than the expensive route of going on roads that are overburdened already by lorries and traffic, we could have them coming and going on the rail network.  If we had a train going down to Cahirciveen it would blind the Orient Express any day of the week because of the simple fact of the beauty of the area.  People would come from all over the world to see it.  If they were travelling along that area on a train looking out onto the sea they would say, "my God, we are going to paradise".  I mean that and I believe it in my heart and soul but politicians in this House thought it was a good idea - short-sightedness - to close it down.</p>  <p>  Why am I comparing this with all those years ago and those politicians?  God be good to them they are gone, but they made a mistake.  I believe they made a mistake.  I believe that the Deputies who will not stand up here tonight against the Minister's proposals are making a mistake.  Time will prove who is right and who is wrong.  Being a politician and being serious about it means having to look to the future.  We have to see around turns and time will tell that what is happening here is wrong.</p>  <p>  It comes back to what I said earlier on about people using their discretion.  We had garda&iacute; who used their discretion.  We had people in positions of authority who sized up a situation and made up their minds about what was right and what was wrong.  The trouble nowadays is that everything is about books and papers, filling up forms and dotting i's and crossing t's.  We are so blinded by legislation and by people being politically correct that we are losing sight of our real values, namely, people.  When I think of legislation and of changes - I am not even talking about the Minister, Deputy Ross - it is so easy for a Minister to come along and say he thinks such a thing is a good idea.  However, we must think of the knock-on consequences and what it will mean to people living in their own communities.  It can devastate communities.  If we look at decisions that were taken in the past, for instance with regard to people in our fishing communities, we sold out our fishermen and what did they get in return?  Nothing.  </p></speech>

It is providing for the inclusion of the Road Traffic Acts of 2016, 2010, 2002 and 1996.  That might be right but I take the view that this recommittal is widening the scope of the Bill.  I cannot insist that it is very narrowly focused but what I can insist on is that while the Deputy is making a contribution, he sticks to the road traffic issue.</p></speech>

Every word he said is 100% correct.  I agree with him and will do exactly what he says to the letter of the law.  He is the boss.</p>  <p>  Sticking 100% to the Bill, I say to the Minister that I do not agree with it.  I fundamentally, heart and soul, disagree with it.  I am sorry that my colleagues and I do not have more support.  Tonight and tomorrow will be remembered for years to come.  People will look back at the changes being made and will see that letting this happen was a big mistake.  They will ask where the politicians were and the answer will be that many of them were asleep at the wheel.  They could not see what was happening and did not realise the enormity of the implications for people.  </p>  <p>  I have made my case in the fairest, most honest, straightforward way, and nobody, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle included, could disagree or find fault with the sincerity of my argument.  He has visited County Kerry and he has seen what life is like there.  He knows the people I am talking about.  He can see why I am so passionate about this, why I believe what I am saying and why I believe I am correct.  It is seldom that I will be heard saying I am right and someone else is wrong but in this case I think I am and it would be neglectful of me not to say that.  I am glad to be here and to have had the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-24a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400044#RR00200"><p>I reiterate I am vehemently opposed to the Bill in its entirety and to the additional proposal regarding learner drivers.  A couple of weeks ago, the Government made much ado about the lack of teachers.  Students who are going to college, whether they are in Kilgarvan, the Black Valley, Cahirciveen or wherever else, have to undertake teacher training in different schools around their areas.  Many of them are in university in Cork.  They go there for a few hours and then go home to Macroom, Bandon or Killarney to finish the rest of the day.  Can the Minister visualise how that is going to work?  Who is going to travel with them?  Someone will have to drive these students to college in Cork, stay with them there for two hours and bring them back home again.  That simply will not work.  The Minister will ask me why these students do not have licences.  They cannot get a provisional licence until they are 17 years of age.  There is then a 22-week wait to do their tests.  That is half a year.  That is the truth and these are the facts.  How are young people from Lauragh, Knocknagoshel, Gneeveguilla, Rathmore or Scartaglen going to manage?  It just will not work.  It is different in Cork or Dublin where there is a completely different way of life.</p>  <p>  I am sorry the Minister does not understand and does not want to understand.  I believe that every young person deserves to get the same chance as everyone else but because of this legislation, young people will be further isolated.  They will not be able to go their apprenticeships or attend colleges and their whole education will be affected.  Young people of 17 or 18 years of age cannot ask their father to drive them around the county because everyone has his or her own job to do, be it milking cows, teaching or whatever else.  In rural Ireland, in places like Kerry, one cannot travel without a car.  </p>  <p>  The elderly are also angered by this Bill.  Many people around the country are greatly angered by what the Minister is doing, and are asking what they did wrong.  They do not believe they ever did anything to the Minister and are wondering whether he is trying to make a name for himself with this Bill.  The Minister has not shown that people with 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol in their blood while driving are the cause of fatalities or accidents.  I certainly do not condone drunk-driving but a pint and a half pint never made anybody drunk.  That is the truth.  There is a lot of talk at the moment about hard and soft borders.  The facts are that in the Six Counties, the limit is 80 mg, not 50 mg.  One is not put off the road until there is 80 mg of alcohol in one's blood.  In France the limit is 80 mg and if one is caught with a lower level than that, one is just fined; one is not put off the road and there are no penalty points.  </p>  <p>  Why are the people in Kerry and other rural places being scapegoated?  Why is the Minister trying to criminalise them?  They are hard-working people.  There has been much talk about water and housing.  These people just want to be left alone.  It is harder and harder to get planning permission.  Most people in rural Kerry have their own septic tanks and their own water supply.  They are really asking for nothing except to be left alone.  So much lipservice has been paid, since I have been a Member of this House, about what will be done for rural Ireland.  Everything that is being done is hurting the people of rural Ireland.  Why will the Minister not just leave them alone?  I am begging him to leave them alone.  I cannot understand how Fine Gael gave the Minister liberty to do this.  That party, for almost 100 years, has gone in and out of rural countryside places such as Rathmore, Kenmare, the Black Valley and the Pocket in Glanmore, and people have voted for it in those places.  It is now turning its back on those people and giving the Minister the power to put forward this Bill and to isolate them further. </p>  <p>  The people in rural Ireland do not break the law.  When this law is brought forward they will only have one thing to do; stay at home.  They will not be able to socialise.  They will not be able to go out to their local pub to have a pint and a half pint in the way they have been doing.  I know a man of 93 years of age, and he has his pint and his half pint - at the very most two pints - and he has never been over the 80 mg limit.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has said, discretion was allowed.  That man is 93 years of age but the minute this Bill is enacted, that man will be at home for the rest of his days because he will know that at the 50 mg level he will not be able to have a pint.  That is the effect this Bill will have on such a man and many more like him, those who have worked tirelessly to put this country together.  Those people had to do things that we do not understand.  I do not understand what they did, and I am certain the Minister does not understand what they did or how they managed to keep going and keep the country going.  We are here because of people like that man and many more who have gone.  </p><p>That is how we came to be here.</p> <p> I again call on the Minister to reconsider what he is doing.  In Dublin, there are plenty of DARTs, buses and taxis but places like Sneem, Waterville or Caherdaniel do not have taxis.  There is some service on a Saturday night to take the young people to the local disco.  That is all they have, and there is nothing left to enable the elderly or middle-aged people to go out to the rural pubs.  It is sad to think that while many rural pubs have closed, hundreds more will do so once this Bill is brought forward.  </p> <p> I am disappointed to note that not enough Deputies stood up to allow us to have a vote.  At other times, we have stood up at with other parties just to give them the privilege and the chance to have a vote.  We were not allowed that chance tonight and I regret it.  I know that many of the those who were present would have liked to stand.  I do not know who stopped them.  I believe that when a Member is elected to this House, there is only one priority, namely, the people who vote for him or her.  Many of the Deputies here have let their own people down.  However, that is their business and I will not name them or anything like that.  I am very disappointed that we did not have a vote tonight because this is a most serious issue.  It is going to hurt County Kerry in a desperate way because by and large, it is a rural county and one cannot manage without a car.  People realise that when this measure comes in, if they go out, have a pint and a half and are caught, they will lose their licence.  That means they will lose their job, which means they lose everything.  It could mean they lose their home.</p> <p>  This is shameless carry-on.  I am hurt and I am praying that somehow, something will happen that will stop this from going through.  The Minister seems to have the numbers.  Fine Gael are backing him just because he is holding that party's Government together.  It is a shame that Fine Gael has allowed the Minister to do this because many of its members do not agree with this measure either.  What the Minister is doing is needless.  He is hurting many people in rural Ireland and I am very sad and angry about it.  </p></speech>

I have been here for 11 years now and I do not think I have ever seen this happen.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, had introduced his Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 and we all debated it here.  Then he had a brainwave over Christmas and decided to add more things to it, for fear it would not do enough damage.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I do not want to see anybody drink-driving.  I do not want to see anybody hurt by an accident.  However, laws Members pass in here must be accepted by the people.  The Garda cannot police the country, nor can any police force police any country in the world, without the support of the people, na daoine go l&eacute;ir.  If the Minister brings in draconian laws that are impossible to implement, it will undermine the whole ethos of government, legislation and constitutionality.</p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; an-chairdi&uacute;il leis an Aire ar feadh c&uacute;ig bliana.  We were the best of friends.  He has now decided to take a dislike to me because I represent my constituents.  I am doing no more than my colleagues here.  I am representing the people that I meet who do not have services in rural Ireland.  I will deal with the rest of this tomorrow but I note the Minister has raised the issue of learner drivers.  I know some of the Minister's children and grandchildren.  I have asked him honestly whether any of them has ever sat in a car without a qualified driver.  He said they had not.  I take him at his word.  However, I can tell him that most people in rural Ireland have to drive.  Insurance companies accepted this, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae noted, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were aware of it too.  I am not against dangerous drivers.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the Minister to reform the testing centres countless times.  It is a dog's dinner.  One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  He will not listen, or his officials will not listen, at all.  I put down a parliamentary question, which I have to hand, that the Department passed on to the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The Minister is good at passing the buck.  The RSA confirmed to me in a parliamentary reply that nationally, a total of 44,746 applicants are awaiting to be scheduled for a test.  The Minister should sort that out first, and then demonise the people.  He has the cart before the horse.  I could say something else about mo th&oacute;n.  But I will not use it, because it is spelled A - R - S - E and W - A - Y - S.</p>  <p>  These figures go to the heart of what I and others have been saying for some time now; which is there is a chronic backlog afflicting the sector, which in turn is creating serious knock-on consequences.  What else did the RSA tell me?  What is deeply alarming to me is that this number of almost 45,000 does not include those who have already been scheduled for an upcoming test.  They could number another 40,000 for all we know.  The Minister is playing with the figures. In this case he is playing with people's lives and their constitutional rights to live, breathe, work, play and socialise.  To hell with them.  I said it earlier.  To hell or to Connacht.  Cromwell is back.  Those people do not matter.  The Minster talks about Bills in this House.  On the other hand he is going to knock Na Fianna GAA club down, undermine it or blow it up like Nelson's Pillar.  It does not matter where it goes.</p>  <p>  The Minister does not listen.  The figure of 45,000 merely reflects those waiting to be given a test date.  What about the rest of them?  The RSA informs me that in part, this is due to the number of driver tester retirements in the past 12 months.  However, it does not specify how many testers have opted out of the system or why.  They are probably fed up with it.  They are sick of it.  Working in a bureaucratic system is impossible.  I told the Minister previously that driving should be started in schools.  T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre.  It should start in transition year where a simulator course should be held and driver testing carried out.  Some schools, including the Abbey School in Tipperary town, have had that facility for several years.</p>  <p>  The RSA has also told me it has taken on 23 new testers in 2016.  Hooray.  Only six of them will commence operating by this year.  What is going on?  What are they doing, these 26 testers, if they are not working?  Are they on the payroll doing nothing?  This is farce.  The Minister and his officials should go back and examine that.  I refer to the downright waste involved in people taking two years to be trained.  Are they that stupid, that they take two years to be become a tester?  I do not know what the Minister is in charge of but the lunatics are in charge of the asylum and I include the Minister in that.</p>  <p>  This is simply not good enough, given the scale of the challenge.  If my son or daughter applies to do their test they may fail for a flimsy reason.  I agree that fundamentals must be done right.  Test candidates have all had 12 lessons now, which means that nearly &euro;600 has been spent by themselves or their parents or guardians.  The lesson system is very good.  I told the Minister earlier about a girl who drove from Cappawhite to Clonmel, a distance of 30 miles, in the fog.  The tester came outside, looked up at the sky and said it was too foggy to have a test, so she could not take it.  She had to drive home again in the fog.  What kind of a fog is the Minister in?  He is in a fog, and he does not know when he is going to come out of it.  He is in a deep fog.  He does not know what is going on.</p>  <p>  I met someone only two weeks ago who drove in the frost from Ballyporeen into Clonmel.  She brought an approved driver with her, for fear the Minister might have instructed the Garda to catch her.  The tester came out, said it was a bit cold and frosty and declared he was not going to do it.  This is what is going on, namely, downright blackguarding of ordinary people and citizens.  It is downright blackguarding and skulduggery.  Those people must take a day off work and get a driver to accompany them.  They wait for six months for a test in my town of Clonmel.  If a candidate fails the test for any reason, however flimsy, they must wait a month before they reapply.  They are penalised again.  They cannot apply that day by simply asking if they can come back again.  Think of an enthusiastic young fellow who has an apprenticeship waiting for him, who must finish his college or leaving certificate or lo and behold, wants to go to college.  The Government will not give him accommodation up here.  It is doubling and trebling the fees here.  It wants people to live in the Dark Ages in the country.  Let them grow horns and go back to the Dark Ages.  To hell with them.  Keep all the nice things for this crazy city where one cannot get a bed.  Somebody told me tonight that a bed in a hotel cost them &euro;780.  We have plenty of beds in Tipperary.  We have plenty of people there.  The Rising started in Tipperary.  The War of Independence started in Soloheadbeg.  We are great people, proud people and people with autonomy.  I am elected by the people of Tipperary for the time being, thankfully, and I will fight the Minister every inch of the way on this Bill, because it is nonsense and poppycock.  He does not understand the first thing about it and he cares less.  He had time for reflection over Christmas or maybe he was on one of those journeys that his colleagues have been on with the eighth amendment.  They were all going on journeys this way, that way and the other way.  To the people who are here tonight in the Visitors Gallery, in anticipation of the next debate-----</p></speech>

The schemes have proved to be a great panacea for the country.  They have assisted individuals by giving them a sense of purpose and assisted communities in various ways which my colleagues will outline.  The schemes would not have been the success they have been if they had not been manned by able supervisors.  The position of community employment supervisor is one that requires a unique set of skills and vocational attachment to the job.  I know many supervisors who work far beyond the call of duty.  Many people in this country are in receipt of pensions from the public purse for work that is less difficult and, in some cases, less important than that done by community employment supervisors. </p><p>On 22 July 2008, the Labour Court ruled that an agreed pension scheme be introduced for community employment scheme supervisors.  I must stop because not one member of the Government is present. </p></speech>

It also ruled that this should be done without delay.  Ten years have passed and the scheme has not been put in place.  On 22 September 2009, the then line Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, sought clarity on a number of issues to enable F&Aacute;S to proceed with the pension scheme.  A further six months elapsed and on 24 May 2010, the Department sought yet more time.  Another four months elapsed and on 22 September 2010, F&Aacute;S announced it could no longer deal with the issue as responsibility for community employment schemes was moving to the Department of Social Protection.  This meant the community employment supervisors and their representatives had to negotiate with that Department.</p>  <p>  A number of further meetings took place but another nine months slipped by until 21 June 2011 when the Department sought a meeting with the representatives of the community employment supervisors, not to announce the details of their pensions but to inform them that it was seeking more time.  The Department was given more time and four months later, in October 2011, it indicated it had finally decided it would not proceed to implement the Labour Court recommendation after all.  It advanced two reasons for the decision, the first of which was that F&Aacute;S was not represented at or party to the Labour Court proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Minister, her officials and everyone in the country knows there is no substance to that argument.  F&Aacute;S was represented at the Labour Court hearing and I can name the two representatives of the organisation who attended if anyone wishes.  They made submissions and the input of F&Aacute;S was referenced in the Labour Court decision.  It is shameful, therefore, to try to get out of the matter by arguing that F&Aacute;S was not a party to the proceedings.  In any case, even if F&Aacute;S had not been represented, in previous instances where matters related to community employment went to the Labour Court it was always the position, and always understood to be the position, that even though the supervisors were recognised as not being employees of F&Aacute;S, it nonetheless fell to F&Aacute;S to implement the decision of the Labour Court and fund its implementation.  </p>  <p>  As I stated, this is a rather threadbare excuse.  However, not content with putting forward an excuse for inaction that had about as much credibility as Oscar Pistorius's defence, the Department decided to supplement its first excuse with a second one with even less credibility, namely, that the companies employing the supervisors did not provide pension schemes for them.  In other words, community associations, GAA, handball and soccer clubs and so forth had not set up pension schemes for community employment supervisors.  It may have escaped the Government's attention that the community employment aspect of the work of these clubs was funded by the State and it was illegal for any of these clubs or so-called employers to use this funding to set up a pension scheme as it was specifically allocated for salaries and some minor ancillary matters.  The Government's excuse then is that because the employers of community employment supervisors did not act illegally, it cannot implement the Labour Court recommendation.  If the first excuse was threadbare, the second was, frankly, mendacious.</p>  <p>  The matter rested for four years until, in 2015, the Government facilitated the matter being further discussed under the ambit of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It accepted in principle that community employment supervisors should be entitled to a pension and established what was grandiloquently described as a high-level forum to discuss and settle the matter.  The forum was set up three years ago and to date nothing has been settled.  I note that in the past three years it has held a grand total of five meetings.  Its members must be very high-level and busy. </p><p>In October 2017, two years after the establishment of the forum, the Minister for Finance committed the Government to the creation of a scoping system to work out the cost of all this.  While the cost regarding community employment supervisors is very small, the argument was put forward that it could have knock-on effects throughout the community and voluntary sector.  I do not understand that argument.  There is nothing in it.  All the organisations operating in the community and voluntary sector are unique, separate and distinct.  This is simply about community employment supervisors, not anything else.  The Government, however, seems to be saying that accepting a Labour Court recommendation to establish a pension scheme for community welfare supervisors would give rise to a whole lot of ancillary or knock-on claims throughout the voluntary and community sector.  There is no reality to that.  I note, however, that the Government relies heavily on the argument in its amendment to the motion.  I assure the House that the motion is about community employment supervisors who, incidentally, have a Labour Court recommendation in their favour.  I recall that last year when there was danger of industrial action from garda&iacute;, the Government clung like a drowning man to a Labour Court recommendation which favoured the claim made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The argument was that because the Labour Court was an organ of government, the Government could not go against its decision.  It is refusing to implement this particular decision, however.</p> <p> The motion before the House, which I urge the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to accept by withdrawing his ridiculous amendment, simply calls on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet immediately with unions representing community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors to permit negotiations to commence with a view to creating a process to bring this issue to finality.  Given that these people have made a significant contribution to the country and been led by the nose for ten years in the expectation that they would get a pension and that the Labour Court recommendation would be honoured, it is not much to ask.  I ask the House to support the motion if the Government refuses to withdraw its amendment.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, Deputy Calleary and all my colleagues for their continuous work on the issue.  Last week, community employment supervisors briefed many Deputies in the AV room on their quest for pension rights and there was staggering support from representatives from all parties and none.  The issue affects every single community and county in Ireland.  I welcome all the supervisors in the Gallery who have travelled from the four corners of the country to be present.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have raised this issue repeatedly with the Government and now call on it to find a resolution and satisfactory pathway to address the issue for the 1,250 supervisors and assistant supervisors on the basis of the Labour Court recommendation of 2008.  We also call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet immediately with the unions representing community supervisors and assistant supervisors with a view to creating a process to bring the issue to finality and making available the financial resources necessary to do so, if even on an incremental basis.  We acknowledge that this is a long-running issue, but Fine Gael has been in government since 2011 and failed to deal with it.  Community employment schemes are an intrinsic part of communities the length and breadth of this country and supervisors and assistant supervisors are key to their success.  Unfortunately, more than 250 persons have retired since the 2008 Labour Court recommendation and supervisors and assistant supervisors are now considering industrial action on foot of the Government's inaction and failure to adequately address the issue.</p>  <p>  The contribution of community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors and the schemes they oversee is immense.  They develop a pathway to encourage people back to work, which is a fundamental aim in respect of which they have had a fantastic success rate.  Their contribution to local communities includes working with sports clubs, church groups, meals on wheels, the elderly, youth education support schemes, Tidy Towns, rural development and heritage schemes.  I could go on and on.  The motion sets out clearly what is needed.  We want to avoid industrial action at all costs.  We want a resolution and satisfactory pathway to address the pension issue.  We need the Minister to meet the unions as soon as possible.  We need him to make available the necessary funds, even if on an incremental basis.  It is high time the Government recognised the immense contribution and valuable service provided by community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors and set about resolving the issue once and for all.</p></speech>

It represents a big mistake on the part of the Government to fail to recognise the role and significance of community employment schemes in all of our constituencies and the long-running issue of pension provision for the supervisors and assistant supervisors of those schemes.  It is a big mistake that she is not here tonight.</p>  <p>  There is not one Member of the House who does not have a scheme in his or her area.  Apart from the beneficial effects for the individuals who participate on schemes, many activities in our communities would not survive without them.  Community employment is grossly undervalued but many of the Members here tonight recognise and appreciate the services that have been provided.  I acknowledge one particular group, not by name but by category.  In the region of 1,000 people are on drug rehabilitation programmes on special schemes nationally.  They come through very difficult and challenging times and community employment provides them with an opportunity to reintegrate into the workplace.  It may be a longer path for them than for others, but I have seen at first hand that it is a real opportunity.</p>  <p>  Behind every successful scheme are the supervisors and assistant supervisors who make it happen.  I will not go back over the history lesson provided by Deputy O'Dea given the time available, but this issue has been going around for ten years.  In the early years following the Labour Court recommendation, it is acknowledged that there was a recession and F&Aacute;S did not have the funding.  However, we have moved on radically from that place.  As Deputy O'Dea said, it was determined in the context of the Lansdowne Road agreement that a high-level forum would be established.  It met five times.  In my view, the high-level forum has actually been used to frustrate the process instead of to facilitate a resolution.</p>  <p>  When I last asked about this on 30 November 2017, the Minister of State's Department replied that a meeting of the forum had taken place on Thursday, 23 November, at which the findings of the scoping exercise were shared with the members.  The reply further stated that a follow-up meeting to deal with the technical questions arising from the exercise was to be arranged in the coming weeks.  The problem is that the follow-up meeting has not taken place and we are now at the end of April.  The forum, which should produce results and deal with the issue, has failed and it is frustrating the process.  I appeal to the Minister of State to deal with this proactively.  These people are entitled to have the Labour Court's recommendations implemented at this stage.</p></speech>

We in Fianna F&aacute;il recognise the work of supervisors.  Community employment plays a crucial role in supporting people getting back into employment and the schemes carry out invaluable work at community and local level which, over the years, the State and commercial sector have failed to do.  The success of the schemes is due substantially and in large degree to the work of supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The supervisor is the go-to person in the local community when one wants something done.  Whether one is a member of the community or a community employment sponsor, nothing can happen without the supervisor playing that pivotal role.</p>  <p>  Over the years, my colleagues and I have raised the issue of the failure to provide for and honour the right of supervisors to an occupational pension by way of Government funding and we will continue to do so.</p><p>We hope that as result of this debate tonight we will make substantial progress.</p> <p> We all know the matter went to the Labour Court which made a recommendation.  Governments of all descriptions, time and time again, have always respected the State's industrial dispute resolution mechanisms.  It is wrong of this Government to ignore the Labour Court when it expects everyone else to adhere to its recommendations.  The Government must honour the institutions of the State and not undermine them by refusing to do so.</p> <p> As a result of that recommendation, the Estimates voted in this Chamber for several years in a row provided for &euro;10 million to be made available through F&Aacute;S.  However, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection did not implement it.  As a result, on both occasions those moneys were handed back to the Department of Finance.  At this stage, it is in the hands of the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to bring back the moneys previously voted in this House for this scheme.  There is no point in any high-level review unless there is an agreement from the Minister to provide funding to deliver this.  Above all, I want the Government to do that before the next budget as part of pay and pension restoration for people who work in the public good.</p> <p> I thank all those who travelled the length and breadth of the country to be in the Visitors Gallery tonight.  We are delighted to have such a large group here.  We want to work with them to deliver this.  We are asking the Minister of State to do the same.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the issues as a result of numerous meetings I have had with community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors in County Donegal.  Donegal is just a microcosm of the rest of the country.  We are here to support all of those who have done so much in supervising community employment schemes.  The value of their input is difficult to quantify.  It goes to millions of euro.</p>  <p>  What is at stake is simple.  It is an occupational pension for those who worked to keep the schemes going.  This matter has been ongoing since 2008 and we are all familiar with the Labour Court decision.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Social Protection, he met community employment supervisors in Donegal when he was on the campaign trail 12 months ago.  He felt the recommendation of the Labour Court should be implemented.  The Taoiseach is in a senior and influential position now but nothing has been done about it.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister ensure the Labour Court recommendation is implemented?  Our calculations are that about &euro;3.3 million is involved.  That is the commitment required from the Government.  We have had many false dawns.  We have had many promises.  I recall Ministers committing privately to this but, when it comes to a Government decision, they then take a different view.  The supervisors are employed by the company but by the same token, if there is a will, the Government can change this overnight.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection can accept the Fianna F&aacute;il motion tonight.  By doing so, they would be rewarding these supervisors.  Many of them have retired and they have to be taken into consideration as well.</p></speech>

I welcome the community employment scheme supervisors to the Gallery and thank them for the invaluable work they are doing in our communities.  Community employment scheme participants provide an invaluable service in our communities, whether its through GAA clubs, Tidy Towns, childcare and so forth.  The schemes face significant challenges, however.  They have had their resources cut and they are finding it harder to recruit participants because of changes introduced by the previous Government.  The Government does not acknowledge the great work these community schemes have done.  The 1,200 supervisors motivate and encourage the scheme's participants to ensure our communities get this service.</p>  <p>  Over ten years ago, the Labour Court made a recommendation that a pension should be introduced for community employment scheme supervisors.  However, ten years on they are still waiting.  They have demonstrated their community ethos through the very patience they have displayed over the past ten years.</p>  <p>  Time and time again, the Government cites that it needs to refer matters to the Labour Court because it is the independent mechanism to adjudicate on disputes between the State and the people who work for the State.  If so, why after ten years, has it failed to implement the recommendations in question?  The Government must work with this side of the House, accept the Labour Court recommendation and give those supervisors in the Gallery what they are due.</p></speech>

These organisations deliver much-needed support services at community level to users every day throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection assumed responsibility for the community employment programme from F&Aacute;S in January 2012.  Community employment schemes are typically sponsored by voluntary and community organisations wishing to benefit the local community.  As the employers, these sponsoring organisations contract with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on an annual basis to provide jobseekers, as well as other vulnerable groups, with good quality work experience and training qualifications to support their progression into employment.  Community employment participants work an average of 19.5 hours per week.  Virtually all participants are engaged in some element of service support and delivery such as amenities management, arts and culture, sports, Tidy Towns, childcare and health-related services.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, the community employment scheme has been subject to major programme changes which have resulted in significant savings, greater accountability by sponsoring organisations and improved oversight by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In July 2008, IMPACT and SIPTU brought a claim to the Labour Court seeking Exchequer-funded pension provision for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The outcome was a Labour Court recommendation that F&Aacute;S, as the recognised funding agency, should fund the pension provision.  On this recommendation, the position has always been that neither F&Aacute;S nor the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are the employer.  Accordingly, it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme to employees of private companies, even if those companies are, or were, reliant on State funding.</p>  <p>  The community sector high-level forum, reinstated in 2015, includes representatives of various Departments, statutory agencies and union representatives.  The forum is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Membership includes the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health, Education and Skills, and Housing, Planning and Local Government, along with Pobal and IMPACT and SIPTU, the two unions which represent the community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors.  This forum has since met on several occasions.</p>  <p>  At a meeting in April 2017, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform outlined its intention to conduct a detailed scoping exercise to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues under consideration.  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate <i>ex gratia </i>lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.  As previously stated however, community employment supervisors are employees of private companies and are not employed by the State, notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, reliant on State funding. </p></speech>

Generally, when the economy is flourishing, the need for community employment schemes is less evident, while the opposite is true in times of recession when these schemes become hugely important for many members of local communities.  While unemployment impacts on people of all ages, in recent years when technology has become so relevant and important to so many industries, people of a certain vintage are more often than not finding it difficult to match their skills or lack thereof, to the needs of potential employers.</p>  <p>  While the younger generation have the potential to seek out the appropriate training to upskill themselves to meet the needs of those potential employers, more mature people often find themselves unable to bridge the technology gap.  As the country experiences an economic revival and renewed growth, many of this mature group redirect their skills to their locality and the opportunities provided by the local community employment scheme.  This is evident in the mid-Louth community employment scheme, which caters for a large rural area and, with the benefits of the recently introduced new categories, has become an excellent opportunity for those unemployed mature people to use their skills for the benefit of the local area.  It is vital that this employment opportunity continues and hopefully expands.</p>  <p>  In addition to the satisfaction experienced by the community employment scheme workers, the benefits to the rural areas where the schemes exist is evident to all, including local residents and the ever-increasing number of tourists who visit.  The national Tidy Towns competition has been and continues to be a wonderful example of the improvement that is evident throughout the country.  The backbone and major contributor to this movement is the local community employment scheme working hand in hand with the Tidy Towns volunteers.  In the mid-Louth community employment scheme, the village of Tallanstown is a prime example of the opportunities presented by the co-operation between CE workers and local volunteers when after almost 30 years of endeavour, Tallanstown was honoured by winning the national Tidy Towns title in 2010.  </p>  <p>  We hear about the problems associated with data protection almost daily and the need for all organisations to put in place a suitable policy to protect this data.  Community employment schemes are not exempt from this.  The larger schemes hold various information and personal data on their employees.  Scheme secretaries play a vital role in the protection and maintenance of this data and at present these important employees could potentially be replaced annually.  It is very important that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection evaluate this situation and look at the implications of providing a considerably longer term of employment or perhaps permanency to some of these secretaries, particularly those working in larger schemes.  This change could be reviewed in conjunction with the possibility of giving recognition to the Trojan work undertaken on a voluntary basis by many sponsors in keeping theses schemes in operation.  Perhaps a process could be put in place where these hardworking sponsors could be rewarded, particularly on the larger schemes, by allowing them have &ldquo;a chosen employee&rdquo; - one might call it something else - who might be, say, a person who is of vital importance to the scheme, such as a scheme secretary or a scheme employee who regularly goes above and beyond the call of duty and who is an example for others to follow.  While many see this as problematic, it is a suggestion that I hope might be given further consideration and that all concerned can create an opportunity for discussion to further develop this possibility.  </p>  <p>  We all agree that CE supervisors and assistant supervisors are not public service grades but are employees of community employment schemes funded through Exchequer grant aid.  As the Minister of State noted, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service on the potential cost of providing Exchequer support to establish a pension scheme for employees across the community sector.  This exercise found that there was a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million annually.  </p>  <p>  The community employment scheme is a wonderful scheme.  I am a firm believer that people who work hard deserve what they get.  I believe that CE supervisors and assistant supervisors deserve to have a pension put in place.  I will fight hard with the Minister to work on that.</p></speech>

Its two-strand approach makes it unique compared with all other schemes, providing individuals with employment and training while providing much-needed services to the community at the same time.  Often they are services that would not otherwise be available.  I commend everyone who has made the effort to come here this evening, the supervisors and assistants, to listen to this crucial debate.</p>  <p>  CE schemes work along with important organisations such as Enable Ireland, the Simon Communities, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Tidy Towns groups the length and breadth of the State, the Cope Foundation, the Brothers of Charity and many others.  CE participants are the people who deliver meals to elderly citizens in their homes, they are the people who care for young and old people with disabilities, getting them in and out of bed, dressing them and preparing their meals.  They are the people who drive the elderly into town to collect their pension, do their shopping or allow them to visit the doctor.  They are the people who look after our young people in creches and after-school clubs.  They take care of local sporting grounds, maintaining them so that others can enjoy them.  These are the very people to whom this Government is denying a pension, despite the knowledge that without CE supervisors and assistant supervisors these services would not exist and our whole communities would suffer.</p>  <p>  There are cases of people who have been CE supervisors and assistant supervisors for 20 and 30 years.  I have spoken to many of them here this evening.  They are watching this debate in the Gallery and in the AV room, and some are outside the front gates of Leinster House on Kildare Street.  Despite their years of commitment, they are being denied a pension by this Government.  </p>  <p>  These people have given their entire working lives to CE schemes, to the benefit of communities they serve.  It is really unfortunate that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, could not come to this Chamber this evening to look the very people who provide this essential service throughout the State in the eyes and tell them that they are digging in their heels.  They have tabled an amendment to this critical motion to ensure the Government will do nothing.  </p><p>That is absolutely despicable.  The 2008 Labour Court recommendation which ordered that an agreed pension scheme should be put in place for community employment, CE, supervisors and assistant supervisors has unfortunately been ignored by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and, indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il.  In 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 they unfortunately chose not to implement the recommendations.  Here we are almost ten years later.  We are supposedly in economic recovery, but this recovery has not been felt by CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  That needs to happen.  The Government needs to recognise the valuable work carried out by CE schemes across this State.  If the Government is genuine in its compliments - and compliments is all they are, not substance - we need it to follow through.  We need it to put this pension scheme in place.  We also need it to withdraw its amendment, to stop digging its heels in and to give our supervisors the pensions they deserve for the phenomenal work they are doing in managing these schemes across the length and breadth of the State.</p></speech>

It is a shame on this and previous Governments, as Deputy Brady has outlined, that this has dragged on for so many years.  It is absolutely appalling that it has been let get to this situation.  I do not think there is any other category of workers in the public or private sector that would be treated as contemptuously as this in respect of its pension rights.  The Minister of State has adverted to the community and voluntary sector generally.  There are obviously key differences in that the direct paymaster for these schemes is the State.  The Minister of State has to recognise that these are people who have given years and years of work to their communities and to their projects.  I submit that very many of these people could have found much better paid employment but decided not to on the basis of their commitment to the projects and what they are involved in.  We are leaving them in a situation in which many of them will find it very hard to make ends meet at the point of retirement and may consider their options in the future.  It is vitally important that this is addressed early.  It is important that those who have retired in recent years are redressed and that those who are retiring in the next two or three years are not forgotten.  They may have difficulty in building up stamps.</p>  <p>  Before I finish, it is worth saying that this comes in the context of the view which I and many others have, which is that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not believe in CE anymore and that it is undermining community employment.  The Department has lost sight of CE's original purpose and wants to hive it off to things like JobPath and T&uacute;s and not to have it on its books any longer.  This pensions issue is directly related to that agenda.  To sum up, these people have been treated shamelessly.  It is time to bring that to an end and to resolve this issue.</p></speech>

The reality is that we should not be here at all.  That is very clear.  There should not have been a Labour Court recommendation.  The Government should have dealt with this in the very beginning.  From the very outset, when the CE schemes were set up and the whole process was put in place, the supervisors and the people who worked on those schemes should have been provided with a pension.  To say it goes back ten years is quite incorrect.  It actually goes back much further than that because to bring it to the Labour Court the unions obviously had to have been advocating for some time and seeking justice for the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The reality is that if it goes back 15 years, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael share almost equal blame in respect of this issue.  That needs to be acknowledged.  The fact of the matter is that we have people in the Gallery looking for something which they should have gotten as a right as employees from the day they commenced their employment.  They should not be coming here 15 or 20 years after starting work looking for it.</p>  <p>  It is also the fact that we are in a situation where, as was mentioned earlier, there are people in government who have very great power in respect of this matter.  The reality is that we have power on both sides of the Chamber this evening because we have a confidence and supply arrangement which keeps the Government in place.  If there was this sense of outrage in respect of these particular workers, or indeed any other workers in this State, we would not be in this position today.  We would not be coming here talking about very small numbers of workers who are trying to get their rights vindicated.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that resolving this issue would somehow or other open the floodgates and that there would be a whole other sector of workers in the community and voluntary sectors that would possibly be looking to get pensions because of it.  The trade unions have been quite explicit and clear in this regard.  The situation for the community employment workers is very clear and very specific.  It is on those specific issues that this needs to be addressed.  The Labour Court was very clear that this recommendation dealt with the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  To reiterate the point made a few minutes ago, it is also clear to anyone who looks at this situation that community employment has been under attack and has been subject to cuts, revision, restructuring and everything else that could be found for the last ten to 15 years in order to put it into the ground and shift it to one side.  That is a reality which the people in the Gallery, the people who are working on community employment schemes, and those trying to get on them up and down the length and breadth of the country are absolutely aware of.  It is scandalous that this Government is refusing to vindicate the rights of these workers.  It is a great shame not just on this Government but on previous Governments that we are here this evening at all.</p></speech>

More importantly, hard-working CE supervisors should not have to take time away from their families to travel up to the D&aacute;il to listen to this debate.  As all the Deputies who have spoken from the Opposition benches have made clear, we are here because we have a Labour Court recommendation which explicitly sets out what the Government should be doing.  It is not just that people should have gotten this by right, but particularly after funding was allocated, although it was not spent, from 2009, people took up positions as CE supervisors and assistant supervisors with the reasonable expectation that those pension claims would be met.  More importantly, if this issue is not resolved CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will face a real future of financial hardship, and in some cases poverty, in retirement because of the failure of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is absolutely wrong in the figures he is quoting.  The actual cost of resolving this issue according to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, earlier this year is approximately &euro;6 million annually and a one-off payment of approximately &euro;19.2 million.  That is the cost.  In the context of the enlarged fiscal space which is available to Government next year, there is simply no reason not to resolve this issue.  It is disingenuous to quote the figures that were mentioned.  </p>  <p>  Not only is it disappointing that neither of the lead Ministers is here, but the fact that the Government seems to be digging its heels in is deeply worrying.  If this motion passes when we vote on it on Thursday, which I expect it will, the Government needs to listen very clearly.  It needs to go back to Cabinet and agree to meet the unions and the CE supervisors as a matter of urgency in order to resolve the issue.  In conclusion, not only should the Government resolve this, but it should start to reverse the decade long assault on community schemes because they do huge work in communities and with people in desperate need of those schemes.  That would be a good place to start.</p></speech>

I commend them all for their patience.  Nobody could dispute that they have indeed been very patient with this process.  As a former trade union official, I would say to them that the Labour Court should be the end of the line.  It is the last place to which one goes.  It should be the place where, if one wins, one actually wins.  These people won in the Labour Court.  The difficulty for them is that the Fine Gael Government refuses to acknowledge the third party mechanisms of the State, as did Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party when previously in government.  What does that say to every other worker outside of here?  The Government is very fond of telling people to take disputes to the Labour Court.  What should they do then?  Should they win and wait ten years?  This has been going on for the ten years since the Labour Court recommendation.  The Minister of State said that "[a]ccordingly, any solution to this issue will require careful consideration".  Well the Government has now had ten years.  Has it considered it carefully enough?  It is actually a very simple Labour Court recommendation.  Sometimes they go on for pages, but this is a very simple one.  These people have the right to a pension.  I am acutely aware that every single one of us in here has a pension.  That is all these people are here to get - a pension.  They believe they are entitled to a pension.  The Labour Court has backed that entitlement.</p><p>The Government should withdraw its disgraceful amendment.  I echo what my colleagues have said, namely, it is a disgrace that the lead Minister is not here to answer the case.  These people are only seeking a pension they won in the Labour Court, part of the third-party machinery of this State, to which the Minister of State and Members who sit on the benches opposite tell workers to go time and time again.  The Minister of State is sending a message to workers in this State that the Labour Court can be disregarded, and that message will be heard by unscrupulous employers.  Does he want to join them?</p></speech>

It is a sad day that people must come here to fight for their rights.  Listening earlier, I heard about the forum that is going on.  It should just be abandoned because all it is is a charade.  We need to get conclusions out of this and sort it out once and for all.</p>  <p>  I am looking across the Chamber at the Fianna F&aacute;il Members.  Within the next six months, they will have an opportunity when the budget is being prepared to put the gun to the head.  That is the way politics is done here.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members should forget about forums and labour courts and just tell the Government the budget will not go through, which would lead to an election, if it does not pass this once and for all, and by God it would start listening then.  That is the only way to solve this.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there are people right around the country looking after Tidy Towns and there are people being sent off schemes and not having them renewed.  We cannot get people to administer the schemes.  I met the Minister before Christmas and she said she thinks the Government will get this resolved in the new year.  The new year is coming, we are landed into summer and she is still telling me it will happen.  The reality is that there are towns struggling to get people into these schemes.  People over the age of 55 should be left on the schemes to ensure that the great work they are doing is kept going.</p>  <p>  All I am saying is that the talking is over; action is what is needed.  I am sure two people from Fianna F&aacute;il, including Deputy Calleary, a good Mayo man, will go in and fight the battle and come out with a result because that is the way it works and that is the way we need to get answers.</p></speech>

Since the commencement of the community employment programme in 1994, the scheme has provided fruitful employment and skills acquisition to tens of thousands of long-term unemployed across this State, the vast majority of whom have progressed to both mainstream and self-employment.  The social benefit of the work undertaken has been reaped by thousands of communities across the State.  The legal and fiscal relationship between CE supervisors and the State is no different from that of many public sector workers contracted by intermediary bodies.  Failure to fund pensions for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors renders the State complicit in an evasion of its fiscal obligations and in the deprivation of employment rights to a <i>de facto</i>public service sector.  The work of many CE scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors has clearly gone unappreciated and undervalued by this Government.  These supervisors deserve respect and fair play.  That is all they are asking for.  They have waited too long for the pension entitlements that are their due.  It is high time the Government get up off its feet and delivered on these entitlements.</p></speech>

I welcome the supervisors and assistant supervisors and their trade union representatives to the Gallery.  We met some of them earlier.</p><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to contribute to this debate on the plight of CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who, notwithstanding the court hearing on 11 July 2008, have been denied the import of the recommendation of 22 July 2008 by Raymond McGee, which took into account the comprehensive submissions made by the unions on behalf of the supervisors and assistant supervisors of CE schemes and a submission from F&Aacute;S, as the funding agency for the CE schemes.  They recommended that an agreed pension scheme be introduced for the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p><p>One of the important aspects which compelled the Labour Court to bring forward this recommendation was the fact that the public service benchmarking body in December 2007 did not provide a pay increase to the majority of public servants because of the value placed on public service pensions.  This gave rise to a fundamentally iniquitous situation whereby supervisors and assistant supervisors of CE schemes did not receive pay increases to which they were entitled because they had no pensions.  They were told they had pensions and, as a result, were not given any pay increases so they were effectively double-whammied by the State.  The consequences of these decisions remain current and relevant to date.  The Labour Court recommended that a pension scheme be adequately funded by what was then F&Aacute;S, as the recognised funding agency, and exhorted the parties to engage without delay to achieve this objective and that no adverse consequences for workers' employment should arise.</p><p>We are all aware of the importance of CE schemes throughout the country and the key role they play in environmental enhancement and refurbishment in towns and villages.  They also help disadvantaged people and those in long-term unemployment to gain work and training in their local communities as a stepping stone to achieving regular work.  I am aware of this happening through a scheme operating in my own village and of one young man recently securing full-time employment.  We see the results of the work input of CE schemes in the provision of much-needed community services, such as: cr&egrave;ches and meals on wheels; the upkeep of community halls and facilities and GAA and soccer pitches; Tidy Towns supports; and the maintenance of green areas.</p><p>Critical to the success and smooth functioning of CE schemes are the 1,200 or so supervisors and their assistant supervisors who manage all these local projects daily and ensure the objectives of the schemes are achieved.  This involves a wealth of bookkeeping, record-keeping and general management expertise and the implementation of various legislative requirements in health and safety, so it is a very challenging and responsible role.</p><p>Since the 2008 Labour Court recommendation, approximately 300 or more supervisors and assistant supervisors have retired.  Never mind the fact that they did not get to go on a pension; they did not receive a red cent, not even an <i>ex gratia</i>payment to acknowledge their invaluable contributions.  Many have retired to rely on the old age pension.  This could mean a drop in income of approximately &euro;450 for some.  It is a shattering experience for any employee to experience at that stage of his or her life.  One cannot but argue that these supervisors and their trade union representatives have been extremely tolerant, responsible and patient for the best part of a decade.</p><p>Some of my colleagues in the Chamber might not understand this, but my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, together with the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, actually brought forward a scheme to deal with this.  It was called the community sector redundancy supports fund, and &euro;1 million was provided for it as a head.  This was at the end of 2015.  There was going to be an amendment to a local government Bill to ensure it was put on a statutory footing because the Attorney General, I understood, had recommended it had to be on a statutory footing.  That was the ideal way to deal with the matter.</p><p>I think Deputy Calleary understood that Jack Wall, Jack O'Connor, Patricia King and others were involved in this.  He recognised that here in October, when we debated this matter.  It was tremendous, and a satisfactory and workable solution was given.  Everyone knows that it took into account a number of factors involved, including the cost and precedential value of implementing such an arrangement for the public sector.  However, it now appears to me, and indeed my Labour Party colleagues, that this has turned into a war of attrition.  More and more people will have retired or passed away and their families will be left close to a state of impoverishment if this is not resolved.</p><p>In November 2017, a report was prepared by the Minister of State's Department which calculated the precise cost implications arising from the claim for pension provision for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has referred to the correct figures in this regard.  It would cost approximately &euro;25 million to include the <i>ex gratia</i>payment.  I speak to people in Lanesboro, such as John Farrell, who would be happy to get a few bob to retire on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis.  The Minister of State is not dealing with fools; he is dealing with very intelligent people who are operating schemes on behalf of the State.  They realise that if they have five or six years left, they will not get a full pension.  They are dealing with an <i>ex gratia</i>situation, which is what was agreed.  Some of them are prepared to contribute to a scheme so as to ensure that in the future, supervisors will have a proper scheme that is properly financed by the State and with input from themselves.</p><p>This is an opportunity to grab this ball once and for all and to bring the curtain down on a saga that does not do any credit to anyone.  We have arrived at a situation whereby there has been no willingness or effort to address the issues, leading to an incredible level of frustration, which was evident last Wednesday in the AV room, where supervisors from all over the country addressed Members of the Oireachtas.  They are here again tonight.  I cannot understand why this cannot be looked at.  The Labour Court is an important vehicle in the armoury of industrial relations, and we all at some stage in this House, as colleagues have said, have advocated the sanctity and importance of adhering to recommendations and outcomes that derive from the State's industrial apparatus and we have respected the rulings emanating from the independent industrial relations of last resort to the State.</p><p>It is high time to end the current impasse.  The Minister of State can do so, and the pilot way of doing so is set forward.  It was brought in a Government memorandum by Ministers.  Therefore, it is lying there; all it takes is political will.  There are a set number of people involved and they have a Labour Court recommendation which distinguishes them from any other group.  If any other group gets a Labour Court recommendation, it will be prospective.  This is retrospective and deals with those affected going forward as well.  It is a defined group, so there is no excuse for any further delay.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of SIPTU and Eddie Mullins in particular.  It was acknowledged that this issue has been sorted.  I look at the Fine Gael benches and the low number of people who have turned up, in fairness to the couple of people who have turned up, and there is an unwillingness to sort out this issue.  The memorandum for Government is done and this is it in my hand.  It is completed.  I know because it was done through me and the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The funding stream has been set aside.  The administrator of this, with whom discussions took place, was Pobal.  It is all in place. I have to admit I was committed to doing this.  It was left like that for the Government to implement and why it has not been implemented two years later says more to me about the Government and its priorities than it does about anybody else.</p><p>It is very simple to implement it. There is a legislative basis under a local government miscellaneous provisions Act and there is a provision put aside by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was done following negotiations with Deputy Howlin at the time.  Please act on it.  There was also a letter to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, from SIPTU in September 2016 which outlines that there is a precedent from the <i>ex gratia</i>payments made to workers made redundant under the local community and development programme, LCDP, which was terminated and became the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.</p><p>We have a legislative process, if necessary following legal advice from the Attorney General, we have the funding put aside and we have a precedent.  Everything is in place except the willingness to implement the work done.  Look at the impact of all of the supervisors here, and all of those in the AV room and around the building because they cannot fit in the Gallery, on a range of schemes and lives throughout Ireland and think about this as a Government.  Think about the impact they have had and could have on the Government if it does not implement this and do what is right.  Everything is provided for.  It is a Labour Court recommendation, so please do the right thing by these people who are all here.</p></speech>

I support the motion and I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling it.  I have no hesitation in supporting it.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment because it does not make sense on any level.  It is an embarrassment to read with its reference to careful consideration, and this, as has been said, after ten years.  I certainly would not like to be in the position of the Minister of State, having to read a reply that tells us we will have careful consideration or a reply that mentions an amendment about private companies.  It is most disingenuous to talk about companies when communities are forced to set them up by Government policy and are then blamed for not paying pensions.</p><p>I want to read out something presented to us at the Committee of Public Accounts by the Department of Finance.  The Government is talking about a time of straitened finances at present, but in his opening statement to the committee the Secretary General of the Department of Finance told us:</p><blockquote>The robust pace of recovery in the economy continued in 2017, with GDP increasing by 7.8%.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and the economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland has been one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union in the past four years.</blockquote><p>I could quote much from it but my final quote is that he said the &quot;[k]ey economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year&quot;.  This is what the Department of Finance is telling us.  This is the time to ask how we make up for the lapse of ten years and how we give a pension.  We will never do it if we do not do it now.</p><p>We have all received representations on this matter, in my case by email and on the ground in my constituency in Galway.  On top of this, we receive urgent representations all the time with regard to two other matters.  These are from people desperately trying to get onto community employment schemes who cannot do so, and with regard to the difficulty posed by the Government schemes of Seetec and Turas Nua, which prevent people going on community employment schemes.</p><p>This ties in with the amendment because the Government seems to know the value of nothing based on what it does put a value on.  The amendment mentions careful consideration, the high-level forum established and a scoping exercise that was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service on the potential costs.  What struck me immediately was reference to potential costs.  What about the value of what community employment schemes do for all of our communities?  Did the Government ever think about putting a value on this or even doing a scoping exercise on it to see the millions being saved to the Government by these schemes and by the supervisors who are an integral part of them?  It might be a bad example but, as with a good teacher in a classroom, without a good supervisor we will not have people coming out of these courses with dignity.  This is what the community employment scheme is all about.  It is about dignity and providing opportunities for people who are not disadvantaged but whom the system has disadvantaged by failing them.  On the other side of it are the advantages for the community.</p><p>I ask the Government to see a little bit of sense and withdraw this nonsensical amendment.  It is an embarrassment and does not do anything for the Government.  It does not make sense given the statement from the Department of Finance and it certainly does not make sense from the point of view of the communities.  Try a scoping exercise on the value of the community employment schemes to this country and the money they save.</p></speech>

My involvement in community employment began in the days of AnCO, quite a long time ago in the 1970s.  I did voluntary work with two organisations, namely, the youth centre at St. Mary's youth club in East Wall and the Cavan Centre outside Ballyjamesduff.  I can state that the employment schemes provided by AnCO at the time and later had a massive impact.  The youth club had funding to build the frame of the centre but it was people on the employment schemes who did all of the work inside, including the painting and decorating.  It was the same at the Cavan Centre.  Today it relies on community employment schemes for essential physical work and maintenance that allows it to provide a space for holidays and weekends for training, respite and outdoors pursuits.  This is being provided primarily for those who come from disadvantaged areas.  I know the effect of the feud on the constituency I represent and how invaluable the centre has been to give that respite to families.</p>  <p>  As well as what the schemes provide for the organisations they also provide training for the participants that will help them to move on to employment when their time on the scheme has ended.  Participants were facilitated in doing courses.  For some people, their time on the scheme finished before their course finished so an appeal had to be made.  Some of those appeals were successful and others were not.  It was always very disappointing to see people who had put so much into their course who had to finish on the scheme before the final qualification.</p>  <p>  In more recent times, the loss of the double payment had a very detrimental effect on the schemes I know in Dublin Central.  Some of those schemes relied on community employment to provide essential services, especially those involved in childcare.  They provided childcare in areas of significant disadvantage.  The schemes found themselves without enough participants so the childcare service they had been providing could not continue to do its work and the service was reduced.</p>  <p>  I want to mention special drug rehabilitation community employment schemes, which have been of great support to those in recovery.  They need greater flexibility regarding duration for those with addiction issues and for those with mental health issues.  Sometimes it can take two years to get the person on the scheme ready for the scheme itself.  This is where the flexibility is needed.</p>  <p>  Being nice about it, the schemes are a very cost-effective way of providing services.  Being truthful, they are a very cheap way to provide services and, without them, many communities will be left in very difficult situations.</p><p>The skills and work of the supervisor and the assistant supervisor are vital to the success of the schemes, particularly those that are especially challenging.  </p> <p> I was looking at Fianna F&aacute;il's motion.  The pension issue has not been addressed and has been ongoing since the early 2000s.  We had the Labour Court agreement in 2008, but the work of high-level forum did not progress.  When I look at the motion, I hope that, at the very least, the Government will immediately accept the first three points in the hope that by realising these three aspects, it would lead to a resolution of the fourth aspect because not doing so could have negative effects.  It could lead to industrial action and there is no community, rural or urban, that would not be affected such is the significance of the community employment scheme.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to and support this important motion.  I want the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, to correct the record of the House.  He clearly said supervisors and assistant supervisors were employed by private companies.  It should be made clear that they are not.  They work for charitable organisations and supporting groups.  As chairman of my local hurling club, I see at first hand the invaluable service provided every week.  I compliment the supervisor, Ms Marian Scully, and the assistant supervisor, Ms Michele Rohan, for the excellent work they do in keeping the scheme running so successfully.</p>  <p>  When I raised the issue of pensions for community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors during Leaders' Questions last year, the Taoiseach acknowledged the huge value of the scheme both in providing employment and training opportunities and important community services.  I pay a special tribute to the supervisors who are linchpins of scheme.  Many voluntary and sponsors groups are largely unaware of the full responsibilities being placed on them because of the efficiency of the supervisors in looking after all aspects of a scheme.  The Department does not seem to acknowledge the vast amount of work being undertaken by supervisors and how constantly changing procedures and requirements make this role extremely difficult.  This group of people do not have pensions or contracts of indefinite duration and have had no pay increases in the past ten years, despite Labour Court recommendations.  It is clear that community employment schemes would not be in operation were it not for the supervisors.  The supervisors of schemes run by certain local authorities, including Galway City Council, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have full pension rights.  </p>  <p>  I am calling on the Government to right a wrong.  The supervisors should be brought within the remit of the Department.  They should be entitled to a pension and given proper contracts.  I call on the House to support the motion and ask for the issue to be resolved as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It is a disgrace that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has not done them the courtesy of being present.  They face a long journey back to different parts of the country.  Wherever the Minister is, it is a disgrace that she and others are not here to do the people in question the courtesy of listening to the debate.  I thank Deputy Willie O'Dea and Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward this very important motion.</p>  <p>  I will highlight one aspect of the issue.  An individual wrote a letter to the Minister.  For more than 50 years he worked professionally and as a volunteer at local and national level in non-statutory organisations providing services and supports for people with special needs and their families.  Killarney community employment scheme was established more than 25 years ago, initially under F&Aacute;S but is currently administered by the Department.  This is an example of what is happening with every other scheme in all parts of County Kerry and the country.  Like most community employment schemes throughout the country, Killarney community employment scheme has been of great benefit to hundreds of participants, local communities and organisations.  Hundreds of participants have secured employment through community employment schemes.  Killarney community employment scheme has a very high success rate for progression to either further training or employment.  A recent audit showed a 100% progression rate in the previous 12 months.  The supervisor, Mr. Michael Brosnan, who is present is due to retire in June after more than 24 years of sterling service.  He will leave without a pension, the same as many more who are present, and with no entitlements other than the contributory State pension.  That is neither fair nor equitable and is morally unjustifiable.  although Michael has worked as a public servant for 24 years in all but name, he has been treated very differently from public servants employed by the State.  His contract of employment is with Killarney community employment scheme.  As such, he is deemed not to be a public servant, which is a disgrace.  It is wrong to see people being beggared.  They should receive that to which they are entitled and they should get it now.  </p>  <p>  I again thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward this important motion.</p></speech>

Community work schemes are at the bottom of the Government's list of priorities.  This is the Government that set up the anti-rural Turas Nua scheme run by a company that has acted like a vulture in local communities.  Communities that have willing workers who want to enter T&uacute;s, community employment and rural social schemes have had them grabbed from them.  After months of pleading, some small moves have been made in the past week, whereby Turas Nua can refer persons to T&uacute;s and community employment schemes, but many great workers who want to take part in the rural social scheme are still kept in the system where they are going nowhere.</p>  <p>  The motion is very much based on supervisors and assistant supervisors who, as we all know, are tireless workers day and night.  I call on the Government to abide by the Labour Court ruling and allow the great people who are present their basic human right - a right to a pension.  I am a member of Goleen and District Community Council which has benefited from the community employment scheme throughout west Cork.  I thank the supervisors for the great work they have done.  </p>  <p>  I also concur with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that it is a disgrace that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not here.  For the past six weeks the Rural Independent Group has been looking for a meeting on the issue and others that affect people working on community employment schemes, but up to now the Minister has refused to meet up us, which is a disgrace.  It is also a disgrace that she is not here to speak to the people who have come from all over the country.</p></speech>

I welcome each and every person who has come here and thank him or her for the great work he or she has done.  I welcome the people who have come from County Kerry.  I salute Mr. Michael Brosnan who worked for me and did great work on the schemes on which he worked.  I salute all of the people who have come from County Kerry.  They have made our parishes great through their great work during the years.  That is how communities have been served and we thank them very much for their work.  I am very disappointed with the Minister for not attending the debate.  I am disappointed by the entire Fine Gael Party.  There should have been more attention paid to the congregation that has come here.</p>  <p>  What is going to happen?  It does not look like Fine Gael or the Minister will listen to us, but I am asking Fianna F&aacute;il to flex its muscles.  It has a confidence and supply arrangement with the Government.  In the budget in October it must ensure the Government will provide pensions for the people in question who have done Trojan work for their communities.  If I did not pay Construction Industry Federation scheme stamp for employees to ensure they would receive a pension, I would go to jail, but that is what the Minister and the Government are getting away with.  It is time they woke up because they are asleep.</p></speech>

They look after people from the cradle to the grave, but where is the Minister?  T&aacute; s&iacute; as l&aacute;ithair, but they will not be as l&aacute;ithair when it comes to voting.  They know what to do - wait in the long grass, trip and knock her and tell her where to go.  Fine Gael was never interested in the little people and ordinary people.  It was only interested in landowners with the big daffodils along boreens, trees and white gates.  Those involved in community employment schemes have been excellent ambassadors.  I am chairman of a scheme in Newcastle, County Tipperary and praise our supervisor, Mr. Se&aacute;n Byrne.  Supervisors need to be social workers and understand legislation on employment, health and safety and God knows what else.  Things are fired at them, but they receive no support.  They are the ones on the front line for those who complain and when people have mental health issues.  They have to do everything and I salute them from the bottom of my heart.  We would not have a country without them.  </p>  <p>  I have been asking successive Governments for decades about this issue.  I have been involved since 1988.  I have asked for an audit of the value of community employment schemes, all of which would stop, including those run by county councils, the HSE, the Department of Justice and Equality and Text Alert.</p><p>They are all run, supported and led by CE participants.  I thank each and every one of them.  The progression from our scheme has been 100%.  I also thank the social welfare officials, the SOLAS officials and all the people involved.<br/><br/>To hell with Turas Nua; turas uafasach, an awful journey is what it is.  It is just big business again, friends of Fine Gael who got this contract.  This was brought in in England and we brought it in here.  <br/><br/>People should stand up for what they are proud of.  The Government should support these people, give them a pension and not make paupers of them.  It is a disgrace that the Minister is not here.</p></speech>

I welcome all those who have come from all corners of the country to be here tonight.  I thank them for the work they do in communities throughout the country.  In particular, I acknowledge those from Tipperary.  I acknowledge Teresa Hinchey from Tipperary town who is the national chairperson of the SIPTU supervisors.</p>  <p>  I confirm my support for the Private Members' motion before us tonight.  A pension is a basic employment entitlement for workers.  As someone who has been a trade unionist all my life and continues to be a member of F&oacute;rsa, one of the unions involved in representing the supervisors and assistant supervisors, I always believed that a Labour Court recommendation was the final place to go.  Those who got a favourable recommendation were then in a position to ensure that their claim was fulfilled.  It is an absolute shame that the Government would refuse to accept a Labour Court recommendation and particularly one that goes back ten years to 22 July 2008.</p>  <p>  At about 3 p.m. Deputies got an email from the head usher who informed us that the Public Gallery was oversubscribed for tonight.  That is a relatively rare occurrence here.  It is an indication of the depth and strength of feeling of supervisors and assistant supervisors on the issue.  It is an indication of the frustration and anger they feel on the issue.</p>  <p>  We had a presentation and a briefing in the AV Room last Wednesday at which there was an unprecedented attendance from Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is an indication of the respect Members have for these schemes, for the supervisors, the assistant supervisors and the participants in the schemes.  On a daily basis Members of this House meet scheme members, supervisors and assistant supervisors in their normal representations for communities and for individuals.  It is an indication of the huge community work done by the schemes and their participants.</p>  <p>  The schemes deal with every aspect of community life, including cr&egrave;ches, tidy towns, GAA, soccer, rugby and other sporting organisations, and day care for the elderly.  They are involved in every facet of community life in every village, town and indeed city in the country.  The attendance by Members of the House at last week's briefing is an indication of the respect the Members of the House have for the participants in the schemes and their supervisors.</p>  <p>  It would be disgraceful if the Government forced community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors into industrial action.  It would be unprecedented and the Government should pull back from that tonight.  If the Government refuses to ensure that pensions are payable to the supervisors and assistant supervisors, I, for one, will support the supervisors in taking industrial action if that is necessary.  If such industrial action were forced on supervisors and assistant supervisors, it would create chaos in communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to remember that the workload taken on by supervisors and assistant supervisors has been phenomenal over the years.  Many schemes have been amalgamated, and supervisors and assistant supervisors have taken on additional work.  They got no compensation for that work.  They have taken it on gladly and allowed the schemes to continue to operate.  Of course, there have been no pay increases for the past ten years.  About 1,250 supervisors and assistant supervisors are involved in the schemes.  They need to be dealt with reasonably and urgently, and must get what they are entitled to.</p>  <p>  In my view a pension is a basic employment right.  Many supervisors and assistant supervisors will retire over a period of time.  This year it is expected that anything up to 40 may retire with a similar figure last year.  In dealing with this pension issue, people who are due to retire in the next few years must also be dealt with properly.  We must remember that very many supervisors and assistant supervisors have retired in recent years with no pension except the State pension.  Those supervisors and assistant supervisors have worked in these schemes for well over 20 years - some of them for nearly 30 years.  One lady in Fethard, County Tipperary, who retired in recent times, was involved in the schemes for nearly 30 years.  She is recognised as somebody who put huge effort into the organisation of community games in south Tipperary.  People like that lady must also be dealt with under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Of course, the moneys involved in this are relatively small - &euro;6 million on an annual basis and about &euro;19.5 million on a once-off basis.  As Deputy Connolly said earlier, we are told that &euro;3.2 billion is available for the coming budget.  Fianna F&aacute;il would be well advised to remember that and to ensure that if this issue is not solved before the budget, it gets solved in the budget.  The money is there and Fianna F&aacute;il has the power to ensure it happens.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment, which is an insult to this House and to the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  There is not an ounce of goodwill in that amendment.  It shamefully kicks the can further down the road and refuses to grant pensions to the supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Now is the time for the Government to withdraw that shameful and disgraceful amendment.  Now is the time for the Government to ensure that supervisors and assistant supervisors get the pensions to which they are entitled, that people who due to retire in the next few years are dealt with properly and that those who retired in the recent past are also dealt with.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and thank all those supervisors and assistant supervisors in attendance for tonight's debate.</p><p>In many respects they are tired of being told they are great and how good a job they are doing in their communities.  They want action and they want movement on this issue.  For all of the other Opposition Deputies who have used this debate as a platform for attacking Fianna F&aacute;il, I would remind them this is a debate brought about by Fianna F&aacute;il tabling this Private Members' motion with a view to bringing about a solution to this issue.</p> <p> As has been said, time is not on the side of many of the supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Some 250 have already retired and some have gone to their eternal reward.  The fact the Government is clinging to the issue of it not being a party to the Labour Court recommendation does not stand up to scrutiny.  The State is ultimately underpinning these CE schemes and needs to find a way of giving effect to the Labour Court recommendation.  Governments always accept Labour Court recommendations in principle and the Government should do so in this matter as well.</p> <p> It is indisputable that there has been considerable procrastination.  This issue has been dragged out time and again.  If the Government is not going to do anything about this, it should be honest.  Instead of talking about another review or another forum, it should just say it and be honest with those involved.  Of course, wider implications have to be considered but these need to be teased out in a professional way.  Are there other categories of employees who are comparable and who have a similar Labour Court recommendation in their back pocket?  I certainly do not know of any.</p> <p> The Minister needs to meet the unions and find a way forward.  I am a firm believer that if the political will is there, any issue can be resolved.  This issue can certainly be resolved.  I want to reassure the House that Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to resolving this issue.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that it is the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who has been sent in because he is very good in his own role.  It is also unfortunate that the Ministers, Deputy Paschal Donohoe and Deputy Regina Doherty, are not here to greet the people in the Visitors Gallery, who have travelled from all around the country.  While I do not know who the people sitting in the Visitors Gallery vote for, I am sure as hell that some of them are Government supporters and they feel very let down tonight.  It is disgraceful and embarrassing.  One thing the Government should do is withdraw its amendment.</p>  <p>  I want to thank Michelle from Galway, who organised a bus and a car load, and who brought up 52 people today to show support for this motion.  When I talk about Michelle, I have to talk about the money she is on.  Michelle earns &euro;10.94 an hour after tax and she takes home &euro;426 a week.  One would think we are talking about people on seriously large wages but we are not.  If anyone thought Michelle's wages were bad, an assistant supervisor who was taken on a few weeks ago started on payscale 1 and he has to use family income support of &euro;93 per week to make up his income.  These are the people I am talking about, the people representing us with the Cope Foundation, Youth Work Ireland, Brothers of Charity, Ability West and in day care centres.  When there is a photograph to be taken after they have done the jobs on the GAA pitches and the playgrounds, and painted the day care centres, by God, some of the Minister of State's colleagues are front and centre to be there for the photograph.</p></speech>

Government members are there for the photo opportunities, there for the spin and there to take every opportunity for their own self-promotion.  When decent people have contributed to their communities, when they have sought to bring others with them and provide a centrality and a hub for the people they represent in their community centres, GAA clubs and the voluntary sector, they have been driven out at retirement stage because of contempt and because of a delay in the process through which they should get a pension and get their entitlements.</p>  <p>  Deputy D'Arcy's speech mentioned mobility.  In my constituency of Dublin West I have seen that the only mobility people are getting in regard to CE schemes is that they are being sent home, whether it is people retiring or people who are trying to participate in CE schemes not getting an extension.  It is an attempt by the Government to privatise this process.  It is wrong and it has to be changed.</p></speech>

I want to clearly put on record that the purpose of setting up limited companies by F&Aacute;S at the time was to shift responsibility for the disbursement and accountability of moneys on foot of a "Prime Time" investigation on RT&Eacute;, where mismanagement was found in the south east of the country.  That was cleverly construed in order to shift responsibility from the Government to the voluntary chairs of community boards and to deflect from the issue which I knew was going to come down the road, namely, providing a pension for those who look after the schemes on behalf of the voluntary boards.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, on average there are 30 people being managed in these schemes.  In the public service people would be paid a pension for looking after 30 staff.  The Minister should get the finger out and pay the pension.</p></speech>

People have travelled with great enthusiasm to hear the debate on what is an important and significant issue, as we saw with the turnout in the AV room last week.  I acknowledge Deputies Willie O'Dea and Mary Butler, who have pursued this and brought the debate to the House today.</p>  <p>  The community employment schemes are very important to so many communities around the country.  We see the fruits of their work in community amenities, sports facilities, Tidy Towns, childcare facilities and so many other ways.  They are delivering not just an income but dignity and a pathway towards work.  A huge part of this is the work of supervisors and assistant supervisors, who are very important in regard to the success of the schemes.</p>  <p>  In 2008 the Labour Court made the decision and we should not have to be here today pursuing it.  In the meantime, 250 people have retired without a pension and the remaining 1,250 cannot be left watching this drag on.  The proposed Government amendment suggests even more dragging on.  That should not continue.  A decision has already been made by the Labour Court and we need a clear road map to the pension for these very important people.</p>  <p>N&iacute; f&eacute;idir ruda&iacute; a fh&aacute;gaint mar at&aacute; siad.  T&aacute; an cinneadh d&eacute;anta cheana f&eacute;in ag an Labour Court le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas agus t&aacute; g&aacute; le br&uacute; ar aghaidh chun an pinsin a chur ar f&aacute;il i gcomhair na daoine seo at&aacute; ag obair chomh gn&iacute;omhach ar son na pobail, tr&iacute;d na t&iacute;re.

As has been pointed out on many occasions, there was a Labour Court recommendation in 2008.  I do not know how many times I have heard the Government stand behind Labour Court recommendations, in particular when the recommendation does not suit the other side of the argument.  On this occasion, the recommendation is for the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors but for ten years we have procrastinated on the issue.  It affects new supervisors coming into the scheme, those who have retired and those about to retire.  The recommendation clearly states it is desirable for all workers to have pensions, that this should be introduced for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors and that the scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S.  It is in black and white.  If one goes back as far as 2003, it has been Government policy for all employers to offer pensions.  We are facing a cliff edge on pension payments in years to come and if employers do not stand up to their responsibilities, it is going to get worse.  In this case, the State has to step up to its responsibility.</p>  <p>  The services that are provided have been spoken of by many speakers.  They are invaluable to the communities they serve.  There are people in the Visitors Gallery from all over the country who have come here in the hope that we will do right by them and that this motion will at last address an issue that has been with us for over ten years.  I plead with the Minister.  Now is the time for action.</p><p>The time for talking is over.  These people deserve what they are entitled to.  As a State and as a Parliament, we should have the dignity to respect it.</p></speech>

I want to clarify one point for the record.  The Government accepts the first four points of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion but deletes what comes after the fourth point.  That is how it appears to me and I hope that, having read it a couple of times, I am right about that.</p><p>Community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors are not employed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but are employees of companies in the community and voluntary sector.  The State is not responsible for funding arrangements for such employees, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  It is open to individual CE supervisors to provide for a pension by way of a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, which all employers are obliged to facilitate.  It is not possible, despite what has been said, to confine consideration of this matter to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors alone as these individuals are a small section of a very large community and voluntary sector.  It is clear that the provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector.  The potential cost of this would create a significant cost on the Exchequer.</p><p>The scoping exercise that was carried out in 2017 estimated that it would cost &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations.  An immediate <i>ex gratia</i>lump sum pension, as is being sought, could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million depending on the size of the community and voluntary sector.  Notwithstanding the existence of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation, therefore, the question of pension provision for employees of private organisations in the community and voluntary sector is one which is of relevance to the potentially very large number of individuals, far greater than only community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  Accordingly, as the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, stated, consideration of this issue cannot be confined to this cohort alone but must have regard to all community and voluntary sector employees and to the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p><p>A major pension reform is now being advanced which should go a long way to addressing Members' concerns with regard to this issue.  As Members will be aware, a major reform of future State, private and public service pension provision was announced in February this year when the Government launched a five-year roadmap for pensions reform.  To ensure the State pension system continues to play its role in providing a core level of adequate income, the Government intends to implement a number of reforms.  One of these reforms is focused on addressing Ireland's significant retirement savings gap, and a new retirement savings system will be introduced to encourage employees to provide for additional retirement income to supplement the State pension.  The Government will, by 2022, introduce a State-sponsored supplementary employment related retirement savings system in which workers will be automatically enrolled.  It is intended that employee savings in this scheme will be supported by employer and State contributions.  Under the system, workers will have the freedom to opt out, should they so choose, but experience in other countries indicates that, once automatically enrolled, workers tend to remain in the system.  It is hoped and anticipated that the same experience will be repeated in Ireland.</p><p>I think I was right to read my point of clarification into the record at the beginning of my contribution to the effect that the Government's amendment relates to the motion after the fourth point.

The Minister of State speaks of employers being able to opt out of future pension reforms, but on this occasion the Government has opted out.  It has opted out of giving pensions to its own employees, in spite of a recommendation of the independent Labour Court which we are all supposed to respect and adhere to.</p>  <p>  I took up this cause in November 2015 and I thank Deputies O'Dea and Butler for their support.  I was approached by a very good friend and was asked to meet his colleagues who were CE supervisors.  CE supervisors and assistant supervisors have a unique opportunity to redirect individuals' futures and to shape communities for the better, which they do every single day throughout the country.  Since that time, 35 or 40 have been leaving every year without a pension, left to the vagaries of our State pension service in spite of 25 or 30 years of service to AnCO, F&Aacute;S or whatever it may have been called.  They gave 25 or 30 years of service to their local communities and ensured better opportunities for individuals who have, ironically, gone on to get better pension provisions than those who gave them the opportunities in the first place.</p>  <p>  This Government needs to wake up to the potential of CE and to support it and embrace it.  It needs to finish its relationship with JobPath and put the money it put into JobPath into the men and women in the Visitors' Gallery and those others around the country who are watching.  It needs to wake up and support the Labour Court.  For a Government to ignore a recommendation of the Labour Court undermines our industrial relations machinery, because every time employers ignore the Labour Court, they will point to the Government ignoring this ruling.</p>  <p>  I spoke about my meeting in summer 2015.  The gentleman who asked me to that meeting was a supervisor of many years' standing and was in great health at that time.  He passed away very suddenly, months later, without a pension or support for his family and leaving behind a community bereft.  For his sake, I am going to keep up this fight and I am going to do it for the sake of each man and woman in the Gallery who have travelled from the places the length and breadth of the country.  I know at least one person who would have preferred to watch the Liverpool match tonight.  They won 5-2, by the way.  I ask the Minister of State for a little bit more Klopp and little less rubbish.  I ask that the Government deliver on its promise and on the Labour Court recommendation for the sake of these people.</p></speech>

The community employment schemes were introduced in this country at a time when unemployment levels were very high, particularly in rural Ireland.  By all accounts, the initiative has been very successful and has served its participants very well in securing employment when jobs were scarce and in helping the long-term unemployed to find a pathway back to work.  We cannot underestimate the effect secure employment can have on a person, from both a financial and mental health point of view.  I have spoken to people who were long-term unemployed for years and could see no light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the CE scheme that got them going again, giving them a jump start and leading them back to full-time and long-term employment.</p>  <p>  CE schemes would never have succeeded without the work of the supervisors and assistant supervisors.  They have a strong personal vocation for the work they do and they are passionate about helping the people of their communities.  Our motion calls for a satisfactory pathway to be found, based on the 2008 Labour Court recommendations, to address the pension issue for the 1,250 CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p>  <p>  Last week my colleagues, Deputies Butler and Calleary, organised a briefing in Leinster House on this issue.  It was clear at that meeting that there was strong cross-party support to find a solution to this unfair anomaly.  These supervisors are honest, hard-working people and they need the Government to do the right thing and set out a pathway to provide them with the pensions they are owed.</p><p>The Government cannot sit on its hands any longer.  With all due respect to him, the Minister of State is here tonight.  However, the two senior Ministers are not here, showing disrespect to the motion proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il tonight.  At least one of the Ministers responsible for this decision should be here tonight to listen.  People from all over the country are in the Gallery who expected at least one Minister to have the respect to come here and listen to what we have to say.</p> <p> The Government cannot hide behind red tape any more.  A recommendation of the Labour Court was made.  We cannot say these people are not employees of the State.  They need a way out.  They need a pension.  They have done their service all over the country, particularly in rural Ireland.  It is time for the Government to wake up and look after them and give them the pensions that they deserve.</p></speech>

A great number of people have travelled from the east, west, north and south tonight to make their case.  It does not show much respect to those people and shows very little regard for them.  They will have made maybe an 18 hour or a 20 hour round trip before they are back home again.  It is disappointing that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not here, which has been said already.  Another Minister I feel should be here is the Minister for Health.  I am sure my constituency is no different from any other in this country.  Every one of these people, supervisors and assistant supervisors, is aware of and looks after people.  We hear a lot of talk about suicide prevention.  In my own constituency, a great number are suffering from mental health issues and because of the work of these people - those in the AV room and in the Gallery tonight - they have a reason to live and a reason to get up in the morning.  They have a reason to go to work with the help and support of these people and their colleagues.</p></speech>

There was a Labour Court recommendation in 2008.  It is very easy for the Opposition - Sinn F&eacute;in - to ask why we did not pay at that time.  There was not enough money to pay the people on the schemes never mind the pensions of any other people.  This should be concluded and sorted out.  As Deputy Calleary said, there are people who have gone to their eternal reward who did great work.</p>  <p>  We should remember those in communities working on a voluntary basis and the communities that support these schemes and workers.  What is happening is a disgrace.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is a decent man and I have had many dealings with him.  However, it is an absolute disgrace to think there is not another person from Fine Gael in this House tonight on such an important issue.</p></speech>

The reality is that there was a Labour Court ruling in 2008.  I can understand that it was not introduced at the height of the downturn when the order of the day was cutting back.  For the last number of years the budget has increased to such a level that, in fact, this year the expenditure voted by this House will be as big as it was in 2008.  Therefore, it is time that this matter was dealt with.  The Government has been taking steps but they have been very slow.  A high-level forum was set up but it seems that there is a difficulty in just progressing this and coming to a conclusion.  In the meantime, supervisors and assistant supervisors are retiring without anything other than the State pension.</p>  <p>  The message is loud and clear.  The Government must deal with this issue now and must come to a conclusion, organise the meetings and make a decision.  That is what people are looking for.  Not to do so would be totally unfair.  As the Minister of State knows - I often wonder if Departments fully appreciate this - if the CE schemes were to stop tomorrow, what would happen to the services that have come to depend on these schemes?  In terms of training people back into employment who have been long-term unemployed and in terms of people's personal well-being, what would happen?  Without the supervisors and assistant supervisors, it is not possible to do anything.  The Government has the recommendation and it is time that it acted.  It is time the Government made a decision to award the pension that was basically awarded by the Labour Court.  It would be a very bad precedent if it did not honour a Labour Court recommendation.</p></speech>

I thank all the parties and individual Deputies who expressed their support for this motion.  We very much appreciate that.  There was one aspect of community employment that has not been mentioned tonight, namely, the sponsors.  I recognise the important role the sponsors play in the delivery of the community employment schemes.  I also want to reassure those who have raised issues about JobPath that we produced a Bill recently to enable people who were taken into JobPath to participate in CE schemes if such a vacancy would occur.  The Government has accepted the substance of that Bill, which I welcome.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I must say I am absolutely aghast at the Government's response.  This is in no way to be taken as a personal reflection on the Ministers of State, Deputies D'Arcy and Doyle, both of whom I hold in high regard.  My understanding of the Government's argument is that one of the reasons CE supervisors have not been provided with pensions is that what the Minister describes as the private companies that employ these people did not make provision for pensions for them.  What are these so-called private companies?  The local GAA club, the Tidy Towns committee, Meals on Wheels - when they were allocated a CE scheme, they were supposed to immediately set aside funding - but not any of the public funding because they were not enabled to do that.  They were supposed to hold more raffles, take up more collections, etc., and beg more people for money to provide a lump sum for a pension scheme for a CE supervisor.  </p></speech>

The Minister of State also said, in his supplied script from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, that while he accepts the figures of &euro;6 million per year plus &euro;19 million for the gratuity, this could lead on to enormous, potentially life-threatening sums of &euro;350 million or &euro;400 million.  It could potentially do that.  Whenever I hear a Minister seeking to defend the indefensible using the word "potentially", I know he has reached the bottom of the barrel.  The reality is that all the different organisations that make up the voluntary and community sector in this country are unique and distinct.  They all have their own particular characteristics.  This motion is about CE supervisors and assistant supervisors only, nobody else.  It does not constitute any precedent or create any inevitability that there would be knock-on claims of the magnitude the Government is trying to suggest.  Besides, I do not know of any other organisation in the voluntary and community sector that has a Labour Court recommendation stating that those involved in it are entitled to a pension.  They are unique.  This is confined to community employment supervisors alone.  Let us dispel all this nonsense about "potentially" and "knock-on effects", etc.</p>  <p>  I thank the people in the Public Gallery for their attendance and their patience.  This issue has meandered on now for ten years.  I really admire that they have continued to make their case assiduously in spite of all the setbacks, prevarications, delays and false promises that came to nothing.  They have persisted with their campaign because they believe so firmly in the justice of their cause.  We are all familiar with the Old Testament character, Job, who was supposed to be a man of immense patience.  In the patience stakes, the people representing CE supervisors would put Job to shame.</p>  <p>  Initially - I know this has been dropped now - when Deputy Joan Burton was Minister for Social Protection, they came up with this argument about F&Aacute;S not being represented at the Labour Court.  It was an argument that would make Oscar Pistorius's defence seem credible.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>It supplemented that with an argument that was even more incredible.</p> <p> The time for prevarication is over.  People have travelled here from the length and breadth of Ireland.  They have come to show all of us here in Leinster House and the country at large how strongly they believe in their case.  I am not talking about the Minister of State when I say this, but I believe that these people have been insulted by the Government tonight.  They have been insulted because the Ministers responsible, in particular the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, did not have the gumption to come in here and read out the miserable script that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection wrote as a defence for not providing them with their justified claim.  In the very last line of the supplied reply from the Minister of State, the final answer these people are getting as a reward for their efforts and their journey tonight, it is stated that any solution to this issue will require careful consideration.  This has been under consideration for ten years, and they are now being told that more consideration is required, which will lead to more prevarication and delay.</p> <p> I assure the people who have travelled here tonight and the country at large that Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to sorting out this issue.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State now to withdraw this amendment.  It is a despicable, disgraceful amendment and it should be withdrawn.  Fianna F&aacute;il's motion should be accepted, the necessary provision should be made and the people should be given a definitive timescale for the granting of their pensions, which they are entitled to as a result of a Labour Court recommendation and for which they have been waiting for ten years.</p></speech>
