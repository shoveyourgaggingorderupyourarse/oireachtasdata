The CRU has advised it has identified specific challenges to ensuring continued security of electricity supply.  These challenges include lower than expected availability of some existing power stations, anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned, expected growth in demand for electricity, including due to the growth of data centres, and the expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity over the coming years.</p>  <p>  In September, the CRU published an information note setting out the programme of actions being progressed to deliver secure supplies of electricity.  The actions set out in the CRU programme include increasing the availability of existing generators, developing of new generation capacity, including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022, extending the operational life of some existing generators, a new policy for the grid connection of data centres, and actions to enhance demand-side response, including large consumers reducing demand when the system margin is low.  In addition, my Department is developing a new national policy statement on security of electricity supply in support of the CRU work programme.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while there have been a number of system alerts on the electricity system in recent times, there has been no need to disconnect customers.  It is not possible to provide an absolute guarantee this would never happen, but I can assure the Deputy the CRU is working with the support of EirGrid and my Department to minimise the chances of this happening.</p></speech>

I will look at what options are available to me.  It is not disrespect to the Minister of State.  It is just on a point of principle.  These things are planned more or less six weeks in advance.</p><p>This morning we have news of Equinor pulling out from Moneypoint.  DP Energy said in the <i>Business Post</i>at the weekend that if offshore regulations were not in place, it would walk away from Ireland.  The Irish Wind Energy Association said the Government has a year to get things right.  More recently, we have an indication it will be very tight over this winter period.  The issue of the ESB was raised with the Minister of State yesterday in terms of 500 MW which were to be delivered and were not.  Why were they not delivered?  What was the penalty?  How much did Moneypoint make in the meantime because that was not delivered?  What lessons have been learned?</p></speech>

Providing emergency generation is just one of them, but more important than that was getting two other gas-fired power stations back online and ensuring everything recommended by the CRU was done.  I met with the CRU during the summer and its position was this was a serious situation, and if we carried out the recommended actions, the risk would be greatly mitigated.  The updated review statement in September reported a reduced risk of energy disconnection, but it is a risk we take seriously.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question about why 500 MW of power was not directly connected to EirGrid, I do not have a response, but I will get one from my office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400003#A01900"><p>Some of this was raised with the Minister of State yesterday by one of his Government colleagues.  I am hearing from competitors in the sector that the process was flawed and that the tender and rates that were submitted were never achievable.  It was almost like a loss leader, which we are familiar with in retail.  It was something in the region of &euro;48 per MW and was not delivered on.  The response from Government has been to fall back on Moneypoint and the same company, the ESB, essentially an arm of the State, is winning either way.  The management of that process and the failure to deliver seems fundamentally flawed.  I ask the question again: how much did Moneypoint make during the period when the ESB should have delivered alternative supply?</p></speech>

However, if it just a vague feeling, suggestion or rumour that something untoward happened, there is not much I can do to advance that.  Yesterday, Deputy Cowen presented and said he felt something that was not correct had been done and the energy supply crisis had somehow been orchestrated by the ESB.  I have invited him to come back to me and provide me with more information on that.</p> <p>If the Deputy has more information to back that up, I can help.  However, if it is just an unsubstantiated rumour, a feeling, or a sense, there is not much I can do to address it.</p> <p> What I can say is that there is an energy security review in progress.  It will directly look at and find the practical things we have to do to make sure our energy supply is reliable and dependable as we shift away from fossil fuels towards renewables, which is the right thing to do.  We are going to find every way we can ensure our security of energy.</p></speech>

It is disappointing and frustrating for Opposition spokespersons on climate, like me, not to have the Minister, Deputy Ryan, here to answer the questions.  I just want to put that on the record.</p>  <p>  It is indeed a momentous day and I very much welcome the opportunity the Minister, Deputy Ryan's office has given us to engage with him, but I do want to ask the Minister of State to provide an urgent timeline, broken down by sectors, for the implementation of the commitments in the national carbon budgets and climate action plan.

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which was passed in July 2021, requires the Government to adopt a series of economy-wide five-year carbon budgets, including sectoral targets for each relevant sector, on a rolling 15-year basis, starting with this year.</p>  <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, last week presented the first three successive five-year carbon budgets.  These carbon budgets will be presented to the Oireachtas and then they will be considered and approved by the Government.  Once approved, the carbon budget will then have effect from the date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by the Oireachtas.  The Government will then set sectoral emission ceilings, determining how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the budgets.</p>  <p>  The climate action plan 2021 is currently being finalised and will be published imminently.  The plan establishes indicative sectoral emissions arrangements for 2030 across the different sectors of the economy.  It also includes a suite of policies and measures to achieve our climate ambition.  As with the previous climate action plan, it will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve them, together with the assignment of clear lines of responsibility for delivery.</p>  <p>  The carbon budgets, therefore, have been advised by the CCAC.  They have to be brought before the D&aacute;il.  There are four months provided for in the Act to do that.  After that, the final sectoral emission ceilings are set.  The climate action plan will be coming out very soon now, and it will set a range of sectoral emissions ceilings, but not the final emissions ceilings.  They will have to be done after the carbon budgets have been laid down and approved by the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400004#B00700"><p>I am well aware of the provisions of the legislation.  The problem is the Government keeps missing deadlines on climate action.  We have seen long delays in the publication of the climate action plan, although it is welcome we are going to see it today.  However, it was promised last month.  It was promised initially that it would be aligned with the fiscal budget.  It is unfortunate it was not.  There have been long delays.  We are already well into the key decade in which we are to reduce our emissions by 51% by 2030.  We are now nearly at the end of 2021.  I know the Minister of State is more aware of this than any of us.</p>  <p>  I welcome, as does the Labour Party, the ambition of the targets that we are setting, but we are concerned about inconsistencies and apparent problems with meeting those targets.  We see today problems with how we will reach the targets on offshore wind.  That is a serious concern, given how much we will be depending on offshore wind to generate a sufficient quantity of renewable energy.  We are seeing inconsistency with methane target reductions.  We are seeing the Taoiseach committing to 30%, which is welcome, yet only 10% being signed up to in the action plan.  We are seeing concerns about a just transition, as houses are struggling to meet energy costs.</p></speech>

We are a decade late.  We had ten years of twiddling our thumbs.  We finally have an ambitious programme.  It will be much harder to achieve because of a lost ten years.  We are setting carbon budgets that go for 15 years: ten years and then five years in draft, so we have to get it right.  We have been doing nothing for ten years, so it is essential we do not finalise or set something in stone for 2030 that will not work.  Deputy Bacik says she is worried about us missing targets, and it is my concern too.  Now that we have set the laws and put the plans in place and so on, delivery is the next stage.</p>  <p>  The news that Equinor is pulling out is disappointing, and yet it is one of dozens of companies are involved in offshore wind.  I will certainly see what its concerns were.  However, one of the most important pieces of legislation coming to the D&aacute;il is Maritime Area Planning Bill.  We have done the other two major pieces of legislation: the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act and the Land Development Agency Act-----</p></speech>

There have been unconscionable delays.  I agree, of course, that the world is coming to this too late.  However, in our own recent past, we have missed so many deadlines.  To coin a phrase, climate action delayed is climate action denied.  We now know, with the increasingly urgent warnings about the scale and the speed at which biodiversity is being destroyed and at which the earth is heating up.  Therefore, there is no time to waste.  We will work constructively with the Minister of State from the Opposition to ensure we meet the targets.  However, it is valid to raise concerns about inconsistencies, missed deadlines and how we will achieve that just transition that is so crucial to bring people with us, who will be adversely affected in many cases in terms of jobs and their sectors.  We need to ensure people see the opportunities presented by the roll-out of renewables, with the increased biodiversity, and with things like re-forestation, which very much provide such opportunities.  It is important to emphasise the positive and the hope here as well as the seriousness and the challenges.</p></speech>

I really need all Opposition Deputies to go beyond encouraging the Government to set great strategies and targets and to support direct climate actions that are happening in their constituencies and areas.  Therefore, if in your area you are opposing a local wind farm or a local cycle lane, then you are not helping.  If you are organising people, stoking their fears and anxieties and saying, "This is something we do not want to do; I want to go back to business as usual; why do I have to change?", if you are encouraging people to take that mindset, it is really not helping at all, and neither is coming into the D&aacute;il afterwards and saying you want greater ambition and greater cuts in theory, but in practice you do not feel those things should apply to the people you directly represent.  I appeal to everybody in the D&aacute;il to work and to live the values they are espousing in the D&aacute;il when they go back to their constituency on a Monday and Friday and to put their money where their mouth is.</p></speech>

It commits Ireland to reach a legally binding target of net zero emissions, not later than 2050, and a cut of 51% by 2030 compared with 2018 levels.  Further to the enactment of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Climate Change Advisory Council has recently advised proposed economy-wide carbon budgets for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, and a provisional budget for 2031 to 2035.  This is the first step in developing carbon budgets which will in the coming months be allocated across sectors by way of sectoral emissions ceilings.  Sectoral emissions ceilings are the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions permitted in a sector of the economy during each five-year carbon budget.  The Oireachtas will be tasked with considering the budgets in accordance with section 9 of the Act.  Once the economy-wide carbon budgets have been approved, the Government will agree specific sectoral emissions ceilings.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department is currently finalising the climate action plan 2021, which will be published shortly.  This plan will set out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for all sectors.  It will also set out the practical measures we need to take to meet our climate targets for 2030 and to set us on a pathway to climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.  My Department has engaged proactively with public stakeholders and other Departments to deliver an ambitious, fair and achievable climate action plan.</p> <p>There will be different ambition levels for every sector, based on their respective starting points and the relative difficulty, cost, speed and benefits of reducing emissions.</p></speech>

A couple of years ago, the Government set out a climate action plan.  Much in today's climate action plan is similar.  We are a couple of years on and limited progress has been made on the targets.  We had 183 actions and we will have 200 today.  How does the Government bring the public with it on this journey and how is it funded?  My first supplementary question is about the funding.  It will cost &euro;125 billion.  The Government plans to raise &euro;9.5 billion in a carbon tax over the next decade.  I have a question about the Government's calculations of income from the carbon tax.  Has it factored in Fit for 55 and the loss of 70% or 80% to Europe with regard to roads, transport and buildings?  If it has, how will this be funded?</p></speech>

The Fit for 55 target was not in place until after that point.  These are valid questions about how we will get there, how we will pay for that, how we will bring people with us and the fact that climate action plans in the past did not amount to much.  The difference now is political will.  I have spent most of my life trying to achieve these things.  I am now in a position to help.  It is the same for many of my colleagues.  The Deputy will have noticed that everybody is up to speed on climate at this stage, including politicians of all parties, including the Opposition, and that there is a genuine sense that we want to achieve these things.  The money can be provided.  We saw during the pandemic that we can achieve what we want when that is our priority.  Things will change in the environment.  We set a target in 2020.  By 2025, the environment and the world will have changed and we will need to revise that.  We will get through through force of will.</p></speech>

Some of it is because the focus is not there and some is because the finance is not there.  A different approach was applied during the pandemic.  There was substantial state borrowing at a national and international level and states led on it.  An entirely different approach seems to be proposed here.  It is taxes and nudges and signals to the market.  It is fundamentally a dud.  Does the Minister of State think that we will soon move to national and international borrowing to fund this?  The second point is on participation and community engagement.  Will there be a commitment to establish a just transition commission in the climate action plan?</p></speech>

I do not know when that will be.  It is not all about money.  Having a lot of money to spend does not solve all your problems.  Sometimes the staff cannot be found or there are not the skills within the economy, or else you have the money to spend but people do not want the money to be spent or people with vested interests in an area do not want that change.  Not everything is about cash.  Money is essential and things cannot be done without it.  Green bonds will be issued at European level.  There is a debate over what is green and what the bonds can be issued for.  There has been a change of mindset at European level about economic realities, how much money should be borrowed, how the economy should run and how careful we should be with our expenditure.  There is a renewed perspective on the fiscal compact.  That will affect how money is spent and raised to deal with the green transition.</p></speech>

This will have a significant impact on the uptake of remote working across the country and an overall impact on climate emissions, especially in rural areas.</p></reply>

These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising weekly which could not have been foreseen until the building crews commenced work on the ground.  My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the contract.  The plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and set new baselines for milestones for 2021.  Work is underway to set new baselines for milestones for 2022 and beyond.</p>  <p>  NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the roll-out including increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month, bringing in additional NBI resources, earlier procurement of material used in the build stages and bringing in additional subcontractors.  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high-speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 30,000 premises available to order and pre-order across 11 counties.  It remains the ambition of the Government to roll out the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible.  My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP roll-out to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years six and seven of the current plan to an earlier date.  However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland building programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>  It is good that NBI is coming to Oireachtas committees and being directly cross-examined so that its testimony can line up with what we are saying.  It is essential that we make progress on the national broadband plan.  I work on it every day.</p></speech>

We are told that the primary reason for delays in the roll-out is Covid-19.  That just does not stack up.  There have been ongoing delays in engagement with local authorities, with CI&Eacute; and with Transport Infrastructure Ireland with regard to getting access to infrastructure.  That does not seem to be acknowledged by everyone.  Why is there a cover-up and failure to acknowledge that?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State answer a simple question?  The single biggest subcontractor that National Broadband Ireland has is Eir.  Eir has achieved its timelines last year, in 2021 and is expected to overachieve in 2022.  It had to deal with Covid.  How could Eir deliver when National Broadband Ireland cannot?</p></speech>

I have spoken with them directly about that.  NBI is a brand new company which is not directly comparable with Eir.  It is reliant on contractors with which it has shorter relationships.  Regarding TII, CI&Eacute;, and any difficulties, I have heard the Deputy's comments.  I am willing to investigate those and see what can be done to improve that situation.  Deputy Naughten knows that Covid caused real problems for installation in remote rural areas which would not have been the case if installing fibre in a city or town.  If all of the bed and breakfast accommodation is closed in a remote part of Cork or Donegal and contractors cannot be housed overnight, or if contractors from another country are being relied on who cannot travel because of international travel restrictions, problems arise, which are due to Covid.  It is not all due to Covid.  Some of the issues that I outlined are not covered by <i>force majeure</i>and will be subject to penalty clauses.</p></speech>

There are hotels, restaurants and guest houses across the country that would have thrown open their doors if they were approached about it.</p> <p>Some of them did, in relation to contractors.  Local authorities can find emergency accommodation and they have a relationship with many bed and breakfasts throughout the country, so that just does not wash.</p> <p> I will give the Minister of State a piece of advice.  Two years ago last month, a month before the contract for the national broadband plan was signed, the mobile phone and broadband task force was the agency that brought the local authorities and State and semi-State agencies around the table at which I sat as a Cabinet Minister and drove forward the bottlenecks in terms of access issues.

In the meantime, I meet regularly with National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  I attended its last board meeting and I spent a couple of hours with its chief executive on Tuesday in Limerick when installations were being done there.  I see the fibre being installed at the data centre end and at the home end.  I met with the chief executive of Eir earlier this week and I am offering to facilitate and make sure all stakeholders can work together and that there is a role for Government being between a number of parties who are competing or contracting with each other.  It is to ensure hurdles are overcome, regulatory changes can be made where needed and to act as an honest broker and as the major customer for making sure the project is delivered.  It is one of the most important projects in the history of Ireland.  It is essential people in rural Ireland have high-speed broadband so they can live their lives, and I will do everything I can to ensure the project is delivered correctly and on time.</p></speech>

In offshore wind, we have a lack of a framework and regulation.  In onshore wind, we have a lack of guidelines.  We have similar issues with microgeneration.

The programme for Government commits to expanding and incentivising microgeneration and to developing a solar strategy to ensure a greater share of our electricity is generated through solar PV.  The pending introduction of a clean export guarantee tariff will represent the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro and small generators in Ireland, including schools, farms, sports clubs and community buildings.  This will allow them to receive remuneration from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity exported to the grid, reflective of the market value of that electricity.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, published a consultation on a draft enabling framework on 1 October which outlined the details for the introduction of the clean export guarantee payment.  I understand a decision is expected to be published this month and a compensation regime expected to follow shortly afterwards.  My Department is also developing a microgeneration support scheme.  I expect a proposal on the supports to be offered for new installations under the scheme will be submitted to Government for approval later this year.</p>  <p>  Regarding accessibility, my Department has engaged extensively with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the proposed revisions to the exemptions for solar installations under the planning regulations, to reduce barriers to micro and small-scale rooftop solar PV and open up exemptions to new building types, including educational, community and apartment buildings.  It is expected the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will bring forward revised regulations early next year.</p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that ESB Networks will shortly begin a trial of an updated and simplified grid connection process for microgenerators in the 12-50 kW range.</p></speech>

It is a missed opportunity to date.  We see, and it was reported in the media during the week, the level of openness and the opportunities that exist to cover roof space with solar panels.  The benefit of that in offsetting the cost of electricity, heating water and running businesses is there for everybody to see.  It is a perfect example of where there is a willingness on behalf of communities.</p>  <p>  I would like to hear from the Minister of State what the hold-up is in this.  Is it intransigence at departmental level?  Is it lack of political will from the Minister of State's party or his colleagues in government?  What is the delay in realising this and when will the schemes be in place?  I hear lots of commitment around plans, assessments and consultations but when will it be delivered?</p></speech>

It was said that people should get money back if they generate excess renewable energy in their homes.  They should be paid by the electricity company.  It was said this was the case in other countries so why not in this country?  I wish this had gone live earlier.  We are waiting for the CRU to approve a scheme later this month and, after that approval is obtained, we will put in place a compensation scheme setting the amount of money a person will get per unit of power.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows the will is there to do it.  He will have seen there are solar panels on half the buildings in the North.  They are further north and have less solar that we have.  At the same latitiude, in Hamburg, for example, there are solar panels on every building.  There is no reason we should not have that in Ireland, other than the regulatory regime in place.  I am delighted it is changing and expect that, from the end of this year or the start of next, people will be compensated or paid for the solar they generate in their homes.</p></speech>

We need to see the detail of the proposals.  My colleague, Deputy Stanley, published legislation some years ago on this and we still have not seen the type of action we need.  Will the Minister of State confirm we will not be presented with a load of ridiculous exemptions that rule out buildings such as farm sheds, schools, public authority buildings or community centres on spurious criteria?</p>  <p>  There are criteria concerning farm lands to the effect that if over 50% of the farm is used for solar, they lose the definition as agricultural land.  The incentive is a perverse one and has a direct impact on the uptake.  Will those anomalies be addressed in the proposals coming forward?</p></speech>

We are working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to change those exemptions so they are taken away and you can put as much solar on your roof as you want.</p>  <p>  Will it be available to farms and schools?  Absolutely.  It is critical that people generate their own power because then they have a sense of ownership and of taking part in the green transition so it is not just that a foreign company comes in, invests money, generates electricity, takes it out of the area and the locals do not benefit.  To achieve buy-in for a green transition and to get a just transition, we need people directly involved.</p>  <p>  On the question of agricultural land being lost as a result of renewable energy generation, the idea of the transition for farming is to give farmers new sources of income and not to disadvantage them.  It is critical they are not found through some technicality to be down in money.  I will speak to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, about that.</p></speech>

The North-South interconnector is critical to improving the efficient operation of the all-island single electricity market and increasing security of electricity supply in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It will also help Ireland to move towards our target of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030.  A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions.  Most recently, the key finding from the international expert commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this, a further short review was commissioned to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid.  Terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April.  On 7 May, the Department initiated a procurement process to appoint an independent expert to undertake the review.  International consultants are now engaged on the review and their work is well advanced.  I understand the review will be completed by the end of the year.</p> <p> A judicial review decision from the High Court in Belfast upheld the planning permission for the project in Northern Ireland, which means that the project now has approval from the planning authorities in both jurisdictions, with all legal challenges dismissed.  EirGrid and ESB Networks, together with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, are continuing their on-the-ground engagements with landowners as well as the procurements necessary to support the delivery of this vitally important piece of infrastructure.</p></speech>

It is one of community engagement and consultation.  It is not being applied here in the way it should be.  It seems that the Government is determined to do this transition by megaphone diplomacy on the picket line or at the farm gate.  It is already a major problem and that will continue to be the case unless the Government changes tack.</p>  <p>  I got information from the Department yesterday that two leading Italian consultants in transmission grid infrastructure are now engaged on the review and that their work is well advanced.  Could the Minister of State indicate when the work will be concluded and when the report will be published?  At the same time, the CEO of EirGrid is telling us that the project is in execution mode.  How can those two positions be accurate if the ongoing review is to have any real impact or relevance?</p></speech>

By being able to move the electricity and balance the supply around the island, we can ensure better reliability and security of supply and also reduce prices on both sides so that we are not dumping load or shedding load in one part or the other.</p><p>The review will be finished by the end of the year.  In response to how that fits with EirGrid saying it is in execution mode, as I stated, this is a fully consented project, which has passed all legal hurdles.  We have agreed to make sure that the conclusions of the 2018 assessment are still valid, and that something has not changed.  We are carrying out an assessment and we will see what the report says.  I will not prejudge the report.  I do not know what is going to be in it.  The report will be done by the end of the year and we will act according to what is recommended in it.</p></speech>

From listening to the CEO, it appears to be proceeding full steam ahead.  That raises the question of the purpose of the desktop review that is being conducted by the two Italian consultants.  Is it not the case that it is a waste of taxpayers' money to fudge the issue for the Minister of State's colleagues in government and to provide them with some political cover when, in truth, it is a meaningless exercise and that this project is proceeding regardless?  We know that there has been further progress by local authorities in terms of the discharge of some of the planning conditions.  What level of community engagement has happened?  There is full resistance from the community to the project and I do not accept that it will be delivered.</p></speech>

It is important to put that on the record.  It was a political decision to allow EirGrid to proceed with the overhead option.  I am firmly of the view that the ongoing review is a waste of taxpayers' money because it is conducting an examination of something that nobody asked for.  What people asked for was a proper, full assessment with a cost-benefit analysis of an underground option, which has never happened.</p>  <p>  On what legal basis will EirGrid now be able to proceed onto the lands of people who have said they are not going to permit EirGrid to enter their lands?  What level of interaction and conflict is the Government willing to allow to occur between EirGrid and local communities before it instructs EirGrid to consult them constructively, properly and adequately?</p></speech>

It is essential out of a sense of fairness but also to make sure that it is accepted, that it proceeds and that the right answers are found for it.  This project could not be described as one that was rushed: it has been running for 15 years.  I do not think we can have it two ways: we cannot say that we need to make sure we do this right, listen to the public and have engagement and then say that we should not have this final review to make sure all the conclusions of the previous reports are valid and that this is a waste of taxpayers' money.  Either we are going to have the review and examine the project and listen to people or we are not.  We are not building the infrastructure until we see what is in the review and that the conclusions of the previous report are valid.  In terms of undergrounding cables, we had previous protests at underground cables.  It is not the final solution that makes everybody happy.  There are other concerns.  A different set of people will come forward and say that they are not happy with underground cables.</p></speech>

It will leave time for other Members.  I will take n&oacute;im&eacute;ad amh&aacute;in.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made the point in his earlier reply to me that part of the reason for the delays was because of tree trimming, ducting and so forth.  Eir achieved the targets to date, as the single biggest subcontractor to NBI.  It subcontracted out the work to the exact same subcontractors that are working for NBI, but the difference was that Eir was working on existing infrastructure that did not require consent or approval from Irish Rail, local authorities or Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  That is a significant problem.  Why did it take 21 months after the signing of the contract for guidelines to be issued to local authorities to streamline the authorisation process?</p>  <p>  We are told that there will be primary legislation to support those guidelines.  When will we see it?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400007#E01000"><p>As I have said, there are very different circumstances to the roll-out of the NBI fibre and the work being done by other organisations, such as the work Eir is doing to its own existing network.  NBI is a new company coming into the market.  It is trying to connect people who have previously not been connected.  It has a lot of new works to be done and it does not have an existing relationship with suppliers that other people have.  That does not mean that its excuses for delays are reasonable and it does not mean that it does not get penalty clauses applied for the delays that happen, but there is a learning from those.  My focus will be to ensure that the delivery is accelerated, which it has done.  If we look at other projects such as the vaccine roll-out, we will see there are periods of time where the ramp-up happens.  In this case where the surveys are carried out, initial work is carried out and lessons are learned before a much larger rate of roll-out is achieved at later points.</p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten specifically asked me when legislation will be brought in to support guidelines for how NBI works with local authorities.  Not all of that requires primary legislation or even legislation at all.  Some of it just requires sensible work practices and people being brought together.  As the Deputy indicated, the task force is going to be the answer to a lot of that.  I will come back to him on whether specific primary legislation is to be introduced to support this and give him some timelines around that.  </p> <p>If the Deputy wishes to make suggestions on how that should be done, I am absolutely happy to help him with that.</p> <p> In general, though, the project is getting back on track and the rate of delivery has greatly increased.  I expect that by next year, 140,000 homes will have been passed.  At the same time we are delivering this we are also ensuring we have a targeted campaign to encourage people to take up the service, as passing a house with fibre is not equivalent to the occupants signing up or agreeing to take the connection.</p></speech>

The Minister of State tells us today he expects 140,000 homes to be passed by the end of next year and the budget documentation we got a couple of weeks ago told us it would be 130,000, meaning only 10,000 more homes will be passed next year compared with this year.  Where is the ramping up of this process?</p>  <p>  I have a final point that the Minister of State can take up directly and I ask him to do so with the European Commission.  The definition of high-speed broadband at European Commission level is 30 Mbps and there is no family in this country that would believe 30 Mbps is high-speed broadband.  If the definition could be increased to 150 Mbps, 500 Mbps or 1 Gbps, it would stimulate private investment, as we have already seen.  It would also ensure NBI could intervene where the private sector will not.  That single step would help to address the overall deficit across the country.</p></speech>

Both I and Deputy Naughten know this was fought tooth and nail within the House by people seeking to obstruct it.</p>  <p>  I raise a serious element of Deputy Naughten's question, specifically the impact this will have on carbon emissions.  My experience has been that official Ireland dismissed the transformative impact on carbon emissions that this infrastructure could have.  It says something about our evaluation system in a world seeking to move to zero carbon emissions that our public evaluation of projects like this does not take into account the transformative impact on climate.</p></speech>

Ireland supported the hydrogen strategy, including the need to deploy green hydrogen in line with the programme for Government.  Ireland also supported the publication of the Council conclusions on a hydrogen market for Europe in October 2020.  In the development of these conclusions, Ireland strongly supported the need to focus on green hydrogen.  I expect further initiatives to assist in the development of green hydrogen to form part of the European Commission's proposals to reform the gas regulation and directive.  These proposals are expected later this year and I expect them to be discussed at the Council of energy ministers meeting in December.</p>  <p>  As part of the development of the climate action plan, my Department is working with relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders to examine the future role of green hydrogen and identify the policies and measures we need to ensure its deployment.  These policies and measures will need to ensure green hydrogen is developed in a cost-effective way while contributing to our commitment of net zero emissions by 2050.

It is good to hear there are initiatives under way both at European level and here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Any engagement I have with stakeholders on how we meet those targets for generation of electricity through renewables indicates green hydrogen is the energy of the future, although that may be a clich&eacute;d term.  There has been a doubt about whether we can develop the production of green hydrogen in a cost-effective way, as the cost seems to have been the biggest obstacle to development.  What I am seeking to explore is precisely what initiatives we can take in Ireland to ensure the roll-out of green hydrogen can be done in a way that is cost-effective.</p></speech>

Some countries have different views and some are going for blue hydrogen rather than green hydrogen.  Ireland is going for green hydrogen.  In Ireland we brought in three buses that run on hydrogen in order to get experience of what it is like to use them.  This is not a mature technology but I do not want it always to be a future technology.  We can achieve that by trying things out.  I know in west Dublin there is a trial to inject hydrogen into the normal gas network and see how it works.  It would be good if the existing gas infrastructure used to pump gas around the country could be reused for hydrogen.  It would give us greater energy security for the future and avoid problems where we are dependent on unstable foreign powers for our energy needs, which affects people directly suffering from energy poverty.</p></speech>

We all very much hope the same will happen with green hydrogen.  As the Minister of State has acknowledged, we certainly have an opportunity to build out renewables through green hydrogen, among other technologies.  This might even allow Ireland to become a green hydrogen exporter in place of being an importer of fossil fuels to generate the energy we need.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the ambitious target on the generation of electricity through renewables and I am very conscious of the vision increasingly being promoted around the world of electrifying everything as a way of ensuring we can move to a carbon-neutral or zero-carbon economy and society around the world.  The technologies are there or are being developed to decarbonise electricity and they could ensure that electricity powers all the human activities that have for far too long been powered by fossil fuels.</p></speech>

This week we saw legislation introduced which I am thankful was withdrawn that would have blocked the development of onshore wind.  Earlier in this Question Time we heard the dismissal of a review being carried out by the Government - effectively rubbishing it - and the backing of full resistance to the strengthening of our electricity grid.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot hope for green hydrogen and then block the instruments that would help to realise such an opportunity.</p></speech>

Will it be ideal for long-distance trucking or suitable for storage so it can help to balance electricity grids when the wind is low?  Will it be appropriate for the heating of homes and directly replacing gas in those homes?  </p> <p>There are different use cases which have to be tried out and which have to be economically sound.  Hydrogen will be appropriate in some circumstances and inappropriate in others.  It has challenges and it is a new technology but it has the potential to balance out the fundamental variability in renewable energy where the production is related to what the weather is at the time.  It also allows us to avoid the volatility and variability that comes with relying on the international price of fossil fuels, which can vary.  At one point a barrel of oil was $10 and then at another point it was $140.  It is hard for any country to deal with that and it has direct consequences for people.  Hydrogen allows us to move towards sustainability, self-reliance and a clean energy supply.</p></speech>

I am also responsible for ensuring the whole country has broadband and there are blackspots within urban areas as well.  There are over 624,000 premises in County Dublin, of which 15,000 are within the NBP intervention area.  Those premises will receive access to high speed broadband under the NBP.  Government investment in County Dublin in the NBP will be approximately &euro;48 million.  I am advised by NBI that, as of 27 October, almost 2,500 premises in County Dublin have been surveyed.  In Dublin, surveying is complete or under way in areas around Skerries, Balbriggan, north County Dublin, Fingal, Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Clonsilla, Ongar, Chapelizod, Ballyfermot, Cabra, Bluebell and Finglas.  Build work is currently under way in the Skerries area.  The NBI website provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register its interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.</p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment.  My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the contract.  This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021.  Work is under way to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond.</p><p>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP, providing high speed broadband to every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 27 October, 386 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.  BCPs are installed in County Dublin at Man O'War GAA club, Applewood Community Centre, Tyrrelstown Community Centre, Newbridge House and Farm, Glenasmole Community Centre, Stars of Erin GAA and Dublin Mountain Community Centre and Fingal Ravens GAA club.  Balscadden National School's BCP has been installed by NBI for educational access.</p></speech>

When people think about the NBP they often think about areas outside the capital but it is an increasing issue in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, where there are a number of areas when you talk about Stars of Erin GAA club in Glencullen but it is a part of the county that I know the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, know particularly well.  We are thinking of areas like Glencullen as well as Tibradden, Barnacullia, Ballybetagh and Kiltiernan, where there is a distinct lack of ability to access broadband and an increasing issue of general connectivity.  In the last 18 months we have seen the increased focus on people working and studying from home and remotely and it is becoming a huge issue for a growing population in my constituency who are prepared to go for a blended model or whatever but who simply do not have the strength and connectivity to maintain that.</p></speech>

They will be surveyed and assessed and if broadband is unavailable to them from any other supplier up to 30 MB then they can be included in NBI's roll-out.  SIRO is developing in the border area between the city and the rural area of the Dublin mountains.  SIRO is half-owned by the Irish State and it announced last week that it will deliver an additional 300,000 fibre connections and Cabinteely and Foxrock were included among those.  It is looking at areas at the edge of the city where it can install fibre broadband and that may be appropriate for some of the Deputy's constituents.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State's comments on SIRO and I appreciate the opportunities he presented for individual constituents.  He mentioned a range of areas in his initial reply, none of which are in my part of the county and that is the concern.  We need to make sure the surveys are progressed up the Dublin mountains into places such as Glencullen and Tibradden.  These are not just traditionally peri-urban or rural but they are also areas with growing housing developments.  Over 7,500 homes are about to be constructed in this area and the Minister of State knows that as well as anyone.  We need to ensure those houses do not drain the resources and that the people who are there already have full access to ensure they can take that blended working model and have the level of connectivity they need for work and study.</p></speech>

I have no desire to sound like my esteemed colleagues from County Kerry but a significant number of communities in north County Dublin were mentioned, which I am appreciative of.  I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the importance of the NBP and I recognise the work Deputy Bruton did on it.  It is fantastic to see so many community hubs being created across the country and not just in my constituency.  Deputy Richmond mentioned the importance of NBI in the context of working from home and the fact that there are people in urban communities who do not have access to high speed broadband.  I was pleased to hear what the Minister of State had to say about contacting his Department to have assessments completed.  I am concerned about slippage during Covid, which is not the subject of the question, but the Minister of State might touch on that in his remarks.</p></speech>

That is why more areas in north County Dublin were listed.  I will contact NBI if the Deputy has specific areas in the Dublin mountains that he thinks need to be surveyed and I will ask it to look at that.  On blackspots in urban areas, I have spoken to NBI about this and in some cases a commercial supplier next door needs to extend its fibre into that neighbouring premises.  Sometimes the best way to solve that blackspot is for NBI to pay whoever the local supplier is to do that.  I mentioned SIRO but Eir has an enormous fibre roll out plan as well and that has been greatly increased.  Virgin Media made an announcement yesterday as well so we have four large deployments and those will start to cover many of the areas that concern the Deputy.  We need to reach gigabit style broadband so that we can have multiple people in a home who are working and attending education at the same time.  That is such a common thing and the Deputy's constituents will have come to him about that problem.</p></speech>

That means we will have to find measures to reduce carbon emissions by an extra 5 million tonnes.  I would like to ask the Minister of State what impact that might have on other sectors if that sector itself cannot deliver and what new policy and investment tools will evolve to support the land use changes.</p></reply>

LULUCF includes activities associated with forestry, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government recognises that the next ten years are critical if we are to address the climate crisis.  It commits to a 51% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the decade and to achieving a climate neutral economy no later than 2050.</p> <p>These commitments have since been placed on a statutory footing through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  The climate Act provides for carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings to be put in place which will determine how each sector of the economy will contribute to the achievement of the carbon budgets, including the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector.</p> <p> Ireland is currently a net emitter of greenhouse gasses from the LULUCF sector to the order of 4.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, MTCO2e, per year.  All the LULUCF categories have potential to be managed as net sinks for greenhouse gasses.  It is important that we fully account for our actual emissions and removals from LULUCF in order to ensure policy is designed consistent with our objective to reach a climate neutral economy by 2050.</p> <p> The climate action plan, which will be published shortly, will set out a range of LULUCF policies and measures which we will need to continue, modify and enhance over the coming decades to realise our climate ambition.</p> <p> The programme for Government commitment for a national land use review is under way and it will consider options on how we might improve the management our land to meet not only the climate challenge but the biodiversity, water resource and socioeconomic challenges too.  The first phase, the evidential review, is currently under preparation.  This is overseen by a steering group co-chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

The climate council is advocating that we set a reduction which will mean we have to find 5 million MTCO2e from the land use sector.  I want to probe the Minister of State as to what new policy tools and investment measures will allow us do that because failure to meet this new target will fall back onto the other sectors.  The climate plan will be published today but the Minister of State might recognise that this is a shift in policy and requires a shift in policy measures to match.</p></speech>

It is something new, but it is not all negative.  The fact is that at present LULUCF is generating emissions in the wrong direction - it is 4.8 MTCO2e - but it is also true that it could be a sink.  That is not the case with other sectors of the economy.  This is a sector of society which can make progress on emissions beyond zero.  In other words, it can sequester carbon.  At the same time, we can pay farmers to do that.  Therefore, it can be a source of income.  It can be a source of opportunity.  It can be a way for agriculture to become sustainable, not only environmentally but financially.  We can pay farmers to sequester carbon and they have that opportunity which is not available in other sectors.  We will never have negative emissions from transport, we will never have negative emissions from industry but agriculture will go in that direction.</p></speech>

I suppose we need to see what will be those mechanisms for paying for making those land use changes.  It is important, if those mechanisms are not evolved today, that there is a clear statement that Government will be evolving mechanisms to pay for carbon management, which is effectively what this would be, of the land use.  I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that there will be payment to farmers on that front.</p></speech>

In the commentary and debate about what needs to be done for climate action, too often the position of agriculture and farming is taken as definitely to be a negative.  It is discussed in terms of pain, suffering and job losses when actually it is a time of opportunity.  It is a traditional sector with a long heritage.  It is difficult to have deep changes in such a sector, or lifestyle and culture.  Nobody in Ireland who wants to deprive farmers of income.  Everybody in Ireland is proud of their farming sector and of the food that we generate, wants to give farmers a sustainable income for the future, wants to pay them to be stewards of the land and wants to give them a way to continue to live on and from the land in a way that protects it and that we can be proud of for all of our citizens to enjoy in whatever way possible.</p></speech>

In total, over 272,000 premises in the intervention area across all counties have been surveyed, with over 115,000 premises under construction across 30 deployment areas.  Retail service providers are actively selling on the NBI network with over 30,000 premises available to order and pre-order in counties Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary and Wicklow.  This includes over 4,500 premises in County Cork.</p><p>NBI's fibre network architecture is centred around existing Open Eir exchanges and the State-owned metropolitan area networks.  This strategy is based on engineering design principles that allows every premises to be passed as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  The fibre network is divided up into 227 deployment areas, DA.  Each deployment area is centred around existing regional or local exchanges.  The areas referred to in the questions are covered by a number of different deployment areas and, therefore, the timescale for premises being passed by the new high speed broadband network will vary.</p><p>Surveys are complete in County Cork in the deployment areas of Carrigaline, Midleton, Youghal, Templemartin and Tallow.  Main build work is currently under way in Midleton and Youghal and is complete in Carrigaline.  I am advised that premises will be available for connection in the Midleton deployment area in the first half of 2022.  This covers the areas of North Esk, Carbeytown and Rougrane.  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for people living within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates at <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.</p><p>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP.  As of 27 October, 386 BCP sites have been installed by NBI.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>The high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.</p><p>BCPs are installed in County Cork at Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Courtbrack Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Ballindangan Community Centre, Clogagh Community Hall, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, The Old Schoolhouse, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Glash Community Centre, T.O. Park Labbamollaga and Sherkin Island Community Hall.</p><p>Templebrady National School, Ballycroneen National School, Clogagh National School, Educate Together Carrigaline, Ringaskiddy Lower Harbour National School, Scoil Naomh Fion&aacute;n na Reanna, Ballygarvan National School and Shanbally National School have been installed by NBI for educational access.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP.  In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the national broadband plan announced in December will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed and by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p></speech>

Every time I lodge the parliamentary question, as the Minister of State said, the numbers are changing and increasing.  I welcome that and the investment that the Minister of State detailed.</p>  <p>  The difficulty I have with the responses that we are getting is I am hearing a great deal about Midleton.  Meaning no disrespect to Midleton, it is in another constituency.  I wish them the best of luck.  I am hearing about many other towns and townlands and, unfortunately, very few in my constituency of Cork North-Central until the Minister of State mentioned Rougrane and the Caherlag-Carbeytown area, which is a rural and isolated-enough area, and which I welcome.</p>  <p>  However, we in Cork North-Central - I note Deputy Gould's question is taken with mine - would be seriously concerned about the lack of roll-out in our own immediate area.</p>  <p>  I would add that the delays in the broadband plan roll-out have been well document.  I note the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was before the Committee of Public Accounts recently.  We are all aware that the plan is estimated to be 50% behind where it is supposed to be and that is obviously concerning.</p></speech>

The deployment areas, each of which include approximately 4,000 customers, do not match the constituencies.  Therefore, we have three different deployment areas covering Cork North-Central.  Large parts of those deployment areas are not in the Deputy's constituency and that is why I am mentioning areas that are outside of where the Deputy is.</p>  <p>  Clogheen Mixed National School is located at Carrigrohane, Gaelscoil U&iacute; Drisceoil, Lower Glanmire National School, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhiorainn in Berrings, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Mhuire, Rathpeacon, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta P&aacute;draig Naofa in Whitechurch, Scoil Chro&iacute; &Iacute;osa and Vicarstown Mixed National School are all prioritised for roll-out over the next 15 months.</p> <p>If there are areas that the Deputy thinks a broadband connection would be suitable, I can ask that it be looked into.  Eir and SIRO are connecting many more homes in the Deputy's constituency and he should speak to them too.  If there are specific homes which cannot get a decent broadband service, he should contact the Department and I will try to help.</p></speech>

I welcome the increase in the number of BCP sites installed from 302 the last time I asked a parliamentary question on the issue to 386 now.  There is no doubt progress is being made but it is slower than we would hope.  People are demanding this service.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicated that surveying in Cork was complete, which is great.  With regard to all the big contracts that are out for tender, the Minister has penalties and other powers at his disposal.  I am not asking if these will be used but for specific information on the powers available to the Minister under the contract in the event of tardiness or further delays in the roll-out.</p></speech>

I did so because I did not want the idea to form that I would overlook issues and we would just try to work together.  A range of penalty clauses apply for being late with the delivery of installation.  Penalty clauses also apply if the service is unreliable.  If the service is dropping, for example, specific euro amounts are charged.  For the first two years of the contract, a grace period applies during which the penalty clauses for late installation are not applied.  That period runs out in February 2022, after which the company will be charged if anything is late.</p>  <p>  National Broadband Ireland is only paid for what it does.  Each time it connects an entire deployment area, which is 4,000 people, it receives a large sum of money.  However, it is not paid if it is not connecting.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the Minister of State's response to earlier questions.</p></reply>

On bringing people with us, I am not deluded and I do not think the Government and the D&aacute;il can just impose things on people.  We rule with the consent of the public and we cannot make changes that people do not feel are fair and reasonable.  People will make huge changes, as we saw in the pandemic.  They can alter their lives if they understand that it is essential to do so to protect each other or for society as a whole.  I am heartened that those changes are possible.  If people could make such sudden and dramatic changes to their lifestyle to protect the elder generations, I believe they will do the same to protect their grandchildren and their children in the future.  They can make those changes, even if the immediate risk and the number of people dying is not going to be reported on tomorrow's news.  People know this stuff is happening and change is necessary but we must bring them with us.</p><p>I am finalising an ambitious set of climate actions, through a new climate action plan, that will position us to meet the targets the Oireachtas has now set through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, namely, to have a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a climate-neutral economy not later than 2050.  Under the new legislation, the Department will update the climate action plan every year so that our actions keep step with the trajectory required to achieve our targets.  In addition, a national long-term climate action strategy will be prepared at least every five years.</p><p>Progress reports on the implementation of the existing climate action plan are prepared on a quarterly basis by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The reports are considered and approved by government and published online to ensure accountability and transparency.  Implementation rates under the climate action plan 2019 have fluctuated on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  The overall implementation rate to the end of quarter 4 2020 was 78%, with 391 measures completed out of a total of 500 measures due.  The reports can be found on the climate action section of <i>Gov.ie</i>.  Challenges to implementation have been highlighted throughout the quarterly progress reports.  These include issues of capacity, resourcing and expertise across government, and the complexity of work and extensive stakeholder consultation often required for meaningful climate action.</p></speech>

Will he comment on the flexibility built into the unpublished carbon action plan to acknowledge the technological advances that may be presented in the coming years in terms of mitigating measures across certain Departments?  What level of flexibility will be contained in the climate action plan?  I am thinking of transport, specifically aviation and shipping.  Given our island status, these two critical sectors for our economy are extremely difficult to deal with in the context of significant carbon reductions and, indeed, carbon eradication by 2050.  There is a potential slate of information that could be made available to the House.</p></speech>

We cannot count on technologies that have not been delivered yet or have only worked in a test phase.  Our experience is that huge technological advances are possible.  What we cannot do is choose not do anything and wait for a technological miracle to deliver things in the future, so we will have business as usual.  We must change the way we do things.  Sometimes the answer is not technology, for example, a flying car, but something else, such as working from home.  Aviation and shipping clearly present a real challenge.  This is being looked at with various possible outcomes, whether biomethane, hydrogen or something else that will power this transport in the future.  We have to find an answer.  That will be of direct relevance and interest to many people who work and live in Deputy Farrell's constituency.  We are an island and we are not abandoning aviation.  We have to find a solution and a way of doing this cleanly.</p></speech>

It is a crucial part of our economy and society, given our diaspora across the world.  I am heartened by the Minister of State's response to an earlier question on the development of hydrogen.  I know there are options in that regard for that sector.  My question was related to the adaptation of the plan and its recognition that, as technology emerges, it will be sufficiently flexible to be able to adapt to those changes rather than, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, the assumption that technology is the solution when changing the way we do business as a society is the answer.</p></speech>

This week, while COP26 is taking place, we are issuing licences for mining exploration in Leitrim.  These licences are for gold, of all things, which is very much a luxury metal that is not necessary for the advancement of mankind.  Most people in my constituency are alarmed and concerned about this.  In the context of the climate action plan and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, will the Government abandon its policy of encouraging mining companies to come to Ireland to exploit minerals in this way, which involves very high use of carbon and very poor use of resources in the context of the country trying to move to low carbon?</p></speech>

It can but the target does not change.  We have to reach the 51% target.  Every quarter we reassess the climate action plan's progress, as I said, and every year we do a new climate action plan.  We are changing the plan all the time, with regard to the implementation steps, but not the goal.</p>  <p>  On mining, we are trying to move from a society based on taking things out of the ground, building things with them and then disposing of those things afterwards towards a circular economy.  However, we are not there yet.  We are dependent on mobile phones, laptops and other such products, many of which use rare earth metals.</p> <p>We need to ensure those valuable products are not being disposed of and we can retain the rare metals they use without having to extract them again.  I understand the Deputy is referring to prospecting licences rather than extraction licences, which are a very different thing.</p></speech>

The Deputy's asked if we can do more on electricity and, in that way, avoid changing other sectors.  The electricity sector has high ambitions.  It is looking at achieving 80% renewables by 2030.  I hope I am not giving away anything from the climate action plan.  Electricity will take an enormous share of the burden and other sectors will take a lighter share as a result.</p><p>When we think about cutting emissions it is easy to think about the energy and electricity sector and forget about the production of concrete and cement and other areas that produce CO<sub>2</sub>in a quieter way and go unnoticed.

I am taking questions this morning for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who must attend Cabinet.  As Members know, the climate action plan is being launched later today.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Like many other sectors of the economy, road haulage is facing the dual challenges of rising costs and labour shortages.  The global oil price has increased substantially in 2021.  However, the Minister for Finance has retained the diesel rebate scheme for the present.  The scheme, first introduced in 2013, allows haulage and bus operators licensed by the Department to apply to Revenue for a rebate on tax paid on diesel purchased in the State.  The rebate rate is based on the average purchase price of diesel provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The rebate amount is capped at 7.5 cent per litre.  VAT-registered businesses are also eligible to claim a refund on the VAT paid for diesel used in the course of business activities.</p>  <p>  In relation to the shortage of heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers, the national logistics and supply chain skills group, chaired by the Department, has been engaged on this issue since it was established in 2019.  All relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the haulage and logistics sector, are represented on the group.  I have asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations.  In the meantime, I have been working with colleagues across government to help address the current difficulties.  Following engagement with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, and discussions between the Department of Transport and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU is being removed.  In tandem with this, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is pursuing HGV driver licence exchange agreements with a number of non-EU countries to allow drivers from these countries to apply for Irish employment permits.  I have had a range of meetings with the haulage and logistics sector to discuss the issue and get their perspective on the key actions that will help ease to the current shortage of drivers.  I have also written to the education and training boards in relation to the matter.</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out three of the five priority questions are on this issue, which highlights its importance.  We are in the run-up to Christmas and there considerable focus on it, as there needs to be.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to a number of issues and I will reflect on some of them from the perspective of the sector.  On the fuel rebate, the sector is saying the scheme needs to be reviewed and expanded and must support the transition to alternative fuels.  The sector points to the fact that gas is currently more expensive than diesel and is not included in the scheme.  Fuel accounts for one third of operators' costs.  The sector points to the impact of the carbon tax and the fact it is not recirculated into the sector.  I ask the Minister of State to respond on those points, after which I will discuss HGVs and workers.</p></speech>

The increase this year, which related to the already planned carbon tax, amounts to between 2 cent and 2.5 cent per litre of petrol and diesel.  Revenue from any increase in carbon tax is ring-fenced and goes directly towards alleviating negative effects for those who cannot afford increases in the price of energy.  I understand the pressures on the sector.  I have been engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, FTAI, as well as other haulage companies throughout the country to highlight the needs of the sector and to ensure we have a robust supply and do all we can on a cross-government level to address the driver shortage issue.  This is not just an Irish issue, as the Deputy knows, but a European and global problem.</p></speech>

On fuel costs, the Government needs to act where it has an opportunity or is in a position to do so.  There are such opportunities with the rebate, the carbon tax and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I will now focus on the issue of workers.  I am hearing a number of things from the sector.  The issue is one of bureaucracy.  According to the sector, the Department with responsibility for business is struggling to cope with the process and there are hold-ups with the RSA in terms of the licence checking process.  The Minister of State mentioned guidance to the sector.  The expert skills group was to have delivered a report in September.  It is now November.  Guidance for the sector has not been provided.  I am trying to be constructive and point to ways to address this problem that are in the Government's gift.  I am conscious that not everything is within its gift but there are measures that could be taken to help alleviate the crisis.</p></speech>

It is important to note, however, that a great deal of work is under way in the meantime.  My engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on the quotas for work permits is one example.  On the RSA, it is the authority's role to engage in relation to securing licence exchange agreements with other countries.</p> <p>This is a long process and in such circumstances both countries have to ensure they meet the standards.  We are focusing on a number of countries in response to what has come from the sector itself though my engagement with representatives of the road haulage and logistics sectors.  The Road Safety Authority is focusing on Argentina, Moldova, North Macedonia and Ukraine in respect of those licensing exchange agreements.  For example, I met with the ambassador of Argentina to see what we can do to try to progress these exchange agreements and make sure we are not coming up with challenges unnecessarily.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is assisting the Department of Transport with that diplomatic engagement.</p></speech>

The scope of the project is terminated 2 km or 2.5 km before Kilcock.  I went to the Department yesterday and brought the Minister, Deputy Ryan, a map so he would have it today because a picture speaks a thousand words, but he is not here.  Essentially, this question is about him seeking to engage with the NTA to expand the scope of this project to take in the town of Kilcock, which has a population of approximately 8,000.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400013#L00400"><p>I received the Deputy's map so we got that correspondence.  I will read out the reply on behalf of the Minister.  DART+ West is the most advanced of the infrastructure projects that make up the overall DART+ programme.  As outlined in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, DART+ will extend or enhance the current DART system west to Maynooth and Celbridge-Hazelhatch, south to Greystones and north to Drogheda.  The transport strategy sets the overall framework within which the programme is being developed, including its overall geographic scope.  However, it is not to say that future extensions to the new network, once DART+ has been deployed, cannot be considered.  In fact, as I understand it, the review of the transport strategy, which is under way and will be subject to public consultation this month, will make proposals in that regard.  I have no doubt the Deputy will make her views known during the consultation period.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there is a view locally that the current DART+ West project should be extended to include Kilcock at the new depot on the line.  That line lies west of Maynooth station on the way to Kilcock.  I am informed that to extend the twin tracking and electrification beyond the depot into Kilcock faces a number of technical constraints, such as clearance issues at existing bridge structures; turnback facilities and the layout of the existing Kilcock station; and insufficient width on the approach to Kilcock to accommodate double tracking.  These issues and others would require detailed consideration and engineering assessment.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned, DART+ West is currently the most advanced of all the DART+ infrastructure projects and the current focus is on ensuring the existing project is brought forward into the planning system and moves into construction as soon as possible.  DART+ West will transform rail services in north Kildare, west Dublin and the broader region thanks to the new depot.  I assure the Deputy that future extensions can be considered at a later date.</p></speech>

The track was doubled between Clonsilla and Maynooth some years ago after extensive engagement with community groups.  Kilcock was left out at that stage.  The town's residents will rely on the Sligo line for commuter services, while the eight-shed depot that is being constructed is in Kilcock.  It is across the road from a new housing estate on the Meath side of the town.</p>  <p>  There is complete unanimity across the political spectrum on delivery of this project.  People just cannot understand why its scope did not go further.  The very same points were made about not being able to fit a double track when we argued for it all those years ago.  It was fitted and is a very successful service.  Some time ago, I received a reply that informed me it was not surveyed in detail.  I question the information the Minister of State is being given on this matter.  We get the population but we do not get the services to go with it, which is the worst of all worlds.</p></speech>

The two primary reasons we simply cannot extend DART+ to Kilcock at this point are linked to the way land use and transport planning works in the greater Dublin area and engineering.  Uniquely in Ireland, there is a statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area and it has set the geographic scope of the DART+ programme.  That scope is then reflected in all land use strategies for the area.</p>  <p>  The strategy states that the DART will be extended to Maynooth, which is the planning context for the overall DART+ West project that will be considered by the planning authorities.  The scope can be changed but that must happen through the review of the transport strategy, which will reconfirm the delivery of DART+ as it stands, but will also state that future extensions beyond the current scope be considered in the future as separate projects.  We could extend DART+ West to Kilcock but it first needs to be reflected in the transport strategy.  It will then be considered as a stand-alone project into the future.</p></speech>

She will hear the M4 and the M7 repeatedly referenced, yet DART+ is not going beyond Hazelhatch on the Kildare line and it is not going to Kilcock on the Maynooth and Sligo lines.</p>  <p>  We know we are in a climate emergency and have to get people onto public transport.  It just does not make sense not to go 2 km further to an area with 8,000 people who are in the commuter belt and are travelling to Maynooth in their cars, parking there to get the train, blocking the train station and adding to congestion there.  Kilcock residents can see the depot from the houses across the road where a station could be provided.  Even if we cannot go as far as providing a station, all sorts of other facilities, such as sidings, could be used.  This is a very disappointing response.</p></speech>

As I said, I share her ambition on this matter, but the fact is it would delay the process.  DART+ West is the most advanced of the four infrastructure projects, with two rounds of non-statutory public consultations already completed.  Its next step, subject to Government approval, is to enter the statutory planning system.  As I said, this matter can be reflected in the revised transport strategy and it will then be considered as a stand-alone project into the future.  I will relay the Deputy's concerns to the Minister in that context.</p></speech>

The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where appropriate.  The NTA is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of antisocial behaviour.  My Department has engaged regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies on the issue of antisocial behaviour and in ensuring the safety of passengers and staff.  In their responses, all three companies stressed their strong and close working relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on these issues.  Furthermore, while I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff, the allocation of all Garda resources, including the manner in which Garda personnel are deployed, is solely a decision for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.</p>  <p>  On the action being taken to ensure the safety of transport workers and passengers, my Department has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that a joint Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann-Garda focus on public order and antisocial behaviour has been in place since May of this year.  A particular focus has been on the greater Dublin area with emphasis on the DART, the northern line and the Heuston to Portlaoise services.  A new security monitoring centre, which has been in operation since January 2021, has played a key role in targeting high-risk locations with a particular focus on groups of youths with bicycles using the network to avoid Garda road checkpoints.  For the months of June and July, 2,852 fixed penalty notices were issued during the joint operations for fare evasion, with 4,348 issued in the year to date.</p> <p>There has been a noticeable increase in compliance and a corresponding reduction in antisocial behaviour.  A new text alert service has also been introduced to enable customers to discreetly report antisocial behaviour incidents and allow security personnel or garda&iacute; to respond.</p></speech>

This is an issue that has been in the news in recent days and weeks.  We have all heard first-hand the experiences of both passengers and workers.  It is of serious concern for a number of reasons, not least the impact it has on the individuals affected.  I know from speaking to workers and their representatives, not just in the transport unions but elsewhere as well, that they are not calling for transport police, like the airport police or the transport police they have in other places.  As I understand it, they are calling for a division of the Garda focused on public transport, the same way we have the roads policing unit, the drugs squad or whatever else it may be.  Is that something the Department has considered or will consider?  The Minister of State has some experience in the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

There is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres and access to good-quality CCTV can assist the Garda when investigating serious incidents.  For example, an interagency operation was established involving garda&iacute; in Dublin and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann targeting incidents of graffiti and criminal damage to train carriages on the north Dublin train line.  As part of this operation, garda&iacute; conducted patrols of rail lines in an effort to target groups involved in this activity.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's annual spend on security has risen from &euro;3.7 million in 2016 to an expected spend this year of &euro;5.2 million, with up to 20 security teams operating daily.  It is a case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working with our public transport operators.</p></speech>

I note that there are significant commitments in the programme for Government to the resourcing of the Garda to deal with antisocial behaviour, among other things.  Another commitment in the programme for Government is the establishment of a national public transport forum involving all stakeholders and the commencement of section 17 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  That forum would be helpful in dealing with this issue, as well as a range of other issues and we are missing it.  When are we going to see it and when will it be populated?</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, while standing in for the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, spoke to the Garda Commissioner and senior garda&iacute; about the issue of antisocial behaviour generally and a new operation will be launched very shortly.  As the Deputy said, we have secured funding in the budget for 800 new garda&iacute; next year, which will put us on track to meet and beat our target of having a 15,000-strong Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na force.</p></speech>

My response to Deputy O'Rourke's question earlier outlines the position in relation to the driver shortage and increasing fuel costs for the haulage sector.  I will focus in this response on the overall position as regards the road haulage sector and supply chain issues.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to publish and implement a ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland, which will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  A public consultation was held earlier this year and the responses to that consultation are being examined.  Other forthcoming Government policies and initiatives such as the climate action plan and the new road safety strategy will be relevant in the context of the development of this new road haulage strategy.  The intention is to carry out a further consultation on the draft strategy when these initiatives have been published.</p>  <p>  Like many other sectors, road haulage is facing the dual challenges of rising costs and labour shortages.  The latest consumer price index release for September 2021 shows that prices, on average, were 3.7% higher in September 2021 year on year.  The highest increases were in transport and fuel costs.  In relation to the shortage of HGV drivers, the national logistics and supply chain skills group, chaired by my Department, has been taking action since it was established in 2019 on future skills needs across all areas of the supply chain.  All relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the haulage and logistics sector, are represented on this group.  I have asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I have been working with colleagues across government to help address the current difficulties.  For example, I have engaged with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English.  Following those discussions, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU is being removed.  The Road Safety Authority is also pursuing HGV driver licence exchange agreements with non-EU countries.  I have held a range of meetings with the sector, as well as writing to Education and Training Boards Ireland to offer support for the many HGV driver courses offered by the ETBs right across the country.</p></speech>

This programme was costed by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, at &euro;8 billion.  The SEAI is costing it at &euro;35 billion over 35 years, as per its website, under deep retrofit.  A house will burn in one year what a truck will burn in one week.  I ask the Minister of State to do the obvious thing and cut emissions.  There are 5 million km to be covered daily by trucks in order to keep Ireland moving.  How much could be achieved if the national fleet was upgraded to Euro 6 engines?  Why is 45% of our national fleet over ten years old?  There is a lack of investment or incentives for hauliers to upgrade their trucks.  The value of older trucks, such as Euro 2, Euro 3, Euro 4 or Euro 5 vehicles, went down in the UK and we bought them.  A fleet of Euro 6 engine trucks would reduce emissions at a cost of only &euro;108 million and the Government is spending &euro;8 billion on houses, when fuel for a house for a year is fuel for a week for a truck.</p></speech>

We are going to need emissions reductions across every single sector and, as we are all aware and I am acutely aware from being in the Department, transport faces one of the bigger challenges in this area.  We need to ensure that we can support the sectors that need the support most.  We need a robust supply chain and that is why I am engaging with the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland and the logistics sector to ensure we can have a robust system.  I spoke earlier about the diesel rebate scheme.  That is just one part of it, as part of our ten-year haulage strategy.  We need to be looking at where the sector will be over the next ten years.  Now, with Covid and Brexit, this is a good opportunity to ensure we have a fit-for-purpose sector that is not only responding the climate crisis but also ensures we have a robust supply chain and can keep foods and products on our shelves.</p></speech>

It does 1.9 billion km per year, as per CSO figures.  This equates to over 5 million km travelled per day and over 1.5 million l of fuel consumed per day.</p>  <p>This works out at almost 500 l per truck per week, which supports the statement that a truck burns in one week what a house will burn in one year.  There are 10,800 trucks in this country that are more than ten years old.  To upgrade these vehicles to a Euro 6 engine would cost only &euro;108 million, not &euro;8 billion.  Fuel rebates could be tied in as an incentive.</p> <p> Last year, 330,000 new trucks were sold in Europe.  That confirms that the only way of moving our goods in Europe is by truck.  Let us incentivise the use of trucks, bring in Euro 6 engines and reduce our emissions.  It is common sense.</p></speech>

We introduced a grant scheme for alternatively fuelled HGVs and the uptake was extraordinary, which shows there is demand for this, although we need to do more.  Technological advances will be required for the sector.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point that we need HGV drivers.  We can consider other matters through the ten-year haulage strategy regarding that final mile of delivery and what we can do to help reduce emissions.  This is why we have opened the public consultation.  We have had positive engagement from the sector but we need it to help the Government to help drivers to ensure there is a fit-for-purpose sector whereby we can reduce emissions but in a way-----</p></speech>

I ask this in the context of the Government taking &euro;1 of every &euro;1.70 per litre of diesel.  Compared with 16 or 17 months ago, what the Government takes now on every litre of diesel is 40 cent higher.  There is room, therefore, for the Government to make an allowance.  This fuel is used to haul food, whether it is exported or goes to cities or rural Ireland.</p></reply>

I am very aware of increased prices at petrol and diesel pumps over recent weeks.  This is an international trend.  Wholesale energy prices have increased significantly following rises in international oil and gas prices and a post-lockdown surge in energy demand.  While the trajectory of the global energy market is not within our control, indications are this current spike will abate over the coming months.</p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel.  The only increase in this year&rsquo;s budget in this regard related to the already planned increase in carbon tax.  At a time when the eyes of the world are on what governments in developed economies such as ours can do to address climate change, our carbon tax represents an important contribution to that effort.</p>  <p>  The diesel rebate scheme partially insulates the licensed haulage and bus sector from such fuel price increases.  Under the scheme, qualifying road transport operators can apply for a repayment of part of the mineral oil tax paid on auto diesel purchased in the State.  While this current spike in fuel prices is likely to be short lived, it is important to take this opportunity to take stock of our dependence on imported fossil fuels in the transport sector.  The new climate action plan, which will be published today, will reduce our reliance on these fuels and allow us to transit to greener renewable energy sources for transport.</p>  <p>  Electrification of road transport is key.  A comprehensive suite of measures is available to electric vehicle, EV, drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, and favourable motor and benefit-in-kind, BIK, tax rates.  While I appreciate this does not relate to HGV drivers, the plan commits also to increasing biofuel blend rates.  These are transitionary fuels that provide time for sectors such as haulage to invest in new, greener technology.  As I mentioned, a grant scheme was launched in March to assist the purchase of alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicles.  The take-up of this scheme has been excellent and demonstrates the level of interest in this sector to make the transition.</p></speech>

There are no articulated lorries in Ireland or Europe at the moment that run on electricity.  Whoever wrote the contribution needs to go back and read up on the matter.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Rourke pointed out, gas is now more expensive than diesel.  It costs &euro;18,000 to convert a lorry from diesel to gas.  As Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out, the new Euro 6 engine has drastically reduced emissions and we should examine using it to help the haulage industry.  The Minister of State is correct in stating international prices of fuel have increased, but every time they do so, the Government gets 65% of the price.  It is like a hen clucking.  The more the price increases, the more the Government will get.  It receives 40 cent more on every litre of the same product in a year because the price has changed, so there is room.  I do not say this for the hauliers; I say it for the ordinary people because the food of Ireland is transported throughout this country on lorries.</p></speech>

As part of this transition, we are trying to ensure we put in place supports such as the diesel rebate scheme.  I mentioned the alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicle grant, which had a significant uptake from the sector, showing the interest.  We are also co-funding three research projects with Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, focusing on decarbonising the freight sector.  This will not be easy and it will not happen next week.  I  am very aware of that.  Nevertheless, we are working across government to ensure we reduce our emissions and protect the sector.  Part of that relates to the ten-year haulage strategy, the first of its kind in Ireland.  Now is the time for people to feed in positively and constructively to the sector, as they are doing, relaying their needs and what they need to do to help support their sector into the future.</p></speech>

I will be the first to admit there is a grant to help people move from diesel to gas, but the cost of doing so is probably &euro;17,000 or &euro;18,000.  They will pay more than if they had kept diesel.  That is a fact.</p>  <p>  I reiterate there is a difference of 40 cent between the revenue on diesel the Government was taking in last year and the revenue this year.  In light of the crisis with regard to the haulage sector shifting goods throughout the country, there is room for manoeuvre.  If the price of diesel had not increased internationally, the Government would not have the additional 40 cent.  What it never had, it never wanted.</p>  <p>  I accept the Minister of State said much of this cannot be done in the short term and I understand that fully.  Even so, for the time being, until we get these electric vehicles that will transport food throughout the country, wherever they are on the horizon, or until gas returns to a normal price, will the Government make a decision on the additional 40 cent to help the ordinary public?  They are the ones who will ultimately have to pay.</p></speech>

I will also work with my Government colleagues, given this is not just a transport issue.  For example, the Minister for Finance sets policy in respect of tax and excise duties on fuel and the only increase this year was the planned carbon tax increase.  I will engage with them in respect of that ten-year haulage strategy, which is the vision.  We need to set out that long-term plan as well as working on what I outlined earlier as the immediate concerns for the sector, namely, ensuring there is a robust supply chain and that we have the skillset, working with our educational centres, whether through skills for HGV drivers or research in the area of reducing emissions, and ensuring we have vehicles and the technology available.</p> <p>Some of the strategies are more for the long term.  We are working on short, medium and long-term approaches.  I share the Deputy's frustration and understand people's questions about the ambition to tackle these issues.  This is a global challenge and we must rise to that challenge and work with sectors to ensure our approach is fair and achievable.</p></speech>

It will set out a strategic framework to 2030 for walking, cycling and public transport to support Ireland's overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of the decade.  The framework will primarily focus on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in so doing, encourage less private car usage nationally to support our climate commitment.  The climate action plan for 2021 sets out additional measures to promote other complementary transport mitigation measures such as the switch to electric car usage and greater use of renewable transport fuels.</p>  <p>  A collaborative approach has been taken by the Department in developing the sustainable mobility policy framework through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement.  It will set out a comprehensive set of actions to increase active travel infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services throughout the country.  These actions will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible.  Transport needs are not uniform throughout the country and we recognise that tailored solutions will be needed for both urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The new framework will be underpinned by funding under the national development plan, NDP, which provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade.  This will enable significant investment in active travel, bus and rail infrastructure and the expansion of sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages.  This will be complemented by expanded public transport services throughout the country, as supported by the public service obligation, PSO, programme.  The target of the policy framework will be to cater for daily travel needs in a more sustainable manner and deliver an additional 500,000 daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030.</p></speech>

The framework is a successor to the smarter travel policy, which brought us up to 2020.  There was a very good consultation on that policy, which finished around the time of the general election.  As we move forward with the new plan with increased ambition, it will be critical to our success.  One of the weaknesses of the smarter travel policy was that it very much focused on commuting to work, whereas we really need to address transport in the round.  The Minister of State has done very good work on safe routes to schools and school streets.  Those types of journeys will be critical to the policy we deliver.  I look forward to the consultation on the plan.  If we can deliver an holistic approach to transport and the modal shift, we will see benefits across air quality, public health and for the economy.</p></speech>

However, it is not just about children in primary and secondary school having safe access; it is about local accessibility in towns and villages.  It is not just an urban programme but one that will also work for rural areas.  It is about enabling schools to work locally with their local authorities, particularly in tricky rural settings, to come up with solutions and models that can be replicated in other parts of the country.  That was the call we put out through the National Transport Authority, NTA, when it was engaging with An Taisce on its Green-Schools initiatives with the local authorities.  The message was that we were not just looking at urban areas but also at solutions for our rural towns and villages.  The sustainable mobility framework will be closely aligned with the climate action plan and the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework, which will be especially important for regional accessibility, strengthening rural economies and ensuring we have sustainable mobility in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.</p></speech>

If we are to solve the challenge of the rural-urban inequity divide generally, we simply have to tackle the challenge of rural transport provision.  We should look to pursuing what the Germans and Swiss are doing, with the model of every village, every hour.  I acknowledge the Connecting Ireland launch last week, which was fantastic.  It will deliver huge benefits to villages and towns across rural Ireland and will give people an alternative to using the car and, for those who do not have a car, a means of getting about.</p>  <p>  We need to make very hard decisions around the reallocation of road space, particularly in urban areas.

When we talk about public transport, there is the issue that people have a vision focusing on urban Ireland and our cities.  Connecting Ireland is about delivering public transport in rural towns and villages throughout the country.  That is key if we want to ensure people in rural Ireland have connectivity.  However, we also need to be practical and realistic in recognising that not every rural area will have a public transport option.  The aim is to maximise the potential of those routes and have evidence-based policy in regard to public transport services in rural areas throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The draft policy framework is looking at issues like ensuring continued mobility safety, decarbonising public transport, expanding the metropolitan area sustainability options, expanding rural and regional sustainable mobility options, and encouraging people to choose sustainable mobility over the private car.  We want transport-led development.  This is about an all-of-government approach to ensuring we are building in the right areas and, where we have housing developments, that there is a sustainable, integrated transport system aligned with them.</p></speech>

Road traffic legislation sets out the standards for the use of such cameras and their effect in terms of road traffic law.  Under section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, electronic apparatus, including cameras, may be used to provide evidence in regard to offences under a number of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.  The enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with some powers provided for local authorities in respect of parking controls.  The installation of cameras for traffic management is a matter for the relevant road authority.</p>  <p>  Regarding the installation of cameras to detect red light offences, in 2015 to 2016, a pilot was successfully carried out at the intersection of Blackhall Place and Benburb Street in Dublin, on the red Luas line, under an agreement between the NTA and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The NTA operated the system and provided images to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which had responsibility for processing violations.  The aim of the pilot was to reduce collisions at that intersection between cars and trams on the red line.  Following a review of the project, two further locations have been selected for red light cameras, namely, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street.  My Department has been advised the NTA will be developing system design and technical specifications for tenders to install and operate the three sites.</p>  <p>  Separately, the role of additional camera-based enforcement and its potential road safety benefits is being considered by the Department and transport agencies.</p></speech>

As she said, the NTA has a role to play in this.  It relates to some of the discussion we have had in recent weeks about the possibility of a transport police force, which is an idea that has merit.  We can no longer divide the issue of enforcement from the proper operation of our transport systems.</p> <p>I get consistent feedback from my constituents in Dublin Central that cars are increasingly pushing the limits of amber lights and outright breaking the red lights, sometimes at speed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have the proper resources to deal with this issue and it is not practical for it to do so.  I can think of better ways for it to use its resources in Dublin Central.  Many EU countries operate this red light traffic system very well.  The initial trial over an 18-month period in that area of Smithfield mentioned identified 1,300 road users breaking the lights, and I suspect that was a rather conservative estimate.  From that trial in 2015 in Smithfield, in 2019, those three additional cameras were installed.  That progress seems quite slow.</p></speech>

However, it was necessary to retender the technical and operational parts of the project, as the original installation was a pilot project only.  Under procurement legislation, the larger permanent operation requires a new, publicly advertised tender process.  Due to Covid commitments, the NTA has not progressed the retendering process.  It intends to develop the system design and technical specifications for the Blackhall Place site, as well as the additional sites at Con Colbert Road and Queen Street and seek tenders in the next year.  While the Blackhall Place site is not currently operational, it is expected to be reactivated following the appointment of a specialist service provider.  During 2023, it is expected the additional two sites, Con Colbert Road and Queen Street, will be activated.</p></speech>

While movement on it is encouraging, it will have to be rolled out nationwide.  Suitable enforcement will have to be part of our transport solutions in moving towards a lower carbon strategy.  It is also an issue around a rights-based strategy for those with disabilities and making the urban sphere much more accessible.  For those who want to move towards active travel in terms of cycling and multi-modal trips, enforcement on our roads is incredibly important.  Speeding and the breaking of lights has a huge impact on people's perception of the road, their right to it and their use of it.  That is no more relevant than to those vulnerable groups, such as younger children and those with disabilities.  Until the perception is out there that people will be seen, called out on and held to account for breaking the rules, the rules will continue to be broken.</p></speech>

There is no legislative barrier to this.  The Department does the legislation and it is up to the agencies - the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authorities - to roll out these projects.  I take her points on accessibility on public transport.  We have increased Garda resources in this budget.  The Deputy made reference to antisocial behaviour on our public transport services.  This came up earlier, with other Deputies.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda is engaging extensively with public transport service operators in ensuring we can make certain both staff and passengers are safe.  The work is ongoing, but I will relay Deputy Hourigan's comments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

Key to that is investing in our public transport.  In my constituency in Wicklow, we have a 19th century public transport service and infrastructure, the Dublin-Rosslare rail line, which serves through the county down to Wicklow town and Arklow.  What plans are in place to expand the capacity and frequency of the rail service through Wicklow?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400017#P00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question and the opportunity to discuss the issue of increased capacity and the frequency on our rail lines, specifically the Dublin-Rosslare rail line.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport, however, neither he nor my Department have a role in the day-to-day provision, operation, or maintenance of subsidised bus and rail services.  That is the responsibility, first and foremost, of the NTA, in conjunction with public transport operators such as Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Go-Ahead Ireland, Luas or, in this instance, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that its operational fleet is fully deployed in the provision of scheduled services at present, in line with prevailing passenger demand across the network.  The current capacity is primarily based on demand levels pre-Covid, when rapid growth in passenger demand resulted in the use of 100% of the company's operational fleet at peak times.  Post-Covid, demand remains suppressed in the short term, and as we continue to exit the Covid-19 restrictions, significantly altered travel patterns have emerged.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it intends to undertake an analysis of this new trend in customer habits and adapt its timetable to meet customer demands.  It is expected this assessment will take a number of months as travel patterns become established, with a phased return to the workplace over the coming months, depending on the prevailing epidemiological situation.  Once this process has been completed, a timetable and capacity proposal will be prepared and issued for public consultation on the Irish Rail website.  It is currently estimated that this process will commence in the second quarter of 2022.</p>  <p>  The recently announced national development plan will see the introduction of additional infrastructure which will relieve congestion on the network while also delivering new trains to provide greater capacity for increasing passenger numbers into the future.  A range of projects are under way which will continue over the next 12 months, such as the national train control centre, track laying and new intercity railcars.  These 41 carriages are under construction and scheduled for delivery in 2022.</p></speech>

I am a firm believer in "build it and they will come".  Unfortunately, we have a 19th century rail line through Wicklow, which has received no upgrades for many decades.  We have five services out of Wicklow, with two in the morning, one in the afternoon and two in the evening.  Coming from Dublin into Wicklow, the first train to leave Dublin is at 9.33 a.m.  If we are serious about getting people out of cars, there needs to be a bigger picture in terms of investing in our rail infrastructure.  I am hearing absolutely nothing from the Minister of State.  We need to see the electrification of the rail line beyond Greystones down to Wicklow town.  We need to see the roll-out of battery operated trains as well.  When will we see battery-operated trains on the Dublin-Rosslare line?  What are the plans to extend the DART to Wicklow town?  That gives us a serious opportunity to take people out of cars and put them on public transport.</p></speech>

As well as increasing the Dublin area capacity, it will also see intercity carriages in use on commuter services allocated to intercity routes to increase capacity and frequency of services.</p>  <p>  With regard to the possibility of increasing the DART frequency on the Dublin to Rosslare route, between Bray and Greystones, there is an issue with physical infrastructure constraints.  The railway between Bray and Greystones is single track, which means only one service can operate between Bray and Greystones at any given time.  Journey time between the two takes ten minutes each way, and both of these factors dictate the level of frequency which can be achieved.  The DART+ coastal project is in the design and planning phase.  One of its key goals is to identify opportunities for capacity enhancement between Bray and Greystones.  Public consultation will be under way on those emerging options.</p></speech>

I know there are plans to look at the DART between Bray and Greystones.</p> <p>I asked specifically about extending the DART from Bray to Wicklow Town.  That gives us a serious opportunity to deal with the congestion on the N11.  On the N11 on a daily basis there are thousands of people sitting in their cars stuck in traffic, when we have a 19th-century rail line.  That is where the investment needs to be, if we are serious about getting people out of cars to use public transport.  That is where we need to look.  I am conscious that the National Transport Authority, NTA, has had some discussions with Wicklow County Council with a view to extending the DART line to Wicklow Town.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here to deal with the questions.  My colleague, Deputy Darren O&rsquo;Rourke, raised that point earlier.  It is a serious issue that the senior Minister is not here to answer the specific questions that we as Deputies have put forward, with no explanation whatsoever.  It is in the Minister's remit to reschedule if he will not be here to answer the questions that we pose.  It is within his remit to change the roster.</p> <p> The Minister of State might answer the specific questions that I asked, not the issue between Bray and Greystones.

Implementation of these recommendations was underway prior to the Comptroller and Auditor General raising the issue of procurement of vehicles in 2020.  In particular, new internal controls in accordance with best practice procurement procedures have been put in place.  Additional resources have been allocated to the area and training has been enhanced.  Insofar as this specific issue is concerned, it was identified as a deviation event through the Coast Guard&rsquo;s deviation and risk management procedures.  A corresponding investigation regarding the suitability of the assets procured in support of cliff rescue operations occurred on 4 February 2020.  The recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relate to specification of requirements, tendering supply and delivery of vehicles and procurement processes.  These recommendations are accepted and are being implemented.  The vehicles procured under the contract are currently fulfilling an operational role for the Coast Guard.  The vehicles purchased are a considerable improvement on the previous vans in use by cliff rescue teams.  This is because they have additional carrying capacity, improved storage of equipment, welfare facilities, air conditioning, dry equipment, additional radios and under chassis sealing.  Coast Guard cliff rescue teams continue to rely on multiple vehicle types to respond to cliff incidents.  The Coast Guard continues to review procurement procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they comply with best practice in the area.</p></speech>

It highlighted to me a litany of issues around public procurement in the Irish Coast Guard.  There are concerns that need to be taken back to the Department and acted on.  The Minister of State will be aware of the range of other issues that have been raised in recent times about the Irish Coast Guard&rsquo;s governance, structure, culture and morale, as well as a series of allegations which raise concern.  I wonder if the Minister of State is aware of those.  Has she met with the Irish Coast Guard about them?  Has she met with the new group, Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association, the launch of which her party colleague and mine attended in recent weeks?  Their own stated intention is to better the Coast Guard for everybody involved.  That is a laudable ambition.</p></speech>

In 2019, my Department&rsquo;s internal audit unit carried out a procurement gap analysis, which identifies a number of areas with significant scope for improvement.  The following eight recommendations are contained in the March 2020 audit report: the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, procurement procedures are to be documented; there is to be better procurement documentation filing and retention;  there is to be a live contracts register on finance and procurement SharePoint site; avoid appointment of contractors without competition; improve tender specification costs; improve contract management, contract planning; and carry out evaluations of procurements.  These eight recommendations in the internal audit report on Coast Guard procurement were all implemented by the end of November 2020.  A procurement manual was finalised in November 2020 which sets out the process from a formal assessment of operational leads to a business case.</p>  <p>  Training and procurement workshops are available to all staff involved in the procurement process.

My follow on question is that I am concerned that the procurement issues were a symptom of potentially wider issues within the Irish Coast Guard.  We are hearing clearly about these issues from the new representative group, the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association.  There was the resignation of volunteers in Doolin in recent days, as well as the standing down of the Coast Guard there.  There will be significant implications on the services being provided.  It also flags, in my opinion, problems within that service.  I ask the Minister of State what actions are being taken.  Has she met with the Irish Coast Guard?  Has she or will she meet the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association which, as I said, wants to deliver a better Coast Guard for everybody involved?</p></speech>

We have good management teams right across the country.  Where there are challenges, we need to address them.  We need to ensure that they are resolved.  That is my commitment.  I have been liaising with officials in my Department.  I will do whatever is needed, the Deputy can be assured, to ensure that we get a resolution.  At the moment, however, I have been assured that there is adequate cover.  From time to time, certain teams step down for different reasons, such as operational reasons.  In those situations, cover is provided elsewhere.</p> <p>I continue to monitor the situation and I understand the importance of this issue.</p></speech>

Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the management and improvement of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with local authorities.</p>  <p>  A key priority in the NDP, in line with the Department&rsquo;s investment hierarchy, is to maintain the quality of the existing national road network.  This consists of about 5,300 km of national roads, including 1,000 km of motorways, connecting Ireland&rsquo;s cities and regions.  I take the Deputy's point about ensuring that we have that connectivity.  The NDP foresees Exchequer expenditure of about &euro;2.9 billion on the protection and renewal of these national roads over the period to 2030.  Such investment is required to keep the national road assets at a safe and robust level for all users.  Investment in existing road assets can also assist in retrofitting them where applicable, for example by providing new bus lanes.  Further, approximately &euro;5.1 billion will be spent on new national road projects over the lifetime of the revised NDP to 2030.  This funding will enable improved connectivity across the country, as well as compact growth, which are core components of the revised NDP.</p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority and works on those roads are funded from councils' own resources, supplemented by Exchequer grants where applicable.  Grant support provided by the Department under the regional and local road grant programme is focused primarily on the protection and renewal of the network and the NDP makes provision for expenditure of &euro;5.35 billion on this in the period to 2030.  Provision is also being made for expenditure of &euro;677 million on targeted road improvements for that period.  Within the context of the capital ceilings set for the Department and its delivery agencies, the funding allocation for new public transport and new roads is in keeping with the agreement in the programme for Government.  A 2:1 ratio will be maintained between new public transport investment and new road investment.</p></speech>

Might it be possible to identify a national minimum standard for quality of roads to facilitate those parts of the country that will require access to markets for heavy transport vehicles and access to investment in their respective areas, having particular regard to the fact that in a line from Belfast to Cork, and to an extent to Limerick and Galway, there is no access to that level of quality?  From the point of view of investment in jobs and employment, there is a necessity to do so in the future.</p></speech>

Ensuring that minimum standards are kept is a matter for local authorities.  Local authorities, with TII, identify roads that need to be further maintained.  The maintenance, protection and renewal budget was protected, which recognises the importance of road connectivity and safety for all road users.  It is critical that we have new road infrastructure built as part of that.  Public transport uses roads.  We also need to make sure that we maintain and upgrade our existing road network to ensure we meet the minimum standards and that we retrofit, where possible, by putting in bus lanes, for example.  All of this will form part of our vision for ensuring that we are connecting Ireland both in our rural and urban settings.</p></speech>

Would it be possible to contact the relevant local authorities directly with a view to achieving that kind of minimum standard for connectivity to facilitate our growing population and investment in jobs in the future?</p></speech>

I would like to speak in support of the points that Deputy Durkan is making.  On the new 2:1 ratio of expenditure on public transport to expenditure on roads infrastructure, it is important that we prioritise many of the vital smaller schemes around rural Ireland.  In my own constituency, as the Minister of State is familiar with, I have been seeking to have the Castlemartyr and Killeagh scheme prioritised to alleviate the 24,000 passenger vehicles travelling along national routes through small villages.  It is important for the Government to fulfil commitments that have been made through the new NDP and in the engagement process beforehand to ensure that these types of projects get full prioritisation, funding and support from the Government.  They are needed in addition to the welcome investment in public transport.</p></speech>

A list of projects is mentioned in the NDP.  Projects currently under construction are the M50 traffic control management unit, the N5 from Westport to Turlough, the N56 from Dungloe to Glenties, the N22 from Baile Bhuirne to Macroom, the M8 Dunkettle interchange, and the N5 from Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge.  There are other projects earmarked to begin construction within the coming months, for example, the N59 Moycullen bypass and the Listowel bypass.  Deputies may feel that other projects are absolutely critical.  We all have our own views on our own areas that we are familiar with, including local employment, local education and the connectivity that is required.  It is up to the local representatives, working with local authorities, to put forward proposals regarding further projects that may be deemed necessary, looking at demographics, employment and future prospects over the next few years.  That is part of the national development plan too.  It explicitly states that local authorities can put forward proposals on projects that may be deemed necessary for their areas.</p></speech>

In the recent national development plan, that was extended to 2030.  This is welcome.  It aligns with the United Nations recommendation.  Few countries are actually doing this.  I ask the Minister of State for a status update on capital spending on walking and cycling infrastructure.  There is an allocation from the Department for 2021 and I ask the Minister of State to make a statement on the matter.</p></reply>

This investment will help to support the delivery of about 1,000 km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in greenways.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this year, we have seen a significant increase in funding in line with the Government's prioritisation of active travel and greenways.  My Department provided approximately &euro;287 million in funding this year to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for active travel projects.  This allocation is enabling investment in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities along with an additional investment in projects in 19 other local authority areas.  The latter funding stream constitutes the first ever major active travel investment programme for rural Ireland.  A further &euro;70 million was allocated to greenway projects.</p>  <p>  The significant increase in funding requires additional capacity and resources to be made available in the local authorities to deliver the projects as planned.  To this end, earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wrote to the County and City Management Association to advise that approximately 250 additional staff would be allocated to local authorities around the country to work on the delivery of active travel projects.  </p> <p>I understand the recruitment process is ongoing and I hope to see all the staff in place by early 2022.  As we emerge from Covid, we have a major opportunity to change the way we travel in this country and I am pleased to say that, despite the challenges of Covid as well as the need to recruit additional staff in the local authorities, it is expected that 80% of the total active travel financial allocation will be spent by the end of this year.</p></speech>

It falls short of the &euro;360 million but we have to recognise it will take time to build up to that and it is with the local authorities to develop the pipeline of projects.  It would be good if the Minister of State could speak to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and ask him to consult the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on pushing the local authorities to develop that pipeline.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's point about 1,000 km of active travel infrastructure to be developed by 2025.  I think we can be even more ambitious.  That figure is predicated on a very high standard, which is needed in our towns and cities, but if we want to have more extensive networks across all our towns and villages, we can go for a standard of infrastructure that would not cost &euro;1.5 million or so, which is the basis for the 1,000 km.  It comes down to reallocating road space and making difficult political decisions around that.  We need to address that.</p></speech>

That may have brought the figure down slightly but as the resources are allocated to local authorities in relation to active travel projects, we will see - and we will monitor this - an increase year on year in the roll-out of active travel infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I note what the Deputy says on rural towns and villages.  It is important to say that additional funding of &euro;72 million was announced in March for 340 sustainable transport projects in 19 local authorities outside the greater Dublin area in our regional cities.  The NTA originally earmarked &euro;50 million for the scheme but it was increased due to the volume of proposals.  That shows there is an appetite to roll these out in our regional cities, towns and villages.  I encourage local authorities to continue to do that but we need to resource those authorities around that.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  The policy and the investment the Minister of State spoke about is important because we have a car-oriented society which has developed over the last 40 years or so.  Some 74% of all journeys are made by private car.  In my city, 70% of all journeys under 3 km are made by  private car.  We have to transition.  They are journeys that can be transitioned over to walking and cycling, if not public transport.  There has been a slight turn in recent years, which is positive.  I acknowledge the Limerick school cycle bus and there is a successful cycle bus in Galway as well.  We should not need cycle buses and would not if we succeeded in providing active travel infrastructure.</p></speech>

It is said by people who engage in and spearhead cycle buses that hopefully one day we will not need them and will have safe routes to school and protected infrastructure such that parents feel confident to let their children cycle to school appropriately.  What is important about the safe routes to school programme is that the schools are actively involved in these solutions.  It is not just the local authority coming in and proposing something outside of the school space.  It is the schools working with parents and the real leaders are the students.  They say what they require, be it cycle parking or a walk and stride facility.  Our commitment is to roll out that &euro;360 million per year on walking and cycling facilities.  This is just the start and it will ramp up.  If we get good examples in urban, rural and suburban areas that can be replicated across the country, and if leaders roll out schemes in areas where it was thought not to be possible, that will encourage others to do the same.</p></speech>

Providing a sustainable low-carbon transport system is a key priority for the Department.  The programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reductions to 2030.  Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050 and electrification will be key to achieving that in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  EVs are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 climate action plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.  This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.  To this end, my Department has convened the electric vehicle policy pathway working group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target.  The working group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial and taxation policies to help to drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. </p>  <p>  Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations.  The working group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs.  However, the group concluded that niche market scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as in the small public service vehicles, SPSV, sector.  Furthermore, considerable progress has been made as a result of the work of the low-emission vehicle task force to ensure conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and benefit-in-kind tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network.  These measures have contributed to increased take-up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to around 45,000</p></speech>

We sell 7,500 EVs per year and another 7,500 on top of that but it is 7:1 compared with diesel and petrol.  We will not hit the target for 2030.  The scrappage scheme is important because it will tackle the affordability anxiety people have.  We do not have range anxiety in Ireland; we have affordability anxiety.  The vast majority of people, even with the measures brought in by the Government, still cannot afford to switch to an electric vehicle.  Something has been brought in for the SPSV sector.  That is a good thing.  There are other sectors and other ways of bringing this in.  The Minister of State mentioned the word "niche".  We can look at older cars.  We can look at areas and at people living outside of public transport nodes who do not have access to bus and rail and incentivise them through scrappage schemes.</p>  <p>  The other thing about a scrappage scheme that is important is that there is no use having an electric vehicle if the vehicle it replaces in the family home is sold as a second-hand vehicle and remains on the road somewhere else or is given to an adult child in the household.  The emissions will be the same.</p></speech>

Preparations are under way to establish an office of low emissions vehicles.  This office will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles and will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p> In the context of rural Ireland, we spoke about Connecting Ireland, which concerns a public transport system across rural Ireland, but we have to be realistic.  We will not have public transport in every area of rural Ireland.  It is not feasible.  We know this clearly.  We need to look at ways to help people to move to a more environmentally friendly vehicle.  I would like to see the office of low emissions vehicle looking at that.  The move to electric vehicles will be a critical part in emissions reduction.</p></speech>

I also represent an awful lot of people who are on low incomes who live in those areas.  People who are on low incomes cannot afford newer cars or even more fuel-efficient diesel and petrol cars.  They are driving older cars with higher carbon emissions.  This is where we need to look.  This is where we can be brave and ambitious in the area of electric vehicles.</p> <p> I commute by car and bus.  I hope in the next few years it will be by electric car and bus, but there are people in my constituency who do not have bus access and they need their car.  People with disabilities have no other option but to use a car.  Incentivising them and bringing them in early to a truly affordable scrappage scheme so they can buy an electric vehicle would be in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve through COP26.  What we are trying to achieve globally and nationally would be a really good tool for this country.</p></speech>

There will be people who will need a private car.  The evidence is there regarding emissions reductions with electric vehicles.  In particular where people have no other alternative, we must look at measures in that respect.  I will not go into the grants.  Deputy Duncan Smith is very well aware that there is going to be a concerted public service element as well, including for taxis.  The public sector is leading the way.  An Post, for example, has invested hugely in electric vehicles for its fleet.  We must lead as well, but also look at supports and targeted incentives for certain sectors and regions that may need extra help.</p></speech>

Chuala muid ar fad na sc&eacute;alta &oacute; na teaghlaigh agus t&aacute; s&aacute;r-jab d&eacute;anta acu ag cur a gcuid point&iacute; trasna le linn an fheachtais seo.  Ar an 15 Meitheamh, thacaigh an tAire agus an Rialtas le r&uacute;n &oacute; Shinn F&eacute;in a thabharfadh 100% c&uacute;iteamh do na daoine seo, ach tuigim &oacute; bheith ag caint leo ar&eacute;ir n&aacute;r bhuail an tAire leo go f&oacute;ill agus n&aacute;r thug s&eacute; cuairt ar na ceantair seo leis an scannal agus an briseadh cro&iacute; a fheice&aacute;il d&oacute; f&eacute;in.  Tugann siad an cuireadh don Aire &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh anois.</p>  <p>  I want to raise with the Minister the mica and pyrite redress scheme, which is currently the subject of discussion between various Departments, including the Minister's own Department.  The families involved are living in homes that are literally crumbling around them.  That is a result of light-touch regulation and no regulation during the Celtic tiger period.  It is important to say again that none of this is the fault of those families that are affected.  I am sure we can all agree in this House that their campaign has touched the hearts of many people throughout the State.  They have shown great resolve in their campaign for justice and for 100% redress.  They have laid out their case, opened up their hearts and told their own personal stories to the entire nation.  Now they need the Government to step up for them.  They need the Government to have their backs and to be in their corner, and that includes the Minister.</p>  <p>  On 15 June, the D&aacute;il unanimously voted for a motion which mandates the Government to deliver 100% redress.  The Minister supported the motion and now he needs to deliver on it.  I am aware from those involved and the people I spoke to last night that thus far, the Minister has not had the opportunity to meet with them or to visit the areas affected.  The families would like to extend that opportunity to the Minister before he sits down at the Cabinet table to make a decision on this matter.  On behalf of the families affected in Donegal and elsewhere, I ask the Minister if he will take up the offer from them to meet with those affected and, ideally, to visit the areas affected.  They have said that they will meet with the Minister any time, anywhere, in person or online.  The Minister should do that before he sits down to make a decision.</p>  <p>  The other key issue at play is who will manage the scheme if it is agreed and is acceptable to those involved.  The families are very clear on this.  They want the Housing Agency to manage this from start to finish.  That has numerous benefits which the Minister should be concerned about, not least the benefit of economies of scale, which will help deliver better value for money.  The opposite of that is that it would leave those devastated, crushed families competing for materials, personnel and at the mercy of construction inflation.  Just like with the pyrite resolution scheme in Leinster, the Housing Agency, with its proven expertise, should be tasked with the responsibility of project managing the restoration of the affected homes in partnership with the families, from the tendering of works, to the appointment of contractors, to ensuring quality and right through to providing a State guarantee for the works to the families.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe that the Housing Agency should be responsible for managing the scheme, delivering better value for money, dealing with economies of scale and ensuring quality?  Will he take up the offer the families have asked me to make to him to meet with them in person, preferably physically at the locations?  None of us, even including those who represent the people who live in the counties most affected, can comprehend the scale of the problem until we hear what it means to the families living in those houses, until we reach into those blocks that crumble in our hands and talk to the children about how they are not having a normal childhood.  That offer is being extended to the Minister today.</p></speech>

I want to begin by acknowledging the extraordinary trauma, anxiety and stress that all those who have been afflicted by the awful change in the building blocks of their homes have confronted and endured.  I have been aware of this issue because I worked as a member of the previous Government to bring forward the scheme, which in light of the continuing challenges the families face, the Government now accepts needs to be strengthened.  This is why I am working very closely on this matter with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on a regular basis.  The Government is committed to bringing forward a strengthened scheme to respond to the anguish, human need and to the basic need for the stability and safety of a family home.  We all know how important that is to families all over the country.  We are committed to bringing that forward.  What we are working on at the moment is that we have to acknowledge that in addition to the huge need that Deputy Doherty and other Deputies have raised, including Deputy McHugh, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, we are also aware that the cost of dealing with this issue is very significant.  We are aware not just of the challenges of mica, but other challenges across the country in relation to how homes have been built and what their future is.  As a Government we need to ensure that we are confident that we are dealing with this in a way that meets the needs that are being raised with us by those families directly, while being conscious of the cost involved in this and also dealing with the important point Deputy Doherty raised, which is how such a scheme is administered and how it is delivered not only in his community but potentially in other communities that are afflicted by this issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are currently considering this issue.  Of course, it is a challenge regarding how we can respond in a humane, compassionate and effective way, which we are committed to doing.  We will be making this decision conscious of significant amounts of money being spent on this, which we acknowledge needs to happen.  We must focus on ensuring that as this money is being spent, it is being done in a way that can deliver speed of execution, confidence about being able to meet the needs, and does also reflect on what we have learnt from how other schemes have been administered across the country, in particular for pyrite.  This is an issue that we are working on at the moment.  The Ministers, Deputy Darragh O'Brien and Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are going to continue with the work, which we are doing as quickly as we can.  We want to get this right.</p>  <p>  I will not have the opportunity to travel to Donegal as we move through this process, but I have met families who have been afflicted by this.  I am aware of the horror when a home turns into a property that is falling down in front of your eyes.  Of course, I am aware of the anxiety that is causing and the deep and profound stress.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has met the families involved on many occasions.  He has concluded a process that began at the end of June and lasted all the way up until the end of September.</p> <p>I know he has been in regular and direct contact with many of the families that are very active on this issue.  We will of course be guided by the input they are giving, recognising the scale of the matter.  We must also be conscious of the funding that will be involved in this while dealing with the execution and governance questions that Deputy Doherty has correctly raised.</p></speech>

The Housing Agency took on that project and it is the only agency that can do this properly.  We should not force families at their wits' end to compete for developers' prices and tenders and all the rest.  The Minister for Finance clearly must have a view on this.</p>  <p>  The families are well aware of the Minister's busy schedule but they are also aware he is a key person, as Minister for Finance, for the scheme that could address and lift the burden from those families.  Alternatively, it could leave many of them behind.  They are appealing to meet the Minister any time and anywhere, whether it is online or in person.  They want to meet him before he sits at the Cabinet table and makes this decision.  It is a fair request from the families and I encourage the Minister to take up that offer.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, these families are at their wits' end and they have won the hearts of this nation.  These families expect the Government to have their back.  They did not cause this problem, which arose because of light-touch or no regulation.  This came from the Celtic tiger era and these homes are literally falling apart.  Will the Minister please take up that offer and provide an answer on whether he will meet the families online or in person over the next number of days?</p></speech>

The last thing I am concerned about is my schedule, whether it is busy or not.  All that matters is how we as a Government can meet the needs being raised in the House by Deputy Doherty and others in a compassionate and fair way while also being conscious that the funding involved and the commitment from the Exchequer is very significant.  The Ministers, Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Michael McGrath, and I are aware that as we deal with this matter, we may well have other challenges to which we must respond regarding the future of building within our country.  We are aiming to get that balance right.  I can assure Deputy Doherty that I am absolutely aware of the human need he referred to.  The Government will do all it can to conclude a process that aims to respond to this issue.</p></speech>

We appear to be going from one wave to another without moving to a point where we accept this as endemic and we need strategies to deal with the virus into the medium term.</p>  <p>  It has been clear for a long time that Covid-19 is airborne, and this presents significant challenges, particularly in the winter months when people are more likely to be indoors.  Despite this, very little has been done in terms of ventilation in the Government response.  We can take primary schools as an example, as we all want them to remain open and be safe.  We also know a large number of children have tested positive for Covid-19.  CO2 monitors have been provided for most classrooms.  I spoke to a teacher yesterday who told me windows are fully open all the time, along with the classroom door, with the CO2 levels monitored constantly.  They only have to close the door for a short time before the indicator turns red.  Where it is not possible to have good ventilation, the advice is to contact an architect and apply for remedial funding.</p>  <p>  A contrasting approach is being taken in Victoria, Australia, which has invested in air filtration systems with HEPA filters for every classroom.  This is a proactive approach.  Not only do we see large numbers of children with Covid-19 but there are also other nasty viruses on the go, such as respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, that result in hospitalisations.  Good ventilation could play its part in reducing the risk of the spread of more than Covid-19.  It is particularly important in this country, where class sizes are particularly high.</p>  <p>  We have been repeatedly told schools are somehow immune to the spread of Covid-19 but that view is contested.  We have 500,000 primary school children who are unvaccinated and many of them attend classes with poor ventilation.  None of these is being tested when there is a positive case in the class.  It seems we are taking a very high risk.  We could take other action and the use of antigen testing has been discussed.  The medium-term view is very important.</p>  <p>  Is there any change in the approach to the time horizon for managing Covid-19 or will we continue to go from wave to wave and hope it will not reoccur?  Has the Minister had discussions with the Department of Education about taking a proactive approach, with investment in good ventilation?  Is there a change in approach in new school design, for example, that would incorporate better ventilation standards?  Energy is very expensive now and windows are being left open so will there be additional funding for schools for such costs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400022#U00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Government and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, are very much aware of the change we are seeing in community transmission and the level of Covid-19 incidence across our country.  Of course, we take heart in the fact we are in a very different position from where we were a year ago due to the success of the vaccination programme of the Government, the resilience of the Irish people and the extraordinary work done by all our front-line workers in healthcare services.</p>  <p>  Of course, we are looking at the current change in the spread of disease, and as Dr. Tony Holohan and the Government have acknowledged, there is real cause for additional focus and concern as we move to a period when socialisation and household contacts increase.  The Government is acting to manage this risk and continue protecting the health of this country.  In testing alone, we now have capacity in place for 175,000 tests per week, with 140,000 of them within our community teams and 35,000 in acute testing services.  We have put in place a very significant testing programme.</p>  <p>  As the House is aware, we are also in an important phase in rolling out our booster campaign.  The national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, will make further considerations on the future of the booster campaign in Ireland and we have, due to the work of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, maintained &euro;1.2 billion of additional funding made available to our health services last year.  That will equip our nurses, doctors, healthcare professionals and consultants for what we acknowledge will be a challenging period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked a particular question about schools.  Our public health experts continue to acknowledge and advise us that our school and classroom settings are lower risk and safer when the right measures are put in place.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, noted this morning that with the capital plans and capital expenditure she has available for this year, additional funding is being used to invest in our school buildings and do what we can to make them safer as we help our schools, teachers and pupils to stay as safe as possible at this time of additional risk.</p>  <p>  I will conclude with the point that this appears to be quite a shift in position from the Social Democrats.  Not so long ago I remember the Social Democrats being the lead advocates for a zero Covid approach.  The party is now in a very different place.  I acknowledge that shift in position and it is welcome.  It should be acknowledged that the party was making the case for setting tests and standards that we, at the time, believed would be difficult to deliver.  The approach being taken by the Government now looks to reduce risk, although we acknowledge all we still need to do.</p></speech>

We are constantly being asked by people why we are so different from our European counterparts when it comes to the rate of transmission of the virus.  </p> <p>We seem to be going from wave to wave and hoping it will not reoccur.  The reality is that this is a substantial wave with 7,000 cases in the last two days and many children and their parents testing positive.  I have no desire to get into a Punch and Judy act with the Minister on this but it seems self-evident that where a virus is transmitted by air, in congested environments such as schools the Government should take a longer term approach.  This will not go away overnight.  I acknowledge that the vaccination programme has been extraordinarily good but it will not be enough on its own.</p></speech>

We have a strategy that is based on putting in place public health guidance with immense resources from our country to equip our hospitals, GPs and nurses with all possible measures and supports to help them deal with the approaching challenge.  The Deputy compared us with other countries.  Every country is different and the health conditions and geography of every country are different.  However, in many of the measurements of Ireland's performance and resilience in dealing with Covid, the efforts the Irish people have made and our efforts to reduce the loss of life are recognised.  Every life lost is one too many and in every case where a person's health has suffered, that loss of health is a loss too many for this Government.  We will continue with our focus and efforts in the coming period.</p></speech>

This week, there has been much discussion of the environment, with the ongoing conference in Glasgow discussing how we will save the world from itself and from us.  I also understand the climate action plan will be launched today.  The KPMG economic impact analysis carried out on behalf of the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>points to a frightening scenario for farming in this country as a result of proposals to reduce carbon emissions for the farming sector.  Small family farms of 50 acres or less will probably face the greatest burden arising from the new farming methods that will be brought in to try to deal with carbon emissions.</p><p>The CAP proposals put forward by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine are creating a sense that CAP funding, which has been used historically to provide family income support, will be used to provide for environmental schemes.  The farming community is concerned that this will be done without first considering that income has to be protected before we look at how to provide investment upfront to ensure small family farms survive.  The programme for Government proposes that additional funding be made available beyond the CAP to help farmers to meet these challenges.  It is important that the Minister understand that farmers in my area, including small suckler farmers, beef cattle finishers, sheep farmers and tillage farmers, all of whom depend heavily on direct payments for their incomes, are worried that they will not get the same level of support they got in the past.  They are also worried that they will have to invest more in their farms to bring them to a point where they reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>Farmers want to participate in this and ensure we have a better environment.  Over the years, they have shown themselves to be good custodians of the environment.  Ireland ranks first and fifth, respectively, in Europe for dairy and beef production.  We are at a crossroads worldwide in an environmental sense but we are also putting agriculture at a crossroads.  I ask the Minister to outline how we will ensure that the proper turn is taken at that crossroads.</p></speech>

I fully understand the anxiety about what the future could bring.  It is a future and an anxiety that stretch beyond our agricultural community.  Of course I understand that this issue is of fundamental importance to farmers.  This is why the climate action plan the Government will launch today is a plan for our entire country and every sector of our society and economy.  We are asking and calling on all to play their part in responding to this great challenge.</p>  <p>  It is in recognition of the issues that Deputy Canney raised that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, worked so hard to get where we are now with CAP funding and to put in place the funding that would be needed to respond to the issues the Deputy is referring to.  Deputy Canney will be aware of the strategic plan in CAP, which has funding of &euro;3.86 billion.  Pillar 2 of that plan is focused on how we can invest in the future and focus on the investment and infrastructure that will be needed to cope with change.  There is increased funding for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the dairy beef welfare scheme, the sheep improvement scheme and the organic farming scheme.  Funding is being put against all of those programmes to respond to the needs farmers and the farming community are raising directly with the Government and through Deputy Canney.</p>  <p>  The Minister and the entire Government believe that Irish farming has demonstrated again and again its ability to put in place sustainable practices to bring the best of organic farming into farms all over the country.  We will harness that commitment and co-operate and work closely with our farmers to move to a future in which they are central.  Along with all of us in the country, farmers will make changes and we will support them in doing so to help us respond to the existential challenge we face.</p></speech>

We also need to provide front-loaded funding to allow farmers to change their work practices to ensure they are doing so in an environmentally-friendly way.  Those are two separate matters.  The concern farmers have is that the CAP is being taken hostage to pay for the environmental measures and that their family supports will be lost.  To take small farms of 50 acres as an example, only one third of these farms are viable.  The security of these family farms is in doubt if we do not address this matter in a tangible way.  I ask for further engagement with the farming organisations to ensure Pillar 2 of the CAP is administered in a way that makes a difference to farm incomes, rather than just creating consultancy fees.</p></speech>

This is the reason Pillar 2 funding is now &euro;900 million higher than it was in the previous scheme between 2016 and 2020.  This is an increase in funding of 30% for Pillar 2.  Deputy Canney will know better than me that it is sometimes the case that funding made available through the CAP or through the Government directly has conditions and requirements attached to it.  This funding should be used to support our farming community and farm incomes when farmers are going through a period of such change.</p> <p> To go into the specifics, this is why there will be a dairy beef welfare scheme and a sheep improvement scheme and it is why we will honour the commitment to put in place an organic farming scheme for which &euro;256 million of funding will be made available.  The Minister has already given the commitment that he will consult widely with the agricultural community on this plan and this issue.

Energy prices are rocketing.  We saw two energy companies, Budget Energy and SSE Airtricity, announce cost increases of 29% and 9%, respectively, in September.  Our laoch thar lear or dhroimeann donn d&iacute;lis who will save us, Equinor, has pulled out of the Moneypoint project which hopefully will not scuttle it but will certainly delay it.  People are seeing increases in the costs of their shopping baskets already.  Almost all of the big agrifood companies published warnings about increasing costs through the late summer and September.  Somebody who works in the agrifood sector and for whom I have great regard told me he expected to see food inflation hit 40% by the end of next spring.  A 40% increase in the cost of a shopping basket is huge on top of energy costs.</p><p>As regards the construction industry, the CSO has announced that this year, the cost of structural steel has increased by 26.7%, the cost of rough timber has increased by 60% and the cost of plaster has increased by 20%.  I do not know what the Government can do about all of these increases individually, with the possible exception of timber.  The lack of felling licences is inexplicable when the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is being warned about the costs of materials.  Of course, these do not only apply to timber.  We do not produce steel in this country but the lack of felling licences is inexplicable.</p><p>On the broader issue, what will be done?  It seems clear now that we are in a period of inflation, which is estimated to have been 3.79% in September.  It is 3% in Germany.  The <i>Financial Times</i>yesterday announced that the Federal Reserve was to taper its stimulus programmes.  I accept it has been a long time since monetary policy for Ireland was set by the Minister for Finance.  It was set for a very short period given the peg to sterling and that short period is not really a glowing reference.  However, the Minister is also the chair of the group of eurozone finance ministers.  Is inflation a concern of the Minister and his colleagues?  What will be done about it because monetary policy is obviously the response?  The Minister does not control it; it is controlled by the European Central Bank.  Professor Philip Lane is the chief economist in the ECB and its head is not an economist.  I am not suggesting that monetary policy will be set for Ireland, which is on the periphery.  Clearly, it will be set for Germany.  Does the Minister accept that inflation is a concern everywhere?  Does he expect to see counter-inflationary measures?  What would he like to see done about inflation because ordinary people cannot bear the rising costs?</p></speech>

This is an issue that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I acknowledged in our budget day contributions.  We acknowledged that we have seen, particularly across the summer period, a steady increase in the inflationary and cost-of-living pressures that many are facing.  The Government is well aware of the additional challenge and cost that these are adding to families, businesses and workers all over the country.  We appreciate that, as we try to put this awful disease behind us and heal the economy and lead it to recovery, for this additional burden of rising costs to be faced by many is an additional and a real challenge that we have to acknowledge and respond to.</p>  <p>  At European level and on a global level, there are many catalysts for this change that, as Deputy McNamara acknowledged, are beyond the influence and control of a small open economy like Ireland's and even economies that are far bigger than ours.  The biggest countries are having to confront the changes happening in energy markets and the changes that have happened in global supply chains.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what my colleagues across Europe feel about this and what their judgment is on the matter.  As I indicated on budget day, we are seeing inflation levels begin to increase.  We said that there is a risk that they will increase further beyond the forecast on budget day.  In terms of what we can do about it at an economic level across the eurozone, the President of the European Central Bank has already said that she will take care regarding changes in monetary policy because we are still in a situation where the economic costs of the pandemic are so real that we must nurture many employers back to a position where they are able to provide sustainable employment.  That is a key consideration in the choices that employers are making.</p>  <p>  That leads into what we can do here in Ireland.  What we are doing here is making practical changes, such as the increase in the fuel allowance made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, which took effect on 27 September, and also the changes to the income threshold, which will be increased by &euro;20 in January 2022.  This is also the reason the Government brought forward a personal tax package.  We believe that those on low and middle incomes in particular should receive additional support in coping with the cost of living.  Other than the Government, it appears that no one in this House believes that targeted changes in personal tax have a role to play in helping people with the cost of living.  Those changes, combined with what we have done on social welfare, are what we are doing to respond to the challenge Deputy McNamara correctly identified.</p></speech>

I can read a commentary in <i>The Economist </i>on what Christine Lagarde is doing but I would like to think that we are more than mere bystanders reading the <i>Financial Times</i>and <i>The Economist</i>, that we have some input as a nation, either at the eurozone table or, more broadly, into our monetary policy, and that we are not just drifting along.  As the Minister for Finance of a sovereign state, what does the Minister want to see done with monetary policy in Europe in response to this?  Only that will have an impact on inflation and inflationary measures in the long term.  Are we entering a period of quantitative tightening?  What impact will that have on the Government's ability to borrow?</p></speech>

Recognition that the financial market environment within which Ireland borrows could change is the reason Ireland is committed, over time, to steadily reducing the amount of money that we need to borrow and to getting ourselves in a position for next year - one year ahead of schedule - where our only borrowing needs will be to fund to invest in our future.  I believe we will see over time - I hope at the right time - changes in how countries such as Ireland need to fund themselves.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that there is little point in waving the big stick at Irish farmers if the EU market is about to be flooded by environmentally damaging Brazilian beef in the coming years.  The first step the Government should take in bringing farmers on board with a more sustainable food production is to reject the EU-MERCOSUR trade deal.  It is bad for Ireland and it is bad for the planet.</p> <p>It is a trade deal that is, at its core, a glaring contradiction to the policies and politics set out by the European leaders this week.  It fundamentally undermines climate action targets and actively encourages a hyper-intensive farming model that pushes out family farmers.  Will the Minister commit, on what should be a good one for climate action, not to sign up to this bad deal?  Will he inform the European Commission that Ireland rejects the Mercosur trade deal? </p></speech>

I have made clear, as has the Government, that we want to co-operate and engage with our farming communities because we know they are central to the change that has to be made.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is well aware of the concerns that our farming community have about Mercosur and the impact the deal might have on the viability and future of the farming community.  He will continue to engage with our farmers and the Commission on this.</p>  <p>  On the very day the climate action plan is being published, given the role of Sinn F&eacute;in in acknowledging and voting for a climate crisis, I look forward to hearing from it later in the day regarding its support for the climate action plan the Government will publish.  I also look forward to hearing how it can acknowledge there is a climate crisis while continuing to be against any measure that looks to make a meaningful difference.</p></speech>

In the past five years, we have missed tree planting targets by over 15,000 ha.  We have lost the opportunity to remove 5.4 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere.  Tree planting in 2021 stands at an abysmal 2,000 ha.  The Social, Economic, Environmental Forestry Association states it cannot get enough licences to plant trees to increase our forestry coverage.  In light of COP26, what changes will we see to address the licensing crisis?  How will the Government restore confidence so that a meaningful afforestation programme can be incentivised?  Will the Government take responsibility to ensure that a bespoke afforestation programme will be fully integrated into the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to ensure tree-planting targets are delivered upon?</p></speech>

This is an issue that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is working on in order to respond to the issues the Deputy and other Deputies have raised in the House.  Of course we are aware of the difficulties that exist with the release of licences for forestry.  This year alone, 3,045 licences have been granted as opposed to 2,592 in all of 2020.  We have, therefore, seen an increase in the number of licences being granted.  The volume of timber that is now licensed is 87% higher than for the whole of last year.  That being said, we acknowledge that we must do better on this.  For this reason, there is a budget allocation for forestry of nearly &euro;100 million.  While we are doing better, we acknowledge we need to do more in the coming months.</p></speech>

Victims are severely affected by having their drinks spiked and this practice is also associated with sexual assaults.  However, considerable uncertainty exists in this area as incidents are under-reported.  Often, when individuals realise what has happened, the substances may have left their system.  We need victims to be assured that they will be listened to and respected by garda&iacute; and hospitals.  This is an issue that the Rape Crisis Centre organisation and student unions are raising.  This evening, there will be a rally in University College Cork to highlight the issue.  What actions will the Government take on the issue of drink-spiking?</p></speech>

I am very much aware of the threats of violence and intimidation that are caused by those engaged in it.  My message to all who fall victim to that appalling criminal practice is to please have trust in our hospitals and garda&iacute; to come forward because the issue will be treated with the seriousness that it absolutely demands.</p>  <p>  On what the Government is doing in response, one of the many reasons An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have funding of over &euro;2 billion next year is to respond to this and other serious matters in society.  The Department of Justice will revert to the Deputy during the day with more detail on what it plans to do given the event to which the Deputy referred. </p></speech>

Last month was breast cancer awareness month.  Two weeks ago, this House heard statements on breast cancer and its prevalence.  Screening was one of the main issues to emerge from the debate.  At the moment, screening for women is provided at age 50 and beyond.  There is growing international evidence that lowering the age of routine screening to 40 years results in better detection and saves lives.  When Sweden lowered the age to 40 years it saved hundreds of lives.  Will the Government review breast cancer screening and reduce the screening age from 50 years to either 40 or 45 years?</p></speech>

This is the reason, in the aftermath of the darkest periods of Covid, that the Government was so determined to try to get our screening programmes operational again and to encourage all who have concerns to attend and respond to the invitations for screening and check-ups?</p>  <p>  Given the seriousness of this matter, I will not do it a disservice by seeking to deal with a specific question without having accurate information in front of me.  I am sure the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is aware of it and I will ensure he reverts to the Deputy with a more detailed answer than I am in a position to give.  I agree with the Deputy on the huge importance of this programme.</p></speech>

I have come across something that flies in the face of trying to get things done.  There is a stand-off between local authorities and developers of solar and wind farms.  When someone is trying to get a connection to the grid, it may have to be routed along a public road, possibly underground.  However, before people can make an application for planning permission, they need a letter of consent from the local authority as part of the planning application.  There is a stand-off where local authorities are not issuing these letters of consent.  We have an energy crisis but the development of wind and solar farms cannot move ahead.  This flies in the face of the climate action plan if we cannot get these public bodies to come together and find a solution.</p></speech>

The Department is aware of the issue the Deputy raised and is examining it.  It will seek legal advice to see if any further changes to legislation are needed to ensure we get the balance right between clarity and certainty of process and recognising the individual rights of property owners.  The Government is aware of the issue.  The Minister and his Department are investigating the matter to see if a revision may be required to bring the clarity and certainty to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

In the past week, schools in Ballydehob, Caheragh, Schull, Maulatrahane, Dreeny and elsewhere have urgently required SNAs.  Despite announcements in budget after budget that extra SNAs have been agreed, nothing is happening for these schools on the ground.  This is an urgent situation that needs addressing as many of these children are being treated shockingly.</p> <p>Some must go home early from school daily as proper help is not available in their schools.  One principal told me she knows of schools in Dublin that were in the same position but got SNAs immediately upon requesting them.  Why do we have a two-tier society in our education system?  Will the Minister work with these schools in west Cork to resolve this crisis for school principals, teachers, staff, parents and, most of all, vulnerable children?</p></speech>

A plan was put in place to lead to the recruitment of many hundreds of additional SNAs in 2022 in order that we will be in a position to ensure the educational needs of our youngest are met.  I cannot give the Deputy an answer regarding what is happening in the specific schools he mentioned.  This does not need to be turned into Dublin versus the rest of the country issue.  The needs the Deputy is referring to are also felt in schools in Dublin and beyond.  He does it a disservice by trying to put it in that light, as he does with every issue.</p></speech>

This would have avoided an avalanche of appeals.  I was promised a response and as usual I did not hear anything.  I raise SUSI again today in the context of the Finance Bill before the D&aacute;il.  Students from families on low incomes are being denied the special rate award, even though they are under the miserly income threshold of &euro;24,000, because they do not have an eligible long-term social protection payment making up part of that income.  Surely the Minister will agree that the important criterion here is the assessed level of income, not its source.  Will the Minister commit, in collaboration with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to use the current budgetary cycle to change this?  It would make a big difference to many hard-pressed students and parents in County Donegal and across the country.</p></speech>

The Government and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are very aware of the important role of SUSI and how it helps many families deal with the growing cost of further and higher education.  It is the reason the Minister made the first significant changes in the SUSI eligibility criteria for many years.  He did so in recognition of the importance of the scheme to which the Deputy referred.  I will speak to the T&aacute;naiste's office and we will ensure it contacts the Deputy, if it has not already done so, with a detailed answer on the point he raised with me.</p></speech>

This fabulous Coast Guard station opened in 2015 at a cost of around &euro;2 million.  There are 18 people working there, nearly all of whom are volunteers.  Six of them resigned this week due to: &quot;... irreconcilable divisions that have unfortunately existed within the unit for a number of years&quot;.  That spake is coming from the Irish Coast Guard itself.  I urge the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, who is seated beside him, to urgently intervene.  These people are volunteers.  They are highly valued.  They support and help people who go to see and put their lives at risk by patrolling that coastline area.  The problem is best evidenced by a text I received last night, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	Cathal, as I write this text I am looking at rescue helicopter 115 searching for a person reported missing at the Cliffs of Moher, and no support available from Doolin Rescue. </blockquote>  <p>We need this rescue service back.  We need Government intervention.</p></speech>

I vividly remember its location, how close it is to the sea and the services and how important it is to maintaining the safety of all those who depend on it.  I was not aware of the closure to which the Deputy referred and the serious issues he raised but the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is now aware of them, as I am sure she already was.  We will ensure the Minister or Minister of State comes back to the Deputy with an update and a response to the issue he raised.  I know the Coast Guard station in question and how important it is to the local community and the general maritime community.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and her officials are aware of it too.</p></speech>

It is why we want, over the lifetime of this plan, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and then phase out that reliance entirely.  It is why we are committed to the kind of changes needed in the use of public transport and, in a careful and responsive way, working with all parts of the country and economy to bring about the change that is needed.  I am confident we can do that while growing the economy and employment because opportunities will be created in all this.  Our economy and workers have shown their ability to go after new opportunities.  They will be fulsomely supported by the Government in doing that.</p></speech>

The people of Limerick accepted the proposal.  Unfortunately, people in Cork and Waterford did not.  It is over two years since that happened.  We expected direct elections for the mayor of Limerick to take place in 2021.  Obviously the pandemic interfered in that and delayed it.  When will the legislation be ready?  When will direct elections for mayor of Limerick take place?  Is the Minister satisfied the powers being discussed will be enough to ensure we have a proper mayor and not just a spokesperson for the county?  As the plebiscite was carried by such a small majority, will the Government establish a publicity campaign to ensure people are well aware of what we are talking about?</p></speech>

I have made the case that Epidiolex should be reimbursed by the HSE numerous times in the House.  It is a life-saving cannabis-based drug that can prevent serious seizures in certain cases.  I have been working with the parents of a young girl, Lauren McGrath, for the past 18 months to try to get this expensive life-saving medication covered by the HSE.  The bureaucratic answers I have received time and again are frustrating in the extreme, while a young girl and her family are going through a horrendous time.  Now that &euro;30 million has been made available, I appeal to the Government to ensure sign-off is given to the reimbursement of Epidiolex.</p></speech>

I know that as he raises it, uppermost in his thoughts are Lauren, her family and her health and well-being.  However, it is because every case raised in relation to a drug like this is so sensitive and has such an impact on the family raising it and the health of a loved one that the decisions on it are made at a clinical level and by our health experts, as opposed to by any Minister or politician.  Recognition of the importance of the supply of new drugs is the reason the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, made this level of funding available for new drugs overall.  I will speak to the Minister for Health and pass on the information the Deputy raised to see if further information can be supplied to the Deputy, Lauren and her family regarding where this process stands.</p></speech>

I note that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, are in the Chamber.  The people of Crossmolina need progress on this scheme as we enter the winter months.  I understand final approval is due to be decided on within days.  We need to get the ball rolling on the construction phase.  This is a &euro;13.5 million project that will provide protection to 116 properties, which have been repeatedly subjected to flooding putting personal safety and livelihoods at risk.  It was great to invite the Minister of State to Crossmolina in May to see first-hand the importance of this project going ahead.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Crossmolina were hit by flooding in December 2015, which resulted in millions of euro worth of damage, with many homes and businesses now struggling to obtain flood insurance.  The Crossmolina community has been waiting patiently following initial delays because of design and environmental challenges.  I hope this will change in the coming days.</p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about climate change; this is a climate change mitigation measure for the people of Crossmolina and the wider community.  It is one of a number of projects the OPW is trying to conclude and we are anxious to get it concluded.

This important scheme provides access to dental treatment to some of the most vulnerable people in the State - those who hold medical cards.  My constituency of Wicklow is one of the worst-affected counties in the State.  In 2017, 52 dentists were participating in the scheme.  That is now down to 18 dentists within the county.  The impact this has had means that some of the most vulnerable people are foregoing treatment, have to travel large distances to try to get a dentist who is part of the scheme or are paying huge sums of money to get private treatment.  What actions are being taken at this point to address the crisis within this service?</p></speech>

These have been used on a daily basis, perhaps for decades or even centuries, and all have to be registered by 30 November.  That has created a huge amount of concern among my constituents.  There is also concern among the legal profession that if everybody rushes in together there will be lots of litigation.  When I raised this issue with the Minister for Justice, I was told a Bill would be brought in to get rid of that deadline so it would not be necessary to register rights of way.  We are now getting close to the end of November and I do not see any sign of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill.  Will we see that Bill?

I also raise it in the context of informing consumers throughout the country of the choices they are making about products that are coming in from all over the world rather than being sourced locally.  The multiples and smaller retail units should involve themselves in tackling unnecessary carbon emissions by leading the way in ensuring that such a measure would be a success.</p></speech>

On the EU efficiency labelling needed for household appliances, as the Deputy will know, many of these changes came into effect on 1 March this year, which laid out the energy impact of those appliances.  I understand that under the European Commission's second circular economy action plan, it is looking at dealing with a whole variety of issues relating to carbon footprints.  The aim is that the regulations on, for example, batteries will come into effect before 2025.  I also understand that the Commission is now considering the use of a directive on single use plastic products.</p></speech>

The family contacted their GP who refused to see the child until he or she had a Covid test.  By the time the parents had sourced a test and got the result, it was the weekend and the GP was closed.  They contacted Doctor on Call, whose doctor refused to see the child and told the parents to bring the child to accident and emergency.  Our hospitals are under enough pressure as it is, between Covid and flu.  Many people are telling me that it is impossible to get a doctor's appointment at the moment.  This issue has to be dealt with in some way.  I suggest that an antigen test could suffice in this instance.  I know doctors have to be careful in treating people who may have Covid but, at the same time, somebody will end up losing their life if people are not seen in these circumstances.</p></speech>

It is being used in many workplaces throughout the country, but my understanding is the only circumstances in which it is being more broadly used is in the context of someone having had a PCR test, having been vaccinated or having a concern but no symptoms.  At that point, antigen testing is being allowed in some circumstances.  It is a matter for the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to advise us on whether it should be used in circumstances beyond that.  Currently, NPHET is encouraging use in certain circumstances but not beyond that and not in the circumstances the Deputy referred to.  It is one of the reasons we are trying to support our GPs even more because we are aware of the many challenging circumstances and cases they are facing at present.</p></speech>

It is appalling that such an attitude would even be suggested.  Public transport is safe, and in circumstances where it is not safe or any kind of issue is developing, I absolutely expect Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Garda would do all they can to respond to the issue.  A working group on this matter has been in place since May of this year.  I am confident, given the way this issue was raised publicly and given the Deputy is now raising it in the D&aacute;il, that the Garda and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will redouble their efforts to ensure this issue is responded to.  I use public transport.  I use the Luas very regularly.  I see the work that is done to keep the Luas as safe as possible, but I also see the issues that develop and can cause public concern.  I want and expect the Garda, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority will respond to this issue seriously, as it is serious for those who commute upon and depend upon public transport.</p>  <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Wynne, I have been informed that the Coast Guard unit on Inis O&iacute;rr is currently providing cover, given the issue that has developed in Doolin Coast Guard station.  We want to ensure that, if there is an issue with the operation of the service, all efforts are made to ensure the safety of seafarers is not in any way compromised.  This has been raised by Deputies on all sides of the House today and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, will respond to Deputies on this as the day goes on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400029#EE00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce this Bill to the D&aacute;il following its passing in the Seanad.  The purpose of this legislation is to strengthen Ireland's regime against the smuggling of persons and to implement several important international instruments in this area.</p>  <p>  People smuggling is the facilitated, irregular movement of persons across borders for financial or other benefit.  It is distinct from human trafficking in that smuggling occurs with the consent of the person while trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of a victim.  However, smuggling and trafficking are inevitably closely linked.  Those smuggled are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, often placed in mortal danger and left owing debts to organised criminal groups.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, estimates that 2.5 million people are smuggled every year.  Catastrophic loss of life is all too common, and everyone in the House will recall the horrific deaths of 39 Vietnamese men, women, and children in Essex two years ago.  Ireland experienced the tragic consequences of people smuggling in the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, where eight people suffocated in a shipping container while attempting to enter the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  Smuggling is a highly profitable criminal activity and one that is difficult to prosecute given its inherently complex and cross-border nature.  A co-ordinated international response, including effective and dissuasive criminal sanctions, is vital, and this Bill will strengthen and modernise Ireland's regime and ensure we play our part in that response.  It is important to emphasise, however, that the criminal sanctions in this Bill are only one part of a broader national effort to ensure we support those most at risk of exploitation.  Over the past year, we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and raise awareness and provide training.  An important element of this work was the approval by the Government earlier this year of a proposal to revise our national referral mechanism, NRM.  The reform of the NRM is intended make it easier for victims to come forward, to be officially recognised as victims of human trafficking and to receive the appropriate supports.  Work to advance this important initiative is under way.</p>  <p>  In addition, other ongoing initiatives include the drafting a new national action plan on human trafficking; the development of training, through NGOs, for front-line staff in industries such as the hospitality, airline and shipping sectors who may come into contact with trafficked persons; the improvement of supports for victims through the implementation of the Supporting a Victim's Journey programme; the running of a new awareness-raising campaign, which launched in October, in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, on human trafficking in Ireland; and the promotion of the supports that are available, which will build on the success of previous campaigns.  There will also be an increase in funding to support victims of crime generally, as well as increased funding specifically dedicated to supporting victims of trafficking.</p>  <p>  Turning to the Bill, Deputies will be aware that people smuggling is already an offence in Ireland under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  The introduction of this legislation is motivated by two goals: to extend those existing provisions in line with the relevant EU and UN instruments to ensure Ireland meets its shared international obligations, and to address the practical limitations of the 2000 Act which have hampered successful prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The Bill reflects the provisions of three international instruments, namely, the EU Council Directive 2002/90/EC defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence, the EU Framework Decision 2002/946/JHA on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence, and the United Nations Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000.</p>  <p>  The EU framework is composed of two instruments that were adopted together and which are commonly referred to as the facilitators package.  Together, they set a baseline against people smuggling across the EU, providing for the essential elements of offences and their geographic scope, minimum-maximum penalties, corporate liability, extraterritorial jurisdiction and inchoate offences.  These instruments were introduced in 2002, and at the time Ireland and the UK chose not to participate.  In the context of closer links with the Schengen area, however, and particularly for the purpose of accessing the second generation Schengen Information System, we have committed to implementing these instruments by the end of this year.  The UN Protocol, adopted by the General Assembly in 2000, was the first global instrument to contain an agreed definition regarding the smuggling of migrants.  Countries that ratify this treaty must ensure migrant smuggling is criminalised in accordance with the protocol's legal requirements.</p>  <p>  Taken together, the EU and UN instruments require criminalisation of the facilitating of smuggling into any member state or state party to the protocol.  They also provide for the criminalisation not only of facilitating the act of unlawful entry into a state but also that of facilitating unlawful presence.  The instruments also require the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction on a broader scale than is currently provided for.</p> <p>As I noted, significant practical issues have arisen in respect of the offence under section 2 of the 2000 Act.  The most important of these is that it is an element of the existing offence that it must be proved that the smuggling was done for gain.  This requirement reflects the focus placed, and rightly so, on prosecuting for-profit smuggling.  Nonetheless, the need to prove the &quot;for gain&quot; element of the offence places a difficult burden on investigators, particularly when an offence is discovered at the point of entry rather than through prior intelligence gathering.  While the offence under the 2000 Act has been successfully prosecuted, in practice it is often simply impossible to meet this burden, even under circumstances where it is clear no humanitarian purpose of any sort exists.  The main reasons are that the payment will usually take place outside the State and the smuggled persons may not co-operate with authorities for fear of the consequences for them and their families at home.  These are well-known issues in respect of such prosecutions.  The European Commission, for example, in its analysis stated:</p><blockquote>	In this context, it is useful to recall that payments to migrant smugglers tend to occur in third countries of origin and transit.  These are often done in cash [or] with the use of intermediary brokers operating largely without a paper trail and often outside the law. </blockquote> <p>In addressing issues of proving gain, it should be noted there are differences in approach between the UN protocol on one hand, which envisages an element of material gain in all cases, and the EU instruments on the other, which do not.  However, these instruments set minimum standards for what must be considered criminal activity rather than prescriptively determining the elements of the offence.  Within the requirements of these instruments, and recognising the vital imperative of actually being able to prosecute these serious offences, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance, one which reflects our intention to focus on for-profit smuggling while also ensuring those who are genuinely acting for humanitarian reasons do not face criminal penalties.  To achieve this we have adopted a reverse burden approach which does not require proof of gain as part of the offence but instead provides a broadly applicable humanitarian assistance defence.<br/><br/>A central provision of the international response to people smuggling is to avoid criminalisation of smuggled persons, and the Bill makes express provision to ensure such criminalisation does not occur.  A person does not commit an offence by virtue of being smuggled.  The primary offence under this section must be in respect of another person, while section 9(2) provides that a person does not commit an offence by aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his or her own smuggling.  To avoid any doubt or chilling effect, the Bill also makes express provision in section 5(2) to ensure those providing goods and services in the ordinary course of their business, for example, a landlord, are not captured under the definition of assisting presence in the State.  Arising from our discussions in the Seanad, I am giving further consideration to whether an amendment is appropriate to clarify that assisting a family member does not constitute a smuggling offence.<br/><br/>I will briefly mention the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains preliminary provisions, including the Short Title, commencement, expenses, repeals and definitions.  Part 2 forms the heart of this Bill and creates the new criminal offences.  Section 6 provides for the offence of assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in the State.  The essential ingredients of the offence are that a person intentionally assists entry into, transit across or presence in the State of another person where the entry, transit or presence of the other person is in breach of a specified provision of Irish immigration law and the perpetrator knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the entry, transit or presence of the other person is in breach of a specified provision.  A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to ten years.<br/><br/>Section 7 provides for the offence of assisting unlawful entry into, transit across or presence in a designated state.  The elements and penalties applicable for this offence are similar to those of an offence in respect of the State under section 6(1), except that the section 7 offences relate to entry into, transit across or presence in the designated state rather than Ireland, and the relevant immigration law is that of the designated state rather than of Ireland.  More limited extraterritorial provision also applies in these cases.<br/><br/>Section 8 provides for additional offences in respect of the fraudulent documents used or intended to be used for people smuggling.  These provisions complement those of Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides the humanitarian assistance defence.  It provides that it is a defence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct was engaged in for the purpose of providing humanitarian assistance, otherwise than for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, a financial or material benefit.  Provision is also made for those working for bona fide organisations.<br/><br/>Section 10 provides for penalties.  Notably, it provides that the court shall treat as an aggravating factor any behaviour by the offender that endangers the life or safety of the person being smuggled or that resulted in the exploitation or inhuman or degrading treatment of the person to whom the offence related.<br/><br/>Part 3 deals with enforcement measures, notably including powers in respect of ships at sea, and provides for the confiscation and forfeiture of vehicles and vessels used in the commission of smuggling offences.<br/><br/>Part 4 deals with miscellaneous matters, including provisions for liability for corporate bodies, while Part 5 addresses incidental amendments arising to other enactments.<br/><br/>I am indebted to several organisations that made submissions to the Oireachtas scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill.  These included Ruhama, the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland, the Bar Council and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The submissions made on the general scheme of the Bill have been considered in depth in the course of drafting the Bill and, where appropriate, are reflected in the Bill before the House.  I know there are many details that will merit debate and I look forward to working constructively with Members as the Bill progresses.</p></speech>

It is a legislative measure that is overdue in some respects.  People smuggling is not only an issue for Ireland but is an international issue that crosses boundaries and borders across Europe and elsewhere in the world.  It is not before time that this EU directive is finally being transposed into law, and I and my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues welcome it.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies will recall the horrific images on our television screens when 39 Vietnamese people suffocated in a sealed container in Essex in 2019.  The victims in that case were 29 men, eight women and three children, two of whom were aged 15 years.  There was evidence in the subsequent trial detailing the terror and horror those people went through as they died, one by one.  Some of them tried to escape.  Many of them made contact with their families to say a final goodbye from the entombed horror which they lived through for the number of days they were locked in the container.  That incident brought home the realities and dangers of this behaviour and, indeed, what people must be running away from by taking such risks to get to somewhere better in their lives.  Many are trying to get to countries where they already may have family and they are trying to join them.  That has to be taken into account.</p>  <p>  The incident in Essex displayed the grotesquely lucrative business that people smuggling is.  In that case we understand each passenger paid between &pound;10,000 and &pound;13,000 sterling.  We all are aware of the exploitative nature of the illegal smuggling trade and the after-effects of it.  Many of the people who are smuggled have to repay their debts to smugglers when they get to the other country.  Some of that is done through forced domestic labour or, indeed, through prostitution in many cases.  There are examples of that in this jurisdiction as well.  I am aware of the situation regarding a domestic slave labourer a number of years ago.  While I will not go into details, many people would be shocked at how much of it is happening.</p>  <p>  It is astounding, especially in certain groups of individuals who come here from certain countries and keep within their own boundaries and become a little enclave of people.  There are some horrific situations there and much of it comes from the fact the person who arrived here was without papers and came in illegally after being smuggled here.  They then feel they have no identity and have no place.  They are outside society and can be abused in any way possible by unscrupulous individuals.  Due to the way these people came into the country and the fear of drawing any attention to the situation in which they find themselves, they are left in a precarious position.  Many of them end up in prostitution and in other activities they did not envisage was going to be where they would end up before they left their native countries.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, the fact this Bill will allow for designated organisations to smuggle people into Ireland may form a key part of humanitarian work in the future.  That is vital.  We have to recognise there are situations where individuals are fleeing from very difficult situations in their native country.  They often need assistance to get here, and sometimes people of goodwill facilitate that.  It would be totally inappropriate if legislation were to punish people in those circumstances.  We recently dealt with people fleeing from Afghanistan after the fall of the government there.  Like me, Deputies and Senators received emails at that time from Afghan people in Ireland who had families there outlining the fears and problems they had.</p> <p>Much of it related to people in Afghanistan who had worked for Irish or other EU companies.  Some of them were under threat because the Taliban saw they were working with the western enemy and they were in a really difficult position.  That has not improved for them and, in fact, it has got worse in recent weeks.</p> <p> There were great difficulties in trying to locate and extract people safely before events in Afghanistan got as bad as they did, and they have got worse since.  It was a time that necessitated human trafficking by a designated organisation to allow people to get out safely but, unfortunately, very few were able to do that.  I hope that when the Bill comes into law, it will be enforced as a best practice framework to identify and vet any suggested organisations that might smuggle people into the country, and it is vital that that be done properly.  The designation of organisations cannot be left to chance because they take people's lives in their hands.  We need to ensure it is done properly and that proper regulations are in place in that regard.</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to speak to the details these people face when they come forward and try to regularise their status in Ireland.  Many people who have come forward in Ireland because they want to regularise their status and stay, work and be part of the community here, with so much to offer to society, find that very difficult, as the Minister of State will be aware.  The system is really broken in that context.  While there were delays because of Covid, many of these delays predate Covid by quite some time.  This has further marginalised people and pushed them onto the fringes of society.</p> <p> The Bill highlights to me, especially in light of my having engaged with stakeholders on this topic, that increased and specialised training is needed for those working on the front line in the naturalisation and immigration services.  It is important that those dealing with applications, interviews, background checks and so on be aware of the signs they need to look out for, whether in regard to the person they are speaking to or the documents he or she provides.  The same goes for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the divisional protective units in place throughout the country.  The State has to support these people but we cannot support them unless we can identify them.  That is a crucial part of it.</p> <p> The other day I saw a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Dublin who was clearly from a different ethnic background.  He probably came from Africa originally, judging by his skin colour.  That is welcome and we need much more diversity within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all other elements of State employment.  Only when people see themselves or reflections of themselves in that context will they know they will be accepted and can be part of our society.  That is an important move we need to make.</p> <p>  We welcome the Bill and think it needs to be advanced as quickly as possible because there is a great deal of work to be done in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400031#GG00200"><p>We will support the Bill, which will transpose an EU directive and EU legislation.  I have spoken many times about the criminal confraternity and the high level of interconnectivity within crime.  To a degree, criminals have at times been miles ahead of where the legislative or investigative process and our capacity as a State or as states have needed to be.  We absolutely recognise the need to do this.</p>  <p>  People smuggling, obviously, happens across borders, so we welcome the fact this measure will apply throughout the European Union.  Of course, two jurisdictions share this island.  Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned the scandalous situation that arose in October 2019, when 39 Vietnamese people lost their lives in a brutal way.  It was a people-smuggling operation that did not view those who were trafficked as anything other than a means of making money.  It was a heinous way of looking at human life.  This can be very difficult to contemplate.</p>  <p>  I imagine other Deputies will outline the connection of people smuggling with other levels of crime.  We have heard examples of people having been smuggled into this country who have been forced into prostitution, not necessarily knowing what they were entering into when they left their home country or what the circumstances would be.  There have been cases of people being forced into positions of being involved in growhouses or other criminal enterprises.  It goes without saying that somebody who is willing to risk people's lives and smuggle them will be willing to move anything else that might be considered, given that it all comes down to money.</p>  <p>  We need to ensure we have all the powers necessary for dealing with this.  As Deputy Kenny said, we need a best practice framework.  In the case of designated organisations, we need to ensure due diligence will be carried out in order that we will in no way allow them to operate under some sort of cover.  Furthermore, we must ensure we give protections to those people doing the right thing and facilitating people who are, in some cases, leaving dreadful, war-torn scenarios.  When people end up here having left terrible situations, probably via a terrible journey and being used and abused by brutal criminals, we need to ensure we have all the tools necessary to engage with them.  Sometimes these people hide in plain sight and operate on the periphery of our society.  We need to ensure, therefore, that we have all the tools to enable us to see where this is happening in order that we can address it insofar as possible.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Kenny said in the context of the processing of asylum seekers, additional resources are needed, whether for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, or the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  All Deputies will have dealt with these issues, submitted parliamentary questions and had that over and back with the authorities.  Sometimes it has taken a hell of a lot longer than might have been anticipated and, in many cases, we have not got to the point we would have wanted quickly enough.  I accept that there can be additional issues in some cases the authorities deal with, where they relate to asylum seekers and so on, but we need a system that is compassionate and can address these issues insofar as possible.  If additional resourcing is required, that needs to happen.</p>  <p>  I expect all Deputies will support the Bill.  It stems from a recognition that we need every available weapon to deal with those people who engage in this brutal practice of the smuggling of persons, with which international criminality in all its forms is deeply connected.  I assume people who engage in this practice will engage also in moving materials without whose presence on the streets of Dublin, Dundalk or any other towns and villages on this island we would be much happier.  We need to ensure we have all the tools required.  We need whatever legislation is required to ensure we can operate effectively and deal with the international facets of this and any technical difficulties that might arise.  We must do what is necessary to protect people who are being abused and not leave any room for these criminal gangs.  I imagine all Deputies will be in agreement and we just need this to happen as soon as possible.  There must be due diligence in regard to how it operates and the necessary protections must be put in place as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400031#GG00300"><p>Like my colleagues, I welcome the Bill.  It is timely we are having this debate today.  During the summer, there was the first ever conviction under the existing anti-people smuggling legislation and we must consider why it took so long.  We must consult An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies to seek their opinions on necessary reforms in this area of law.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to bring Irish legislation into line with an EU directive.  It also allows for specific circumstances in which a person may be brought into the country by a designated organisation for the purposes of seeking asylum, which the existing law does not provide for.  </p> <p>Twenty years ago next month, a lorry driver in Rosslare transporting what was supposed to be a load of furniture from Milan noticed the customs seal on the load was broken.  Garda&iacute; were called and discovered that 13 people had been in the container for more than five days.  Eight of them, including four children, had suffocated.  The migrants had paid traffickers up to &euro;15,000 to be transported west.  The traffickers had assumed the container would be unloaded in Dover but it was sent directly to Ireland.  A trial of the people smugglers at the centre of that incident heard the group made up to &euro;12 million a year from human trafficking.  Two ringleaders were convicted in a Belgian court in 2003, but they fled the country.  One of them was apprehended in 2012 but the court annulled that conviction.  Some of the survivors of the tragedy settled in Dublin and Wexford.  I remember politicians at the time shedding tears and saying it would never happen again, yet tragedies like it continue to happen all over Europe.</p> <p> Research by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has shown that the lack of effective legislation and criminal justice processes to address people smuggling has contributed to the smugglers and criminal networks viewing smuggling as a low-risk, high-reward offence.  That needs to change.  People who pay these smugglers do not place themselves and their families in danger without good reason.  Many of them are fleeing religious or political persecution.  All of them are seeking a better way of life.  We know this only too well from our history of emigration in this country.  The nature of their transport to Europe means many refugees find themselves in situations that have led to exploitation and forced prostitution, as referred to by Deputy Martin Kenny.  That cannot be allowed to continue.</p> <p> This Bill will allow for designated organisations to bring asylum seekers to Ireland without fear of prosecution.  We must put safeguards in place to ensure all designated organisations are vetted properly to reduce any risk of exploitation.  In its 2020 report, The Challenges of Human Trafficking in the Digital Era, Europol notes that information and communications technology has changed the criminal landscape.  Traffickers have adopted new methods and ways to recruit, control and exploit victims.  We must respond in kind.</p> <p> Before I conclude, I want to highlight the delays in processing asylum seekers.  Additional resources must be provided to INIS and the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to help them to deal with the backlog.  The Government must deliver an end to direct provision.  Companies should not be profiting from human misery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400032#HH00200"><p>Once again, I begin a contribution on a justice matter by having to refer to the time lag between an EU or international legal instrument being adopted and mandated on Ireland and our accepting it, and legislation being presented to this House to transpose it into domestic law.  The two European Council directives we are dealing with in this legislation date back to 2002 and the UN protocol dates back to 2000.  The Department has acted to transpose the directives because not doing so means Ireland will no longer have access to the Schengen information system, SIS, from the end of next month.  It seems the Oireachtas waits to debate legislation of this kind until there is either a punitive case being taken against us in the European court or there is some significant consequence for Ireland in not acting.  These are instruments, from both the EU and elsewhere, that we willingly and voluntarily sign up to but have a great reluctance to sign into law.</p>  <p>  Being part of the SIS is really important to us.  It allows our customs and emigration authorities to have access to information about alerts on wanted persons, missing persons, stolen vehicles and a range of other information that is essential for those authorities to function properly.  In this instance, I accept there may be some excuse in regard to the original EU directives insofar as we did not opt in because we are not part of the Schengen Agreement, but there is a pattern to how we deal with such matters.  The Minister of State seems to have taken a lot of backlogged EU directives off the shelf in recent times.  I commend him on that.  However, there is something in the way this House functions that is leading to the issues in this area.  Once upon a time, there was a D&aacute;il subcommittee on secondary legislation that looked at directives and why they had not been transposed.  That is something we might look at again.</p>  <p>  In his opening statement, the Minister of State pointed out the important and significant difference between people smuggling, which is facilitating the irregular movement of people across borders for financial or other benefits, and human trafficking, which is the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of persons.  These are most serious matters.  People smuggling is one of the horror crimes of our times.  Desperate individuals and families undertake often horrific journeys to seek a better life for themselves and their families.</p>  <p>  I recently watched a truly shocking television documentary setting out the details, in all their horror, of what happened to the Vietnamese men, women and children, as referred to by other Deputies, whose bodies were found in Essex in 2019.  Seeing their last desperate text messages, sent when they knew they were dying and already surrounded by the dead, was quite numbing.  We saw, too, their home villages in Vietnam and their families and friends.  In echoes of millions of our own people and predecessors, they left their country villages in search of a better future.  Whole families gathered together the money to pay for those journeys, a debt that will take a generation for many of them to pay back.  It really was a horror story.</p>  <p>  Closer to home, I remember vividly the day in December 2001 when a container was opened in Drinagh business park in Wexford town, no more than a mile from my own home.  Eight Turkish males, including four children, were found suffocated inside that sealed box.  Five others miraculously survived.  I remember going to Wexford General Hospital that day.  I remember in particular talking to the then parish priest of Wexford, Fr. Jim Fegan, whom the Minister of State would know well.  He was one of the people, together with local ambulance crews and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who had to go inside that place of suffering.  The experience is still seared on those people.  There is a beautiful memorial to those who died at the site in Drinagh.  I occasionally go out to that quiet and calm place.  I remember the inauguration of the memorial a year after the tragedy.  Anybody who attended will still be impacted - I would say, traumatised - by the memory of the relatives who attended, the words spoken and the keening of one elderly grandmother for the loss of her grandchildren.</p>  <p>  The point I am making is that this is about the real suffering of real people.  Sometimes when we talk about these issues, we lose sight of the fact these are human beings trying to get on with life and make a better future for themselves.  Unfortunately, this is still happening.  Our laws must be robust enough to dissuade in the clearest terms those who would engage in people smuggling and the exploitation of people in this way.  Their blood money is gathered at a very high price indeed.  </p> <p>This clearly is an international crime that can only be effectively combated on an international basis.  The instruments we are enacting criminalise the facilitation of people smuggling into any member state of the European Union or state party to the United Nations protocol.  I understand how our experience of the operation of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 has proven problematic, as the Minister of State has referenced in his opening comments, especially the challenge presented by our prosecution authorities in proving, in a court of law, the for-gain motivation.  However, this is an extraordinarily difficult area and we want to be careful and clear in the law.</p> <p> The Minister has crafted a different approach, the so-called for humanitarian purposes defence, to be made available to those who would facilitate people moving into our State or the European Union, not for gain, but motivated by humanitarian reasons.  That defence must be there.  A defence from prosecution or conviction is extremely important.  We have seen where clear humanitarian support to migrants has, in jurisdictions including in the European Union, been deemed unlawful and the humanitarian support given to desperate people has been criminalised.  That cannot be right and cannot be our approach.  I do not suggest it is the approach of the Minister or the Government.</p> <p> We have to be careful and clear in how that balance is calibrated in that those who see the exploitation and smuggling of people as a commercial business and have no regard for the well-being or welfare of men, women and children must have the full rigours of the law used against them.  Those who genuinely want to assist desperate people in a struggle for a better life cannot be criminalised.  The section 9 humanitarian assistance defence is of the utmost importance.</p> <p> The area highlighted for attention by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is the lack of clear rights and protections for the people being smuggled because most of our focus has been on the smugglers rather than the smuggled.  We need to step back and ensure the people I have described and their families also fall within our purview and are dealt with properly.  What is to become of people found to have been smuggled?  What clear rights and protections do they have?  Some of the survivors of that horror story in my home town of Wexford, as has been said, settled in Wexford and subsequently in Dublin.</p> <p> It cannot simply be a matter of a humanitarian gesture to be given in an extreme case such as that by the Department or Minister for Justice.  We need to have an established policy on how we deal with the victims in all of this - the smuggled people.  What is our approach to them?  How are they to be dealt with?  What fundamental rights do they have?  It is an issue we need to deal with in the context of the legislation we are advancing here today.</p> <p> I grant it that these are difficult and challenging issues to address, issues that need to be approached from a humanitarian perspective.  That would be the view across this House.  We have been fortunate in this jurisdiction so far that, by and large, there has been a large consensus of view among the elected representatives of this House on how to deal with such matters.  We have not had the far right approach that is becoming more and more prominent in other European countries and elsewhere throughout the world, where a fortress Europe is wanted and no regard is had for those desperately seeking to improve themselves.  That may be because of our own history seared in our souls and memories, but we need to be vigilant to ensure that is protected and that mind frame is not organically growing on the ground, especially through some of the most awful social media sites growing in this jurisdiction, as they have across the globe.</p> <p> These are not easy questions to settle.  We must see people who go to such lengths to improve their circumstances and their family's future in a complete and whole way, to seek to understand their experiences and support their needs.  What they have already endured has been immense in getting to our shores.  A country with our experience has a unique and particular responsibility to be mindful.  We can tease these things out.</p> <p> I welcome the conclusion of Second Stage.  I ask the Minister to give a clear exposition of what rights smuggled persons have, what his intention is, what statutory underpinning it has and whether it needs such an underpinning, even in this legislative measure we have before us.  It would give us all an easement that we would be robust, clear and definitive in striking as strong a blow as we can against those who would smuggle and exploit people, while being as compassionate as we can possibly be to those who are smuggled and are seeking to build a better life here.</p> <p> I will touch on another issue I raised previously, which is the operation of Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  I have no doubt the good women and men who populate INIS are of the finest calibre and do a sterling and great job.  The problem is, in crafting the legislation, we put a barrier of secrecy on how it does its business.  When individuals come to us to try to ascertain their status, and I am certain this happens to all of us because many individuals come to me, we have no option but to put down a parliamentary question, which with all due respect is a pointless exercise because it just goes to INIS, or to email INIS, which is the more likely option, in which case we get a standard reply stating that according to the GDPR law it cannot provide any information and the client should look at the tracking of his or her application.</p> <p> That is not the way any other service operates in this State.  Without oversight, any service is vulnerable.  We get significant criticism, as Deputies, for our clientelist way of operation.  I make no apology for that.  All of us, individually, regard ourselves as an ombudsman for our own people.  I am quite certain that people go into public authority with a strength by saying they will get Deputy Catherine Murphy or Deputy James Browne to table a question on a matter or to raise it.  That is a strength for people, but we need to have the capacity to hold all public officials to account and that is not there with INIS.  The opaqueness of INIS does not serve INIS as an organisation, just as it does not serve us or the individuals who simply want to know what their status is.  It can go on for years like that.  </p> <p>After six months, eight months or a year, INIS could tell people they need to submit a document, sometimes one that had been forwarded in the first place.  Then the clock on the application starts ticking again.  There seems to be no way of challenging that because of the structure of INIS.  I have made this point before.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the legal framework that underpins the service.  That would be a great boon for transparency in the operation of our immigration services and a great asset to the most vulnerable of people who are new to us, many of whom are fearful of authority.  We have seen that in the vaccines uptake.  Some people have an experience of authority and government that is very different from the casual and open way that, thankfully, our people interact with politicians.  We need to have that openness.  I ask that the Minister of State have a look at the underpinning legislation for INIS.  He might make some alterations if there is a difficulty.</p> <p> As we all know, the whole GDPR issue has been a boon to those who want to shield transparency and make information more opaque.  We need to have a balance between the oversight of all public administration and the right of individuals to privacy.  Deputies do not make a representation because we are thinking of somebody and picking them out off the street.  We do so because somebody comes to us and asks us to make a representation as his or her elected representative.  This is a matter that needs to be addressed.</p> <p> This is important legislation, which is not particularly complex.  It will give a new arm to prosecute those who have been difficult to prosecute because of the existing need to prove a for-profit motive.  If we can overcome that, we will be able to prosecute those manipulators of humanity and human desperation.  If we can put them to the sword, it will be a good day.  The Bill will certainly have the Labour Party&rsquo;s support in trying to achieve that. </p></speech>

However, I disagree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments that human trafficking and people smuggling are different.  They are hand in glove.  People smuggling is often the engine that facilitates the movement in human trafficking.  I do not think one can be separated from the other.  It is perhaps this false dichotomy that has given rise to the criticism of IHREC and others that the Bill is silent on the victims and their rights.  We need to look at both human smuggling and human trafficking together.  We need to address the rights of the victims as much as we need to address punishment for those who are doing the smuggling.</p><p>Deputy Howlin gave us a most welcome history lesson on our failure over a long period to implement the directives.  I read the comments of Ms Justice Iseult O&rsquo;Malley in a case in 2015.  She described how our system for dealing with smuggling and trafficking was not fit for purpose.  Little has changed since then.  The obvious consequences of that are that we continue to have victims and trafficking of people.  There are also serious consequences for the State.  We are tumbling down the ratings in the US State Department&rsquo;s trafficking in persons, TIP, report.  We have been on the tier 2 watchlist for the past two years.  A state only gets two years on the tier 2 watchlist before it either drops to tier 3 or moves up to tier 1.  If a state falls to tier 3, there are significant consequences.  The United States, in its own laws, will not work with that state in certain areas and it becomes <i>persona non grata</i>, as it were, because it is on tier 3.</p><p>The reform of the national referral mechanism is long overdue.  It is as overdue as the transposition of the directives.  While I welcome that we are beginning to see movement on reform of the national referral mechanism, it is not moving quick enough.  We need to address that.  I hope this Bill gives us an opportunity to do that.  As I said, we need to address the lacuna relating to victims and victims&rsquo; rights that has been identified in this Bill.  </p><p>What sort of politician would I be to simply offer criticism and not to offer a solution?  The Minister of State will be glad to hear I do have a solution for him.  I have a Bill sitting in the Bills Office awaiting approval.  I had started work on it before the issue of the national referral mechanism reform was mentioned.  This Bill addresses human trafficking and tries to improve the State's response to it.  It puts into legislation the Delphi indicators, which are important operational indicators for improving the identification of victims of trafficking.  It seeks to improve the system and address the problems Ms Justice Iseult O'Malley commented on in 2015.  It provides for a more victim-centred process of identification and for <i>guardians ad litem</i>for children and child victims of trafficking.  It details supports and provisions that we can give to victims, and would be obligated to give to them, in line with best practice in legislation in other jurisdictions.</p><p>We need to look at these issues.  I hope we can improve this Bill on Committee Stage by making amendments that will expand the legislation, include supports for victims and address the lacuna and gap with regard to silence in relation to victims.  As I said, I have several legislative proposals I can pass on to the Minister of State which will do just that.</p></speech>

One point must be emphasised, however.  The purpose of the Bill is to bring Ireland in line with EU directives to strengthen the State's ability to fight the smuggling of people.  However, issues affecting the welfare of asylum seekers remain woefully unaddressed and need to be tackled.  Recently, we have heard horrendous accounts of the consequences of people smuggling.  Let me make no bones about this - people smuggling is a big business with no morals and no regard for human welfare or dignity.  That was made desperately and horrifically vivid to us in Essex two years ago when 39 adults and children died as they were being illegally smuggled.  As far back in 2001, this horror visited our shores when eight lifeless bodies were discovered among 13 people in the back of a lorry in Wexford.</p>  <p>  The profits made by the smuggling of people contribute to the international drugs trade, enforced prostitution, exploitation and other illegalities, such as violence and conflict.  People smuggling must be tackled in a way that tells anyone involved that the full force of our judicial system will come down upon them if they engage in this inhumane and illegal business.  That is why I am supportive of the Bill and the criminal sanctions it will enforce.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that the Bill deals with the circumstances in which a person is brought into the country by a designated organisation for the purposes of seeking asylum.  That is welcome.  However, when giving this status to such an organisation, we must ensure it is extremely well vetted to avoid leaving room for exploitation.</p>  <p>  As worthy and necessary as this Bill is, it does not address the problems that remain in the system for those who come to this State in search of asylum.  At the Joint Committee on Public Petitions, we have regularly discussed the malfunctioning direct provision system.  Thankfully, that is being transformed.  What concerns me is the rate at which change is taking place.  In September, the committee was told by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that, as of the end of June, 4,430 international protection applicants were awaiting an interview.</p> <p>That is too many and the issue must be addressed rapidly.  An asylum seeker should be entitled to legal advice when arriving at reception stage.  We were told by the Law Society of Ireland that too many people were still having to go through the preliminary international protection interviews without having received legal advice ahead of them.  Vulnerability assessments formed the basis of a trauma-informed approach to international protection but Ireland was in breach of the EU's reception conditions directive for a number of years due to inaction.  In December 2020, a pilot to tackle this was commenced and it was extended to all applicants from the beginning of February.  With up to 886 applications received by the International Protection Office by September, only 268 applicants had entered the vulnerability assessment, with 161 completed and 107 ongoing.  I do not want to criticise the efforts of the Aire to make good on the failures of the direct provision system but I felt that I should mention it.  As welcome as the Bill that we are discussing is, it is not a panacea for the areas where we are still failing those who come to us for protection.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that we are at the 11th hour with this Bill coming forward.  The Minister of State happens to be the one in the seat who is taking the criticism that can really be applied to his predecessors, because this has gone on for a long time.  We have a serious problem in Ireland with human smuggling and human trafficking.  With the current frameworks for identifying smuggling and trafficking, we do not have a clear picture of just how badly the State is failing vulnerable people.  There are far more victims of human trafficking in Ireland than are officially recorded.  A report by Mary Immaculate College has shown that numbers of adults and children trafficked into Ireland between 2014 and 2019 is at least 38% in the Republic of Ireland and 20% higher in Northern Ireland than is officially recorded by authorities.  There is nothing in the Bill about the vital need for a comprehensive identification procedure for smuggled and trafficked people.  We can strengthen the offences all we want but unless we can properly identify the people at risk, the State will continue to leave people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.  I note the Minister of State's comments and opening remarks that this is one part of a number of things that need to be done.</p>  <p>  The failure to identify victims and protect people who claim to be victims of human trafficking was made clear years ago in the P case.  The case concerned a Vietnamese woman who was discovered by garda&iacute; locked in a grow house, charged with drug offences, and who spent two and a half years in custody.  The woman claimed to be a victim of trafficking.  The failure of garda&iacute; to recognise this meant that she was deprived of the protection regime for victims of human trafficking.  The court found that the State's administrative scheme for the recognition and protection of victims of human trafficking was inadequate to meet the obligations under EU law aimed at combating trafficking of human beings.  Human smuggling and human trafficking are distinct issues.  I agree with the Minister of State about that.  He referred to it in his opening statement.  It is important that we recognise the differences.  It is recognised in the UN report.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, human smuggling is a crime which takes place only across borders where migrants are assisted to enter or to stay in a country illegally in exchange for some financial or material gain.  People smugglers profit off the desperation or desire of migrants who are attempting to reach a better life in a new country.  The crucial aspect of smuggling is that people consent to the smuggling venture, although in many cases the level of danger they experience in the crossing is not initially known to them or to their families.  That is the case in the case referred to repeatedly here, of the Vietnamese people who unfortunately lost their lives in that tragic incident in Essex.  People are put in often deadly conditions by smugglers, such as hostile sea journeys in unsafe vessels and often become the victims of severe human rights violations in the course of their journey.  We saw that play out in the Mediterranean in recent years, with the perilous position and the loss of life there.  Our Defence Forces, specifically the Naval Service, had an important role in intervening there that we were proud of.</p>  <p>  These migrants are not criminals.  It is important that we keep that fundamental truth in mind when legislating and debating human smuggling.  Under international law, Governments are required to criminalise the smuggling of people not those who are smuggled.  However, the boundaries between trafficking and smuggling often blur, since the crimes are often perpetrated by the same criminal networks along the same routes.  I thank that Deputy Costello's point may well have been referring to that.  Human trafficking involves the recruitment, movement or harbouring of people for the purpose of exploitation, including sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery and even organ removal.  The majority of victims of trafficking are women and girls.  Global reports also indicate that children with disabilities are more likely to be trafficked.</p>  <p>  In its 2021 report, the US State Department continues to list Ireland as a second-tier country in its trafficking of persons report.  It is one of only two countries in the EU to receive such a poor ranking, the other being Romania.  The report makes a number of recommendations and explains the rationale for the designation.  It is hard to argue with its logic.  It is hard to argue that we have not been failing victims of trafficking for years.  That blame rests solely with the State.  We have failed to identify victims properly, to enforce existing laws and to prosecute trafficking offences.  I acknowledge that there was a prosecution in recent months.  The lack of prosecutions has contributed to smugglers and criminal networks viewing trafficking and smuggling as low-risk offences with high profit margins.  International best practice recommendations should be central to our mindset when discussing smuggling and trafficking.  With that in mind, it was worrying to see the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's, IHREC, submission to the general scheme of the Bill.  It stated that the Bill is silent on the rights and protections of smuggled persons.  That is a damning statement.  IHREC is the State's human rights watchdog.  It is also the national rapporteur on the trafficking of human beings.  It is the expert body on human rights and trafficking in this country.  I implore the Minister of State and his Department to look further at the recommendations about how this Bill can be strengthened.</p>  <p>  Any measures that we introduce to control the entry and residence of irregular migrants must also be completely compliant with human rights and equality principles.  Regardless of how people enter the country, they hold fundamental rights under the Constitution and international law.  These rights include the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and security, the right to asylum, the right to fair procedures and the right to an effective remedy.  The State continues to fail in this regard.  We need only look at the conditions in direct provision centres or the appalling standards on so many of our fishing trawlers to see just how severely we have failed these people.  We saw a story on social media in the last few days about how food is being dispensed in a direct provision centre.  It is unacceptable for people to be given food in plastic bags.  That kind of thing should not happen.  I acknowledge that the Government has an ambitious programme, although I would like to see it happen more immediately.  There is a significant change under way but that kind of thing is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the Minister of State has taken some recommendations on board but many have not been.</p> <p>Many of the recommendations were raised on Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad and I suspect they will be raised in this House.  There were a number of amendments in the Seanad that the Minister of State indicated the Department would consider and that they would be returned to the Seanad when it was debated in this House.  Will the Minister of State provide an update in his summing-up as to what he intends to bring forward?  That may minimise the number of amendments put down.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister of State to look at including specific provision in the Bill for rights and protections for smuggled persons and rights of women, children and disabled people.  There is often a desire in Departments to keep Bills somewhat condensed and to acknowledge shortcomings and a need to fix them, but insist they will be fixed at a later stage in another piece of legislation.  We have an opportunity and responsibility to make this Bill as robust as possible, to protect the rights and lives of people who are smuggled, to ensure smugglers are criminalised and to ensure NGOs and human rights workers are not swept up by criminal charges.<br/><br/>A number of concerns were raised by IHREC that there was not enough safeguarding in place to protect people providing assistance to smuggled people for humanitarian and familial purposes.  I note some of the comments in the opening statement.  The debate in the Seanad seemed to indicate the Minister of State was reluctant to revise the definition of the smuggling offence so that more discretion could be given to the Judiciary.  I respectfully ask him to reconsider his stance.  A role of this House is to legislate, to make the law as clear as possible and to ensure laws are fair and appropriate.  Leaving definitions purposely vague does not sit well with me.  There is a risk of criminalising people who are attempting to help those in dire need. <br/><br/>We have seen many cases of this across Europe in recent years.  One such case that comes to mind is that of Se&aacute;n Binder, who grew up in Castlegregory in County Kerry.  Se&aacute;n was a rescue diver and trained in maritime search and rescue.  He volunteered on the civilian rescue operations in Lesbos in Greece 2018.  He was arrested and spent 106 days in a Greek jail before being released on bail following a campaign by friends, family, supporters and various human rights organisations.  The charges against him include assisting human smuggling networks and he faces a potential 25 years' imprisonment.  His role in Greece was to swim out from shore and rescue those struggling in the water.  He also retrieved bodies of people who had drowned.<br/><br/>While this Bill deals specifically with the offence of human smuggling, the debate naturally includes human trafficking and it would be remiss to discuss human trafficking without talking about the appalling conditions in the Irish fishing sector.  In the US State Department's report which I referenced earlier, the Irish fishing industry was specifically called out for leaving undocumented workers vulnerable to human trafficking.  In the words of the International Transport Workers' Federation, a union representing fishers working at sea and on land:</p><blockquote>	The Irish government has allowed whole sectors of the economy to develop a low-wage model that can only be sustained by bringing in vulnerable workers from Asia and Africa.  By their inaction, the State is allowing unscrupulous employers to regard these workers as totally expendable, as people they can hire and fire with impunity because of the inability or unwillingness of state agencies to uphold the law. </blockquote> <p>The widespread abuse of migrant workers in the Irish fishing industry has been acknowledged for years.  Reports were first published in <i>The Guardian</i>in 2015, leading to a Government task force and the introduction of the atypical working scheme, AWS, which offered 500 12-month renewable permits to migrants already working in the fishing industry.  If offered the permits to external applicants hoping for work thereafter, in 2016.  A review of these measures was published in Maynooth University on 19 October and concluded that despite policy changes, the problems persist.  From 2016 on, the US State Department, the International Transport Workers' Federation, the UN special rapporteurs and the Council of Europe have all expressed the view that the AWS did not have enough safeguards in place to prevent human trafficking and exploitation.  Despite some changes to the scheme over the years, the workers in the Maynooth report say that conditions have worsened.  The new regulations are not enforced and when inspectors are sent on board boats, migrant workers feel unable to talk to them or are prevented from doing so.  There is a power and inequality issue there.  One worker in the system said it was like a visa into slavery.  We have to deal with that comprehensively.<br/><br/>The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, carried out 454 inspections up to June 2021 on fishing boats and found that 323 instances breached conventions.  These reports have been consistent.  They have come from workers, journalists, unions, international bodies and human rights organisations.  The State refuses to take them seriously and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton's, response to the US State Department concerns about human trafficking in the fishing sector is concerning.  She said:</p><blockquote>	No evidence has been found to support the allegations of widespread human trafficking in the fishing industry and it is worrying that the [US] State Department chose to place weight on one voice and not ... take account of the balance of stakeholder assessment &ndash; including assessment by NGOs active in Ireland in [trafficking of human rights]. </blockquote> <p>We need an urgent review of that and owe it to the people who feel they are in a vulnerable position.<br/><br/>We often compartmentalise legislation and think that is done and that box is ticked.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State said in his opening statement that this is one of a myriad of things that needs to be done.  We have an obligation to put this legislation in place and a gun to our head in terms of time.  We equally have an obligation to deal with this issue comprehensively and to deal with the substance of the problems.  Part of that is understanding the extent of it, how we record it and how we deal with people in a humane way, putting victims' rights at the centre.</p></speech>

People smuggling is already an offence under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  However, this Bill fulfills additional requirements on Ireland from the EU and provides for the implementation of three international legal instruments in the area of people smuggling.  I am supportive of this and urge its swift passage.</p><p>Ireland needs to provide an effective international response to the growing problem of people smuggling.  We must be clear that people smuggling is not trafficking.  Trafficking is carried out for the purpose of exploitation and need not involve illegal entry to a State.  People smuggling involves illegal entry and exploitation.  When someone is involved with a people smuggler, he or she is a victim and we need to protect such victims.  People smuggling costs lives and is a business model.  We need to put them out of business and stamp it out.</p><p>This Bill stipulates that any person who deliberately assists unauthorised entry, transit or residence of a non-EU national in the EU will be sanctioned unless they do so for humanitarian reasons.  Seeing the balance of supporting humanitarian efforts while tackling people smuggling is most welcome.  In 2020, UN expert Siobh&aacute;n Mullally told the General Assembly that Covid-19 increased the risk of exploitation of women, children, migrants and other vulnerable people:</p> <blockquote> 	A new model of identification and early support and assistance is needed, one that recognises that vulnerability is shaped by discrimination and by the inability of a person to gain access to social protection and effective remedies. </blockquote>  <p>That is exactly what she stated.</p> <p> I also agree that we must make a lot of changes to the migration policies and radically refocus international human rights law and practice to combat criminality.  The Bill is very supportive of that.  The reality in these crimes is that in most cases payment to be smuggled into Ireland will have been made outside the State.  Evidence of payment is difficult to find.  It is also the case that people being smuggled are often unwilling to be witnesses for the prosecution, which makes it all the more difficult.  We must do all we can to safeguard the victims from the abuse, financial exploitation and even death which can occur with smuggling.</p> <p> I am happy to see in section 5 a provision in respect of the definition of what it means to "assist the presence", which in sections 6 and 7 ensures that no doubt exists that the ordinary provision of goods and services including, for example, rental accommodation does not constitute an offence even if the person providing the goods or service is aware that the receiver is unlawfully present.  Sometimes people will help the victims who are not the ones who have smuggled.  That is very important because there is a difference.  People smuggling is a business model and it is largely the preserve of organised criminal gangs whose sole motivation is profit.  Women and children are often the most vulnerable of their prey and we must do all we can to protect such vulnerable people.  The criminals take advantage of vulnerable and desperate people who are only seeking a better life than the one they are living now.</p></speech>

In previous years, any island nation such as ours, was seen as a smuggler's opportunity, but at that time the concern was primarily about illegal narcotics and goods and that has rightly, if somewhat slowly, shifted to also focus on people and the illegal trafficking of human beings.</p>  <p>  It is beyond obvious that appropriate resources must accompany this legislation and that those who engage with people who have been trafficked are trained to a standard that does not inadvertently increase or compound trauma.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau needs additional resources and training that is regularly updated in line with best practice, as does the International Protection Office, INIS social workers and the specialist garda&iacute; who investigate these cases.  We must ensure that both those who have been trafficked and those working on such cases are equipped and supported throughout the duration of any subsequent process.  As recently as September, it was reported that specialist detectives were investigating a "growing number of illegal immigrants who are being forced to work in the sex industry in Ireland".  A major crackdown on human trafficking resulted in the rescue of 38 people in the previous year.</p>  <p>  My constituency of Longford-Westmeath has been mentioned here this afternoon.  It was the location of the first conviction under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, following a six-week trial in which two people were found guilty of human trafficking offences.  The judge in the case referred to the individuals who had been trafficked as "indentured slaves", who were coerced into a sustained and degrading period of prostitution, which did great harm to all victims for financial gain.  The judge acknowledged also that the individuals had no real alternative but to accept their exploitation.  Those words resonate with me.  Nobody should accept exploitation.  It was a truly tragic and disturbing case.  I take this opportunity to commend the survivors on their bravery, courage and resilience following what can be only described as horrific exploitation.  I also acknowledge the valuable work of all involved in securing the conviction.</p>  <p>  We urgently need to get our house in order regarding our obligations to end human trafficking, but we must also improve the related legal, criminal and support processes.  While our response must be robust, it must also be fit for purpose and it must be one that reflects the extremely unpalatable reality that human trafficking happens, and it happens here, as we saw in Westmeath.  We may have had the first conviction, but it was not the first incident.  Convictions like this must become much more common.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Deputy Murnane O'Connor stated, it is the case that laws existed to criminalise human smuggling and they were contained within the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  However, that legislation covered a lot of issues, including human trafficking as well as human smuggling.  It is crucial that when we are dealing with something as important as human smuggling and human trafficking that we distinguish between them and that we have individual criminal justice responses in respect of each of them.  That is why it is so important that we are bringing forward this legislation today which deals specifically with human smuggling.  If we are trying to establish a criminal justice system that identifies and emphasises the wrongdoing associated with certain criminal acts, it is helpful if the legislation deals exclusively with the act we are trying to prohibit and criminalise.  That is why there is a benefit in separating the two crimes of human trafficking and human smuggling and, in respect of the latter, that we have a specific piece of legislation regulating it.</p>  <p>  It is hard to decipher which crime is more dangerous.  Both of them are deadly from the point of view of the unfortunate people who are subjected to being trafficked or smuggled into another country.  If somebody is smuggling individuals into this country and there are tragic consequences, as can happen, such as death, it is the case that there will be other penalties available and other crimes can be prosecuted in respect of those deaths.  We saw that in the UK recently in respect of the tragic deaths of 39 Vietnamese people arising from them being smuggled into the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  There are also benefits in this legislation in that it specifies the type of actions the State can take in to ensure we can vigorously confront those people who are involved in a vast criminal enterprise in trying to smuggle people into this country.  Under this legislation, power will be given to the relevant authorities in respect of Irish ships or ships sailing under an Irish flag to seize documents and other pieces of relevant evidence in respect of those ships.</p>  <p>  This is an international business and criminal enterprise.  It is funded by the unfortunate and tragic circumstances that so many people around the world are experiencing at present.  In years to come, when we look back at the 21st century, one of the most abiding images will be of desperate people trying to leave war-ravaged or impoverished countries or regions to try to make a new life for themselves and their families.  We see it in terms of people trying to cross the Mediterranean to get into Europe.  Now we see it with people trying to cross the English Channel to get into England, and we have seen it for many years at the border of Mexico and the United States with people from Central America and South America trying to get into the United States of America and Canada.</p>  <p>  All of these actions share a number of characteristics.  First, we have people who are leaving desperate regions.  Second, the reason they are leaving those desperate regions is predominantly because of maladministration and bad governance by the governments in the countries from where they are coming.  That is a consistent feature when one looks at the migrant crisis we face today and that these people are facing.  They are not leaving for purely arbitrary reasons; they are leaving out of necessity.  They are leaving Syria because it is a war-torn country.  People are leaving Nicaragua and Venezuela because of the inability of the governments there to ensure that the quality of life is available for them in those countries.  That is a huge challenge, not just for the countries that are providing the maladministration, but for those countries to where people are seeking to come in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other countries around the world.  Migrants are desperate to have the opportunity to live a better life, in the same way as Irish people who left this country in the 19th century when we left as a result of the political crisis and the war ravages that were caused here at the time as well as the Famine.  We must recognise that the solution to human smuggling and human trafficking lies at a much higher international level.</p> <p>In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, I know neither he nor the Government can be expected to seek a resolution in that respect.  However, when we look at how the international community has come together to deal with the climate crisis and the recent conference in Glasgow, surely we are crying out for a similar type of convention and agreement in respect of the migrant crisis we see around the world.  It cannot simply be the case that the migrant crisis is to be resolved by countries deciding that huge numbers of people will migrate to different parts of the world.  That may be a consequence and characteristic but there is more to it.  There must be consistent and good levels of governance and management in countries around the world.  This may appear na&iuml;ve or too optimistic but we must accept the crisis of migration will continue throughout the 21st century unless we put in place some form of a more coherent system to respond to the issues affecting people leaving those countries.</p> <p> As mentioned, probably the most important people to consider when it comes to tackling smuggling are those who are being smuggled.  The fact they have paid money and are doing this consensually or with their agreement does not take away from their desperation.  They are in an appallingly desperate position.  I am sure it is the case that when they arrive here, having been smuggled into the country, they should be able to avail of the international protection system that operates here.  I know it is improving and the Minister of State is doing his best to ensure it becomes much more effective.</p> <p> The matter of international protection here has probably been alleviated as a result of the pandemic.  The numbers are down significantly compared with what they were two years ago.  If people find themselves in the unfortunate and horrific position of being smuggled into this country by criminals who have no consideration for the health of the people being smuggled, it is imperative on this State to protect those people when they arrive.</p> <p> I note the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was critical of the Bill because it does not contain any specific references for migrants but as the Minister of State knows, those protections are elsewhere.  They also must be added to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400038#OO00200"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, on his remarks on the Bill, including the assumption of the challenges not only facing us here in Ireland but right across Europe.  A higher level must be achieved.  I thank the Minister of State for his attendance throughout this discussion this afternoon of this important Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  I support this Bill, which provides for the implementation of three international legal instruments in the area of people smuggling.  These three instruments are aimed at providing an effective international response to the growing problem of people smuggling.  Under these instruments, any person who deliberately assists unauthorised entry, transit or residence of a non-EU national in the EU is to be sanctioned unless doing so for humanitarian reasons.  It is an important point that the Minister of State made in his opening remarks that there is a safeguard for those who are undertaking that extraordinary work.</p>  <p>  As noted, people smuggling differs from human trafficking in that trafficking is carried out for the explicit purpose of exploitation and need not necessarily involve illegal entry into a state.  People smuggling is not defined in terms of exploitation but the process of people smuggling typically involves serious exploitation, suffering and a risk of physical harm and death.  People smuggling frequently involves the imposition of extortionate fees by smugglers, as we heard, as well as exposing the illegal migrants to severe danger in clandestinely entering states.  This was demonstrated by the recent tragedy in Britain where 39 people died in a container in Essex and the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, which happened in the Minister of State's constituency.  Those images haunt everybody and serve to highlight the challenges faced by those individuals.  As my colleague has said, they have paid to get to where they think their destination will be.</p>  <p>  Members have noted the high estimates of numbers of people smuggled into the State.  As a State we should do more to streamline the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, process and systems to help vulnerable people without papers regularise their position.  I highlight the remarks from Deputy Howlin earlier about the need for greater co-operation between the INIS and Deputies from across the House, which were well made.</p>  <p>  In many cases Members of this House are the last option for those individuals, particularly the most vulnerable people.  Agencies should not be using the General Data Protection Regulation and other regulations as a pretext for avoiding transparency and accountability.  Personally, I have found INIS officials very helpful but it is clear the office is stretched and requires greater resources and support.  Perhaps this is something the Minister of State can raise with colleagues in advance of the next budget.</p>  <p>  That said, this is very worthwhile and needed legislation.  It is important that Europe is working collectively on it.  Much more needs to be done.  The Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle are aware that on 19 October I restored the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the Order Paper.  That deals with people leaving this jurisdiction for other reasons but such matters must be viewed in the round.  Any effort in this space by the State must be welcomed and we must do more in this space to protect vulnerable individuals.  As we have said, they believe they are heading to a better destination or life but are confronted with some pretty horrific reality.  They feel they cannot do anything about it.  We need to hear more about the Health Service Executive anti-human trafficking team and promote it as our existing services need greater support and promotion.  That is so people who feel exploited and vulnerable can report their position and, we hope, get the support and assistance they need and deserve.</p></speech>

On one hand, the challenges posed by the crimes of trafficking persons very much require collaboration.  On the other hand we must mark out our own policy, informed by the humanitarian reasons why so many people are falling into the hands of traffickers.  As long as there continues to be war and bloodshed around the world, especially with climate change, people will seek to move across the world and will, in general, gravitate to the global north.  The 2020 trafficking report from the US State Department indicates this clearly.  The Government has not obtained a trafficking conviction since the law was amended in 2013, which weakened deterrence, contributed to immunity for traffickers and undermined efforts to support victims to testify.  Perhaps this Bill may come some way to addressing the problem but resources must be provided as well.</p>  <p>  Kerry has one of the longest coastlines in the entire country, making it a prime site for potential trafficking.  What plans are being made to address this and provide for anti-trafficking efforts along the west coast as part of ongoing reforms?  As mentioned by Deputy Devlin, I am also interested in the HSE team in place to help the people who are victims of human trafficking.</p>  <p>  The recent release of the Facebook papers highlighted how it and other social media platforms have been used as markets for people.  Sometimes we are a little deferential to these companies but as a key regulatory and economic hub for the newly renamed Meta, we have a serious role to play in addressing the use of these social networks in general and particularly in this context when they are used by traffickers.  I look forward to seeing that.</p></speech>

We are bringing the Bill through the Houses and it has been through the Seanad already.  A number of issues have been raised and I will try to address some of those.  I will also have an opportunity to address some of them in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the important issue that those who are being smuggled are often in a desperate situation.  At a minimum they are seeking a better life for themselves, as Deputies Martin Kenny, Howlin, Jim O'Callaghan and others pointed out.  We have sought to ensure the Bill strikes a balance in that it will get prosecutions against the smugglers who are seeking to get a financial benefit from smuggling people but without putting those who are being smuggled into any risk of being prosecuted themselves and that they would feel they are in a safe situation.  The challenge under the existing legislation is that it has been almost impossible to prove that such activities are done for profit or gain because those payments and profits are often made in third countries and because those who have been smuggled have often been fearful of coming forward to make any statements.  The purpose of this legislation is to make it easier to prosecute the smugglers and we have taken significant steps in the Bill to protect the smuggled people, who are often exploited, and ensure they are protected from prosecution.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny also raised the issue of regularisation and we will be publishing the new scheme for the undocumented in Ireland.  We will be able to be proud of that scheme and it will be one of the most important schemes anywhere in the EU.  We have a history of Irish people being undocumented in other countries, particularly in the United States of America.  If the country is going to continue to seek the regularisation of the undocumented Irish in America, then we have to lead by example.  We will be publishing that scheme to regularise the undocumented in Ireland soon.  Those people are here and they are living and working here so we have to bring forward such a scheme, which is almost ready to be brought to Cabinet.</p>  <p>  I would like to clarify one issue in particular.  It is a general defence in the Bill for people acting out of humanitarian grounds, and the reason for the general defence is that if we start putting in specific situations, it becomes very black and white.  We can trust our Director of Public Prosecutions and judges to ensure those acting out of humanitarian grounds are not convicted for doing so.  That is why it is a general defence in the Bill as opposed to specific situations being mentioned.  We are not creating a situation where we are designating particular groups either.  If we were to start designating individual NGOs, for example, we would have situations where individuals would find themselves acting out of humanitarian assistance to protect somebody who was being smuggled but may then find themselves being convicted of an offence.  We are confident the way the general defence is drafted will protect anybody acting out of humanitarian grounds.  The Bill will get that balance right while also ensuring we can prosecute and convict those who are carrying out smuggling on a for-profit basis and who are exploiting people.</p>  <p>  A number of other Deputies raised important issues around ensuring there is compassion, and all of these issues will be addressed on a compassionate basis.  These are, as Deputy Howlin pointed out, real and ordinary people who are often suffering and who want a better life for themselves.  We have to treat people as humanely as possible and that is exactly what we are trying to do in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Costello who effectively said there is no difference between human trafficking and people smuggling.  There is a clear difference and it is important the distinction between the two is maintained.  People smuggling is the facilitated irregular movement of people across borders for a financial or other benefit and occurs where the person being smuggled is doing so with consent.  That does not mean that person is not vulnerable.  He or she can be very vulnerable and he or she is at risk of being trafficked as well but there is an important distinction.  Human trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation and exploitation of a victim.  You do not even need to be a non-national to be trafficked.  You can be trafficked within this country.  That is an important distinction that remains but we want to ensure in this Bill there are no gaps between smuggling and trafficking that anybody can exploit.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly pointed out, this is only one part of a lot of things we are doing to protect people, whether they are being smuggled or trafficked.  As I stated earlier, the new national action plan on human trafficking; the development of training, through NGOs, for front-line staff in industries such as the hospitality, airline and shipping sectors who may come into contact with trafficked persons; the improvement of supports for victims through the implementation of the Supporting a Victim's Journey programme; and a number of other important steps are being taken across the Department of Justice to ensure people are being protected, whether they are being smuggled or trafficked.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the issue of dealing with Immigration Service Delivery, ISD, previously known as INIS, and trying to get information from it, and a lot of that criticism is legitimate.  The staff in ISD are doing their best but the system as set up has almost become akin to a situation of pen pals, as was once said to me.  There is that much correspondence going on yet people cannot find out where they are.  The reason for that is we do not have proper ICT systems around ISD.  A lot of people are on different applications that have different stages.  I recognise that and we have carried out a review of the entire system and we are upgrading those ICT systems.  Funding was put in at budget time for additional immigration staff so that we can streamline this entire system, so that people will be able to readily identify where they are, and so that we do not have a number of different sections of ISD writing to various people on that.</p>  <p>  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, section was also raised and we cannot change that, but all that is required from a Deputy is to demonstrate he or she has the consent of the person concerned and then we can provide that information.  I have had responsibility for immigration for the past six months and it has gone back to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, since Monday.  Any time I saw a letter coming my way going out to a Deputy telling him or her that information could not be provided, I made sure a line was attached to the letter to state that if the Deputy got the consent back to us, we would then provide the information.  That is one way to resolve that issue.</p>  <p>  We are coming up to the anniversary of the death of those poor victims in my county of Wexford.  Deputy Howlin eloquently described the horrors of what happened in 2001 with those people who were smuggled and died in Wexford.  It is horrifying to see that kind of tragedy happen, and such tragedies should not happen.  They happen because smugglers feel free to carry out this smuggling and exploitation of people.  That is what we are determined to bring to an end with this Bill.</p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  There will be further opportunities on Committee Stage to assess some of these issues in a more detailed manner.  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the atypical working scheme in the fishing sector.  Along with the Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Protection, Deputy English, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, I initiated the process of carrying out a review of that scheme.  It has been in place for about five years and it was welcomed at the time.  It was brought in urgently and was needed, but the principal officers in the Department of Enterprise, Trade of Employment, the Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have met on a couple of occasions to see in what format a review could take place and how that could be carried out.  That matter has gone back to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, as all immigration matters have, and I am sure she will pursue it with the same determination I have in recent weeks.</p> <p>As I have said, I look forward to having a more detailed consideration of the various sections on Committee Stage.  Overall, this is a positive Bill and part of the broader remit of what we are carrying out in the Department of Justice at present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400040#QQ00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which is draft legislation to prohibit fur farming in Ireland, to the House.  The final version of the Bill, as drafted by the Office of the Attorney General, was approved by the Government at its meeting on 19 October 2021.  The Government also authorised the Minister to introduce the Bill into the D&aacute;il or Seanad for debate.  The general scheme of the Bill was previously approved by the Government and it has been through pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government 2020 includes a commitment to bring forward legislation that prohibits fur farming in the State.  While fur farming was once legal and socially acceptable in most countries, there is now a broad consensus among veterinary and other scientific experts that certain animals should not be farmed for their fur or skin because of serious animal welfare concerns that cannot be mitigated.  There are also increasing societal concerns in this regard.</p>  <p>  There are three active farms in the State that breed and rear mink for the purposes of pelting for the fur industry.  The statutory prohibition on fur farming will, in particular, impact these three farms which are currently operating a lawful business.  For this reason, the draft legislation makes provision for a scheme of compensation that my Department will make available to the three farm businesses affected by the prohibition.  The Bill also introduces other miscellaneous amendments to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill that govern the nature of the compensation scheme that can be provided for ensure that mink farming operators are to be compensated for losses and costs directly resulting from the prohibition on fur farming in Ireland.  The Bill sets out criteria upon which compensation for income loss, non-income loss and certain costs will be payable.  The types of costs that will be covered by any compensation scheme made under the legislation will include redundancy payments to employees, certain professional fees, mink disposal and clean-up costs, and the costs involved in the demolition of mink buildings.  It should be noted that the specific details regarding the methodology for calculating the compensation payable in respect of income and non-income losses and costs incurred are to be provided for in regulations made by the Minister rather than being set in the primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Provisions have also been inserted into the Bill that will allow the Minister to authorise advance compensation payments to affected farmers in respect of any particular income loss, non-income loss or type of cost which can subsequently be offset against any compensation amount to be made.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the appointment of an assessor whose function shall be to examine an application for compensation submitted and to determine the amount of compensation payable.  The Bill provides that an assessor may require information or documents from an applicant and applicants are obligated to assist and co-operate with the assessor in this respect.</p>  <p>  The Bill makes provision for appeal to the High Court.  In addition, the Bill provides that the decision of an assessor can be appealed by the Minister.  The Bill provides procedures for the payment of compensation and includes express provision authorising the Minister to offset any advance payments that may have previously been made.</p>  <p>  The Bill makes it an offence to engage in fur farming and provides for appropriate penalties.  It also provides for a procedure for the disposal of fur-producing animals lawfully seized following commencement of the prohibition on fur farming.</p>  <p>  The legislation also includes some technical amendments to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and a repeal of the Milk (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1979, which is no longer required and is not being replaced.</p>  <p>  I now wish to deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the definitions section for the purposes of this legislation.  It contains one definition only, which is that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 is defined as the "Act of 2013".</p>  <p>  In section 2, we have an amendment to the definition of an "animal product" set out in section 2 of the 2013 Act.  The new definition of "animal product" will include "wool, skin, fur or feathers derived from an animal".</p>  <p>  Section 3 is an amendment of section 39 of Act of 2013.  Section 39 provides garda&iacute; with a power of arrest without warrant for certain animal health and welfare offences.  </p> <p>This amendment will confer a power on garda&iacute; to arrest without warrant a person who breaches the prohibition on fur farming provided for later in this Bill.<br/><br/>Section 4 is an amendment of section 52 of the 2013 Act.  It provides for the penalties that apply to animal health and welfare offences.  This amendment inserts the penalties that will apply to a person convicted of breaching the prohibition on fur farming provided for in this Bill.  The offence will be prosecuted on indictment only, indicating the serious nature of the offence, and a person convicted will be liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 and-or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.<br/><br/>Section 5 is a repeal of Part 12 of the Act of 2013.  Part 12 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 contained provisions in relation to the regulation and licensing of animal marts.  This part of the 2013 Act has never been commenced.  The Minister's sole policy concern in relation to marts relates to animal health and animal welfare and not the &quot;business of an animal mart&quot;, as currently provided for in Part 12.<br/><br/>Section 6 inserts a new Part 12A into the 2013 Act containing 13 separate sections that collectively provide for matters such as the prohibition on fur and skin farming, compensation for existing fur farmers and related ancillary matters.  These new provisions are numbered 71A to 71M.  I will detail each provision separately.<br/><br/>Section 71A provides for a set of definitions to apply to specific terms appearing in this new Part 12A of the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  Of particular importance here is the wide definition given to a &quot;specified animal&quot; which ensures the prohibition on fur and skin farming contained in this new Part is extensive.  It should also be noted, however, that the definition of fur or skin farming is confined to the breeding, rearing or keeping of specified animals solely or primarily for the value of their fur or skin.  This prohibition will not apply, therefore, to animals farmed primarily for other purposes.<br/><br/>Section 71B contains the prohibition on fur and skin farming and creates a new criminal offence of engaging in fur or skin farming in contravention of the section.<br/><br/>Section 71C provides for a procedure to be followed for the disposal of specified animals that have been seized by authorised officers on the basis they are being kept for the value of their fur or skin in contravention of the prohibition.  The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the seizure and detention, apply to a District Court for an order authorising the disposal.  A notice is required to be served on the person before an application to the court is made.<br/><br/>Section 71D sets out the overarching principles that will govern the compensation payable to existing fur farming enterprises that will be forced to cease their businesses as a direct consequence of the prohibition.  Compensation will be payable for income losses, non-income losses and costs incurred as a direct result.  The amount of compensation for each affected fur farming business is to be determined by an independent assessor to be appointed by the Minister.  The Bill contains principles and policies that authorise the Minister to make regulations to specify the income and non-income losses and other costs in respect of which compensation is payable and the basis of valuation for assessing income and non-income losses, and to provide for financial limits to apply to certain compensation payments where appropriate.  Regulations will also provide compensation for the costs involved in disposing of breeding mink, demolition and clean-up costs, payments required to be made to redundant workers, and certain professional fees incurred in the preparation of applicants' claim forms and in the making of representations to my Department relating to the development of this legislation.  Finally, regulations can also be made to provide for a number of administrative matters, including advance payments to claimants prior to any final determination of their compensation entitlements under the Bill, the appointment of an assessor, the form and content of applications for compensation, information required to be furnished by applicants and any other matters that are incidental supplemental and consequential thereto.<br/><br/>Section 71E provides for the appointment of an assessor to determine the amount of compensation that will be payable to an applicant.  The person so appointed must possess an appropriate level of skill, knowledge and qualifications to perform this important function.  The assessor shall be independent and shall be paid fees and expenses as determined by the Minister and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br/><br/>Section 71F establishes the procedure to be followed when an application for compensation is received by the Minister.  The provision requires the Minister to appoint an assessor and to transmit the application and any documents required to him or her.  Thereafter, the assessor examines such information or documentation received and goes on to make his or her determination.<br/><br/>Section 71G provides the assessor with a power to require further information or documentation from an applicant if the assessor considers that it is reasonably necessary to have that additional information.  The assessor may issue a notice in writing requiring an applicant to provide further information or documents or to verify such information or documents within a defined period for response.  Where the information or documents are in the power, possession or procurement of a third party, the applicant shall make every reasonable effort to obtain that information or those documents.<br/><br/>Section 71H provides a direction to an assessor on how to proceed in the event of a failure of an applicant to co-operate.  Where there is a failure to provide documentation, information or assistance to an assessor, the Bill will allow him or her to determine the application in a manner that has regard to the fact the information or documentation submitted or requested was incomplete or that assistance required was not forthcoming.  In such circumstances an assessor may draw any adverse inferences he or she considers appropriate, albeit only in the most extreme of cases he or she would make a determination that the applicant is not entitled to compensation.<br/><br/>Section 71I provides for the procedure that the assessor will be required to follow when determining a compensation application under this Bill.  Essentially, when the assessor has determined the amount of compensation payable under this Bill he or she will be required to notify the applicant in writing of the determination reached in each income loss, non-income loss and type of cost applied for and the reasons for their determination.  A copy of the notice of determination shall also be given to the Minister.<br/><br/>Section 71J provides for an appeal option where either the Minister or an applicant is dissatisfied with the assessor's compensation determination.  Appeals against the assessor's determination will be determined in the High Court.  Applicants will have three months to lodge any such appeal.  The court may affirm the determination, vary the determination or set it aside.  In addition, the High Court may, where appropriate, substitute its own determination for that of the assessor's.  The High Court will also have the power to remit an assessor's determination back to the Minister should it consider it appropriate to do so.<br/><br/>In the circumstances, this legislation will provide an effective right of appeal against an assessor's compensation determination should any party to it consider it necessary to challenge same.<br/><br/>Section 71K relates to the High Court appeal option.  It directs that where the High Court decides to set aside the determination and remit it, the Minister shall assign an assessor to consider the application and the assessor shall have regard to the stated reasons of the court.<br/><br/>Section 71L relates to payment of compensation.  The Minister shall pay the assessor's determination as soon as practicable.  Where an appeal has been made, the Minister shall pay after the date on which the determination under appeal ceases to be under appeal.  If the High Court has made an order, the Minister shall pay the compensation in accordance with the order as soon as practicable.<br/><br/>Section 71M relates to the revocation of licences.  The Act provides for the revoking of all licences to farm mink for the value of their fur that are current on the day before the commencement of Part 12A.  This is the final provision of the new Part 12A which will be inserted into the existing Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and which will govern the prohibition on fur and skin farming and related matters.<br/><br/>Section 7 is an amendment of Schedule 3 to Act of 2013 in which the Department seeks to license marts by way of secondary legislation for the purposes of ensuring the health and welfare of the animals present in the mart.  To this end, a new mart-specific paragraph 40A is inserted into Schedule 3 to the 2013 Act and a minor consequential amendment is made to existing paragraph 40.<br/><br/>Section 8 is repeal of certain legislation.  The Bill provides for the repeal of the Milk (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1979.  This Act is  no longer required and will not be replaced.<br/><br/>Section 9 is the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement.  The section cites this Act as the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  It provides that the Animal Health and Welfare Acts 2013 and 2019 and this Act shall be construed as one Act, as the Animal Health and Welfare Acts 2013 to 2021.  It also contains a commencement provision which will authorise me to choose the date on which the provisions of this legislation will come into operation.<br/><br/>I have presented a detailed view of the provisions of the Bill.  The legislation will prohibit fur farming in Ireland.  There is now a broad consensus among veterinary and other scientific experts that certain animals should not be farmed for their fur or skin because of serious animal welfare concerns that cannot be mitigated.  There are also increasing serious societal concerns in this regard.  The legislation provides for a fair and reasonable scheme of compensation that my Department will make available to the three farm businesses affected by the prohibition which are currently operating legitimate businesses and to all of the necessary standards and for whom this move is very significant indeed.  I commend the Bill to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister on bringing it to the House in a timely manner.  It is important to note that while many of us probably have little interest in, or understanding of, fur farming and it would be an alien concept to many, it is important to put on record that those who have been engaged in it have been doing so legally and to standards that have been set out.  Through the deliberations at the Oireachtas agriculture committee and other engagements that have been had, there has been no suggestion that those who have been operating in this sector have been doing so to anything other than the absolute standards that have been set out.  There have quite clearly been animal concerns and societal concerns and this has been raised.  I think it is appropriate that in 2021 we are acting on those concerns.</p>  <p>  There will be scope for further deliberations on proposals for amendments and I hope the Minister will be open to that.  I have some questions about the huge flexibility now in place with the compensation package.  The Minister will know that during pre-legislative scrutiny there were very different sets of figures set out, by the Department on the one hand and the industry on the other, on the actual costs that may be involved.  I note some of the points of contention are not defined in the legislation itself and therefore it is important we ensure we do not end up in a situation of serious dispute, especially as this legislation provides recourse to the High Court.  It would be an absolute travesty if we ended up in a situation where huge sums of money were spent in legal wrangling as opposed to addressing the issue.</p>  <p>  The position of the workers is also a very important issue that must be addressed.  This is a very unique situation.  There are people working on farms earning a wage as PAYE workers and who are going to lose their jobs because of an Act of this Oireachtas.  In this circumstance it is entirely unfair they would merely be entitled to statutory redundancy and I hope some Ministers will be able to outline how that matter can be addressed going forward.  There were particular issues raised during pre-legislative scrutiny regarding the removal and disposal of asbestos at some of the sites.  I do not know if the Minister can indicate whether those issues have been addressed.  There have also been issues about engagement with local authorities on any planning issues that might arise from the change of use or dismantling of these farms.  Again, it would be useful if we could get clarification on whether the Department has carried out assessments of all that.</p>  <p>  There are a number of areas regarding animal welfare concerns which need to be addressed by this House.  I welcome and commend the fact we have made progress on this issue.  I look forward to and hope the Minister will work constructively with us as we move through the remaining Stages of this Bill.  The Bill allows, as is usual, for the Minister to set out a timeframe for when this will be enacted.  I would welcome a commitment that it is his intention that when the Bill proceeds through the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I hope we can do speedily, he will act speedily in enacting it so we can clearly show this House has been decisive in moving forward on this issue.</p></speech>

There are just three active farms in the State that breed and rear mink for the purposes of pelting for the fur industry.  The tide is turning against fur farming.  It is already banned in Austria, Croatia, the Netherlands, Britain and the Czech Republic.  It will be illegal in Norway from February 2025.  We must ensure this legislation is dealt with swiftly.  Each December approximately 80% of mink are killed, leaving approximately 20% as breeding stock.  This will leave approximately 24,000 mink in the country in the new year.  Currently, there are 120,000 mink here.  We must ensure this year is the last breeding season.  There are alternatives to fur for those who want them.  There is a material new to the market called Koba Fur.  It is a bio-based fur made not from petroleum oil but from oil from vegetable crops.  There is recycled faux fur.  Making use of what we already have and reducing landfill and pollution is critical to an environmentally friendly future.</p>  <p>  The main purpose of this Bill is the statutory prohibition of fur farming.  It will impact on three farms in the State, including one in County Laois, which are currently operating lawful businesses.  For this reason, the legislation makes provision for a scheme of compensation to be made available to them.  These provisions of the Bill govern the nature of the compensation scheme that can be provided to ensure mink farm operators are to be compensated for losses and costs directly resulting from the prohibition of fur farming in Ireland.  The Bill sets out criteria upon which compensation for income loss, non-income loss and certain costs will be payable.  I would like to see a retaining fund put in place for the 30 to 40 workers between the three farms.  There must be a just transition for them.  Mink are an invasive species and it can only help our biodiversity to have all mink removed from the country.  Perhaps the former workers could assist in helping remove escaped wild mink, which are wreaking havoc on local ecology, before being retrained.  I for one will be glad to see an end to this activity and we need to take action for the animals' sake.</p></speech>

I am sure many people watching on will not be sorry to see the end of fur farming in this State.  It is a practice that has faced opposition for many years now and finally the days of fur farming and the slaughter of these animals for their skin is coming to an end.</p>  <p>  The existence of these types of farms has not settled well with me so I will not mourn the loss of fur farms in the State.  Indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in as a party has been opposed to the farming of mink since the 2007 Ard-Fheis so we will be supporting this Bill.  However, like any enterprise, fur farms are businesses which employ people and which have been invested in and that is what we must take note of when analysing this Bill.  We are talking about legislation that will introduce a prohibition on a type of business, in this case fur farming.  These are businesses nonetheless and jobs will be lost and livelihoods and families will be affected.  Like any other sector, we must examine how the issues of compensation and recompense will be organised for workers.  Can the Department detail any progress that has been made on the issue of statutory redundancy and does it foresee anything above statutory redundancy being provided?  Where are we on the request for a retraining fund for staff to be put in place?  Given the change the workers will experience in their work life as a result of this, it is only right that such training be provided for, as has been said already.</p>  <p>  When this matter was discussed at the agriculture committee, I enquired as to the cost that would be involved in removing asbestos roofs which we were told will have to be dealt with.  Will an tAire give us any indication of whether that has been addressed?  As I recall, during the sector's appearance at the committee it was claimed that two out of the three farms have asbestos in their buildings.  At the time of the committee discussion, we were told the Department is looking at a cap of &euro;50 per square metre.  I said then that I worked for 35 years in that business and to talk about &euro;50 to get rid of asbestos is to be in dreamland.  It will not cover the cost.  Someone, be it the Department or the industry itself, is being asked to take the cost.  Can the Department confirm whether it is sticking to that figure and if the additional costs will be included in the asbestos removal?  There is also the cost of transportation and disposal, which cannot take place in this country, to take into account.  </p> <p>On the same issue, has the Department engaged with the relevant local authorities regarding an assessment of the possible environmental impact the demolition of the structures concerned may have?  This had not been the case at the time this matter was discussed at the committee.  If this has been done, what was the outcome of those talks?  The committee also witnessed a divergence of opinion between the Department and fur farmers over how the compensation scheme would be designed and whether it would factor in a dip in the market the stakeholders claimed had been experienced between 2015 and 2020.  Do we have an update on that?  </p> <p> I will ask about the overall future of this industry.  Given that we are banning the fur industry in Ireland, is there any intention, or have any plans been made, to tackle the industry in general?  By this I mean dealing with the importation of fur of this nature.  Does the Department also intend to ban fur for importation or does our opposition to the practice end with the banning of the industry here?  </p> <p> I support this Bill and welcome the fact that fur farming in this country has been prohibited.  I note it makes provision to also ban fur farming that does not currently occur in Ireland involving other animals, with significant penalties for those who engage in it.  The workers affected will need to be assisted through this change and it is important the Department treats them fairly and appropriately. </p></speech>

It is fair to say there is widespread and growing unease at the use of animal furs in clothing and the reduction of an animal to a pelt, a fashion accessory or a symbol of wealth and status.  Growing up, I remember the protests about fur on the catwalks and the banners that read "It takes...[50] dumb animals to make [this]...coat.  But only one to wear it".  It was stark but effective.  As a society, we no longer have to rely on animal skins for warmth or protection.  Fur is a luxury we can no longer afford in terms of public health or animal health and welfare.  There are concerns worldwide about the intensive conditions under which animals are farmed for fur and a growing sense that it is no longer acceptable.  It is not just a case of less is more or fewer are better; none at all is ideal.</p>  <p>  While this compassion for animals and worry for their welfare is admirable and desirable, it has a major impact on the people who have made fur farming their lives, many of them through generations.  It is of critical importance to our fur farmers who have been farming well, legally and to high standards.  In some cases, generations of families were reared on the strength of it.  They know their business backwards and have invested heavily in their operations in terms of commitment, skill and money.  They cannot now be abandoned.  They must be fairly compensated for the dramatic changes in the professional fortunes on which whole families depend for a living.  For Sinn F&eacute;in, our fur farmers are no different from any other workers who merit respect and dignity, especially at a time of major change and readjustment.  These are well-run businesses and real livelihoods, with careers and futures on the line, so the packages must be right.  I commend Deputy Ryan on what she suggested because many mink were released into the wild by misled activists.  It would be a very good idea to look at what she suggested.</p>  <p>  The psychological and emotional aspects of change must be also taken into account, which are factors that cannot be underestimated and must be addressed in the same way as the practical considerations.  It cannot be the case that the State abandons these small operators at the very time they most need our help.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not alone in having concerns about this compensation and how it is devised.  There seems to be a lack of it and it is certainly not the package it could be.  Deputies Carthy and Browne mentioned asbestos and the Minister has to look at that issue again.  These are major practical concerns that are a source of worry to the operators and their workers.  We are also duly concerned about the statutory redundancy and retraining fund the operators have sought.  It is a necessary lifeline for those who will be seeking employment in other areas after years of specialising in farming animals for fur. </p>  <p>  The environmental aspects also need to be considered.  More, and better, needs to be done, with a focus on the issues overall, including the financial, practical and psychological.  I wish to make it clear that we in Sinn F&eacute;in are anxious that these hardworking people are not abandoned but are supported throughout the necessary changes.  There is much more to do for these workers and businesses so people can feel protected and can face the future with a modicum of confidence and dignity.   </p></speech>

Speaking for the Labour Party, and as a long-standing advocate for animal rights, I am very glad to see this legislation come before us.  It is receiving a very broad welcome, which is good to see.  There is a growing acceptance of the need for such a prohibition, as others have said.  We are also all conscious of the need to ensure a just transition because of the fact that jobs that will be affected by this.  For that reason, I am also glad to see the compensation scheme provided for in such detail in the legislation.  That is very welcome.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that although this is directly an animal welfare and health Bill, and very welcome in that regard, we are debating it, as it happens, just as the Government's climate action plan is being published.  I thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Ryan, and his officials, for putting in place earlier today a very useful and valuable briefing with Opposition spokespersons, including me, on climate, at which we discussed and heard directly from the Minister what is in the climate action plan.  The reason I mention it in the context of this Bill is that the climate action plan provides a very welcome requirement for policy coherence and joined-up thinking across all Departments on measures to tackle the climate crisis and the climate emergency.  </p>  <p>  A key part of that is ensuring greater biodiversity through robust and effective legislation on animal rights and welfare and on protection of our wildlife and natural and wonderful biodiversity.  Even though I am a Deputy for an urban area in Dublin Bay South, we have immense biodiversity and a huge amount of great natural amenities in my local community of Portobello.  Where I live along the canal, there is a huge number of wildlife and a very good service offered by the council and Waterways Ireland, in many ways, to ensure wildlife, such as the swans on the canal and so on, is protected.  That is also the case in Dublin Bay, although we can do much more to ensure better water quality and, therefore, protection of marine life in our waters.  I am working with the Minister's colleagues in Government on that along with NGOs such as SOS Dublin Bay.</p>  <p>  This Bill is part of an overall package of measures that we need to see adopted across all of Government, with constructive support from the Opposition to ensure there are major benefits to our communities from promotion of biodiversity and a joined-up policy like that enumerated in the climate action plan.  This will ensure better protection of animals and wildlife and that we have more sustainable cities and communities in line with our sustainable development goals, SDG, 11, to which we have such a commitment.</p>  <p>  I will not speak for long.  I am not the agriculture spokesperson, but I am very glad to speak in support of the Bill and to reiterate my support, and that of the Labour Party, for this important measure, which will see us finally move to a prohibition on fur farming in the interests of animal health, welfare and rights. </p></speech>

It is a cruel and unnecessary practice so we will support the Bill.</p>  <p>  I will also raise a serious issue in respect of animal welfare in Cork city.  Just last week, a horse was found dead on a road in the city.  The day before the horse was found, a number of people contacted different organisations concerned about its treatment and the neglect and abuse it had received.  It should have been rescued, but was instead found on a road in the early hours of the morning.  This was a shocking way for a horse, which is a beautiful animal, to be treated.  People were very upset and it is not fair for any animal to be treated that way.  It is not fair to children and people to see this kind of behaviour and it is not fair to the communities in which it happens.  I know from my colleagues that areas such as Clondalkin have horse projects that have been very successful in changing the way that animals are treated, in bringing a reduction in the number of animals that are being kept on greens and in reducing the neglect of them.</p> <p>These groups also teach young people about animals and how to care for horses.  As a result, they give a lot of young people who might not be into formal education an opportunity for a different type of education, which is something we need to look at.</p> <p> I would love to see one of these projects in Cork.  It would make a huge difference for these animals but also for young people.  It would give them an education and let them see what is involved.  However, this is not just for those children and young people.  It would also give people in urban areas an opportunity to interact at close quarters with animals that they would normally never, or very rarely, have an opportunity to interact with.  They could bring in schools, youth organisations and community groups.  There are loads of positive benefits to giving young people such opportunities.  That is why I would love to see a project like this in Cork city.  To be fair to Cork City Council, and I can be critical of it at times, a number of years ago it tried to do this but unfortunately the planning application was turned down.  That is something that should be supported.  The Minister might engage with Cork City Council about bringing forward a project like that, not just in Cork but nationally.</p></speech>

This is the first of a number of stages of bringing it through the Oireachtas.  I look forward to constructive engagement on Committee Stage and considering amendments, further assessment and interrogation of various aspects of the Bill to make sure it is robust and fully scrutinised as it goes through the Oireachtas.  That is only right.</p>  <p>  It is important to re-emphasise that all three of the farms in the State are complying with all the regulations and always have done.  They have run very good operations according to the rules, requirements and laws of the State.  For many of these farmers, this is something they have been doing for generations.  Significantly, they were encouraged to start out doing this back in the 1960s with support as a new enterprise and a new innovative industry at that time.  However, life moves on, society moves on and people's perception of what is acceptable from a farming and animal welfare point of view changes.  That is very much the situation here.  This will have a real-life impact for the three families concerned and it is important to point out that it is not a reflection on the businesses they built up over the years.  It is a reflection of how society has overtaken the practice of farming animals for their fur, coats or pelts.  It is important, as we finalise this and step forward once the legislation is in place, that there is appropriate recognition of that from a financial point of view, in terms of the impact on the three farmers affected.  The Bill provides for that.  I look forward to further engagement and thank the Deputies for their contributions and support for the objectives of the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400045#WW00400"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the report, Monitoring Adequate Housing in Ireland, which was released on 14 September and prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  The report focuses on six dimensions of adequate housing that were identified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, namely, accessibility, affordability, security of tenure, cultural adequacy, quality and location.  This work seeks to monitor housing in Ireland by providing a baseline measurement for a framework in respect of these six key dimensions, specifically designed for the Irish context.  It raises many issues of common concern to us all in the provision of adequate housing and we can all agree with the opening line of the report, which states, "Adequate housing is essential to the quality of life of individuals and families."</p>  <p>  A number of key findings are set out in the report.  They include the fact that young respondents are less likely to own their own home, that migrants are over-represented on the housing waiting lists and in private rented accommodation and that lone parents have low rates of home ownership and over-representation on the homeless and housing waiting lists.  The report finds that certain groups, including lone parents, people with a disability and migrants, consistently report a disadvantage in regard to housing outcomes.  It also finds that average rents have increased substantially and that affordability is a key issue.  Many of the findings in the report echo much of the Department's analysis of the housing issue.  It is good to see that many of the issues raised have begun being addressed since the report was written through our new strategy, Housing for All, or through other measures such as the White Paper on ending direct provision and the new housing strategy for people with a disability, which is in development.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the housing challenges facing people throughout this island.  The impact of the housing crisis is felt in every family in the country, from hard-pressed tenants stuck in a rent trap to those at the most vulnerable end of the crisis who will spend the night sleeping in emergency accommodation or, worse, sleeping rough in one of our city streets.  It is only by taking measures in regard to all aspects of our housing system that we can begin to improve circumstances for our citizens across the board.  This is particularly evident in the report when we consider the broad range of issues that have been highlighted.  Housing for All sets out our plan and takes a genuine whole-of-government approach to get to grips with the crisis and improve the lives of all our people.  We recognise the impact of the crisis and the scale of the challenge and are committed to resolving it.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place historic levels of investment to promote access to housing, with in excess of &euro;20 billion through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years.  More than 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history and this massive increase in output will provide essential access to housing in all tenures.  Access to housing will be supported also by a range of measures to tackle homelessness to deliver on our commitment to ending homelessness by 2030 under the Lisbon declaration.</p>  <p>  Housing affordability has been put at the heart of the housing system.  The Government has delivered the State's first Affordable Housing Act and the Land Development Agency Act, which provide for new schemes for the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities and the LDA, as well as in private developments under the first home scheme.  We have legislated also for an increase in the Part V requirements to deliver social and affordable homes.  We aim to deliver 36,000 affordable homes, averaging at 4,000 per annum.  We are providing a new affordable housing fund to better support local authorities and increasing the supply of newly constructed affordable homes on publicly-owned lands.  In addition, funding for the first home scheme will be matched by participating banks, creating a fund to use over the coming four years primarily to support affordability-constrained first-time buyers.  Furthermore, the LDA's Project Tosaigh is being funded to unlock and accelerate the delivery of sites.</p>  <p>  All these measures together will make home ownership more attainable for those groups mentioned in the report.  In particular, the fresh start principle, which is being applied to applications for affordable housing or local authority mortgages, will help those such as lone parents to access home ownership.  We recognise that some of the findings in the commission&rsquo;s report on rental costs and affordability reflect the reality on the ground for renters.  I assure the House affordability for renters is also at the top of the agenda for the Government.  There are continuous upward pressures on rents in the private rented market due to strong economic and demographic growth and the restricted supply available.  The most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term with benefits for the entire sector is to increase supply and accelerate the delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors.  The vast majority of landlord-tenant relationships in the residential sector are working.  Less than 2% of tenancies become the subject of a dispute referred to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.</p>  <p>  We are taking a number of targeted measures and initiatives to provide better security of tenure and greater rental certainty for tenants as well as enhancing the supports and services available to both tenants and landlords through the Residential Tenancies Board.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage received Government approval today to cap rent increases at 2% per annum in rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This new cap will operate only when general inflation is higher than 2%.  Key provisions are being drafted as a matter of priority and will form part of the residential tenancies (No. 3) Bill 2021, to be published as soon as possible this month for urgent enactment thereafter.  The cap will apply immediately on enactment.  The previous cap of 4% on annual rent increases was replaced on 16 July 2021, with rent increases in RPZs currently prohibited from exceeding general inflation as recorded in the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICPs.  The aim was to bring about far lower rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies in RPZs.  HICP averaged at 0.73% over three years to July 2021.  Given the unexpected increase in inflation, a rent increase cap of 2% per annum will apply under this Bill if the HICP inflation rate is higher.</p>  <p>  We have also extended rent pressure zone protections to the end of 2024 and are bringing forward legislation to address long-term security of tenure, including by providing for tenancies of indefinite duration, subject to legal advice, and for the enhancement of tenancy protections for those living in dwellings who are affected by a receivership.  Many other measures are being introduced to develop a vibrant and sustainable rental sector - too many to outline in detail.</p>  <p>  One such measure I will mention relates to the strengthening of the framework for enforcement by local authorities of the overcrowding provisions, given this is an the area mentioned in the report.  The Government is aware unscrupulous landlords can sometimes take advantage of tenants.  While Ireland's housing stock, in general, is one of the least overcrowded in Europe, the Government recognises there is a problem with pockets of overcrowding.  We are committed to empowering local authorities to deal with this more effectively and this will be delivered through proposed legislative changes to the Housing Act 1966 by way of a new Bill designed to strengthen the statutory framework for the enforcement of its overcrowding provisions.  The necessary legislative changes will be progressed through the housing and residential tenancies Bill 2022, which the Minister will bring forward as early as possible in the new year.</p>  <p>  Security of tenure is recognised in the report as a key dimension to adequate housing.  As I mentioned, legislation is being brought forward to address long-term security of tenure in the rental sector.  As recognised in the report, there has been a decrease in the number of owner-occupied repossessions in the years following the financial crisis and a number of supports are available to owner-occupiers in financial distress.  These include the mortgage-to-rent scheme, which will continue to assist those in mortgage arrears who are at risk of losing their homes.  We are strengthening the scheme to ensure it will help those who need it, with delivery of on average 1,000 solutions every year.</p>  <p>  The report also examines issues relating to cultural adequacy, examining in particular those in the Traveller community or in direct provision and highlighting disadvantage experienced by lone parents, young people, migrants, people with disabilities, Travellers and others in the housing system.  It is important to note significant progress has been made in this regard and the report confirms a pronounced downward trend in family and lone parent homelessness.  Both in real numbers and as a proportion of overall families, the number of lone parents in emergency accommodation is falling.  The progress that continues to be made on reducing homeless is, thankfully, not limited to this cohort.  Since its highest level, in October 2019, the number of individuals in emergency accommodation has decreased by 2,039, or 19%, from 10,514 to 8,475.</p> <p>Those data are based on the homeless figures for September, which were published last Friday, 29 October.</p> <p> I assure Deputies there is no shortage of will or determination to deal with the issue of homelessness, which will benefit all vulnerable cohorts.  It remains a top priority for me and for the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Department and the Government.  Budget 2022 reflects this commitment by allocating &euro;194 million for homelessness services, as well as &euro;40 million for the provision of health supports.  Housing for All contains 18 specific, actionable items designed to eliminate homelessness by 2030.  Our focus is on the delivery of those actions.  These further interventions will work in tandem with the continued provision of the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, and the homeless HAP place finder service, which is an important aid for homeless households, as well as households in danger of falling into homelessness and which are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.</p> <p> The report notes that, in 2019, funding for Traveller accommodation was not fully drawn down.  I am happy to say that, in 2020, full use was made of the &euro;14.5 million in funding available for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Accommodation for Traveller households is provided across a range of housing options.  More than three quarters of Travellers live in standard housing, including local authority and approved housing body, AHB, housing, and supported tenancies in the private rented sector.  Funding for these housing supports is provided through the respective budget lines.  The Traveller accommodation budget is provided solely for Traveller-specific accommodation, such as halting sites and group housing schemes.  Accordingly, funding available for, and spent on, the provision of accommodation solutions for Travellers is much broader than the reported spend under the Traveller-specific accommodation budget.  Regarding the commentary in the report on lack of data in this area, I am pleased to add that we are in the process of including a new element in the social housing application form to gather improved data on the numbers identifying as Travellers who require social housing support.  This will support further evidenced-based planning for that cohort.</p> <p> In regard to refugee accommodation, together with the local authority sector and the Housing Agency, we continue to support the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in its implementation of the White Paper on international protection and the refugee protection programme for 2020 to 2023.  In particular, the Housing Agency will provide support through the provision of expert advice on sourcing, delivery and management of housing and accommodation, as required.</p> <p> On housing quality and habitability, new buildings, extensions and material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards for the design and construction of buildings set out in the building regulations from 1997 to 2021.  The regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological processes and innovation.  They provide for minimum standards for energy and ventilation.  The nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard for dwellings was introduced into the regulations in April 2019.  This new standard improves the energy performance of new dwellings by 70% over the 2005 building regulations provisions, equating to an A2 building energy rating, BER, for a typical new dwelling.  Improving energy efficiency improves the health and comfort of those living in dwellings.  It also ensures that as well as achieving more energy efficient buildings, we also build healthy, sustainable and durable dwellings that are suitable for the Irish climate both today and into the future.</p> <p> There are also minimum standards set out in regulation for rental properties, to which it is compulsory for landlords to adhere.  As set out in Housing for All, targets for the inspection of rental properties will be set at 25% of all private residential tenancies, as soon as Covid-19 public health restrictions permit.  Since 2018, the Department has increased the Exchequer funding it makes available to local authorities each year to aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the minimum standards.  A total of &euro;10 million has been approved for 2021, which amounts to a 400% increase in funding since 2018.</p> <p> This year, we also launched a new ten-year energy efficiency retrofit programme that will see approximately 40%, or 36,500, local authority-owned homes retrofitted to a B2 or cost optimal equivalent BER standard by 2030.  The newly revised programme provides funding for insulation, window replacement with advanced double glazing, heating system replacement with heat pumps, and adequate ventilation.  The scheme works in tandem with the planned maintenance programmes being introduced for local authorities.  The new climate action plan includes an action for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in regard to non-social housing, involving a commitment to retrofitting 500,000 homes to a B2 rating by 2030.  These measures will benefit householders by providing warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable homes, while enhancing air quality within the home and reducing the amount of expenditure on energy bills for those using oil or gas.</p> <p> I note the need for better data expressed in the report.  I certainly support that and it is a key area for my Department.  It is important to note that the Department has had considerable involvement in housing-related research in recent years, including in respect of affordability and housing quality.  Several of the papers cited in the report were produced with the close involvement of the Department, which operates a housing economics research programme in partnership with the ESRI.  The Department already publishes a large volume of data on housing on its website but we are always looking to improve the available information.  Our statistics and data analytics unit will carefully reflect on the findings regarding identified data gaps.</p> <p> While I have had the opportunity to mention some of the key actions in Housing for All that are of most relevance to the issues highlighted in the report, there are many more actions set out in the plan to deliver a more sustainable housing system that will benefit all, including the most vulnerable.  Delivery of the plan is now our focus and it is being overseen and directed at the highest level through the Cabinet committee on housing, chaired by the Taoiseach, and the Secretary General delivery group.  There are dedicated work streams, led by the relevant Secretaries General, on investment, industry capability and public service delivery.  To keep us on track, the actions in Housing for All will be updated on an annual basis, including timelines, to sustain momentum on delivery during the lifetime of the plan.</p> <p> I thank the IHREC for sharing its work and findings.  I look forward to hearing the commentary from Members on the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400046#XX00200"><p>I thank the Business Committee for agreeing to my request to have a debate on this important report, Monitoring Adequate Housing in Ireland, by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I wanted this debate not only to discuss the contents of the report but also because what the report's authors and sponsors are trying to do is really important.  I am somewhat surprised and a little disappointed that in the 15 minutes of his opening statement, the Minister of State spent three of them talking about the report and the remainder about all the good things the Government is promising to do.  While the Government will, of course, use its time to promote the work it is doing, I would have thought that a little more considered commentary on the report itself, particularly some of the things the authors are urging all of us to do, would be valuable.  I will outline what I mean by that presently.</p>  <p>  What is really important about this report is that it is not just another description of the very difficult circumstances in which tens of thousands of people find themselves across the State.  There have been many such reports produced by many good organisations.  The IHREC has a very specific statutory function, which is not just to document cases of inequality but to assist the State in trying to understand fully the causes of that inequality and to monitor and measure it in order that, as the Government rolls out the measures the Minister of State outlined, we will have some evidence base to determine whether they make any difference.  For instance, one of the issues the Government certainly needs to consider is whether it is going to embrace the kind of methodology that underlines the analysis in this report, which I will summarise shortly.  More importantly, consideration must be given to a commitment to assessing the Government's actions and their outcomes over the weeks, months and years ahead against what is being proposed in this report.</p>  <p>  What the IHREC is trying to do, in particular, is to say it is time we had a robust methodology for understanding and measuring housing adequacy.  In fact, the methodology it sets out is quite innovative.  It captures a broad range of circumstances, which gives us a much more profound insight into housing inadequacy and, in particular, how it affects specific groups of people.  The Minister of State quickly ran through the six dimensions or criteria set out in the report but it is really important to understand them fully.  Obviously, access to housing is key and that rests on supply, especially the supply of affordable purchase homes, social rental housing and affordable rental homes in the private rental sector.  While the report acknowledges there has been some progress to date, it also mentions that this progress is from a very low base and, therefore, access is still a fundamental problem.</p>  <p>  On affordability, the report outlines three indicators.  This is interesting because "affordability" is one of the most used and most misunderstood words in the housing debate.  The report outlines what is referred to as the 30:40 rule, which involves looking at households in the bottom four income deciles, which are spending more than 30% of their net income on mortgages or rents.  It looks at the prevalence of what it calls post-housing poverty rates.</p> <p>Paying very high housing costs makes people even more likely to be experiencing poverty in other aspects of their lives.</p> <p> It also looks at prevalence of rent and mortgage arrears.  The first of those is one the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and others have used before.  Having that broader definition of affordability is crucial because it means when any of us are talking about increasing supply of private or public homes, we have to ensure that supply is done in a way that meets those kinds of indicators.  It is a fundamental shift.  It talks about security, both the length of tenure in accommodation and the security in that tenure.  I will come back at the end to some of the Minister of State's comments on recent Cabinet decisions.</p> <p> There is a cultural adequacy issue.  This is not just about ensuring Travellers have access to culturally appropriate accommodation, where those families and individuals choose that, but whatever interim accommodation we provide for people seeking asylum in this country being culturally appropriate.  I will respond to the Minister of State's comments on the Governments action on that to date.</p> <p> Housing quality is very important.  So much of our focus across the Chamber has been on increasing output that we have not paid enough attention to whether the quality of the accommodation already in our stock meets people's needs and how to ensure it is improved as new stock comes online.  The Irish Government is still in breach of Article 16 of the European Convention on Human Rights, following the collective complaint taken by the residents of a large number of social housing projects throughout the State some years ago.  While the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has given us a detailed response to that, the most recent communication from the relevant committee in Strasbourg is the Government is still in breach of that article, notwithstanding the improvements it claims to have made.  If we cannot even ensure the accommodation for existing social housing tenants is adequate, under international legal obligations, what hope do we have of improving accommodation into the future?</p> <p> Location is also absolutely key.  This is the sixth indicator in terms of proximity to services and access to other amenities.  The Minister of State talked through some of the findings and I will not repeat those here, other than to say they confirm what many of us have known for a long time, that specific groups of people are structurally disadvantaged in our housing system and continue to be so, despite five years of Rebuilding Ireland and housing policies before that.  Many of us will be keeping an open mind, but will be quite sceptical as to whether at the end of the current Government's housing plan, if we get to its end, those groups will be any less structurally disadvantaged.  I hope they are, but the jury will be out on that for quite some time.</p> <p> In addition to trying to provide a methodology, which the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is urging all of us to embrace as a tool for independently assessing the progress of what the Government is doing, it also sets out a number of challenges.  Some of those relate to Covid and the potential for homelessness to start rising again, which we have seen in the past four months of departmental reports, as we ease our way out of Covid and protections for renters have been lifted.</p> <p> There is the continual rise in rents.  We will have a more detailed debate about the Minister's latest attempt to clean up the mess of his last attempt to clean up the mess of his previous three or four attempts to clean up Eoghan Murphy's mess, when we debate the legislation in a couple of week's time.</p> <p> Data is also absolutely crucial.  The Minister is right that we will finally get a Traveller identifier in the housing needs assessment.  It took the Department three years from when that recommendation was made by the expert group on Traveller accommodation to when it will happen.  We will not get it until next year's housing needs assessment.  We will not get the data until the following year, so it will be four years.  It is taking us four years to make one, very important, but very small change in the overall quality of the data sets we have.</p> <p> The Government needs to take the issue of how we best produce the data.  This is no disrespect to any official in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, because they are busy doing other things, but I am not convinced they have the time or expertise to be primarily responsible for the collation and publication of data.  That would be much better dealt with by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Housing Agency on a whole range of fronts.</p> <p> The Minister of State is codding himself if he thinks the list of actions he read out will tackle the fundamental structural problems underlying the kinds of housing disadvantage this report exposes.  The policies he has outlined and the policy document on which it is based are broadly within the policy consensus that has dominated housing policy for successive Governments here since the 1990s.  Those structural problems have been here through all of that.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is a decent man and genuinely cares about the structural inequalities we are discussing, notwithstanding the content of some of the speech he is, unfortunately, obliged to read out as a consequence of being a junior Minister of State.  As future monitoring reports from organisations such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are published, I ask him not to ignore or dismiss them and rely solely on the statistics and public lines provided to him by his policy advisers or civil servants.  If they continue in the direction in which they have been going in recent years or deteriorate, I ask him to stop and absorb the information this independent body, established under statute by previous Governments, is providing to say things are not working and need to be done differently.</p> <p> It is easy for the Government to dismiss the Opposition and accuse us of playing politics and not wanting to help.  While I reject those claims when they are made, it is easy for the Government to do that.  It is much more difficult for the Government to ignore the independent, rigorous and evidence-based research produced by organisations such as these.  All I ask the Minister of State, despite the fact he has spent most of his time ignoring this report in his speech today, is not to ignore it when he goes back to the Custom House and embrace it and use it as a tool to improve housing policy into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400047#YY00200"><p>We welcome this opportunity to speak to this important report on an area of Irish life which has seen a huge level of public policy failure over many generations and possibly since the foundations of the State.  I will speak to some of the key findings and challenges it presents us all with and some of the solutions.  The Minister of State has spent some of his allotted time on the report, but there are key findings about lone parents who are significantly affected and of whom less than 25% reported home ownership, compared with 70% of the total population.</p>  <p>  Ethnic minority groups are at a significantly higher risk of overcrowding.  More than 35% of Asian-Irish, 39% of Travellers and 40% of Black-Black Irish live in overcrowded accommodation, compared with 6% of the total population.  Some 48% of migrants live in the private rental sector, compared with 9% of those born in Ireland.  Some 29% of persons living with a disability experience housing quality issues when compared with the 21% of those without a disability.  The continuing problem of homelessness highlights a disadvantaged section of the community for which the most basic measure of adequate housing, as envisaged under international human rights agreements, is not being met.</p>  <p>  The key challenges which the report outlines are Covid and homelessness.  Use of private rental accommodation has been outlined in the previous points, but rents are rising faster than wages.  Despite the introduction of rent pressure zones in late 2016, rents have increased by almost 40% in Dublin and 20% elsewhere.  Rental costs have risen at a faster rate than mean earnings in Dublin and elsewhere.  In 2020, mean monthly rent in Ireland was estimated to be 31% of mean monthly earnings.</p>  <p>  In terms of what this means and what we need to address, it is a fundamental problem because, in the Irish context, a hugely disproportionate amount of families' and individuals' income is spent on accommodation.  It is totally disproportionate to the rest of Europe.  Their ability to live good and love- and fun-filled lives is being strangled because they are ploughing all this money into accommodation for their rent or mortgage repayments.  We need a national rent freeze.</p>  <p>  The discussion has been well-articulated in this House and it is not unconstitutional, despite what the Minister of State's colleagues might say.  Private renters and those renting from local authorities are at a significantly higher rates of poverty than owner occupiers.  This highlights the need for greater protections for tenants and why so many of those entering homelessness are coming from the private rental sector.  Inadequate housing and poor housing quality is inevitably associated with higher mortality rates.</p> <p>The figures clearly show that we need to reformulate our approach to housing policies to reflect that there are many people who live alone, many people who never marry, or who are lone parents.  We must not keep calculating affordability on the basis of joint incomes.  I grew up in an Ireland where it was not unusual for a mortgage to be able to be obtained by a family that had one earner.  Clearly, this has led to the current situation, where you cannot effectively get a mortgage unless you are part of a dual income household.  It is clearly leading to detrimental outcomes for those who are living alone, both for affordability and housing quality.  We have to grapple with that.  That is a change in the relatively recent past.</p> <p> We need more disaggregated data, particularly related to nationality and disability, as well as further research in order to ensure accurate representation.  There must also be targeted data collection which goes further to ensure adequate representation from certain groups, including the Traveller and Roma communities.  There is a strong case for a comprehensive national survey on housing adequacy and affordability.  Unfortunately, a person's housing sometimes says more about their status in Irish life than any other facet of their life.  </p> <p> I will re-emphasise this point to the Minister of State.  Our dysfunctional housing market and our dysfunctional housing history are making people desperately unhappy.  If we did it differently, people in general will be leading much more fulfilling, much more love-filled and much more fun-filled lives.  That is on all of us.  The model which has been created is just not sustainable for those who want to live.</p></speech>

It looks as if we will continue to speak about it for some time.  I give credit to the Government - as I would of course, and as one would expect of me &ndash; for the efforts being made to tackle this subject, and to make the money available to deal with the problem.  This is notwithstanding the fact that the problem is getting away from us at the same time.  It is like chasing a runaway horse.  If the horse would stand still, we would catch up much quicker.  The same applies to the housing situation.  That is the way it has been in my time in public life.  Mention was made about how people qualify for what I call &ldquo;local authority housing&rdquo;.  I refuse to accept the term &ldquo;social housing&rdquo;, because it carries with it a stigma and a suggestion that it is something for nothing.  It is not.  The person who gets what is now referred to as a &ldquo;social house&rdquo; has to pay for it, end of story.  They have no problem with that.  They are proud to pay for it.  In fact, they are also proud to buy their home, when they have the financial ability to do so.</p>  <p>  We have come on quite a distance.  When I started off in this business a long time ago, a woman with one child would never have gotten house.  That was until I, in my small way as a member of a local authority, decided in conjunction with a progressive county manager that in this scenario we would be housing two people and not one person plus nobody.  That became the norm throughout the country in a short period of time.  This proves that in each small way we can improve the situation by virtue of our ability to deal with the situation as we find it on the ground.  That still prevails.  </p>  <p>  My colleague across the House and I were on the same committee seven or eight years ago.  At that stage, the situation was different.  An emergency response was needed then.  Unfortunately, there was not a great deal of money available.  Emergency housing would have been beneficial at that time, if it had been possible to deliver it, but it was not.  It was unfortunate that we were coming out of a financial crash that left the place like a desert.  I am not blaming anybody for it.  It just happened.  We had to deal with it as we saw fit.</p>  <p>  I will revert to the situation that prevailed before.  Monitoring of the issue is important.  Tweaking of the issue in response to that monitoring is equally important.  It is my hope that the Minister of State would aspire to do so in the weeks, months, and years ahead, as particular issues will arise.</p>  <p>  I am thinking of the list system.  We seem to be preoccupied with lists in this country.  We have a waiting list for everything now.  We have waiting lists for health services, waiting lists to get into schools in some places, and waiting lists for housing.  The lists seem to get longer and longer as time goes by.  The problem, as far as I can see it, affects young people and young adults in particular.  Youth is a short window in the life of a person.  Soon, they move into adulthood and inevitably, they move further away.  In order for their confidence in society and the system to be maintained, it is essential that we respond to their needs within a reasonable timeframe.  For example, it is appalling to tell people, as has been the case all over the country, that if they require a home, they should come back in ten years and then we will be able look after them.  That is not a new thing.  I am not suggesting it is happening only now but it has always been the case.  It is utterly crazy and disheartening to the people concerned who often give up.  They say that there not much sense in waiting.</p>  <p>  I want to point out one or two quick things in the time available.  I wish somebody would arrange for a debate on housing in this House, so that we could make a substantial contribution.  Currently, we are having debates over a 20-minute or half-hour period.  This would not have happened years ago at all.  We would have had a longer debate on the issue, and everybody could speak on it.  That is all unfortunately gone now, in the interest of expediency, in doing the job quicker, and so on.</p></speech>

That is reassuring but it does not solve the problem, unfortunately.</p>  <p>  I will revert to a couple of things that need to be looked at.  First, it is proposed to revise the income thresholds and ceilings for qualification for what I call a local authority house.  It is long past the time for that.  For example, in my constituency of Kildare North, &euro;37,500 is the upper limit for a couple with one child, currently living in rental accommodation costing &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400 per month.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows as well as I do that this is expecting people to create savings and to hang on in that particular situation, as they see it, forever.  They worry and fret about it on a daily basis.  They know the difficulties at present.  They would love to and are willing to buy a house, but they cannot because they will not be able to accumulate a deposit.  If their parents give them the deposit, it is considered contribution to the inflation, which of course it is.  However, the fact of the matter is that they are willing.  We need to ensure that those who have been in rented accommodation for a period of time should get credit by way of a reduction of the deposit they require.  It is a reasonable thing to do and it is possible.  Do not forget that when the old Housing Finance Agency was first introduced, eventually, the deposit was nil, &pound;150 or &pound;200, as it was the time.  It worked perfectly, because the person got a house instantly.  They were able to buy their house.  There was the grant and that was the deposit then.  They then got into their home.  They were able to work to keep their own home.  That incentive was there.  That is one thing I would do.  I would strongly urge that it would be taken into account.</p>  <p>  The other thing that should be taken into account relates to the person who wishes to buy a home.  I want to be clear about this.  There is a great deal of confusion between the role of a local authority, which is a housing authority, and a bank, which is a financial institution.  The two are not the same.  Their responsibilities are not the same.  The housing authority has the responsibility for meeting the housing needs of the population, as they as they present themselves to them.  A bank or a lending institution has only one thing to do.  That is to lend on the basis of the criteria pertaining to the loans, the availability of loans, and so on.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the two issues have merged in recent years.  That was caused by the fact that a local authority would only consider a person's application for a loan if he or she had failed to get a loan from a bank.  What a stupid situation that was.  I cannot understand why that criterion was ever introduced because it clearly put the onus on local authorities to take the people carrying the big risk while the banks would take the others.  It was absolutely crazy.  I ask that an instruction be given to the local authorities to the effect that they are housing authorities.  A housing authority carries different responsibilities altogether.  Trying to assess the eligibility for a person's entitlement to housing on the basis of savings or such is not part of a local authority's problem, and should not be.  That practice should be discontinued as soon as possible.</p> <p> Previous speakers referred to HAP.  I would like about an hour to talk about HAP at some stage in the future, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could arrange that.</p></speech>

I have 3.5 minutes, so I will get straight to it.</p>  <p>  IHREC's report draws our attention to areas in which Ireland's housing system is inadequate.  Many good points were raised by my colleague.  We always raise points here in the Chamber, as has been mentioned previously, including in respect of affordability, access, and medium- to long-term tenure.  I will focus on two cohorts in my community, which the report has highlighted as suffering acutely in the context of adequate housing.  In Clare, based on information compiled by the council, members of the Traveller community accounted for a stark 52% of the homeless figures last year, although they comprise less than 1% of the overall population.  They represent more than half of the total number of people affected by homelessness in Clare.  The report flags that only 2% of those on the summary of social housing assessments for 2020, which catalogues the level of unmet need for social housing, are categorised as Travellers.  These numbers just do not add up.  It is concerning because without proper disaggregated data, adequate plans cannot be made and adequate housing will not be delivered.  This matter must be addressed.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children's report, No End in Site, published in May exposed overcapacity at one Traveller site in particular and assessed it in the context of children's rights.  The analysis was stark and appalling.  A report from the Office of the Planning Regulator regarding the 31 local authority county development plans showed that only four contain Traveller-specific objectives and that only one has a potential future site mapped for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Last year in Clare, there were proposals to create five more versions of a previous model of Traveller-specific accommodation.  I was also made aware at the time that there were 15 Traveller-specific accommodation units of the same model vacant due to historical reasons.  What was the issue there?  Why can these voids not be brought back into use?</p>  <p>  I would like to discuss the housing rights of disabled people.  Disabled people are the only group that have their own specific national housing policy.  Initially, they had a four-year tenure, which was extended for another four years.  What has been achieved?  The report shows that disabled people are more likely to experience housing deprivation, including incidences of mould, lack of sufficient insulation and an inability to keep their houses warm.  Although the report identifies the fact that disabled people do not necessarily spend long periods on social housing waiting lists, which is welcome, we have to remember that the official numbers of disabled people in need of adequate housing are likely to be distorted.  At meetings of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, I have heard many testimonies about the barriers to independent living.  Despite eight years of the national strategy, access to housing for disabled people is still largely inadequate.  They are the hidden homeless.  Many are forced to live in congregated settings against their will and preference.  They often cannot transition to community living because there is inadequate accessible housing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has committed to transitioning 18 under-65s out of nursing homes in 2022.  That is 18 out of more than 1,300, not to mention those who will ultimately transition in the next year.</p></speech>

This is a serious report.  It is a good, methodological study.  It makes the best use of the data that are available, although there, as the report points out, serious gaps.  The report does a service to making people's housing needs more visible, especially those of lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and migrants.  Their housing needs often are not visible enough.</p><p>This matter deserves a more considered response than we got from the Government this evening.  I hope that we do get such a response.  When listening to the Minister of State's comments, I got the sense that there is a lack of acceptance of reality.  He talked about how homelessness is decreasing.  In the past five months, homelessness has increased.  There was no mention of that by the Minister of State.  One would think, given the seriousness of this report and its recommendations, that he would at least acknowledge that, and one would hope that he would talk about what measures the Government is going to put in place to address the fact that homelessness has increased in the past five months.</p><p>The Minister of State told us that the vast majority of landlord and tenant relationships are working well.  I do not know what reality the Government is operating in if it believes that.  The justification for that is the Minister of State's comment to the effect that less than 2% of tenancies become the subject of disputes referred to the RTB.  The latter gives rise some sort of conclusion that the relationships are working well.  If that is genuinely what the Minister of State believes, he misunderstands the position with regard to the major problems in the private rental sector and the power imbalance that exists.  That power imbalance affects all renters and tenants.  It particularly affects people who already feel that they are at an extra level of risk and who have additional difficulties in finding alternative accommodation.  That can include people with disabilities, migrants, Travellers and lone parents.  These people already find it difficult to source accommodation.  If they do find accommodation and are having problems with their landlords, they can, while trying to assert their rights, be scared out of their wits about what could happen because there are so many grounds for eviction.</p><p>I want to read one testimony from a lone parent who is renting.  This is good work done by Dr. Rory Hearne.  The testimony states:</p> <blockquote> 	My marriage broke up 17 years ago.  I left the (rented) home and started renting myself.  Through unemployment, part-time and full-time work, studying for a degree and post-grad teaching qualification and bringing up two children, I have never missed paying my rent, mostly on my own, sometimes with state help.  I have never been in a position to save. </blockquote>  <p>The testimony later states:</p> <blockquote> 	I have no idea ... how I'll manage when I retire in 8 years given that the pension will just about cover the rent.  I try not to think about it. </blockquote>  <p>Another testimony states:</p> <blockquote> 	Was renting with two kids (one with autism and learning difficulties) in 2017 when landlord raised rent beyond means.  Then said he was giving place to daughter.  Before 3 months were up it was back on the rental market.  Took it to the RTB who found in my favour and fined &euro;9000.  He took it to tribunal and basically talked the whole time not giving me much time to speak and they found in his favour. ... Anyway moved 9 times in 12 years and effect on child with autism devastating.  Hates changing.  Went to ask for HAP or some stability and told I earn too much.  Over 70% of salary on rent.  So basically no help from DCC or RTB or this government.  Single parent.  Single income. </blockquote>  <p>That is the reality for many tenants.</p> <p>This report deserves a more serious response from the Government than telling us that homelessness is decreasing when it is increasing and that the vast majority of tenants and landlords have a perfectly good relationship when there is such a huge power imbalance that most tenants feel they cannot assert their rights.  I have figures from the Residential Tenancies Board this week showing that sanctions were imposed on landlords in only 28 of more than 220 cases where it investigated rent cap breaches.  Enforcement is not working and this report deserves a considered response.</p></speech>

I note the Minister of State's remarks in that regard.</p>  <p>  The research, published jointly by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute, has shown that lone parents and their children account for 53% of homeless families and are much more likely to experience inadequate housing than other household types.  The report also highlights the disadvantage experienced by young people, migrants, people with disabilities, Travellers and others in the Irish housing system.</p>  <p>  While I note the reductions in homelessness in recent months, the recent increase in the homeless figures will be of serious concern to the Government.  Significant improvements have been made since homelessness was at its highest two years ago but a huge amount of work remains to be done and we recognise that.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 allocated &euro;194 million to homeless services and the Government is committed to ending homelessness by 2030.  The Government&rsquo;s focus on increasing housing supply was evident in budget 2022.  Next year, for example, &euro;4 billion of Exchequer funding, supplemented by Land Development Agency funding and Housing Finance Agency lending, will be made available to deliver 9,000 new build social homes and make 4,130 homes available for affordable purchase and cost rental.</p>  <p>  In my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a significant public housing development has been completed at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside.  The scheme includes cost-rental and social housing units.  A total of 597 badly needed homes will be constructed at the former Shanganagh Castle site in Shankill.  This public housing scheme, which is being developed in partnership between the Land Development Agency and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, will deliver 91 affordable purchase homes, 306 cost-rental units and 200 social homes.</p>  <p>  Cost-rental homes are a new form of renting and will result in more affordable rents for households which struggle to pay private rents but earn above the threshold for social housing.  The new Shanganagh development is currently the country&rsquo;s largest proposed cost-rental scheme.  These new homes will include 51 terraced, semi-detached and detached houses and 546 apartments.  They will be a mix of two four-bedroom, 99 three-bedroom, 302 two-bedroom and 165 one-bedroom units and 29 studio apartments.  The Minister is committed to progressing this and other badly needed public housing schemes and I look forward to working with him and his officials to increase the supply of public and private housing.</p>  <p>  I welcome today&rsquo;s announcement on private rents in Dublin.  It will come as a relief to renters.  However, there are issues around securing a home to rent.  Higher costs remain and will be resolved by an increase in supply.  I welcome the measures in Housing for All in this regard, particularly the zoned site tax, which will penalise property owners who sit on zoned serviced land.</p>  <p>  The report we are discussing, which is welcome, raises the challenges encountered by people with disabilities in securing appropriate accommodation.  It found that 29% persons living with a disability experience housing quality issues, when compared with those without a disability.  People with disabilities are also more likely to report an inability to keep their home warm and arrears on rent or mortgage payments.</p>  <p>  All Members of this House will be aware of the challenges faced by people with disabilities when trying to secure social or private housing.  This issue needs to be addressed and I will continue to work on it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Ministers responsible for disability.  Housing policy must address the needs of our society, particularly its most vulnerable members.  The restricted options for older people and people with disabilities are among the most pressing issues.  I welcome the pathways detailed in the Housing for All strategy to support these vulnerable groups and others.  I also welcome the commitment to publishing a new national housing strategy for people with disabilities and I look forward to working with the Minister of State and Members across the House.</p></speech>

It puts flesh on the bones and summarises what a lot of Deputies face weekly in our clinics.  A disproportionate number of those who come in to our clinics in serious trouble on housing are single mothers and people with disabilities whose needs are not being not met.  We get some members of the new communities, often with bigger families, coming in whose needs are not being met.  They are also disproportionately represented among the homeless.</p>  <p>  We get people all the time citing the obvious fact that HAP payments are not sufficient to meet the levels of rent in our area.  Average rents in our area are &euro;2,200 per month.  That means someone will need after tax income of &euro;26,000 per year to pay for an average apartment.  Most low-paid workers are single mothers, migrants who have recently moved to the country and people with disabilities.  They do not have a take-home income anywhere near that.  If that is the HAP limit and someone is below it, that person is homeless by definition.  This report is giving us the hard facts on this.  People come into us crying and desperate.  They do not know what to do and they plead for help.  The system is fundamentally failing them.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the place finder service.  The people working in place finder are at a point where they need counselling, as are the people they are trying to help.  They are looking in the same places as the people looking for HAP tenancies and cannot find places because they do not exist.  We pushed and campaigned for a place finder system.  We have put more resources into it but the places are not there.</p>  <p>  If those among the one in 50 who manage to find a HAP place in our area that is within the rent limits, it is a regular phenomenon for their HAP tenancy to fold.  According to the figures, they are socially housed but, in reality, they are not.  The landlord pulls out of the arrangement and the tenant is back in homelessness.  We have had families evicted from HAP tenancies three and four times when they were supposedly socially housed.</p>  <p>  I will make some points on disability.  According to the disability capacity review, we will have a shortfall of 3,900 residential places by 2032.  The only policy in the strategy is decongregation but we do not have places and supports for people.  We are 2,000 residential places short.  I had somebody in to me this week who has resigned from the monitoring committee on the housing strategy for people with disability because he says the national housing strategy has no targets or numbers, just aspirations.  At least the Government has targets in some other areas of housing, although we never meet them.  There are not even targets in this area.  People are asking for targets and numbers to deal with this problem.</p>  <p>  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, people with a disability have the right to choose who they live with and where they live.  They are not given that right.</p> <p>The policy at the moment is to wait until it reaches a crisis.  It is a case of leave them at home with their parents and wait until the point at which it reaches a crisis, perhaps when they get too old or their parents get too old to look after them.  That is the actual policy and that needs to be addressed.</p> <p> I will say something about rents on the day that is in it.  Rents are so far ahead of what the ordinary people earn.  I am sorry &ndash; I say this to the Opposition as well &ndash; but a 2% cap on rent increases is no good because rents are way too high.  I am also sorry to say to Sinn F&eacute;in that a refund of a month's rent will not cut it.  I would not be against it if it came in, but it is not going to address the problem that rents are way too high.  The vast majority of working people do not earn incomes sufficient to meet the rent levels in the epicentres of the crisis.  Therefore, we need public, not-for-profit, subsidised, low-cost housing on a massive scale, much bigger than we are currently doing, but in addition we must have rent controls that set rents at another level.  That is done in many countries and we have been arguing for this for years.  Why do we not have a rent board that sets rents at affordable levels and resets them down to levels that are affordable for working people?</p></speech>

It is an informative piece of work looking at six dimensions of housing adequacy: accessibility, affordability, security of tenure, cultural adequacy, quality and location.  It also provides us with baseline figures on the housing situation for a range of socioeconomic groups.  This research is important because it essentially backs up with data what we all know.</p>  <p>  Whether the people on the opposite side of the House choose to acknowledge it or not, they know in their quiet moments exactly what is going on.  When they look at themselves in the mirror in the morning putting on their make-up, having a shave or whatever, they must know that what they are doing is not good.  They must see what we are seeing in our clinics and on the streets.  It is at the stage now where people approach us on the street to describe the appalling state of the housing emergency and how it affects them.  That is extremely embarrassing for people.  It is dehumanising to have to beg for somewhere to live, or to have to be constantly sharing their story about how they are bringing their kids up in a place that they are embarrassed to call home.  That is not good enough.  That is no way to raise kids.  It is not a year or three or four years of their lives - it is kids growing up into adulthood in these situations.  Their parents cross the street to come to us.  They are mortified because all parents want is to give their kids a decent start in life in a warm and safe place where they can bring their friends home and not to have to move constantly.</p>  <p>  When you are a lone parent, a migrant or the parent of a child with a disability, everything gets that bit more complicated.  You need more supports, but they are not there, so you are forced to go and tell your story to a politician and to look the politician in the eye and explain the conditions that you are raising your family in, how embarrassing it is, how horrible you feel and how you cry yourself to sleep at night.  We are seeing this every day of the week.  I am not making this up.  Everything comes back to housing.  If we are dealing with a child protection case, in the end it comes back to housing.  If we are dealing with issues around employment, it comes back to housing, because some people simply do not have enough space to be able to work from home or they are forced to live too far from where they work and they are getting in trouble in work.  That is compounded when you are a member of a marginalised socioeconomic group.</p>  <p>  It is infuriating when I see the Department of Finance say the ESRI is detached from reality because it says the Government should borrow more money to build houses and try to solve the crisis.  We know well who is detached from reality and it is most definitely not the people who say that for the love and honour of Jesus we should build houses so that people can have somewhere to live and are not forced to go to politicians to beg and to have to tell their story over and over again.  This report points up not just the difficulties that exist in the housing system, but how they affect people who are already marginalised and not getting a head start and how this puts them back much further.  I urge the Minister of State to reflect and to take three things on board: first, the findings of this report; second, the absolute necessity to build social and affordable homes and; third, for God's sake will he tell the Department of Finance who really is detached from reality?</p></speech>

The right to adequate housing is a key element of the international human rights agreements to which Ireland signed up, and it should be a basic need that is met for all.  The Government is focused on tackling the housing crisis, and we have seen that commitment in the plans laid out in Housing for All and in the homes already delivered.</p>  <p>  In our drive to deliver much-needed housing, it is important that we do not lose sight of the need to make sure that we deliver housing that is adequate for a person's needs.  I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and I am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, so I have a twofold interest in this debate tonight.  Over the past year, on the disability matters committee we have heard from a significant number of disability groups, campaigners, activists, parents and those living with a disability.  Many have told stories of living in homes that do not adequately meet their needs.  As a result of bathrooms that are inaccessible, door frames or hallways that are too narrow or location issues, there are people with a disability who cannot fully integrate into their community and cannot live independently due to a lack of adequate housing support.  One of the shocking things that this report highlights is that 29% of people living with a disability experience housing quality issues.  People with a disability are also more likely to report an inability to keep their home warm or to have rent arrears or mortgage repayment issues.  It is very clear from this report and from all of the witnesses who have come before the disability matters committee that the disabled community is not having its housing needs adequately met.</p>  <p>  We talk a lot about the phrase, "nothing about us without us".  It is important that in addressing the housing issues facing those with a disability, we ensure that they are the ones at the heart of the policy discussion and shaping the decision-making process because, at the end of the day, they are the ones who know best the challenges facing their community.  In fact, it is often society that is disabling for people, not the wheelchair that a person may be using.  In this regard, society and the way we build it and homes simply must change.  To be fully effective, these changes must take place at the design phase when it comes to homes.  The universal design approach must be used to ensure that people with disabilities are treated the same as everyone else.  They must be consulted and their needs must be factored in to the design and build of their homes.  Accessibility is one of the central principles of the UNCRPD.  However, lack of accessibility is often the reason for housing not being adequate for a person with a disability.  Accessibility is a precondition for persons with disabilities to live independently and to participate fully and equally in society.  Universal design expands the promise of accessibility and it must be at the heart of housing design going forward.</p>  <p>  This report also highlights the continuing problem of homelessness among a highly disadvantaged section of the community for whom the basic measure of adequate housing is not being met.  We made good progress recently in particular when it comes to tackling family homelessness, but there is so much more that we need to do.  Under Housing for All, we are working towards ending homelessness.  I am glad that in terms of Housing First, we surpassed our target of 663 tenancies and now have almost 700 tenancies. I commend organisations like the Peter McVerry Trust that are working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to provide homes for those sleeping rough or in long-term homelessness.  It was great to see the newly finished homes on Haddington Road where the Peter McVerry Trust is delivering 18 homes, including under Housing First.  That is just one example of how the Government and organisations are working together to end homelessness.</p>  <p>  The report also highlights rising rents and access to rental accommodation as key challenges when it comes to adequate housing.  There is no doubt that Ireland is a very difficult place to be a renter right now.</p> <p>Rents are rising faster than wages and the estimated monthly rent in Ireland is now 31% of people's earnings.  This is unsatisfactory and unsustainable.  Housing for All makes commitments to renters to give them access to adequate and affordable rental properties.</p> <p> Cost rental will give renters access to secure, long-term leases and tackle the uncertainty of renting.  We have tenants already living in our first cost rental homes and availing of rents which are up to 50% below market rate.  The volume of applications for other cost rental schemes makes it clear that we must significantly scale up cost rental in Ireland.  Housing for All sets out to create 18,000 cost rental homes between now and 2030, a target that is ambitious but achievable.</p> <p> We have introduced measures to protect renters who lost their jobs due to Covid-19.  We have capped student rent deposits and reduced the notice period they must give when moving out.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, today received Cabinet approval to cap rent increases at 2% per year in rent pressure zones, a welcome move when it comes to tackling rising rents and the mark of this Government's commitment to improving the situation for renters in Ireland.</p> <p> I thank the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission for compiling this report on monitoring adequate housing in Ireland.  It is a very important piece of research from multiple groups who live on the fringes of Irish society, groups whose needs are sometimes overlooked in terms of housing.  I ask the Minister of State to take the points contained in this report on board and to ensure that access to adequate housing is at the heart of housing policy and the homes built under Housing for All.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400052#DDD00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity for the D&aacute;il to debate the findings of the IHREC report on adequate housing.  Amid this ever-growing crisis within housing, the report highlights several key findings and challenges in housing that many of us have long suspected.</p>  <p>  I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South, a constituency with a wealth of history and rich in community.  At the core of so many of these communities are various council flat complexes in the inner city.  From Ringsend right across to Kevin Street and down to Rathmines, these communities have contributed immensely to the very fabric that makes up Dublin city and they continue to do so.  However, these communities have not been treated with the care and respect they deserve.  The reality is these communities have been failed by a housing policy which neglects them year after year.</p>  <p>  I have on several occasions highlighted in the D&aacute;il numerous examples of the harsh living conditions that tenants renting from the local authorities must endure, issues such as widespread dampness and mould in flats going untreated for long periods of time and widespread rat infestation across several flat complexes in the inner city.  So bad are these infestations that some residents are even afraid to open their windows because the rats are nesting under their balconies.  There is a flat complex in York Street built only 12 years ago and at the time it was an award-winning design.  Now, it is infested with rats and is flooding so frequently that Dublin City Council has had to move several families to a nearby hotel.  The realities of neglect and housing inadequacy run rampant across the inner city.  I can give numerous examples of this neglect.</p>  <p>  We have heard strong words from the Government on its commitment to providing tenants with adequate social housing.  We have heard the Government acknowledge that these complexes and communities are intrinsic to the city and have huge cultural and heritage significance.  These living conditions are unacceptable, so the Government says.  For residents in Pearse House, Glovers Court and Beech Hill Villas in Donnybrook, these words from Ministers mean nothing.  These communities have had enough of talk and empty guarantees.  They need urgent action in dealing with these harsh conditions.  If Dublin City Council does not act, then the Minister and his Department must intervene.  In the eyes of those living in many of the council flat complexes, they have been abandoned, forgotten and brushed aside by the Government.  The cut of &euro;23 million to State regeneration funding, despite unacceptable conditions of social housing in flat complexes, is to many yet another nail in the coffin of inner city communities.</p></speech>

Before I summarise, I will try to address some of the points raised by Deputies.  Again, I thank all Deputies for their contributions and thank the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the ESRI for this very important report.  I want to emphasise that this report is very useful to the Government in terms of our response to Housing for All through housing delivery and through targeting vulnerable groups, such as Travellers and minorities.  It is critical that we take the learning and the experience that people have brought to this report to inform how we better deliver sustainable housing for all communities.  We are taking it seriously.</p>  <p>  The point on data was made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in his opening comments.  Improvements are taking place within the Department around data gathering and the use of data.  With regard to future data collection, the Department is taking on board the point that there are a number of groups where no housing data are collected and there is no ongoing national survey in regard to background, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.  Research has shown that migrants are diverse in terms of education and employment outcome.  Despite this diversity, there are few migrant categories available in the data and the status of second generation migrants and refugees is not captured.  It is similar with the data regarding the Traveller community, so it is important we take the findings from this report.</p>  <p>  Deputy Andrews and I have spoken about this issue and there has been some email correspondence in regard to the State regeneration fund.  It is my understanding that this fund was increased, not decreased, but we are getting correspondence back to the Deputy in that regard.</p>  <p>  I take on board the points made by Deputy Andrews.  Like him, I agree on the value of these Dublin city flats, which are very important, in particular the older design flats from Herbert Simms.  It is important that we celebrate the communities that are living in them and give adequate support to Dublin City Council to do that.  That is what the Government is doing.</p>  <p>  In regard to the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett around disability, the local authority is tasked to have a disability steering group and to set targets and local strategies as mandated in Housing for All.  Under action 7.6, the housing disability steering group should report quarterly on implementation of local strategic plans regarding housing people with a disability to the chief executive officer and to the strategic policy committee.  Local authority housing delivery action plans are due to be delivered to the Minister by the end of 2021.  These plans should set out how dedicated social housing provision appropriate to the needs of people with a disability will be delivered, matching the scale and extent of housing need identified for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  I point to my constituency and the decongregation of St. Patrick's in Kilkenny, in particular the fantastic work that was done in collaboration by St. Patrick's and Kilkenny County Council in providing supported housing for people with disabilities.  That type of project and initiative can and should be replicated across the country.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Traveller community, I want to deal with the issue of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and the very different ways the Traveller community seeks housing support.  Again, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is very much dedicated to implementing that.  Reference was made to the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report, No End in Site, which was published recently.  The Department is in ongoing communication with the relevant local authority to provide the necessary supports to ensure the recommendations contained in the report are implemented in a timely manner.  Again, I am very conscious of the challenges facing the Traveller community in accessing appropriate accommodation.</p>  <p>  I hope I have covered the points raised.  In my closing speech, I will try to capture as much of what was brought forward by Deputies, in particular the issues around methodologies, data and taking this report seriously, which we certainly are.</p> <p> I thank Deputies again for their valuable contributions to this important debate.  The report has provided us with an opportunity to discuss and debate key principles and priorities in the provision of adequate housing and the realisation of sustainable communities.  These priorities were central to the development of the Housing for All strategy and the delivery of this plan will be essential to addressing the issues raised in this report.</p> <p> With that in mind, I wish to reflect on the actions my colleagues in the Government will continue to deliver on to provide adequate housing.  My colleagues and I are keenly aware that the lack of supply is exacerbating the problems raised in the report.  Increasing the overall supply of housing is the essential component to our plan.  We have set an ambitious target for the delivery of homes of all tenure types, and the whole-of-government approach to the delivery of Housing for All will ensure we meet these targets to boost supply and address this core issue.  We have provided an unprecedented level of funding to address affordability challenges and to boost supply throughout the country to more than 300,000 new homes by 2030.  Despite the significant challenges raised by Covid-19 and Brexit, we are on track to increase the number of homes delivered annually.  We have a long-term actionable plan set in place to increase the number of affordable homes and routes to access affordable housing, as demonstrated by programmes such as the affordable housing fund and the first home scheme.  We understand the affordability challenges in the rental sector need to be addressed quickly and efficiently.  Today the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, received approval to introduce a measure to prohibit rent increases above 2% annually, and over the past year he has introduced several measures to directly provide a more secure market for renters in our communities.</p> <p> This report highlights those who are most vulnerable to homelessness in our society, such as lone parents, young people, and people with disabilities.  Housing cannot be a one-size-fits-all fix.  We will provide access to appropriate and adequate housing to suit these needs.  We have committed to the Lisbon declaration to end homelessness by 2030.  Housing for All and budget 2022 follow through on this crucial commitment with their allocation of substantive time and money to this challenge to ensure fair access to homes for all.  We are pleased to say progress continues to be made in this area, and that determination will continue until homelessness is eliminated in our society.</p> <p> We understand the need to provide housing options that adequately meet the cultural needs of those who live there.  As such, we are steadfast in our ambition to provide Traveller-specific accommodation where appropriate and address the unique difficulties and challenges the Traveller community faces when accessing homes.  This commitment further extends to working alongside colleagues in government to improve the conditions of those who have come to this country to seek safety and security.  In light of the State&rsquo;s recent involvement with COP26 and commitments to meet the worldwide climate crisis, it is essential to mention the future of housing needs to be environmentally friendly to be considered wholly adequate.  Of the 300,000 homes to be delivered by 2030, every single one will be nearly zero energy.  An extensive retrofit programme was also introduced by the Government last year.</p> <p> This report gives us an excellent opportunity to reflect on where we can make improvements to our policies and acknowledge the huge achievements we have made so far, while acknowledging all the contributions this evening from Members and the significant challenges that face us into the future.  We will deliver affordable, high-quality and secure housing that meets the cultural and material needs of all of our citizens.  We will continue to welcome research that can aid in our strategy to tackle the housing crisis and we agree that better data is central to assisting our understanding of housing issues and informing our work on housing policy.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is looking forward to the opportunity to have an in-depth discussion on the report with the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, which will take place in December, and I and my Department will reflect further on the points raised here tonight.  There will be other opportunities for Deputies to contribute to this important report and the Minister is committed to giving detailed consideration to it and to responding to the points raised this evening.</p></speech>

Sometimes Ministers who are not from a particular Department take Topical Issue matters and I appreciate the fact she has come in to take this one.  This is an issue which affects my constituency, which is evidenced by the fact that two of us raised this Topical Issue matter and it was also raised in other manners by other Deputies and Senators.</p>  <p>  We need to get the Doolin Coast Guard unit reinstated but we need to address the issues that led us to where we are because the reality is there is a toxic working environment in the Coast Guard station in Doolin and there has been for some time.  Unfortunately it is not unique to Doolin; it exists the length and breadth of this country.  There is a lack of confidence in the most senior management in the Irish Coast Guard on behalf of the rank and file.  They feel nobody has their back and they have no representative body, so if they speak out, they will be singled out for disciplinary measures where they will be accompanied by another volunteer.  I appreciate there was an attempt to establish a representative body for them but the vast majority of those in it are former members rather than current members.</p>  <p>  It is a morass and we will not solve it tonight but the Minister of State needs to take a long look at it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, spoke about visiting Doolin and I was there myself when its lovely new shining Coast Guard station was opened.  The officer in charge there was Mattie Shannon, a man who gave his lifetime to the Irish Coast Guard in Doolin.  He left the Irish Coast Guard but the Minister of State should talk to him and ask him why he left.  She should also talk to the many others who left the Doolin Coast Guard unit one by one.  People of that sort of dedication do not leave unless there is something badly wrong.  I ask the Minister of State not to talk to the head of the Irish Coast Guard.  The head of the Irish Coast Guard will tell her a story but it will not be one that will be recounted by the rank and file on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400053#EEE00500"><p>I also want to recognise and welcome the Minister of State's presence for this debate.  This is an evolving situation in Doolin which has resulted in six volunteers resigning earlier this week.  These resignations have taken place amid claims of bullying and harassment in the service.  I have serious concerns about the standing down of the service and the circumstances in which this happened.  We have hard-working volunteers in Doolin and throughout the Irish Coast Guard, but unfortunately they are not being listened to.  A culture of bullying and harassment has developed within the Irish Coast Guard that has been left to evolve without check and that is desperately disappointing.</p>  <p>  We need a ministerial intervention and I implore the Minister of State to appoint an independent and competent person to have a serious look at the situation in Doolin.  I agree with Deputy McNamara that this is not just an issue for Clare or Doolin; this is widespread throughout the country.  Former and current volunteers are speaking out because of the issues which have emerged.  It is unfortunate and sad for me to say that the coastguard system is under huge stress.  We will not have a coastguard service in the future if we do not address the issues that have emerged in Doolin.  There are 12 volunteers in Doolin who are more than capable of carrying out tasks such as cliff rescue, ambulance assistance and search.  They should be allowed to continue with that work and be reinstated as a matter of urgency.  I ask that the Minister of State take my views and those of Deputy McNamara and other Oireachtas Members across County Clare on board and that we get to work on this straight away.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400053#EEE00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to come before the House.  The temporary standing down of Doolin Coast Guard unit operations is a proportionate response having regard to significant ongoing attempts by the Irish Coast Guard to address the unfortunate differences that have existed within the unit and their impact on the unit.  Equally, the recent resignations of several Doolin Coast Guard volunteers have contributed to this decision.</p> <p>The key objective is to ensure the safety of the volunteers.  The action is being taken in compliance with the search and rescue assurance obligations set out in the national search and rescue plan.</p> <p> As regards contingency plans, I have been advised by my officials that these are fully in place.  The Inis O&iacute;rr Coast Guard unit, which falls under the direct management of the Doolin unit, shall continue to remain fully operational.  In the interim, the Coast Guard is liaising with other search and rescue stakeholders in the area to provide full cover for services that otherwise would be provided by the Doolin unit.</p> <p> The Coast Guard is currently deploying various contingencies based on an assessment of risk within the area, and in particular Kilkee and Killaloe Coast Guard units.  All other Coast Guard units, shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four search and rescue Coast Guard helicopters.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, community rescue boats and Naval Service will continue to assist, particularly in those areas of greatest risk, until the issue has been resolved.</p> <p> The Coast Guard and the Department have taken these unfortunate differences within the Doolin unit volunteers extremely seriously and have consistently striven over the past number of years to try to assist in the repair of the breakdown in relationships that have occurred within the unit.  These actions include: dignity and respect training for the Doolin unit; a number of facilitated group meetings with the unit; one-to-one sessions with Irish Coast Guard management and the Doolin unit members; and an independent investigation by a HR consultancy with subsequent report and follow-up actions and recommendations.</p> <p> Follow-up actions included an intensive support package put in place with the coastal unit sector manager attending training sessions weekly in Doolin to monitor and assist in supervising the situation.  Unfortunately, during the period of March 2020 to April 2021, there were limitations on volunteer training due to COVID restrictions.  Confidential counselling services are also contracted by the Coast Guard and are readily available to all volunteers who wish to avail of these services.</p> <p> The Irish Coast Guard very much acknowledges and recognises the strenuous efforts and leadership displayed by many members of the unit, its management team and other stakeholders to address these difficulties.  The Irish Coast Guard will continue to offer support to all those affected by this event with the aim of strengthening the unit's management structure and providing relevant training and mediation services as may be required.</p> <p> The Irish Coast Guard is committed to supporting the near 900 dedicated volunteers who help provide the important and life-saving services of the Coast Guard.  Ongoing consultation with Coast Guard volunteers is key to the success of the Coast Guard.  For this reason, Coast Guard volunteers have for some time had a representative body called the Coastal Unit Advisory Group.  This group represents Irish Coast Guard volunteers and provides advice and input to the Coast Guard under agreed terms of reference between management and the volunteers.  This group meets regularly and is involved in working with Coast Guard management to deliver a world-class service while protecting the safety and well-being of the volunteers within the Coast Guard units.  My office has been in touch with the Coastal Unit Advisory Group with a view to arranging a meeting shortly.</p></speech>

That is a good body.  I have no problem with it.  That is a bit like saying that a collective of sergeants represents the workforce of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the board.  That is not the case.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors does not represent the entirety of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It never has.  It never will.  It was not set up to do so.  I would ask the Minister of State to revisit that assumption.</p>  <p>  I would also ask the Minister of State to look at the bigger issues.  Why are so many leaving?  As I say, people do not leave unless there is a problem.  Unless management takes the problem and deals with it, it will not change.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned Covid difficulties.  There was an officer in charge in Crosshaven targeted for carrying out activities contrary to Covid, as in getting a rig out on the water when there were many similar boats all over the country up on social media.  Why was he targeted?</p>  <p>  The culture within the Coast Guard is if one speaks out for one's fellow volunteers, one is targeted.  One is silenced.  It is toxic and the Coast Guard will not survive that unless the Minister of State, at a political level, takes it in hand.  There is no confidence in the most senior management among the volunteers.  That is what they are - volunteers who risk their lives to try to protect others.  We should never forget that.  They deserve a lot better than what they are getting at present.</p></speech>

There were current and former members of the Coast Guard - all volunteers from Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Galway and Clare - and they spoke openly about the challenges they face every day in terms of widespread harassment and bullying within the service.</p>  <p>  One has to ask the question of why so many people are leaving the service.  Morale is at an all-time low.  Volunteers are leaving.  They are not being listened to.  They are not being engaged with in a proper manner by management on high.</p>  <p>  There is need for a root-and-branch review of the Coast Guard service in terms of management and volunteers, and how they work together.  The Minister of State must commit to that.  The Minister of State also must commit to the appointment of an independent competent person to try to iron out the issues in Doolin and reinstate that vital service that they have delivered so well over many years.</p></speech>

We are endeavouring to address these issues.</p>  <p>  As regards the terms of reference of the coastal advisory group, the purpose of the coastal advisory group is to provide a structured method of consultation and communication between the Irish Coast Guard and volunteer members.  It recognises a key role that the volunteers play in delivering search and rescue in Ireland.  As such, it provides the volunteers with that formal opportunity to contribute, and to consult and liaise on matters impacting on the performance of search and rescue activities in which the volunteers are engaged.  It is for that reason that I have contacted them in order to meet them.  I hope to do that shortly regarding these issues.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Coast Guard and my Department will continue to offer support to all those affected by this event in Doolin with the aim of strengthening the unit's management structure and providing relevant training and mediation services as may be required to resolve the issues within the unit with a view to returning Doolin to operational readiness as quickly as practicable.  As advised by my officials, all other Coast Guard units' shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place.  Along with the four search and rescue Coast Guard helicopters, the RNLI, community rescue boats and the Naval Service will continue to assist.</p>  <p>  I join the Deputies in praising the great work of our 900 volunteers right across the country who provide an exemplary public service in our time of need.  They need to be supported.  I look forward to that engagement with the Coastal Unit Advisory Group.</p></speech>

It is topical.  It was announced only on Tuesday of this week.</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the announcement of a new technological university of the south-east which is to open its doors at the latest by May of next year.  There are many people to thank in what has been a long and arduous process.  I would thank the Minister for his work on it.  He has brought an energy to the process.  I want to thank particularly Professor Willie Donnelly of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and Dr. Patricia Mulcahy of the Institute of Technology, Carlow.  They were instrumental.  So too were Mr. Jim Moore and Mr. John Moore, the chairs of the respective institutions, and Mr. Tom Boland and his team.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge as well both Government and Opposition Oireachtas Members across the region.  It is a region where often the Oireachtas Members are facing in different directions but on this issue we have been speaking for the most part with one voice and pulling in the same direction.  That is really important.</p> <p>While Tuesday's announcement is a significant milestone, we have to acknowledge there is still a long way to travel before we fully realise the university of scale and substance we need to serve the needs of the population and the people of the south east because we have lagged behind historically.  I could use any number of metrics to show that.  It is something to which the Minister referred in the Seanad yesterday as a glaring anomaly.  It was a commitment in the programme for Government to address that anomaly and I am glad we managed to deliver.<br/><br/>I will return to something I addressed to the Minister on 19 November last year because the facts and figures speak for themselves:</p><blockquote>	As a region the south east accounts for 8.9% of the population but only 5% of the higher education income.  Of our young people who enter higher education, 59% of them leave the region in order to do so, which is in or around 11,000 students per annum.  This equates to a significant wealth transfer out of the south east but far more damaging is the loss of our young people and we see a pronounced demographic doughnut in the region characterised by a missing generation of 19 to 45 year olds.  Our young people are going away and in many cases are staying away. </blockquote> <p>That is as true today as it was at the start of this week.  It is what a technical university, and one of substance, should be designed to achieve and address.  A well-respected commentator in Waterford posed the following challenge in the wake of Tuesday's announcement which is worth considering.  He said he had yet to hear anyone adequately articulate what distinguishes a TU from an IoT.  I think we have that responsibility, both Members of the Oireachtas collectively and the Minister, to do exactly that and make it abundantly clear to the people of the south east that this is the game changer he and I believe it should and can be for the region.<br/><br/>Pivotal in doing that, I identify four issues.  First, is site acquisition.  The Cork Road campus in WIT is creaking at the seams and we need to expand the footprint.  Not only that, if we expand the footprint, we need to build on it.  If we are talking about a university of scale and substance, then we have to talk about capital investment at scale.  Related is the ability to borrow.  I know Housing for All addresses some aspects of that in relation to student accommodation, but access to European Investment Bank funding is important.  The president is also pivotal, as is the membership of the governing authority.  If this is the university I hope it can be to capitalise, change and drive on the south east, we should look to attract the absolute top talent to help drive that process forward and bring those institutions together.</p></speech>

I was pleased to join him and colleagues from across the south east on Tuesday when we announced very clearly that the technological university for the south east will open its doors by 1 May.  After decades of debate, discussion and at times uncertainty and disagreement, we now have a very clear pathway forward.  The train is leaving the station.  The south east will have a technological university next year.  I am delighted and join the Deputy in thanking the presidents of the institutions, the governing authorities, particularly the chairs, Mr. Tom Boland and all the Oireachtas Members.  We can all be partisan in this House from time to time - that is normal in a democracy - but on this issue I must say the non-partisan nature in which everyone approached the issue on all sides was very encouraging and beneficial.</p>  <p>  The application seeking TU designation was submitted to me jointly on 30 April on behalf of the Institute of Technology Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology, or the TUSEI consortium, under the Technological Universities Act 2018.  I subsequently appointed an independent international advisory panel to assist in assessing this application and sought the views of the board of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on that report and any other matters of relevance.  On foot of my deliberations and extensive engagement with the presidents and governing authority chairs, I propose to approve the application.</p>  <p>  I am taken with the question of the difference between an IoT and a TU.  While I will not be able to do it full justice in the two minutes available to me, some immediate things that come to mind.  First, is scale and critical mass.  There is the greater focus on research and a regional focus.  It is something that looks at how we can harness the full potential of the south east from an investment and jobs point of view.  It is about access to the full spectrum of qualifications and a wider range of academic programmes.  Of course, the people of Waterford, for the first time ever, can access a university degree within Waterford.  Those are just some of the things that come to mind.</p>  <p>  In line with the legislative processes, those being sections 34 and 35 of the 2018 Act, I wrote to the chairs of the applicant institutes on this matter on 2 November outlining my intention to designate.  Under the Act the institutes have 30 days to respond to my proposed decision.</p>  <p>  The timeline of 1 May will allow for a number of things to be addressed, including some to which the Deputy referred.  It will allow the Oireachtas to approve the order, the name to be decided, the appointment of the first governing body, and the identification and designation of a first president through an open competitive process.</p>  <p>  I intend to advertise this month through a public process for people to come forward to serve as the chair of the board of the governing authority.  I expect an international recruitment campaign for the first president to kick off probably in January, but certainly very early in the new year.  Those are two very important steps.</p>  <p>  After almost a decade of debate and false dawns, the establishment of the new technological university is now rapidly becoming a reality.  I take the Deputy's point on the importance of expanding the footprint in Waterford and investing in the infrastructure, and we have had many conversations about this.  We have a capital budget for higher education that is larger than ever before.  We have a technological university transformation fund of &euro;90 million.  There is &euro;40 million more for technological universities under the national recovery and resilience plan, published by the Government.  In the coming days, my Department, the HEA and WIT will meet to discuss a prospective business case for the expansion of the footprint and the acquisition of an additional site.  The Government and I - everyone from the Taoiseach down - are determined to expand the physical footprint of Waterford Institute of Technology and what will ultimately be the technological university in the months ahead.</p></speech>

However, it does need to be an ongoing conversation.  We need to make that clear and it needs to be more than words.  It needs to be backed up by actions and by capital investment in particular.</p>  <p>  I did not touch on the issue of the headquarters of the new institution.  I know that lies outside the Minister's gift but it is very important to the people of Waterford and I ask the Minister to keep it in mind.  I and other Deputies have spoken to the Minister about this on this on many occasions.  I would be interested in there being a more definite timeline for the recruitment of the president and, in particular, what steps we will take to make sure the person we recruit for that role will be the person who is required and who has that full range of talents necessary to drive on the institution, because just as WIT was the flagship institute of technology in the country, I fully expect the technological university of the south east to be the flagship TU in the country.  I will be very disappointed if we do not step up the mark in that regard.</p>  <p>  To make a brief point on capital investment, there is an issue around the depreciation of the built stock, especially on the WIT campus.  That is an historical legacy.  Our plans for capital investment in a new and expanded campus must take account of the fact that much of the built stock that exists on the Cork Road campus in particular is ageing and is either midway through or beyond its life cycle.  That also sits with the climate action plan that was announced today.  We need buildings there that perform and which are fit for purpose, both for students and for our climate and energy needs into the future.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on those points.</p></speech>

It must be about engaging with the regional skills forum.  It must be about sitting down with the local business community, saying we are going to have a university in our region and asking the community what the skills needs are in counties Waterford, Carlow or Wexford.  We should ask what we want to be the best in the country or the best in the world at and how do we put the programmes in place to do that.  As I said at our meeting of Oireachtas Members this week, I encourage everybody in the south east, as I know the Deputy will too, to do that engagement.  They should get the business community and the regional skills forum in.  They should talk to the colleges of further education, the schools, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  They should ask what the unique selling point of the south-east region is going to be.  Then they should absolutely come to me and put pressure on me to be forthcoming with resources.  I assure the Deputy the Government he and I are part of will not be found wanting in that regard.</p> <p> On the headquarters, it is a statement of fact to say the law and the process is clear that decision will reside with the first governing authority.  However, it is still okay to have a view and my view is Waterford sounds like a very logical location.  It is logical because of the size of the footprint of the institute of technology already there, because we are going to expand it even further in terms of capital projects and also within the context of other Government initiatives and policies around national planning frameworks and the like as well.  Legally, it is a decision for others but I think Waterford has a very compelling case.  On the president, the recruitment process is vested with the outgoing governing authorities of the institutes of technology but it will be a full international search and I am confident it will be a very robust process.  On capital, the Deputy's argument is compelling and well-made and I will work with him to advance these issues.</p></speech>

He wishes to discuss the decision by the Israeli state to designate six Palestinian human rights groups operating in the West Bank as terror organisations.  Before inviting the Deputy to make his contribution, can I say I have had much correspondence from members of the Irish Jewish community of late and it has highlighted for me the need for us to be very careful and very precise in the language we use.  We should avoid the unintended effect of causing offence or hurt to the Jewish people and especially to the Irish Jewish community, within which we have many colleagues, including former Deputy Ben Briscoe, the late Mervyn Taylor and former Deputy Alan Shatter, all of whom served with distinction.  In addressing these matters we need to be careful about the language we use and that we do not cause unintended hurt.  I am certainly not saying that in respect of Deputy Andrews or any individual Member but as a collective it is something we need to be conscious of.  That said, the Deputy is putting this matter down because so many Members of this House over so many years have had a genuine interest in the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the interest we have is shared by the people we represent.  The floor is yours, sir.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago on 19 October the Israeli defence minister formally designated human rights organisation Al-Haq and five other Palestinian human rights groups as terrorist organisations under Israeli law.  The other five are Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees and the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees.  Let us be clear about this.  This is about shutting down legitimate criticism of Israeli human rights abuses.  Israel's charge against the six NGOs, which include groups that offer legal support to prisoners and a women's rights organisation, is based on a connection to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP.  This claim has been made by apartheid Israel for many years and it is untrue.  There is absolutely no evidence to back up the claim these organisations are involved in terrorism.  For any state to be able to change policy in this way would suggest apartheid Israel is growing in confidence it can do what it wants.  Apartheid Israel is becoming increasingly confident it can do what it wants and there will be no consequences for anything it does.  Let us be clear apartheid Israel's actions are increasingly making a two-state solution less and less likely.  The chance of a two-state solution is disappearing on Ireland's watch on the UN Security Council.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney's additional &euro;2.4 million allocation to fund UN bodies working in Palestine.  However, to be brutally honest, it feels like guilt money because the Government is not willing to recognise the state of Palestine or even to pass the occupied territories Bill put forward by Senator Black.  If we genuinely want to support Palestine we must make significant acts like recognising the state of Palestine and supporting the occupied territories Bill.  We need concrete action on the six designated organisations and we need clarity.  We need an official public statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that categorically denounces the terror designation and removes all deference to Israel.  We need to send public messages to the Irish banks that Ireland does not recognise the terror designations and ensure the open exchange of transactions between Irish entities and the organisations and their staff members.  This will have implications for Irish citizens and relations with Palestine and Palestinian advocacy groups.  In light of the unprecedented attack against Palestinian civil society, Ireland must ensure increased funding to these six civil society organisations.</p><p>It is important to state Al-Haq regards Jerusalem in its entirety as Palestinian as there is no recognition of the illegal acts of annexation in 1949 in west Jerusalem and in 1967 in east Jerusalem.  It is equally important to note the Minister, Deputy Coveney, insinuated during his recent visit to apartheid Israel that Ireland might at some point recognise Israel's sovereignty over west Jerusalem and even consider moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  This was reported in <i>The Jerusalem Post</i>and it was unclear so we need clarity from the Minister on it.  Will the Minister clarify that Palestinians have a continuing right to self-determination and that the 1949 annexation was an illegal act under international law for which there can be no recognition.  We must stand with the six designated organisations.</p></speech>

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p>  <p>  I would first like to restate the Government's concern at the designation by Israel's Ministry of Defence of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist entities on 22 October last.  This includes organisations in receipt of support from Irish Aid and the EU.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, made a statement on the matter on 27 October and has raised the issue directly in his meetings in Israel this week.  We are in touch with the Israeli authorities, along with the EU, to seek clarification.  We were not informed in advance of these designations, and have not received detailed evidence.  Previous allegations against civil society organisations in the occupied Palestinian territories which are supported by Ireland and the EU have not been substantiated.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is committed to funding civil society organisations and human rights defenders through the Irish Aid programme, including Palestinian civil society.  We carry out robust checks to ensure our funding is used only for the purpose intended.  Terrorism is a very serious issue, and must be addressed with both resolve and evidence.  This designation has the potential to impact not only on these six organisations, but on civil society more broadly across the occupied Palestinian territories and to seriously undermine vital humanitarian, development and human rights work.</p>  <p>  Civil society organisations and human rights defenders play a critical role in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values.  Ireland will continue to support such efforts bilaterally and at EU and UN level.  We lead on this issue at the UN, tabling a biennial resolution on the protection of civil society space at the Human Rights Council.</p> <p>We believe in the essential role civil society actors play in scrutinising the actions of governments globally, including those of Ireland and Israel.</p> <p> Deputy Andrews raised our role in the Security Council.  Ireland will raise this issue at the Security Council as soon as possible.  Ireland is a strong believer in the vital role played by civil society actors in the peaceful resolution of conflict.  This is why during our presidency of the council in September we invited civil society briefers to share their perspectives.  Among them were an Israeli and a Palestinian who spoke at the council's monthly meeting on the situation in the Middle East.  Palestinian civil society organisations must be enabled to carry out their important work free from obstruction, harassment and intimidation.  Israeli and Palestinian authorities should support rather than restrict civil society space.</p> <p> We continue to work with partners in protecting and promoting civil society, including in the context of our membership of the council.  Ireland's position on these issues is, and will continue to be, based on international law, Israel's obligation as the occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.  Ireland has repeatedly made this position clear at the Security Council where the issue is discussed each month.</p> <p> Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.  Ireland will remain seized of these matters and we call on both parties to build on steps taken in recent months to improve co-operation and reduce tensions.</p></speech>

I agree with his comments that this matter is bigger than the six designated organisations.  This will impact on all civil society groups and on people being able to challenge the Israeli Government on their breaches of international law.  The Minister of State mentioned raising this issue at the UN Security Council, which is all very well, but if there is no action as a result of that, what is the point of Ireland being on the council?  We raise issues, wag our fingers and lecture, but it has no consequences.  Israel knows that so it does what it wants when it wants.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, knows that the ongoing settlements are having a major impact in ensuring that the two-state solution will not be possible very soon.  We have an opportunity to take clear action.  It is not dramatic action, but recognising the state of Palestine will send out a clear message, to Palestinians and to Israel, that Israeli actions are unacceptable.  It is not a lot to ask yet all we do is raise the issue in the Chamber and express concern about it.  That is no good to the Palestinian community and Israel knows that.</p>  <p>  Senator Frances Black's occupied territories Bill is very reasonable and fair and yet we are not willing to support it.  We sacrificed that Bill to get our place on the UN Security Council, which is having no impact, in a positive way, on the Palestinian situation or giving the Palestinian community a little justice.</p></speech>

The Minister has conveyed our concerns directly in his meetings in Israel this week.  As the Deputy knows, civil society organisations play an important role and Ireland is a vocal supporter of the civil society space.  This is an issue we take seriously and we will raise the designations as soon as possible at the Security Council.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies have raised the issues of settlements and the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories.  We have been forthright in expressing our concerns regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  I will also take this opportunity, since the Deputy raised the matter, to reiterate the Government's concerns regarding recent announcements by the Israeli authorities of plans for the construction of more than 3,000 settlement units in the West Bank.  Ireland joined 11 other European states in issuing a statement on 28 October urging the Israeli authorities to reverse the decision.  Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements and will continue to do so.  Settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to use our voice at the Security Council to draw attention to these issues.  As the Deputy knows, the Middle East remains a key priority for Ireland during our term on the Security Council and we engage actively in monthly meetings on the situation in the region.  As part of Ireland's presidency of the council in September, the Minister chaired a dialogue between the Security Council and the Arab League during which he underlined the need for a strong regional engagement on the Middle East peace process and a reinvigoration of the political track, which is vital to advance peace.</p></speech>

This has been going on for a very long time.  Carlow has an excellent paramedic service but it is in a building at St. Dympna's Hospital that is not fit for purpose.  We were originally told that the service would be moved to another part of the building at St. Dympna's.  We subsequently believed that was to be changed.  According to our capital plan, which was great, Holy Angels Day Care Centre will get its new build on what is called the Kelvin Grove site in Carlow town, which is HSE land.  We then received word that the ambulance base would be built in Kelvin Grove as part of that plan.  Again, there has been no clear confirmation of anything that will happen.</p>  <p>  This situation is very unfortunate because we have the best of paramedics who have always worked so hard, especially during the Covid pandemic.  I know many of the lads in Carlow and I see how hard the men and women paramedics work.  They are excellent.  The building they are in is not fit for purpose.  Is there funding in the capital plan?  What is the situation as we go forward?  We need to give information to the paramedics and let them know what is happening.  Without confirmation of the funding it is very hard to know what is happening.  I brought this matter up during Questions on Promised Legislation and have tabled parliamentary questions on it.  This has been going on a long time.  It is not something that happened yesterday or today but has been going on for years now.  What is the update on it?  I ask the Minister of State to come back to me, hopefully, with an answer on it.</p>  <p>  I also raise a second serious issue.  There is a massive number of long delays in accessing ambulances because the system has changed in Carlow.  Ambulances are often sent to other counties because of our location.  When an ambulance is gone, there is no ambulance to replace it so we are experiencing shortages.  There is no ambulance there and it is not acceptable.  I have heard reports of people in life-threatening situations waiting 90 minutes or more for an ambulance.  I have had calls from elderly people who have had to be brought to an emergency room in the back of a family member's car because no ambulance is available.</p>  <p>  My concern is because of what happened recently.  All ambulance calls are now managed through the central National Emergency Operations Centre.  It is supposed to ensure that the most urgent calls get the highest priority response, regardless of the location of the ambulance.  This is a major issue.  So many things are now happening.  We have a base that is not fit for purpose, our ambulance paramedics are leaving our county and people in Carlow are suffering.  I can tell the Minister of State that there is anger out there among people who want to know why they are waiting so long for an ambulance.  This is not just in Carlow.  Approximately two or three weeks ago, Deputies and Senators from the south east had a virtual meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, during which issues concerning ambulance service delays were discussed.</p> <p>What is being put in place in that regard?  Did the Minister talk to the Minister of State about this?  What is the update?  Will there be a new base for Carlow town or what is the situation?  What is the progress on it?  Where is the funding and is it in the capital plan?</p></speech>

It is a town with which I am very familiar.  The National Ambulance Service is the statutory pre-hospital emergency and intermediate care provider and it seeks to serve the needs of patients and the public as part of an integrated health system through the provision of high-quality, safe and patient-centred services.  Carlow ambulance base is an integral part of the ambulance service and has four emergency ambulances on duty.  The base is supported by National Ambulance Service resources from surrounding ambulance stations, including Baltinglass, Athy, Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Enniscorthy.  Dynamic deployment of available resources operates on an area and national basis, rather than a county or geographical boundary basis, to ensure optimum resource use as the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of the incident.  The priority of dynamic deployment is patient health and welfare in the context of service delivery, which means that resources cannot be confined by county boundaries, barriers or borders.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service operates a comprehensive safety management system across all its premises in the south and continues to work collaboratively with staff and HSE estates or external providers to ensure that any concerns or issues that occur are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Remedial works to the value of approximately &euro;50,000 were carried out at Carlow ambulance base, located in Carlow town at the Carlow Health Services complex on Athy Road, in 2020.  These works addressed requirements to make the ambulance base fit for purpose and included a list of maintenance-type works to doors, walls, floor coverings and minor leaks, with full certification of electrical and fire safety systems.  Earlier this year, the National Ambulance Service completed a detailed prioritisation assessment for all ambulance stations in the southern region.  As a result of this, the new base for Carlow has been confirmed as being the second highest priority for the National Ambulance Service in the south east.  The National Ambulance Service is currently working with HSE estates in planning a future replacement for the current facility and has confirmed that a greenfield site has been identified and is under consideration.  A capital submission for this project is being developed and capital funding for the project will follow, in accordance with overall prioritisation planning.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-04a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110400058#KKK00700"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle because that was my question.  I always get worried when I hear about there being a list because these lists go on and on.  While I thank the Minister of State for his reply it is not actually a reply.  First, the remedial works that were done did not cost &euro;50,000.  I have been up in the base several times.  The minimum works were done and those works definitely did not come to &euro;50,000.  I have said that and I will say it repeatedly because that information is not true.</p>  <p>  Second, I again ask the Minister of State to explain what he means by this project being second on a priority list.  I have been told that originally we were fourth or fifth on a list, then I was told we were sixth on a list and now I am told we are the second highest.  There is still no confirmation from this discussion with the Minister of State tonight that there is funding there, that there is a timescale for when it will happen, or what exactly is going to happen.  I will be going back to the paramedics saying that I have been told they are on a list and that I do not know what funding is there.  The only piece of information I seem to have received is the reference to the Kelvin Grove site list.  I would like that information given to me in a letter, if the Minister of State would not mind.  He mentioned a site but I need to have the site identified.  I also need to know what is happening with the funding.  When is it going to happen?  As I said, I could not give our paramedics enough praise for how hard they work but I have been going back to them for years and years with the same thing and getting no answers whatsoever.  It is disingenuous.  Tonight I brought it up again and I am constantly putting in questions about this issue and bringing it up here.  Again tonight I am not getting any answers.  The paramedics who are saving lives and have worked through Covid and whatever else are not getting a building in 2021.  We are now going into 2022 and they have a building that is not fit for purpose.  It is not right and it is absolute neglect.</p></speech>

I do not have the information on what area is higher on the list but I will try to get that information from the Minister and I will ask him to forward it to the Deputy.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare and Vision 2020, a significant programme of work is under way to transform the National Ambulance Service from an emergency medical service into a mobile medical service.  This is a model that aims to treat patients at the lowest appropriate level of acuity, resulting in a better experience for the patient and a more efficient use of resources.  As the Deputy rightly said, Carlow ambulance base is an integral part of the ambulance service.  She praised the advanced paramedics, the ambulance service and all the staff and I join with her in that.  They have done great work, not just in Carlow and the south east but across the country.  They have certainly saved lives and we are very proud of them.</p>  <p>  The capital spend on ambulance base facilities is an integral part of the ambulance service and is prioritised by the National Ambulance Service to meet the requirements of those bases with the highest needs.  This year, an unprecedented &euro;187.5 million is being invested in the National Ambulance Service.  This includes &euro;10 million in additional funding to progress priority areas in line with the National Ambulance Service strategic reform, including continuing to target capacity deficits as identified in the National Ambulance Service emergency services baseline and capacity review.  Again, engagement is continuing between the National Ambulance Service and HSE estates in progressing the capital submission for a replacement base. </p></speech>
