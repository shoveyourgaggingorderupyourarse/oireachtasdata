    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300003#A00300"><p>I do not accept the assertion in the question that the reviews of service limits for enlisted personnel, which have taken place since 1994, have impacted negatively on retention in the Defence Forces.  In fact, the outcome from the reviews has enabled such personnel to stay in service longer than originally envisaged.</p><p>Military life places unique demands on individuals and it is necessary that Defence Forces personnel are prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations.  To this end, it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel are such as to ensure that operational capabilities and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.</p><p>The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990s and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports, such as those compiled by PriceWaterhouse consultants and the efficiency audit group.  One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. </p><p>As a result of this review, and following consultation with PDFORRA, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994.  In 1997, following further consultation with PDFORRA, a new manpower policy was introduced which provided for an initial service for newly qualified privates of a period of five years, with the option of being extended to a maximum of 12 years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Corporals and sergeants recruited after 1 January 1994 could serve to a maximum of 21 years, subject to meeting similar criteria.</p><p>In 2004, PDFORRA submitted a claim for a further review of the terms of service applying to post-1994 personnel.  The outcome on the discussions on this claim resulted in a set of criteria being agreed to provide for a maximum service period of 21 years for those still in the rank of private or corporal, and a maximum retirement age of 50 for sergeants.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>In 2011, PDFORRA sought further extensions of the service limits.  This matter was processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The matter proceeded to adjudication in 2015, where it was agreed that privates and corporals in receipt of technical pay group 3 or higher may be extended to age 50, subject to meeting certain criteria for continuance in service.</p><p>The adjudicator recommended a further review be conducted on the service limits for line corporals, privates and corporals in receipt of technical pay groups 1 and 2, recruited to the Defence Forces after 1 January 1994.  The adjudicator recommended that such personnel be allowed to continue to serve beyond 21 years for a period up to the expiry of the next two promotion panels, subject to them meeting the required criteria and not exceeding the age of 50 years during this period.</p><p>In 2019, a further agreement was reached with PDFORRA that all privates and corporals recruited after 1994 be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 or until they reach the age of 50, provided these personnel met certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests.  This agreement was subsequently extended to include post-1994 sergeants, who could also continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.  This will allow such personnel to continue in service beyond the timeframe suggested in the adjudication to allow for this review to be completed.  The rank of line privates, which had not been specifically recommended for review in the adjudication, is also encompassed within this measure.</p><p>The review of service limits for enlisted personnel is being progressed in the context of a broader review provided for in the high level implementation plan Strengthening Our Defence Forces.  This review, which encompasses consideration of the mandatory retirement age limits for privates, corporals and sergeants, as well as senior NCOs, is under way.</p></speech>

I disagree with his assessment that the 1994 contracts are not causing a huge difficulty or having a bearing on the retention crisis in the Defence Forces.  Retention and recruitment are the biggest issues facing the Defence Forces.  This is plain for anyone to see because the level of turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces is leading to dysfunctionality.  We see this in the Naval Service, where a number of our naval vessels are tied up due to personnel shortages.  If these trends are allowed to continue, the impact on operating with these levels of reduced numbers will have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of the Defence Forces at all levels and with all duties.</p></speech>

I believe it answers many of the questions the Deputy has raised.  In 2019, for example, a further agreement was reached with PDFORRA whereby all privates and corporals recruited after 1994 would be allowed to continue in service until 31 December 2022, or until they reached the age of 50, provided these personnel met certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests.  This agreement was subsequently extended to include post-1994 sergeants, who could also continue in service to the same date subject to meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that we do have serious challenges in terms of recruitment and retention.  We are approximately 1,000 people short of where we should be in overall numbers in our Defence Forces.  I know this and the House knows this.  We are trying to address it in multiple ways, which I am sure I will get an opportunity to speak about later.</p></speech>

Again, I disagree with him.  We have modern-day fitness and nutrition programmes.  The fact that people live longer is one the Government has used to try to increase the State pension age to 67 and 68.  The same concept should and could be applied to the Defence Forces.  Simple fitness tests for members of the Defence Forces would allow them to meet the criteria over which the Minister has expressed concerns.  There are huge issues.  Retention will not be resolved unless we look at the 1994 contracts.  People are being lost.  They go through recruitment courses and drop out shortly afterwards.  There are huge difficulties and the Minister must commit that the commission on the future of the Defence Forces will look at this-----</p></speech>

There is an ongoing review on retirement age in the Defence Forces for officers and enlisted personnel.</p> <p>It is under way.  We continue to discuss with representative bodies what is appropriate in trying to ensure we maintain and protect capability within the Defence Forces while at the same time trying to do everything we can to recognise some of the concerns raised by the Deputy relating to fitness potential in later life, improved nutrition, better training methods and so on.  All of those are being factored into those reviews.  We need to do this in a robust way so as to maintain standards, fitness and capability in the Defence Forces while at the same time reflecting some of the concerns raised by Deputy Brady.</p></speech>

The strategic dialogue phase of what is called the strategic compass is ongoing, with thematic discussions taking place in different fora focusing on specific topics within the four clusters of the compass, which is essentially the debate on the future of defence matters in the European Union.  These clusters are crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  The strategic compass is a two-year process that aims to provide strategic reflection on Europe's current and future security and defence needs, the EU's capacity to act as a security provider, its strategic autonomy and its ability to co-operate with partners.</p>  <p>  As part of this ongoing dialogue, member states are invited to share their thoughts on how to move the discussion forward through a number of non-papers focusing on the four clusters.  Ireland is one of 14 EU member states which, following consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs, have co-signed a non-paper on crisis management that was presented by France in the context of strategic compass discussions.</p>  <p>  This paper explores some of the matters and options for creating a more coherent, flexible and robust EU response capacity for crisis management operations.  Among the topics explored is how the strategic compass may contribute to enhancing the EU's ability to deploy a common security and defence policy operation as first responder to a crisis, for example.</p>  <p>  These are only proposals and ideas at this stage and they will require significant further analysis, exploration and consideration.  By signing up to the "food for thought" paper Ireland is indicating its willingness to explore some of the options in the paper to enhance EU capability and responsiveness in support of international peace and security.  The crisis management cluster was a topic for discussion at last week's Foreign Affairs Council meeting with defence ministers but I have not had discussions on Irish troops participating in any European rapid reaction force.</p>  <p>  These non-papers will feed the ongoing discussions on the strategic compass and it is expected that by November 2021, a draft of the strategic compass will be presented to ministers for examination in the first half of next year.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this idea is currently in its infancy but the idea of a European rapid reaction force was also floated in 1999 before being done away with in 2003.  Eyebrows will be raised that this conversation is happening and that Ireland is one of 14 nations expressing a willingness to take part in discussions, particularly given the current state of numbers and morale in our Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  What type of scenario would precipitate a response from the proposed rapid reaction force?  What type of emergency in Europe would require it?  Would it be a terrorist incident and the response would be a counterterrorist operation?  What is the expectation at this stage for Irish involvement in such an initiative?  How many troops would be involved according to the initial proposals?  With the 1999 proposal there would have been 800 troops involved.  I am against the idea of a rapid reaction force but its very concept seems very far-fetched, given the current state of our military branches.</p></speech>

If he asked people in the military forces if they want to be involved in collective crisis management with other EU countries, the vast majority of them would say "Yes".  People join the Defence Forces because they want to act.  They want to use their skill sets to save lives as peacekeepers and people who intervene to prevent conflict.  They want to be able to intervene in a humanitarian crisis.  The Naval Service wanted to go to the Mediterranean to save lives and it took 16,000 people out of the water.  That is why people are flying to southern Lebanon this week for the next rotation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  They want to be there.</p>  <p>  This is why people join the Defence Forces.  They do not join the Defence Forces to just train and stay out of trouble.  We are currently exploring whether the skill set of the Irish Defence Forces can contribute to a crisis response along with other EU countries.</p></speech>

I have friends from school who have joined the Defence Forces.  We understand completely the proud tradition of peacekeeping and putting ourselves in harm's way when required.  That is very different, however, to creeping militarisation or getting involved with defence initiatives with a more militarised facet.  We fully appreciate that the Defence Forces do not want to stand out of harm's way, as we can see with their behaviour over many decades, but I still highlight low morale and the low level of pay and conditions that contributes to an inability of the force to put itself in further undefined conflict zones or scenarios for such a rapid reaction force in Europe.  Its remit should be clearer.  I appreciate these conversations happened last week but we must be clearer on the expectations from the off.</p></speech>

I am very proud of them.  It is why we are constantly exploring how the Defence Forces can contribute more to international affairs through peace building, peacemaking, peace interventions and so on.</p>  <p>  I reassure the House that we are not part of a creeping militarisation policy in the European Union.  We have never been part of that kind of thinking and we are still not part of it.  Before Irish troops are sent anywhere abroad, they need to go through the triple lock system, which people understand.</p>  <p>  We are currently contributing to a thought process and asking ourselves a question as to whether the EU, as a collective, has the ability to be able to intervene in crises quickly to save lives.  I am interested in that.  This is not about the creation of a European army.  We already have battle groups, which is an unfortunate name but it is essentially a mechanism where countries train with each other to have the capacity to respond to a crisis should it be required.  They have never been deployed, despite the process going back to 2004 or 2005.</p>  <p>  I reassure people that we will be cautious in how we approach this question.  It will be approached from the perspective of Ireland's traditional contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.</p></speech>

Defence and security remains a national competence, with any decision to deepen EU defence co-operation requiring unanimity.  There is no provision in EU treaties for the creation of an EU army and no proposal has been set out to change this.  Any such proposal would require treaty change and no such change has been proposed.  The protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon expressly states "The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation" and that "The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality".</p>  <p>  Co-operation between EU member states in defence matters continues through established channels including Permanent Structured Co-operation, PESCO, EU battle groups, EU missions and operations and the institutions of the EU, including the External Action Service, the European Defence Agency and the Commission.</p>  <p>  The most recent meeting of EU defence ministers took place on 6 May in Brussels.</p> <p>The agenda for this meeting contained three main items, namely, current affairs, which was an update on the Sahel, Mozambique and Ukraine, which are all a concern, a discussion on the crisis management pillar of the strategic compass and a lunch meeting with the NATO Secretary General on co-operation in theatres of operation.</p> <p> I want to reassure the Deputy because he has asked this question before.  There are no plans for an EU army and if there were, Ireland would not be part of it.  That is not the approach we have ever taken through our EU membership.  It is not allowed in EU treaties.  The Deputy keeps raising this but it genuinely is really not an issue.</p></speech>

We saw that quite recently when Ireland was named as one of 14 countries that support further militarisation through the rapid reaction force, which the Minister referenced previously.  Not only can that venture be classified as being in contravention to Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing and declared policy of neutrality, it also contradicts the Minister's intentions of presenting himself at the UN as an honest broker and a neutral voice in world affairs.  It also represents a very clear snub of the non-aligned nations of the world that voted for Ireland in the belief that we were opting, as I said, for that honest broker.</p>  <p>  I get why people join the Defence Forces.  I get our active participation in neutrality and peacekeeping.  There is a step in a completely different direction at European level, however.  I have serious concerns about rowing back on our neutrality and all those arguments I have put forward.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>

As somebody who is very much involved in foreign policy and defence policy, let me reassure him that Ireland is not in the space of being part of a more militarised EU.  We are in the space of co-operating with other EU countries when we can be a force for good in different parts of the world.  That is what we are trying to do now in Mali, for example, where a number of our Defence Forces personnel are working in the EU operations.  They are embedded with a German contingent and it works really well.  We are also part of an EU training mission with other European countries, which is working well.</p>  <p>  The expertise and skill set of Irish troops is being applied to try to save lives; that is what we do.  We should not apologise for it or reframe that as somehow compromising Irish neutrality because it does not.  We choose to go on whatever mission we go on.  We go through a process in the D&aacute;il and in the Government to make sure that is fully understood and transparent in terms of the decision-making process.  That is what active neutrality means.  We are not forced into any of these missions.</p></speech>

I believe the Minister made reference to Mozambique already.  It appears to me that the sole intent of this is to protect a French mining company.  I want the Minister to answer that claim.  Why would the EU be sending forces to Mozambique in a situation like that?</p>  <p>  I absolutely fully support Ireland&rsquo;s role in peacekeeping and active neutrality.  That is something I absolutely applaud, and rightfully so, we have received huge credit as an honest broker on that footing.  If we were to go into ventures such as this in Mozambique and other scenarios, however, that will seriously question our neutrality.  It is a further step towards militarisation within the EU, ultimately leading to an EU army, which the Minister said at this point is not the intention.  I believe, however, that we are being dragged by the nose into such a scenario.</p></speech>

It is important that the EU supports Mozambique to ensure that terrorist forces do not destabilise parts of the country and that we can protect civilians and a democratic system.</p>  <p>  There are no plans for Ireland to be part of any Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, mission in Mozambique.  I certainly defend the right of Portugal and other countries to try to give leadership, however, just like Ireland has done in other countries to try to intervene to support democracy and stability.</p>  <p>  Many countries in Africa, unfortunately, and particularly the Horn of Africa, need support and intervention at different times.  There are no ulterior motives here.  I have been involved in a number of debates on the Mozambique issue.

He will be aware that a review has been ongoing now for quite a while.  There were reports that the review was supposed to have concluded a year ago.  Where is that review and when does the Minister expect it to be published?</p></reply>

The report was accepted in full by the Government at the time.  To facilitate implementation, a high-level plan entitled Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One was also agreed and published on the same date.</p>  <p>  The high-level plan provided for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the Public Service Pay Commission recommendations.  It also proposed a timeframe for actions or projects to commence and identified the lead actor to implement the action or project.  The timeframe for commencement of the actions is split into four distinct timelines.</p>  <p>  The project to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force was identified as a medium-term project being jointly led by the Department and the Defence Forces together.  After initial research, it was decided that this project would be divided into two phases, the first focusing on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for officers and the second to review contracts for service for enlisted personnel.</p>  <p>  It was agreed at PDFORRA that enlisted privates and corporals who had reached 21 years' service and were under-50 could remain in service until the end of 2022.  Sergeants who were due to retire were also permitted to continue to serve until that timeframe.  These measures meant that the review could take place in an extended timeframe. </p>  <p>  A report on the first phase of this project on reviewing mandatory retirement age for officers was completed by the joint civil-military project team and is currently with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform awaiting clarification on a number of issues, which I understand are primarily with regard to pension entitlements.  Work on the second phase of examining contracts of service for enlisted personnel is under way and progressing well.</p>  <p>  Any proposals or decisions that arise from these considerations relating to the mandatory retirement ages will be discussed with the representative associations, of course.  My Department continues to engage with the associations on all matters that fall within the scope of the representation, not just those arising from the high-level implementation plan.  A draft piece of work is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the moment and we are hoping to get approval and clarification on a number of issues.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the report has been completed.  I know it is still a draft report but it is now with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>The reason I asked the question is because, as those in the House will be aware, many officers who have joined the Defence Forces since 2014 are now leaving ahead of the mandatory retirement age because they are on reduced pension terms as compared with other public servants.  We know that those in the Defence Forces are regarded as being different from other public servants in that the retirement age for them is not increasing up to the age of 68 .  For those who are Defence Forces officers, the age at which they must mandatorily retire is between 56 and 60.</p> <p> The other reason I tabled this question is that, unfortunately, because of the gap in pension which arises, many officers make a decision to leave the Defence Forces early.  Many of them are leaving in their 30s.  That is a time when they should be assuming leadership roles.  It is important that we bring clarity and certainty to this as soon as possible because we need to ensure that we retain our officers within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

That is why I am anxious to conclude this issue, to have the report finalised and published and to stay in close contact with the representative bodies throughout that process.  However, the Deputy will also know that I do not make all the calls on pensions.  In fact, I do not make very many of them at all, even for the Defence Forces in my capacity as Minister for Defence.  Pensions policy and any changes relating to it, even for the Defence Forces in a niche area, are matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.  We are working with that Department.  We have asked for clarification on a number of pensions issues and we are waiting for the Department to come back to us on them.  The sooner we can bring clarity in respect of this matter, the better.</p></speech>

However, he is the advocate at Cabinet for the Defence Forces.  I know that he will continue to advocate on their behalf when it comes to the mandatory retirement age, which I believe should be increased.</p>  <p>  The issue for the Defence Forces officers arises because of the Public Sector Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012, which resulted in the designed entitlement to the single pension or equivalent value through a supplementary pension being denied to new entrants who have joined the Defence Forces since 2013.  It was always the case for commissioned officers that the entitlement to the State pension, contributory or equivalent value through a supplementary pension, was a factor that was taken into account.  The problem for the Defence Forces officers is that if they must mandatorily retire between the ages of 56 and 60 and there is no State pension benefit for them, it puts them in a very difficult position.  That is why they are looking elsewhere in their 30s to plan ahead for themselves and their families.  I thank the Minister for his answer.</p></speech>

If one speaks to officers who have joined after a certain time, it is a big issue for them in terms of planning their careers, particularly the latter parts of their careers as leaders and officers within the Defence forces.  That is one of the reasons we are having a review in this area.  As I have said, however, we are going to have to wait for clarity from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the pensions issues that have been raised by Deputy O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the actions that have been undertaken to date, I have asked the Chief of Staff to consider whether it is possible, as an exceptional measure, to have a retrospective examination of the events at Jadotville in September 1961 in the context of the award of medals and the possible implications for the integrity of the award of medals system.  In response, the Chief of Staff proposed the establishment of an independent group of external experts to consider the entire case and evidence, including new evidence, if any is available.</p>  <p>  The independent review group was established by the Chief of Staff in December 2020 and consists of the following members: the chairman, Brigadier-General Paul Pakenham, retired; Dr. Michael Kennedy of the Royal Irish Academy; Commandant Billy Campbell, retired; Regimental Sergeant Major Michael Dillon, retired; and Ms Linda Hickey of the military archives.  The terms of reference for the review are clear and are outlined in my written answer.  I can go through them if the Deputies so wish.</p>  <p>  In line with its terms of reference, the independent review group will examine, report and make recommendations in respect of the Battle of Jadotville of 13 to 17 September 1961 and will report its findings to the Chief of Staff.  The work of the independent review group is well under way and the group has been actively engaged in the consultation and research process.  The review group was due to conclude by 31 March 2021, however, given the sheer volume of meetings and the comprehensive nature of the research process, which is still producing a vast amount of material, an interim report was submitted and an extension to the timeframe for reporting to the Chief of Staff was requested.  Taking into account the volume of research material and engagement being undertaken by the independent review group in the course of its work on this very important matter, this request for an extension has been recently acceded to.  The timeframe for submission of the final report is mid-June.  Once the work of the independent review group has been completed, the Chief of Staff will make recommendations, as appropriate, to my office.</p>  <p>  At this juncture, it would be premature to state if the interim report or the final report, once submitted, will be published or released.  I will await the outcome of the work of the independent review group and the recommendations of the Chief of Staff in due course.  When the final report has been received and any findings have been given due consideration, a decision on the release of the interim report and final report will then be made, taking into account any legal or other considerations arising.  Certainly, it is my intention to be as transparent as I possibly can be in respect of this process when the final report becomes available.  Obviously, however ,I will have to take legal advice on that.  I hope that this process will be able to bring this issue, debate and discussion to an end.  September next is a very significant anniversary of the heroic contribution of Irish Defence Forces personnel at Jadotville.  I hope that we will have a successful outcome to this review which will conclude next month.</p></speech>

I know that other Deputies have raised this issue, but I looked at my own previous contributions on the matter and I first raised it in 2017 with the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Kehoe.  We have made progress in the sense that there seems to be more openness to look at the issue.  It is disappointing that the review has not been completed, but I understand that there is a lot of work to be done.  Does the Minister have a date for when the review will be completed and the report published?</p>  <p>  I must say that nothing has captured my heart or imagination like this story.  I have watched the film, read two books on the matter and attended all of the talks given by the son of the officer commanding.  Most significantly, it was the presentations made by the pupils of two schools, Galway Community College and Malahide Community College, that really captured my imagination.  We need heroes, and these soldiers were heroes.  I will speak more about that in my second contribution.  I hope we have learned to do the decent thing.  I will conclude so that I stay within my time limit, seeing as I give out so much about it.</p></speech>

There was some concern when a time extension was requested but I understand the rationale behind that.  A lot of work needs to be done and I welcome the fact that the review will be thorough.  We need to bring an end to the injustice that has been done to the gallant members of the Defence Forces who participated in the Battle at Jadotville almost 60 years ago, with the anniversary coming up in September.  That injustice must be brought to an end.  We must undo the unjustified shame suffered by those soldiers, especially given the fact that 33 of those who participated in the battle were recommended for distinguished service medals and five were recommended for military medals for gallantry by Colonel Pat Quinlan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that an end date of mid June has been set for the review.  I ask the Minister to provide assurances that this deadline will be met because, as I said, the 60th anniversary falls in September.  There is only a handful of survivors left at this point.  I hope that the review leads to the right outcome for them and that the occasion of the 60th anniversary is used for the awarding of the long-awaited medals</p></speech>

The Quinlan family have been very strong advocates for full recognition of the contribution that Irish Defence Forces serving personnel made in what were extraordinarily testing and difficult circumstances during the Battle of Jadotville.</p>  <p>  It is important that the awarding of medals is a military process and not a political one.  What we are trying to do with this review by the independent group with military, historical and archive expertise is to make sure that not only was an appropriate decision made in terms of the awarding of medals, but also that the contribution that was made is considered accurately in view of the knowledge we now have of the historical context and so on.  I hope this will be an opportunity to come to conclusions that those who served at Jadotville and their families can be very happy with, that will provide closure and a correction of the historical record, should that be the recommendation in terms of the assessment of those events.  I have seen the film too.  I have also read a lot about Jadotville and have spoken to many people about it.  I am approaching this with the goal of transparency.  I want to ensure that all issues around Jadotville are fully considered and recommendations are made accordingly.  I hope that the date I have given of mid-June for the final report can be met.  Some would have liked even more time but I am anxious to get it done so that we can bring the conclusions back to the D&aacute;il and Seanad before we break up for the summer recess.  I hope that those involved will be able to conclude their work but the most important issue is the quality of that work.  We must not rush it.  The volume of work undertaken by the review group has been quite extraordinary, which is why more time was needed.</p></speech>

I would just like to point out to Deputy Brady that I also tabled a question on this issue, which was grouped with his.  That is why I am here and contributing to the discussion.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about a process that is not political, and I understand that, but if ever a time was right to do the right thing, the 60th anniversary in September is that time.  I do not know how a story of bravery, gallantry and heroism was turned on its head.  These were young soldiers, some of whom were only 16 years of age.  I imagine their parents were still getting the children's allowance for them when they lied about their age.  They were called the "Jadotville Jacks".  I do not understand how the story of their heroism could be turned on its head.  That alone deserves a new narrative.  The amount of pain and suffering and the number of suicides that followed from the consequent behaviour of the system towards those soldiers was unbearable.  Among the group of soldiers, 27 were proposed by their commandant for distinguished service medals, 29 for bravery and five for gallantry.  I may have those figures slightly wrong but what is important is the substantial nature of the awards that were recommended but not given.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we do the right thing.</p></speech>

We have seen a whole series of local authorities around the country pass motions on Jadotville and we have seen schools getting involved in advocacy and doing projects on Jadotville.  This is something that has caught the interest of many people across the country.  It is a story of heroism, professionalism and extraordinary human endeavour.  There are many other stories of heroism and extraordinary bravery linked to the Defence Forces too, which is why we have a medals system within the Defence Forces.  What is being looked at now is whether they got it wrong on this occasion and whether the contribution of Defence Forces personnel at Jadotville has not been written into history in the way it should.  That is what is being considered now.  I hope, on the back of a substantial amount of research and consideration, to be able, as Minister, to correct anything that should have been corrected before now.  Members should not forget that there have been multiple and very genuine attempts by the State to address the Jadotville issue in terms of the awarding of Jadotville medals, scrolls and so on.  However, what is happening now is a more fundamental review of the process and the place in history of this contribution, from a peacekeeping perspective, under extraordinary circumstances.  I hope by the middle of June to have recommendations that I can act on.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on it to do so.  An enormous amount of work needs to be done but ultimately this is about undoing the disservice done to those involved.  It is about honouring the heroes of Jadotville of 60 years ago.  The fact that the testimony of the officer on the ground and his recommendations were not listened to or acted upon was the fundamental flaw in the entire process.  We cannot undo that but the fact that the review is taking place at this point is welcome.  The handing out of scrolls completely missed the core point.  Hopefully, the many mistakes that were made in terms of the classification of these heroic Irish soldiers as cowards will be undone and the record will be set straight.  We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to do that and I hope the right decisions are made.</p></speech>

We have set up a review process involving people who are taking it extraordinarily seriously.  I have been assured that this process will be very robust.  It will take into account an extraordinary volume of archival and historical material and will make recommendations on the back of all of that, in consultation with the families and many others.</p> <p>I hope that by the middle of next month, a report with recommendations will be presented to the Chief of Staff, who will forward that report to me.  We can have the next debate on this issue in the context of all that knowledge and the recommendations that will come from it.</p></speech>

The Government also approved the terms of reference, based on the programme for Government, and the membership of the commission.   The commission&rsquo;s overall approach will be guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and its update in 2019.  As part of a broader consultation process, the commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its terms of reference.  The commission received more than 500 submissions, which it is currently analysing.  </p>  <p>  The commission has been established as an independent body, and while it is a matter entirely for the commission, I understand it has met a broad stakeholder group, including the representative associations, senior and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials from my Department and other groups.  Site visits to military locations by members of the commission have taken place and I understand that further site visits have been scheduled if Covid restrictions permit.  The chairman of the commission, Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, also met members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on 20 April to discuss the ongoing work of the commission. </p>  <p>  The establishment of an independent commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, in terms of both meeting immediate requirements and also seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.  The commission is to submit its report by the end of the year and it will be considered fully at that time.  I look forward to having a debate in the House on the contents of that final report when it has been presented to me and the Government has had an opportunity to consider it.</p></speech>

A couple of weeks ago in <i>The Irish Times</i>, however, Aidan O'Driscoll was quoted as saying that the contentious issue of pay, allowances and overtime for Defence Forces personnel would not be considered by the commission.  There is also the sense among the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, that this will be another wasted year.</p><p>There have been many reviews over the years and many commissions have examined the Defence Forces but the issues remain the same.  They include malcontent among personnel in regard to their rates of pay and overtime, allowances and accommodation.  The basic bread and butter issues and respect for the job are absent from the Defence Forces and are not being dealt with.  It will be, as RACO has stated, another wasted year unless these are dealt with.</p></speech>

One of the main reasons I persuaded many people within my party to vote for the programme for Government was that it was clear the commission would deal with the issue of pay and conditions.  It appears, however, that Mr. O'Driscoll's comments were at variance with that.  Will the Minister directly address that?</p>  <p>  While there is a range of issues in the area of the Defence Forces, pay and conditions is the key one for some members.  It is the issue on which they are waiting for us to move.  Will the Minister address the issue of a permanent pay commission and state whether a pay recommendation will be made in advance of that as part of the commission?  Will a separate pay commission be established or should we not expect a pay award to be made until after the commission has published its report?</p></speech>

In its terms of reference, it has been asked to examine pay structures and allowances, how they developed and are structured, and whether they are appropriate in terms of international best practice and so on.  It will certainly consider pay structures and allowances, how they work within the Defence Forces and whether those structures can be improved.  Separately, we have committed in the programme for Government to setting up an independent pay body for the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I have contended for many years that people who commit to a career in the Defence Forces are different in many ways from others who commit to public service.  They cannot strike or get involved in political advocacy and a series of different structures apply to them, within the defence infrastructure, in regard to arbitration mechanisms and so on.  It is a very different type of service and in my view, therefore, it justifies a separate pay body to assess the unique circumstances, challenges and rewards needed in the context of serving in our Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>  There are two commitments of the Government.  Within the terms of reference, the commission can examine pay structures and allowances but is required to be consistent with public sector pay policy.  I am often involved in debates in the House in which Deputies ask me to increase pay rates in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>The very same people will defend collective bargaining in public sector pay agreements, and so on.  One cannot have both.  We need to have consistency here, which is why we are trying to address this by setting up a separate pay body to look at the unique circumstances within the Defence Forces around pay, structures, allowances and so on.  The commission will be looking at these issues and when the commission reports, we have committed to setting up an independent pay body at that time.</p></speech>

On the one hand he says that it is a different type of service and deserves a separate pay body.  On the other hand he says that it is required to be in line with public sector pay.  Which is it?  Is in line with public sector pay or is a special kind of service that requires a special body to deal with pay?  Whichever it is, the Minister must make up his mind because as RACO has stated, this is another wasted year in respect of pay and pay structures, allowances, conditions and the question of affiliation.</p>  <p>  The Minister has just empathised with the military personnel, in that they cannot go on strike or flex their muscles in the same way as other public sector workers, but they can affiliate to the ICTU.  PDFORRA was given a ruling in the European Committee of Social Rights that the Government was in violation by preventing affiliation to the ICTU.  The least the Minister can do is to allow that affiliation and to clarify the complete mess here about pay.  Is it a special body, is it public sector, are they linked?  In the meantime, many soldiers and military personnel are leaving the service right across the Defence Forces because they are being treated badly.  If they are a special force, then treat them as such and stop ignoring the issues.</p></speech>

Allowances are at the heart of some of the key grievances that many of the Defence Forces personnel have.  It was unfortunate that the comments were made in the Oireachtas that appeared to say the commission would not deal with HR issues.</p>  <p>  Members of the Defence Forces in my constituency will want to know what this means for them.  We need to be clear, as a Government, in outlining the timeline for that.  I welcome the idea of a permanent pay commission.  It is very important for all of the reasons outlined by the Minister.  Will the changes in structures and allowances lead to more money in Defence Forces members' pockets at the end of this year or will they have to wait until the end of the pay commission&rsquo;s deliberations?  Those, I believe, are reasonable questions for the Minister.</p></speech>

Everybody&rsquo;s take-home pay is increasing this year across the public sector.  We must first wait for the commission to report at the end of the year.  The Government has to then consider these recommendations and no doubt we also will have a debate in this House on them and we will make a decision then on the back of that.  One commitment we have made, separate to those of the commission but I suspect that its recommendations will be consistent with this, is a commitment in the programme for Government to set up an independent pay body to assess pay issues across the Defence Forces because its members are in a unique category of service.  That is justified and is also the case in many other countries where there is a separate pay review body for serving personnel.</p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has raised a number of issues and she quotes both RACO and PDFORRA.  As it happens, those organisations have very different perspectives on ICTU affiliation and the setting up of an independent pay body and there is not a uniform view.  Different people have different perspectives and I am trying to take account of both.  I have told PDFORRA that I have not ruled out ICTU affiliation.  While I have some concerns about it, I am committed to setting up an independent pay review body, as is the Government, as can be seen in the programme for Government.  That is the right course of action and is also what I understand RACO supports and was looking for.  This is an ongoing discussion to try to get this right.  The commission is looking at international best practice on pay structures within the Defence Forces as to allowances and how they can be used appropriately to reward service in the Defence Forces and I look forward to the recommendations that will come back in that space.</p></speech>

There are a number of vacant homes in that estate.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on what the plans are for those vacant homes and is he minded to hand over the estate to Kildare County Council?</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that it has been a long-standing policy to discontinue the historic provision of tied housing to Defence Forces' personnel.  This policy, introduced in the late 1990s, has been implemented on a gradual basis, sympathetic to the needs of those occupying these former married quarters and, in particular, those persons who may be vulnerable.  It is not intended to reverse this long-standing policy and, as such, I can confirm to the Deputy that it is my Department's policy to transfer ownership of properties to the housing authority, in this case Kildare County Council, at the earliest opportunity subject, of course, to its agreement.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department transferred two residential properties that were vacant in 2019 to Kildare County Council.  It is intended to make a similar offer to the housing authority in due course.</p>  <p>  As to the handing over of the estate to Kildare County Council, it would be my Department's preference that the local authority take the same in charge. However, this is a matter for the county council in the first instance.</p></speech>

From a broader perspective, the Curragh Camp, as we both know, is an excellent place full of wonderful people but dereliction is a major issue in the camp on foot of decades of neglect.  It is quite an old Victorian camp.  To be fair to the Department of Defence, it has a finite budget.  There is only so much that it can spend in the camp every single year.</p>  <p>  What are the Minister's thoughts on mobilising the broader Government to assist in regenerating that facility?  For instance, the Office of Public Works has a budget and the Department of Higher and Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science has a budget that could be used for the Military College.  The Department of Education could help out with the three schools in the Curragh, and the Department of Rural and Community Development could help out with a rural and town centre regeneration scheme.  The question therefore is should we be looking at a broader approach to addressing the dereliction and infrastructure deficits in the Curragh?  I thank the House.</p></speech>

The answer is basically "Yes".  I have already had a conversation on this with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the context of the plans that we have around the concept of an international peace and leadership institute as part of the broader Curragh campus, which would be an investment and an expansion in many ways of the Military College and the education and work that goes on there.</p>  <p>  First, we have an increasing capital investment programme.  The capital investment for this year in the budget is &euro;130 million but this capital investment should be well beyond that and we will be able to supplement some of the existing expenditure from current expenditure surpluses that we will have.  There is a broader question here, however, as the Deputy has asked whether we can look at the Curragh in a more holistic way to try to build a community there and deal with some of the dereliction on site.</p> <p>I have walked through the Curragh Camp.  There is too much dereliction even though there is investment going on.  I hope to be able to put a more ambitious and broader thinking plan in place with other Ministers.</p></speech>

The budget negotiations will be coming up in the next few months and I ask the Minister to advocate as strongly as possible to his Cabinet colleagues - I know he does so - that if the defence budget was increased, there would be more money available for infrastructural projects and to invest in the Curragh Camp in particular, which is the home of the Defence Forces.  Nearly every member of the Defence Forces passes through the Curragh at some stage in their careers.  It is where all the career courses take place.  Investment in its infrastructure would certainly make a significant difference.</p></speech>

Second, we are investing in the Curragh.  I am sure many people would like me to accelerate that further and to spend more but we have invested and are continuing to invest in multiple projects in the Curragh.  I will continue to advocate for increased budgets in defence.  I think that is justified.  We have a five-year capital investment programme already in place which commits to the expenditure of an enormous amount of money across all elements of defence infrastructure, whether it is the Air Corps, Naval Service or Army, in various camps and barracks and in terms of upgrading equipment, whether that is aircraft, refurbished Mowag vehicles or whatever.  My job is to make sure that we invest appropriately in the Defence Forces in terms of infrastructure, equipment and human resources.  We will do so.  I recognise that the Curragh is the centre of operations and I am currently considering certain flagship projects in the Curragh.</p></speech>

The service is up for renewal in 2023 and I understand proposals will shortly be brought to Cabinet with regard to how best to configure the service from 2023 onwards.  I was very grateful for the comments of the Minister a few months ago when he stated that, in his view, the Air Corps should be given the most significant role in providing that service as humanly and physically possible.  Is that still his view?  I ask him to update the House in that regard.</p></reply>

There is, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, currently a project ongoing under the remit of the Department of Transport to consider, develop and bring to fruition a new marine search and rescue aviation contract for future service provision.  The current contract for the SAR helicopter service is between the Minister of Transport and a civil helicopter operator, namely, CHC Ireland DAC.  The contract commenced on 1 July 2012 for a period of ten years, with an option to extend for a further three years.  The existing contract has been extended for one year to 2023 to facilitate the lengthy procurement process and ensure compliance with the public spending code.</p>  <p>  As the House is aware, a strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the public service code was brought to the Government for information last July.  It included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the State assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard aviation branch.  Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons, notably the risks to the State and questions around potential affordability and deliverability.  I agree with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal to which I have referred and I do not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for SAR services in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue domain.  I think many people in the Air Corps would agree with that assessment in terms of the timelines and capacity issues involved.</p>  <p>  I have acknowledged in the House and other forums that I would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service, given its historical role in this area.  I confirmed previously that late last year I asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.  I have not been prescriptive regarding what model any potential SAR marine aviation service delivery by the Air Corps could take.  There is much to consider and examine, including legal considerations, as part of this process.  I thank my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his proactive engagement and that of his team on this matter with the defence organisation in recent months.  </p></speech>

When Roscommon hospital was closed down in 2013 and there was a need to establish a medevac helicopter in Athlone, the Air Corps was tasked with providing this aeromedical emergency service.  It has been providing that service successfully for the past ten years.  It did not go out to contract; the Air Corps was just tasked with doing it.  When a Garda air support unit was needed in the late 1990s, that did not go out to contract; the Air Corps was just tasked with providing the service.  Not only was it tasked with doing so, it was actually resourced to do so.  Two helicopters were purchased and, as all present are aware, those helicopters are still flying in the air over Dublin.  That model is a good one.  We should identify what component of the service the Air Corps can look after and then task and resource it accordingly.  Any part of the service that cannot be provided by the Air Corps should be outsourced to a civilian contractor.  I would be grateful for the views of the Minister on this issue.</p></speech>

If I made an inappropriate contribution, I could be accused of undermining the process.  This contract involves an enormous amount of public money.  It is a process that must be fair to everybody, whether the existing operator or others who wish to bid for the service.  It is being managed by another Department.  There has been considerable engagement between that Department and my Department to try to do what is appropriate and what would provide value for money and protect the integrity of the process.  My Department and I have been involved in that regard.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next SAR marine aviation service will be a matter for the Government once the detailed appraisal and business case has been finalised by the Department of Transport.  My contribution here is to try to ensure that the Defence Forces, through the Air Corps, put options on the table for how they can contribute in a positive way that can guarantee a quality of service and value for money that should be part of the broader considerations.  It is up to the Department of Transport to respond to that.  We have put a lot of work into this.</p></speech>

The key final point I wish to get across is that this contract could be an enormous contract, worth up to &euro;1 billion over ten years, which is the equivalent of half a children's hospital, but without having a children's hospital or even half a children's hospital to show for it.  My specific recommendations are that, where possible, we should invest in our public service first and foremost.  We should try to keep the money of Irish taxpayers in Ireland.  Instead of assisting international helicopter leasing companies, we should focus on providing for and resourcing our own services first and then outsource what it is not possible for them to provide.</p></speech>

My approach as Minister for Defence is always to look at what the Defence Forces can do, whether they can do more and whether I can resource them to do more so that we can use the assets of the State and the skill sets of the Defence Forces in new areas.  It is important to note on the record the quality of the SAR service we currently have in place.  I have been winched up into helicopters on more than one occasion.  Lives have been saved.  The contribution the search and rescue operation that is currently in place has offered in recent years is of very high quality.</p> <p>It is expensive but it is good value for money given the service that is provided.  What is under consideration now is whether the skill set of the Defence Forces can be part of an overall new SAR contract and, if so, what would be the appropriate level of contribution.  A range of issues must be considered in that regard by the Department of Transport, which has shown a real open mind on this.  I do not want to overplay or overestimate the capacity of the Air Corps and Defence Forces in terms of the role they can play, but I certainly hope they play some role in contributing to the next search and rescue contract.</p></speech>

The operative word in that question is "progress".  I listened to the Minister addressing a parallel issue to this earlier and it seems there are plenty of commissions but no progress.  Can he give an indication of when we might see progress in the only area that makes much of a difference, namely, pay in the pockets of those serving in the Defence Forces?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300011#J00600"><p>I propose to take Question Nos. 13, 50 and 276 together.</p>  <p>  There are many reasons individuals may leave the Defence Forces, ranging from individual personal circumstances to career opportunities, having fulfilled their contract or retirement on age grounds.  The Defence Forces offer significant career opportunities and while pay has been highlighted as an issue, there has been significant progress in recent years.</p>  <p>  Public service pay policy is determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform having regard to public sector pay agreements.  The Department of Defence does not have discretion to award separate pay increases, as Deputies understand.  The Defence Forces have received pay increases in line with the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1 October 2020.  The restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the financial emergency in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation was also restored from 1 October 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to the general round of pay increases awarded to public servants, members of the Defence Forces have also benefited from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission.  These included a 10% increase in military service allowance; the restoration of a 10% cut applied to a number of Defence Forces allowances under the Haddington Road pay agreement; the restoration of premium rates for weekend security duty allowances; and the restoration of a service commitment scheme for pilots.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a new seagoing service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel, which came into effect from 1 January 2021, is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel and incentivising seagoing duties within the Naval Service.  The seagoing naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 was applied in the 2020 tax year for members of the Naval Service who served 80 days or more at sea on board a naval vessel in 2019.  This tax credit has been extended for a further year and is increased to &euro;1,500 for the 2021 tax year. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations.  A new agreement, Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021 - 2022, has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions.  The Permanent Defence Force representative associations have yet to ballot their members and, accordingly, advise the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, of formal acceptance, or otherwise, of this agreement.  The agreement provides for a further increase in pay to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, should the representative associations advise the WRC of formal acceptance of the agreement.  It includes a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, in October 2021; the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a sectoral bargaining fund, in accordance with chapter 2 of the agreement, on 1 February 2022; and a general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces and this is reflected in the programme for Government.  This provided for the establishment of a commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15 December 2020.  After completion of the commission&rsquo;s work, I will consult the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I know there are problems with recruitment and retention across the Defence Forces.  I am very aware of these and we are working on them.  It is not true to say there has been no progress on pay and allowances.  There has been considerable progress is many areas.  We need to do more and we will continue to look at those issues.  We have to assess the recruitment and retention issues in the round.  Pay and allowances are part of that but other factors must also be taken into account.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to some special allowances but they are allowances and not basic pay.  Most of the other increases he announced will be given to the public service in general.  That does not address the fundamental issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister correctly pointed out earlier that the Defence Forces are unique.  They are not compatible with the public service in general.  For example, members of the Defence Forces cannot strike, as the Minister pointed out, but they do not get overtime either.  They are, therefore, in a totally different category.  By saying they are included in the public service agreements seems to indicate that we will talk about it but we will not recognise that there is a special underlying issue that needs to be addressed here.</p>  <p>  The Minister talked about setting up a special group to look at the pay of the Defence Forces.  Can he give an indication of when that will be set up, when it will likely submit a final report and when decisions will be made on it?</p></speech>

What we have committed to in the programme for Government is that on the back of what the commission reports to me before the end of the year, I will consult the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, on the setting up of an independent pay review body for the Defence Forces.  The reason for this is the uniqueness, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v outlined and as I referred to earlier, of serving in the Defence Forces, members' inability to strike and get involved in political lobby and so on.</p>  <p>  Serving in the Defence Forces is unique in the public service and requires an independent pay review body that will not just report on a single occasion but will be permanent and will assess pay issues in the Defence Forces each year.  That is what the Government has committed to and I look forward to being able to deliver on that.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody wants this to be adjudicated in a court in this country.  The Minister stated he had some difficulties with this.  Will he outline what those difficulties are?  Will he clarify whether he is considering changing the age limits for members of the Defence Forces or intends extending them?  There are serious issues that must be addressed.  Will he clarify exactly what the problems are?</p></speech>

What we are trying to do is reflect the fact that people who serve in the Defence Forces are, in many ways, part of a unique service.  They take an oath to the State and commit to not getting involved in industrial action, so they are in a different category.</p> <p>We need to make sure we put structures in place to recognise that and to ensure that people serving in the Defence Forces are protected in that context.  There are different ways of doing that.  PDFORRA would contend that the best way of protecting the interests of the Defence Forces is through affiliation with ICTU, particularly around public sector pay negotiations and so on, but there are different views on whether that is the best way to protect the interests of Defence Forces personnel.  The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, takes a different view, for example.  We are looking at both.  I have an open mind.  I have not ruled out anything.  It is not as straightforward as some people maintain.</p> <p> On the second issue, we spoke about that a lot earlier in some of the previous questions.  We have a review coming close to an end on retirement age within the Defence Forces.  I hope to be able to bring those recommendations soon.</p></speech>

I take her point.  I talk to the representative bodies all the time and I will happily talk to them on this issue.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration, C&amp;amp;A, for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the determination of claims and proposals from the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, relating to remuneration and conditions of  service and having regard to the provisions of public sector pay agreements. </p><p>Officials from my Department continue to work with the representative associations in a positive and collaborative process within the C&amp;amp;A scheme to resolve issues.  There is also ongoing engagement on a regular basis between the official side and the representative side on a range of items which are processed through C&amp;amp;A.</p><p>The C&amp;amp;A scheme was independently reviewed in 2018, the outcome of the review containing a number of recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of the scheme.  Agreement was reached with the associations on a revised C&amp;amp;A scheme, incorporating the recommendations in the review, and came into operation in January 2020.  Whilst agreement on all matters is never inevitable it is the case that the associations have delivered numerous positive benefits for their members through C&amp;amp;A.</p><p>Since my appointment as Minister with responsibility for Defence, I have also met with both Permanent Defence Force representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, on three occasions: 17 July 2020, 20 October 2020 and 17 December 2020.  I have also met with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association on one occasion on 23 November 2020.</p><p>The Department of Defence does not have discretion to award separate pay increases.  However, the stabilisation of the national finances following the financial crisis has led to improvements within the economy which have allowed the Government to restore pay to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants.  This has been delivered in accordance with national public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases has been weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>Some of the increases received in recent times on foot of the most recent pay agreement include a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1 October 2020 and the restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the FEMPI legislation, restored from the same date.  In addition to the general rounds of pay increases awarded, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission including a 10% increase in military service allowance.</p><p>While the minimum remuneration for trained personnel is comprised of basic pay and military service allowance, remuneration for individual members of the Permanent Defence Force is also dependent on a range of factors relating to the role and duties they perform.  This can entail additional remuneration relating to technical pay, duty allowances or other special allowances.</p><p>Negotiations held in late 2020 on a new public service agreement lead to a new agreement, <i>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022,</i>which has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions.  Should the representative associations accept this agreement, their members will benefit from further increases in pay.  I look forward to further continued constructive engagement with the Defence Forces representative associations on that agreement, which I hope will be ratified by the associations.</p><p>The programme for Government provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces which was established on 15 December 2020.  Upon completion of the commission's work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body, reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service. </p></speech>

I and Sinn F&eacute;in called for the largest ever programme of summer provision and for the DEIS summer camps to be extended beyond DEIS schools.  I welcome the fact that significant funding has been announced and there is a wider application potential there.  The concern I have is ensuring the maximum of those eligible can avail.  Removing disincentives to staff and schools participating is key and there are a number of such disincentives.  I would like the Minister of State to address them.</p></reply>

It gives me an opportunity to respond on what we are doing with the expanded summer education programme for people with complex special education needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage, as a Covid-19 pandemic response measure for summer 2021.  This is an incredibly important Government decision which ensures for the first time that all primary and post-primary schools have the opportunity to provide summer programmes for children with complex needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The total funding available to provide the programme is up to &euro;40 million, which is a 100% increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.  It is double the funding.  The programmes for mainstream students in primary and post-primary schools are new programmes for 2021, building upon previous summer programmes for pupils with complex special education needs and those provided in DEIS schools last year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about removing disincentives.  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage schools to offer the programme, including measures to reduce the administrative burden, so there is now a centralised application process.  There is provision of funding to schools towards the preparation and overseeing of the programmes.  There is the earlier payment of school staff and provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer to work on the programme.  The programme's aims are to support students to re-engage with education, build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and, for some who are at key transition stages, to help ensure they can move on to their planned educational placement next September along with their peers.</p></speech>

I will not criticise the provision of additional funds because it is what we wanted.  However, I am concerned that there is a significant difference between eligibility and the ability to apply and the spaces that will exist.  The problem is we are right down to the wire.  There was a nod to some of the disincentives in the Department's press release a number of days ago but we need more detail.</p>  <p>  The first disincentive to schools, as opposed to individual members of staff, is the lack of guidance.  Schools could be running this programme in the next six or seven weeks and they still do not have guidance on what exactly the programme will entail, number of hours, prioritisation and so on.  That is the first disincentive and needs to be provided as soon as possible.  When will schools get guidance on how to run these programmes?</p></speech>

One of the things we wanted to make sure of this year was to remove any impediments schools felt existed to their participation.  Last year, 804 schools were able to apply to provide summer provision, comprising 124 special schools and 680 primary schools.  This year, there are 4,000 schools, so every single school is in a position to apply.  A lot of applications are coming in.  The closing date is Friday and there is a big uptick in post this week, which shows the positive engagement that we also had on Tuesday with stakeholders, unions, management bodies, parents and advocacy groups.  As far as the Department is concerned, all those barriers have been removed for schools to participate in the summer programme.</p></speech>

I will identify three issues and ask the Minister of State to respond to each directly because they are all vitally important.  There was a passing reference in Tuesday's announcement to earlier payment of school staff.  What exactly does that mean?  When will payment accrue?  That is important and was a massive disincentive.  The significant and disproportionate disparity in pay rates for special needs assistant, SNAs, and teachers was a disincentive to SNA participation.  There was very poor pay for SNAs participating in the summer programme.  Finally, substitute staff are concerned about potentially losing their pandemic unemployment payment because of participating.  Those three key issues have not been fully addressed yet and can increase the amount of places that can be taken up.  Will the Minister of State address those three issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300012#K01400"><p>All these issues have been raised with the schools and dealt with by the Department.  The level of investment has doubled from last year.  Teachers and SNAs working on the programme will receive an additional weeks' pay for each week of the programme.  If these staff have existing full-time contracts of employment with their school already paid during the summer, the summer programme payment will be additional on top of that.  It is intended the rate of pay for school-based staff will be based on their personal rate of pay, that is, what they are normally paid during the school year.  Payment for this work is subject to normal statutory deductions.  There is also additional paid time available for schools to prepare the programme, which will be important.  All schools can appoint an overseer to oversee the summer programme and reduce the burden on school leaders.  Another burden was around flexibility and they now have flexibility around timing, so they can have it at any time during the school holiday.</p> <p>Schools can engage substitute teachers, SNAs and teachers graduating from college this summer.</p></speech>

The Chief Medical Officer, CMO, has made it clear in his advices to the Government that schools are places of low transmission, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections in children and adolescents occur outside the school setting.  This is supported by public health doctors.</p>  <p>  Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to or within the school and funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by the Department of Education to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for personal protective equipment, PPE, sanitisation, additional cleaning and other such measures.</p>  <p>  The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of Covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by the HPSC.  The HPSC advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the high-risk and very high-risk categories can return to school and that it is important for the child's overall well-being.  This is consistent with public health advice internationally on at-risk family members.  The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, and for all pupils and staff to continue to adhere to the school's infection control measures.</p>  <p>  The Tusla Education Support Service, TESS, continues to engage with students and families identified by schools as needing additional support, and will remain in ongoing contact with school principals to identify students who may need support going forward.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Tusla has adopted a child welfare approach to all engagement with learners and families, being very conscious that many families had been impacted severely by Covid-19.</p></speech>

She and I have had this argument, discussion or whatever she wants to call it, many times over, but despite the mantra the Minister has just read out, the fact remains that there are vulnerable people out there, including teachers.  However, today I wish to focus on vulnerable family members who either have been vaccinated and are still vulnerable because of very severe types of blood cancers or who have not been vaccinated yet.  Thankfully, a lot of the families to whom I speak have been getting the vaccination.  I got it myself in recent days.  Things are moving forward and we are all grateful for that but, nevertheless, it remains the fact that there are vulnerable families whose children cannot go to school because if they pick up Covid and bring it home then the likelihood of death spikes.  People with blood cancer, for example Jan Rynne, who was mentioned in this House previously, cannot be exposed to Covid because their chances of dying are much more increased than for anybody else.  Ms Rynne has had her vaccination but the type of drugs that she is on for the cancer stop the vaccination responding in the same way as it would for the Minister or me.  There are other people out there in the same position.  What are we going to do to facilitate their children to be able to stay at home and learn?  It is not asking a king's ransom or stretching the resources of the State to breaking point, it is asking to look after a minority of very vulnerable families.</p></speech>

I also appreciate the difficulties for individual families.  I recognise that the issues the Deputy has raised are causing particular difficulties for families.  Equally, it is very important that we remember that within the education sector at every step of the way everything that we have sought to do and achieved has been done on foot of the best public health advice available to us.  That advice is telling us that children are best served when they are in school.  If they are children whose parents or family members are regarded as being particularly high risk, it is still the view of the public health experts that children themselves are best served by returning to school.  Deputy Smith graciously acknowledged that significant work has been achieved in terms of the vaccination programme.  We have been told that by the end of May or June, all those with underlying conditions will have received their vaccination.</p></speech>

I have a friend who is a teacher with a condition that makes her vulnerable and she begged her principal to allow her to teach from home because she feared going back to school.  She went back to school and she has been flat on her back with Covid for 30 days.  The reality is that no matter what the Minister says, Covid is being transmitted in schools.</p>  <p>  I wish to quote Dr. Ronan Glynn, the assistant CMO, who recently told the Ombudsman for Children, in regard to Jan Rynne, that in exceptional circumstances school supports should be provided by the Department to allow children to remain at home.   She is just an example.  I do not want the whole focus to be on Jan, but she is an important example.  The Minister keeps talking about public health advice and how closely she follows it.  There is a specific piece of advice.  Will she follow it, and will she provide in very exceptional circumstances home supports for children to learn at home?  Like I said, it is not going to break the bank.  It is a very limited request and it is increasingly applying to fewer and fewer families but, nevertheless, the need remains.</p></speech>

Substantial funding has been made available for that and it has been drawn down throughout the country in recognition of the needs of specific staff who are regarded as very high risk.  There is no question about staff who are very high risk being asked to return to school.  If they were designated as very high risk, accommodation has been made and they have been substituted.  Very high risk staff have been replaced within the school system.</p>  <p>  Equally, measures have been put in place for children who have been designated as very high risk.  That has been the procedure that has been adopted since we returned to school.  In fairness, the issue the Deputy raises in general &ndash; it is not appropriate for me to comment on a specific case &ndash; has been addressed by public health.  We have engaged with the public health experts on an ongoing basis and their advice is that children are best served in school.</p></speech>

It is also vitally important that we get it right, because if we do not then we risk our children growing into adults who potentially have a feeling of being othered, a disfigured or unhealthy understanding of sexuality and a feeling of exclusion and discomfort within the educational setting.  The Minister will be aware that there is a significant amount of concern about some of the programmes that are being provided in schools at present.</p></reply>

Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary and post-primary schools.  Relationships and sexuality education is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle.  The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed through engagement and in consultation and collaboration with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  The school's programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of the school's RSE policy.</p> <p>Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation.  It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated.</p> <p> The programme for Government states that the Government will develop inclusive and age-appropriate curricula for relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+, and will make appropriate legislative changes, if necessary.  The Department of Education is working closely with the National Council for Curriculum and assessment, NCCA, which continues the process of curricular development and publishing additional resources for SPHE and RSE to determine the approach to best give effect to this commitment in the programme for Government.  This will include legislative change, if necessary.</p> <p> The report on the review of relationships and sexuality education - the RSE programme - in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December 2019.  As part of the review of RSE, an extensive consultation occurred.  Feedback was facilitated through an online survey, written submissions, round-table meetings and large events.  Adjustments were made to the final report to reflect a stronger focus on issues that stakeholders wished to see highlighted.  The NCCA is developing updated guidance materials for schools.  It has established two development groups, which are currently working on the specifications, with a particular focus on the updating of the syllabus at junior cycle level.</p></speech>

The first concerns timescales and when we are going to see some of that work come back because we cannot have it going into the never-never.  The second is more a question of principles.  Schools are at liberty to teach in this way when there is no objective sexual education curriculum.  Where it is the view or the ethos of the school that a relationship should be between a man and a woman, and there is an LGBT child in that school, does the Minister accept they would feel uncomfortable?  Does she accept they would feel "othered"?  Does she accept also that this is entirely permitted within the legislative framework that exists at this point in time?</p></speech>

The Deputy specifically asked in regard to timelines.  As I alluded to earlier, the NCCA is developing the updated guidelines and the information and a toolkit are available online for schools in the interim.  With regard to the body of work that it is being done by the development groups, this is specifically aimed at providing new specifications in the syllabus for, in the first instance, the junior cycle and thereafter moving onwards.  The work is being undertaken at present.  The review of the junior cycle has been drafted and will be considered by the NCCA by the summer.  Subsequent work on the development of the new junior cycle curriculum programme will begin in the new school year.</p></speech>

Many parents are alarmed at the content of some of the religious-based RSE programmes being introduced in schools.  We can talk about parental choice but the reality, particularly at primary level, is that many parents do not really have a choice.  The vast majority - nine out of every ten - national schools are of a Catholic ethos, and that element of choice is something we need to advance very significantly.  There is also the fact that many children are taught an RSE programme that is not necessarily in keeping with their beliefs or the beliefs of their families.  This religious ethos is impacting on what children are learning about relationships, sexual orientation and many other things.  It allows schools, to some extent, to pick and choose the curriculum.  I ask the Minister again: does she accept that a child who is LGBT could be taught in a school that a relationship should be between a man and a woman?  Does she accept they would feel uncomfortable?  Does she accept that this is allowed within our legislation at this point?</p></speech>

As I have stated clearly, all schools are required to have an RSE policy.  That policy, we must acknowledge, is developed in consultation with the entire school community, and the entire school community includes school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  A school's programme for RSE is developed and taught, as the Deputy stated, in the context of the school's RSE policy.  It is a shared policy and one that has been achieved through collaboration and engagement with all of the partners within the school forum.  Equally, it is important to say that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring knowledge about the issues or from following the curriculum as outlined by the NCCA.  It is important to note that there is an NCCA curriculum.  Many individuals from a variety of different experiences and backgrounds would say there is a need for a new curriculum to be put in place in terms of RSE.  That work is ongoing and, as I said, it will continue right into next year.</p></speech>

Over the same period, only an additional 31 front-line educational psychologists have been appointed to our primary schools, which leaves a dramatic deficiency in capacity within the system.</p></reply>

Educational psychological assessments are not assigned to schools; rather, educational psychologists are assigned to schools.</p>  <p>  The NEPS casework service involves the provision of a psychological service for a student, with the psychologist working with the student, teachers and parents, and other professionals, if appropriate, to identify need and plan for intervention and review to support the student in school.  This service can take place over an extended period of time with NEPS psychologists.  This model does not operate on a waiting list basis.  It extends to approximately 8,000 students per annum.  The NEPS support and development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help them build their capability to respond to the well-being, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their well-being, learning, inclusion and participation.  This model of service allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  The capacity of NEPS has increased significantly from its 2016 allocation of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologists.  The capacity of NEPS was increased recently as part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools with the provision of an additional 17 psychologist posts to NEPS, bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole-time equivalent psychologist posts.  This represents by far the highest number of psychologists sanctioned for NEPS since its inception in 2000.  The capacity of NEPS will be kept under review and I hope to be in a position to increase this capacity in future years.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that, in tandem with that model of supporting schools, in order for students to access additional support, they require a psychological assessment.  To have just 31 additional front-line psychologists over the last four years, when 84% of primary school are stating there has been an increase in the number of pupils presenting with additional educational needs, is insufficient.  It is the case that psychologists are appointed to schools but they are allocated specific hours in those schools.  Medium size schools in particular, which are not in the small school category or the large school category, are squeezed.</p>  <p>To give an example of that, in one school where one educational assessment has been carried out, six pupils have had to go privately to get that assessment.</p></speech>

A new model was introduced in 2016.  I appreciate the Deputy acknowledging the various strands of work in which the NEPS psychologists are involved but it is very important to note that.  The special education teaching, SET, model of resourcing, introduced in 2016, is a needs-based resourcing model.   </p>  <p>  Schools are provided for additional resources to support pupils with additional learning needs, care needs or who have special educational needs from a set allocation of resources based on the school's profile.  Schools then have discretion to provide additional supports for pupils based on their actual identified learning needs, as opposed to allocating set quantums of time to pupils who have been assessed as having a particular disability with certain pupils who may not have had an assessment excluded from the provision.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately, rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p></reply>

Therefore, that report is essential in that scenario.  I accept the principle of what the Minister is telling me here but the practical reality on the ground is very different.  I know of schools where there are proactive teams of staff, where they use all the mechanisms available and all the resources, they engage directly with the educational psychologist and exploit the model that the Minister very well articulated here this morning, but the situation in that particular school with less than 150 pupils is that in the past 12 months, six families have had to get private psychological assessments at a cost of between &euro;500 and &euro;600.  Some have recommended further occupational therapy assessments, which is a further cost on those families.  It should be based on need, not on the financial resources of a particular family.</p></speech>

The model as introduced in 2016 is working more effectively, in that it does allow a child without a specific diagnosis to be catered for within the school environment by virtue of the hours that have been made available through the special education teacher.  Since becoming Minister I have been very conscious of the value of this work in our schools and the emphasis on well-being and inclusion in our schools.  For that reason, I very specifically made a determination about schools reopening as we returned, that additional psychologists would be made available for the benefit of schools and of children in particular.  I have committed to keeping that under review and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

The Covid pandemic has skewed the figures for children enrolling in September.

Under the programme for Government there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools and to support small schools.</p>  <p>  As part of the budget 2021 measures, the Government has sought to deliver on this commitment by the announcement of a one-point change to the primary staffing schedule and the introduction of a three-point reduction in the number of pupils required to retain a teacher currently in a school.  That has been of enormous benefit to schools nationwide.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021-22 school year was published last month and all schools can now establish their staffing for the coming school year on the basis of enrolments in September 2020.  The Department has published guidance for schools that takes account of the exceptional circumstances that have arisen for those pupils who are enrolled in school but have not returned to school during the 2020-21 school year but whose intention is to do so.  </p>  <p>  It is important that schools return valid enrolments to the Department to ensure an equitable allocation of resources to schools.  The staffing arrangements also include a staffing appeal mechanism and a developing post application process, which allows for schools to be allocated posts on the basis of projected enrolments.  The appeal process also contains a number of other criteria that may be applicable to some schools where their enrolments has changed. </p>  <p>  This year the Department and the primary staffing appeals board are cognisant of the impact of Covid-19 on schools and in that context will look carefully at all decisions on the allocation of teaching posts where schools have reduced enrolments to ensure that all decisions are reasonable and all schools are treated fairly.</p>  <p>  The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department of Education.</p></reply>

Why then has a school in my constituency, Ballingarry National School, got 38 pupils in one classroom and 35 in another?  It needed to have 199 at the end of September and it had 194.  It now has 201 as it has gained numbers over the year, mainly due to circumstances relating to Covid.  I advised it that there is an appeal process, but on Friday evening, it received a reply turning it down for an extra teacher.  Did anyone actually look at this appeal?  This is genuine.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity for appeal.  I cannot comment on the specific school the Deputy mentioned as I am not familiar with it or the format of its appeal.  However, we did successfully reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 26:1 this year.  We also included the three-point reduction for the retention of a teacher.  To be fair, that is a significant advancement for schools being able to hold onto a teacher and equally for the classroom base to be a ratio of 26:1.  That is the level that schools are allocated in their entirety.  If some classes are less than that and some are greater, that is a matter for the schools themselves distribute their teaching staff.</p></speech>

It is losing a teacher in its appeal, which was also turned down.  Under any circumstances, is it possible to have 38 students, two SNAs and a teacher in one classroom?  That is 41 people in one room.  It was turned down just because the process says "No".  Is the Minister satisfied there will be 38 unvaccinated students, an unvaccinated teacher and two unvaccinated SNAs in a single room?  What exactly are we doing here?  The process is that where a school loses or gains a teacher, it will not get that teacher until 12 months later.  In the case of Ballingarry National School, it has the pupil numbers but it now has to do without a teacher until September 2022 because the process does not allow for it.  These are exceptional circumstances.</p></speech>

There has been a three-point reduction in the number of pupils required to hold on to a member of staff.  For many schools, that has been very successful and beneficial.  For others, it might have required a reduction of four, five or six.  That is the position but there has been a significant advancement.</p>  <p>  Equally, there have been advancements regarding appeals, which can be ongoing.  I cannot comment on the specifics the Deputy referred to but schools are entitled, where they have further information, to appeal again and make reference to the layout of the room, the number who can be facilitated in a room, the number of children who will be in a room, and so on.  That is the basis for making an appeal.  If there is a specific case where a class cannot be accommodated in a specific room, as we saw last year, accommodations can be made.  I ask that the school address that in its appeal.</p></speech>

I recognise the great importance of investing in special education.  A significant investment is being made in both special classes and special schools by the Department of Education.  Almost one fifth of the Department's budget, amounting to &euro;2 billion, is spent on special education annually.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the HSE.  This includes the establishment of special classes and special school placements in geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school authorities can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure an existing space within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme, or both.  Similarly, where special schools are requested to expand provision or wish to refurbish existing facilities, they may apply to my Department for capital funding to carry out these works.  Between 2018 and 2020, permanent accommodation was delivered for 229 special classes and for 67 new classrooms in special schools. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a minor works grant is payable to all primary schools.  This grant provides good flexibility at local level to make improvements to the physical infrastructure of school buildings, including the enhancement of facilities for special needs pupils.  The grant payment structure reflects the priority of supporting special needs provision, with the grant rate for special needs students in special classes and special schools being four times the standard rate for mainstream students.  For example, a 60-pupil primary school will receive &euro;19,830, comprising &euro;6,610 paid in July, a further &euro;6,610 in additional funding as part of July stimulus, and an early payment of &euro;6,610. </p></speech>

I see a great opportunity to expand the funding schemes in the Department, with specific emphasis on empowering local schools to increase their special education resources.  I am thinking specifically about repurposing the minor works scheme and the summer works scheme.  I am aware that the Department has increased the rate of capitalisation per special needs pupil in a school but it does not allow for meaningful projects in many rural schools with low pupil numbers.</p>  <p>  There are other avenues to increase special education funding, such as the creation of a special education grant like the basic grant already paid to schools.  This would enable small-scale projects to be pursued specifically for meeting special educational needs.  It would empower local principals and families who want to use more local schools as avenues.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the NCSE, it is a matter of SENOs recognising parents and guardians as key stakeholders in respect of the child and committing to good relationships.  I would go so far as to say we need a dramatic reform of the process for assessing pupils&rsquo; needs and of how the NCSE engages with education plans for children.</p></speech>

That is as it should be.  The Deputy referred specifically to smaller schools.  A 60-pupil primary school receives just short of &euro;20,000, which comprises grants spread throughout the year, including the minor works payment in July, the minor works payment later in the year and the stimulus package.  That means substantial additional funding for schools in terms of minor works.  On top of that, there is funding being provided for personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and the replacement of staff.</p>  <p>  With regard to other grants, furniture and equipment grants are available to schools.  For example, there is a start-up grant of &euro;6,500, an ICT grant of more than &euro;5,000, a furniture grant of &euro;2,500, and a multisensory room grant &euro;7,000, all made available to special schools.</p></speech>

That is why I have raised this question today.  It is very welcome news for many families and children with autism and will certainly make the home an improved learning environment.  I know of many families around Mayo who will be looking to the minor works funding to make significant improvements in their homes.  I ask that the Minister outline specific funding avenues available to schools for the development of enhanced special educational needs facilities.  Some parents do not feel empowered to demonstrate to school principals on the issue of where funding can be pursued.  I ask that the information be made available publicly and in a structured way.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the home supports being made available.  It is a positive and progressive step forward.  I take the Deputy's point on making the public aware of the funding streams available to special schools.  I will certainly take it on board.  The funding is available but I take the point that there might well be an opportunity to disseminate the information more widely and to make it more accessible to parents and guardians.</p>  <p>  With regard to the setting up of an ASD class, the Deputy made specific reference to multisensory rooms.  There is a grant of around &euro;7,000 for the development of multisensory rooms in special schools.  That is in addition to the other funds I outlined.</p></speech>

They will be the first leaving certificate class to sit a State examination without ever having completed one before.  These two factors, along with the potential threat of further restrictions, in addition to the mental health challenges every pupil has faced, place additional stresses on this cohort of students.</p></reply>

The Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  From 11 January 2021, all students, including those currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the leaving certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools.  However, students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.</p> <p>As the Deputy is aware, all students have now returned to school.</p> <p> The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, the Department of Education provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils and students in a Covid-19 context.</p> <p> The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils' continuity of learning during those periods.  Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated significant innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation, including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.</p> <p> A number of adjustments have been made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 leaving certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations this year.  I am particularly conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in determining the assessment arrangements for the State examinations in 2022.</p></speech>

The point I want to make is that this cohort of fifth year students, who will sit the exams next year, is unique in that they have never sat a State exam before.  They have not had the experience or the pressure involved in a State exam before because they did not sit their junior certificate examinations.  These students need additional supports over the coming year.  I bring to the Minister's attention that there has been a 58% increase in the number of children presenting to our emergency departments in the last three months of 2020, with anxiety, suicidal ideation and self-harm.  Every single young person in this country has experienced additional anxiety as a result of Covid-19.  This is a challenge to deal with across our education system.  We do not need to put additional anxiety on this cohort of fifth year students in coping with a State examination.</p></speech>

In the context of the well-being of and supports for students, I acknowledge that schools and everybody involved in the school community have very much taken a well-being approach to supporting, mentoring, catering to and encouraging students with regard to school.  We are all conscious of issues.  Much of the advice about well-being issues, as the Deputy pointed out, has been highlighted by NEPS, as I alluded to earlier.</p>  <p>  On the current cohort of fifth years who will be leaving certificate students next year, I want to be clear.  As I have said previously, that suitable accommodations for assessment were made for the leaving certificate class of 2021 and consideration is being given to what supports can be put in place for the affected students in 2022.</p></speech>

Additional supports need to be provided.  In general, we need to put additional supports and new approaches in place to deal with and prevent the growing mental health issues that we have among our students at primary and post-primary level.  The results from the Growing Up in Ireland study that was carried out prior to the pandemic show that students having a higher depressive score at the age of 13 is associated with a greater chance of a diagnosis of depression at 17 or 18 years of age and a greater likelihood of self-harm.  It is important that in the wider school population, especially at second level, that we have a proactive, innovative approach across all of our students to support them from a mental health perspective.</p></speech>

It is important to consider that the experience of Covid-19 has created challenges for us all, so I include the wider school community when considering the need to provide resources and support for well-being.  As the Deputy has referenced the cohort of students who will take the leaving certificate examinations next year, I want to be clear that even in the budget in October, I was conscious of the need for supports and making additional school counsellors available.  I was pleased that more than 100 additional posts for guidance counsellors were provided in our schools.  I referred earlier to the provision of a substantial number of additional NEPS psychologists.  NEPS has been working with schools to roll out specific programmes that identify, promote and enhance the existing well-being structures in our schools.</p></speech>

The failure to tackle these super-sized classes means that many children are being subjected to a significant educational disadvantage, which has negative long-term consequences for their progression through the education system.</p></reply>

As he will be aware, it was previously raised by another Deputy.  It is a priority of mine and has been since I became Minister to reduce the pupil:teacher ratio, which we succeeded in doing, and also to address the points required for the retention of a teacher, which have fallen by three points this year.  That is important and has proven to be of significant benefit to schools.</p>  <p>  Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher to 26 pupils which, as I said, is at an historical low.  In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools and supporting small schools.  As part of the budget, as I have outlined, we reduced it by one to 26:1 and introduced a three point reduction to retain a teacher.  This announcement continues to build on this progress to date and for the 2021-22 school year, the staffing schedule will be on the basis of one teacher for every 25 pupils.</p>  <p>  The latest figures for the pupil-teacher ratio show an improved ratio of students to teachers from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015-16 school year to the 2019-20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period.  The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend.  The staffing schedule, which is at an historical low, will help to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that fewer pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.</p>  <p>  The new staffing schedule for 2021-22, taking account of the recent budget measure, was published last month and schools are in a position to establish what their staffing arrangements are for the 2021-22 school year.  The new schedule has received a positive welcome from schools.  It is an historical low.  We would like at all points for it to be as low as possible but it is not possible to do it in one fell swoop.  We will continue to work on it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the pupil-teacher ratio is decreasing and that is positive but this ratio wallpapers over what I believe is an unacceptable situation whereby there are more than 5,000 primary school children in classes of 35 or more.</p> <p>Any teacher in such a situation is not teaching but is undertaking crowd control.  That is all that is involved.  There are 84 or 85 children in classes of 40 or more.  That should not happen in any economy in the developed world.  We need to address this specific issue.  The pandemic has highlighted the issue of these supersized classes, which must be made a priority.</p></speech>

This will be at an historical low, 25:1, when pupils return to school in September.  It is a point consistently missed that we have reduced by three the number of students required for a school to hold on to a teacher.  Again, that was a bold, brave and positive measure in respect of the overall number of staff available in a school at any given time.  I again reiterate that, for every 25 pupils, one teacher is provided.  That is a staffing level of one teacher to 25 students.  That is what the ratio will be in September, which is positive.  I am committed to incrementally reducing the pupil-teacher ratio further every year, within budgetary constraints.  The Deputy specifically alluded to very large classes.  With regard to staffing appeals, appeals can be made where exceptional circumstances pertain with regard to the number of pupils in a particular class or the size of the classroom, as I alluded to earlier.  I advise schools to make appeals in such exceptional cases.</p></speech>

This has a direct impact on the amount of their time teachers can give pupils.  It impacts on individual students and has a disproportionate impact on weaker students who have learning difficulties and on brighter students who need encouragement to move a bit further on.  As a result, such students become bored in their classes for one reason or another, end up disrupting those classes and every single pupil in them suffers as a result.  We need to deal with this issue of supersized classes.  A specific focus needs to be put on the issue, particularly in the context of Covid-19 and the risk of variants in the future.  We need to eradicate these large classes.</p></speech>

I will say again that the ratio will be at an historical low in September.  We are making steady progress in that regard.  For every 25 pupils in a school, there will be one teacher available.  That represents significant progress.  Schools who need to retain a teacher will now require three pupils fewer than they would have heretofore, a measure which will be of benefit to many schools, particularly small schools.  I will specifically say again, very clearly, that we are making progress with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio and the size of our classes.  However, where there are specific demands and specific instances of what the Deputy has referred to, large numbers of children in small classrooms in this Covid-19 atmosphere, an appeals mechanism exists.  Schools have the opportunity to make their case.  I advise that any specific school the Deputy represents should make an appeal of this nature.</p></speech>

The current national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework, provides for an &euro;8.8 billion investment in schools during the period from 2018 to 2027.  The increased investment under the NDP is positioning the State to focus on adding and modernising capacity in the school system.</p>  <p>  During the NDP period 2018-2020, 526 building projects were completed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes, and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country.  Of the 526 school building projects completed in the period from 2018 to 2020, 24 were delivered in County Tipperary.</p>  <p>  The Department has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs.  This is managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  Overall, there are 61 building projects across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction in County Tipperary, five of which fall under the large-scale capital programme and a further 56 under the additional school accommodation scheme.  Two of these projects are at project brief stage, one is at detailed design stage and two are on site as we speak.</p>  <p>  I have made arrangements for the details of these 61 school building projects to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.  I believe he will accept that this represents significant progress in his constituency and will be of considerable benefit to the students and school communities.  We look forward to building on that progress.</p></speech>

I just acknowledged the great investment in Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir all the way up to Lorrha in the north of the county.  In the last six weeks, St. Michael's National School in Holycross has been given two allocations from the Department.  A number of large-scale projects have been approved in the recent past.  Will the Minister provide me with an update on them?  There are two in Tipperary town and there is to be very significant investment in Fethard.  Presentation Secondary School in Thurles is also to receive significant investment.  What are the timelines for building works to start on these four projects?  Have they gone to tender?

On 17 February, I confirmed that leaving certificate 2021 examinations would proceed, guided by public health advice, and that students would also have the alternative option of applying for grades accredited by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to be known henceforward as SEC-accredited grades.  This decision was taken by the Government to provide choice and clarity for students.</p><p>Students will by now have registered for the traditional examinations and-or to receive SEC-accredited grades on a subject-by-subject basis on the candidate self-service portal.  In any subject where a student sits the examination and opts to receive an accredited grade, he or she will be automatically credited with the better of the two results.  Those opting for the traditional examinations will have completed their orals and music practical examinations over Easter and leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, students completed their link module examinations last weekend.  Leaving certificate applied, LCA, orals started on 3 May and continued until 12 May.</p><p>My Department and the SEC have published a series of guides for students and schools regarding the processes for the 2021 leaving certificate.  These guides and further information are available on <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>On 25 March, I announced details of the additional supports that are being provided to schools to support the running of the leaving certificate and LCA examinations and the accredited grades process.  Schools can appoint a leaving certificate aide for up to a maximum of 60 days to support school management in the planning, preparations for and running of the examinations and the work involved in the accredited grades process.  The Department is also supporting schools, parents and students through a dedicated phone line and email service for queries on the accredited grades process.</p><p>In the coming days, the SEC will be issuing further guidance for the conduct of written examinations to schools that is in line with public health advice and will ensure that the examinations can proceed safely.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that legislation is being introduced for the purposes of providing for the running of the 2021 leaving certificate to confer the necessary powers on the SEC to run the accredited grades process.</p></speech>

That legislation is important because it ascribes to the SEC the authority to run the calculated grades process as it was known last year or the accredited grades process as it will be known this year.  Within the legislation, provision is being made for a variety of issues, for example, indemnities for teachers, tutors, subject assessors and everyone with an involvement in the accredited grades process.  It also makes accommodation for non-acceptance in terms of canvassing and so on.  I would welcome the conclusion of that legislation in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

This issue caused major problems last September and could cause chaos this September for 13,000 post-primary concessionary pupils across the system.  We need clarity.</p></reply>

In the current school year, more than 114,000 children, including 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7 million in 2020.  Having regard to available resources, the purpose of the scheme is to support the transport to and from school of children whose places of residence are remote from their nearest schools.  All children who are eligible and complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport in the 2021-22 school year where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis where seats are available after all eligible applicants have been accommodated.</p>  <p>  The Department has engaged intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year.  Based on public health advice, the Department provided for school transport scheme services for the 2020-21 school year to operate fully, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity.  My officials engage on a weekly basis with public health consultants from the HSE on the safe operation of schools, including school transport.</p>  <p>  The requirement to implement additional measures on school transport services in the 2021-22 school year will be dependent on the prevailing public health advice at that time.  It is difficult at this point to make a projection, given that we will be using the most up-to-date advice available to us at the time.  In addition, the Department is conducting a review of the school transport scheme to ensure that it is fit for purpose and serves students and their families adequately.  All consideration will be given to the public health advice that is available to us in advance of the return to school.</p></speech>

Could we be looking at a 50% reduction in capacity?  What impact would that have on the 13,000 students who avail of concessionary school transport?  Their families need clarity for September.  Families whose children are starting the junior or senior cycle might have the opportunity to switch schools if clarity is provided.  Many parents manage childcare based on the availability of and their access to school transport services.  We need clarity.</p></speech>

Children who are not eligible may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis.  If seats are available, even where capacity is at 50%, they will be made available on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear, as we look back on what we have achieved in education and forward to what we will do in future, that everything we have done has been, and will be, on the basis of the public health advice that is made available to us.  As we began this school year, the advice was that, at second level, school transport would have to operate at 50% capacity.  Things are looking much more positive for society in general in terms of how we are progressing.  We are hopeful that the reduced capacity on school transport may no longer be required in due course, but I cannot say it will be so.  We will operate on the basis of the available public health advice.</p></speech>

Reading between the lines, what she is saying to me in plain English is that, while she hopes it will not happen, it may be that the advice is that school transport should continue to operate at 50%.  If that is the case, there will be 13,000 students left on the sides of our roads from the beginning of September because the capacity is not there while services are operating at 50%.</p>  <p>  What was the additional cost  for the current academic year of operating the public health measures to reduce capacity on the school transport service?  How many buses achieved the 50% capacity requirement?  Finally, how many parents availed of the &euro;5.10 a day alternative transport arrangements?  If the Minister does not have those figures available, I ask that she provide them to me later.</p></speech>

I am very clear in terms of school transport.  It is important to acknowledge that we are conducting a review of the service.  It is my intention that we will do all we can to ensure that as wide an access as possible is provided in terms of eligibility of children and young people for school transport.  That is part of the remit of the current review.  I have to be honest with the Deputy and say that where pubic health advice pertains, that advice will be followed.  If the advice is to operate at 50% capacity, then we will have 50% capacity.  However, there is scope within that, as there was previously, for accommodation of those who avail of transport on a concessionary basis.  No one who is eligible will be excluded from that remit.</p>  <p>  More than 98% of buses have run at 50% capacity, at a cost of between &euro;87 million and &euro;135 million.  I can revert to the Deputy with any further information he requires.</p></speech>

In budget 2021, as he knows, we secured an unprecedented investment of &euro;2 billion dedicated to the provision of special education, which is one fifth of the entire education budget.  Included in that was provision for approximately 235 speech and language therapy teachers.  In addition, we got an extra 1,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, which takes us to an unprecedented total of 18,000 SNAs in the education system.  SNAs are critical to assisting children in mainstream classes and, indeed, in special schools and special classes.  Ensuring we have enough teaching staff within the school system is something we always need to advocate for on behalf of children with special needs.  It is always important that we have dedicated teachers for this sector, as opposed to trying to use other teachers in the system.  In my conversations with SNAs, they often tell me that they should not be used for any other care or duty other than looking after children with special needs.  That is something for which I fully advocate.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to mention the expanded summer provision, which offers a significant increase on what was available last year.  The eligibility is now extended to 81,000 pupils.  For the first time, all 4,000 schools in the country will be in a position to apply for funding to run the summer programme.  Last year, for example, it was just primary schools and special schools that could apply.  There is an unprecedented allocation of &euro;40 million for the programme, which is double the funding that was given last year.  That will go some way to assisting the participation of schools in the project.</p></speech>

Having a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for special education was an important move.  I acknowledge her announcement regarding the summer programme, which is very welcome.</p>  <p>  I want to raise an issue regarding Department of Education Circular 38/07, which outlines the criteria for enrolment in special classes of pupils with specific speech and language disorders.  It requires that a full-time teacher be assigned to each class, that classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1 and that eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such a class.  As we know, some pupils with special needs have been seriously impacted by the Covid crisis.  I know of a seven-year-old girl in County Mayo who has lost out on 35% of the time in her specific speech and language class.  I am asking that an amendment be made to the circular in the light of the pandemic.</p></speech>

There is a special education review committee that deals with the resourcing of special classes with teachers and SNAs.  Allocations are determined under those terms.  When we talk about special classes, we know there should be two SNAs and one teacher per special class, if there are only six children in the class.  That should be the number.  If there is a difficulty with adhering to that, I suggest that the school in question should get in contact with either the NCSE or the Department.  The NCSE's comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, published in May 2018, found that the scheme as currently configured worked well in meeting the needs of the children for whom it was originally designed.  It is very important that every child who has special educational needs gets the support and resources he or she needs within a particular class.  I ask the Deputy to bring the particular case he raised to my attention later.</p></speech>

I recognise that the opening of speech and language classes is contingent on the HSE's having resources available to provide speech and language therapy to students.  I emphasise the importance of this provision for parents looking to access services for their children.  In a large county like Mayo, we have two dedicated speech and language classes, one of which is in Ballina.  I understand that there are 46 such classes throughout the country.  This service is something on which we can improve, working in co-operation with the NCSE and the HSE to identify additional resources and requirements for classrooms.</p></speech>

That project was approved by Government in February 2019 and began operating in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7, encompassing Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow.  It was disrupted because of Covid but it will be a transformative model for children with special needs into the future.  Under this model, pupils will have access to bespoke, tailored therapeutic supports <i>in situ</i>, provided by speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, behavioural practitioners and other therapists.</p> <p>They will be able to use their professional relationships and expertise to assist in the best interests of the child and for her or him to reach her or his full potential into the future.</p></speech>

In this city house prices have doubled.  The same picture can be seen right across the State.  The T&aacute;naiste has sat at the Cabinet table for the entirety of this period.  This is the T&aacute;naiste's record.</p>  <p>  This week has rightly been dominated by the housing issue, which has been described as a social crisis.  A report published on Tuesday by the ESRI found that, through a combination of stagnant wages and high housing costs, those aged in their 20s and 30s are likely to be the first generation with lower living standards than the generation before them, an historical first - again, the T&aacute;naiste's record.  Home ownership is at its lowest level in decades - again, the T&aacute;naiste's record.  This is a result of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy, a refusal to invest adequately in social and affordable housing and a decision to hand the provision of housing, which should be a public good, over to the free market and high finance to the benefit of speculators, developers and landlords.  As a consequence, the Government has presided over a social crisis, with not one but many generations looking towards their future and their ability to secure a home and start a family with anxiety and despair.</p>  <p>  The block purchase of homes in a new housing development in Maynooth by an investment fund under the noses of first-time buyers, who had worked so hard to save for a deposit and have a shot at home ownership, acted as a lightning rod for many more such cases.  As I have said before, however, this is nothing new and certainly not an accident.  In 2019, six out of every ten new homes in Dublin were taken off the market in sales to these funds.  They have been facilitated and encouraged by Government policy through their paying no tax on rental profits, no capital gains tax and little by way of stamp duty.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for years for the Government to end these tax advantages, warning that these funds were not only pricing ordinary individuals out of the market but driving up prices and rents as well.  In 2019, the value of home purchases by these funds grew by 7% across Europe; in this State, in the same year, it grew by 141% - the T&aacute;naiste's record.  I expect these funds to continue to snap up houses at the expense of struggling homeowners and homebuyers in the months ahead, just as they have been doing for years, a direct result of the policy of the T&aacute;naiste's party and Government.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste knows well that over seven months ago, during discussion on the Finance Bill, we called on the Government to impose a stamp duty surcharge on investment funds buying up homes in the Irish market.  During the passage of that Bill, the Government refused and voted against Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to examine the tax treatment of these funds.  Last week, however, when the public's attention was drawn to this issue and the Government's policies and their devastating consequences were laid bare for all to see, the Government told us that it would rush to bring forward proposals to fix the problems and that those proposals would be before us this week.</p>  <p>  What policies does the Government propose?  Were these proposals discussed at Cabinet?  Will the Government end the tax advantage these funds were given by the Government and implement Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to impose a stamp duty surcharge on them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300021#T00600"><p>The Deputy has laid out some facts.  Many of them are correct but they are also one-sided.  It is true that house prices have increased by about 90% since the trough in 2013, but what the Deputy did not mention - and this is relevant - is that they are still lower than the peak 12 or 13 years ago.  We certainly do not want to see them go back to that level.  House prices have gone up by about 4% in the past year but we will need to see where that goes.  The figure may well be distorted by the fact that we had no building, real estate transactions or house viewings for months, and that may change.  It may stabilise or go in a different direction in the next few months.  A lot of statistics at the moment are thrown by the pandemic, and we need to bear that in mind.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that home ownership has fallen off significantly in recent years, but it is still the case that between 65% and 70% of people in Ireland own their own homes.  That is a higher percentage than in the US, the UK, Germany, France, Australia and lots of other places.  That has nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in; it has to do with policies pursued by parties that have been in government in the past few decades.  The problem we have - and it is a problem - is that home ownership has been out of reach for far too many people in their 20s and 30s for far too long.  That is what we have to change over the next three years in government to make that reality of home ownership possible for people now in their 20s and 30s so they can own their homes, just as their parents did.</p>  <p>  Investment funds were invited into Ireland back in 2012.  We should be honest about the fact that Ireland was a very different place in 2012.  Home values were plummeting, hundreds of thousands of people were in negative equity, hundreds of thousands of people were in mortgage arrears, there were ghost estates all over the country, nothing was being sold and nothing was being built.  Money from investors in Ireland and overseas helped to turn that around.  However, things have changed now.  I get that.  The Government gets that.  Home ownership has been out of reach for far too many people for far too long, and that requires a change of policy, one that prioritises first-time buyers and families who need to upgrade to bigger homes.  For this reason, next Tuesday the Cabinet will consider proposals to do exactly that.  They will be brought forward by the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Darragh O'Brien, and we will act quickly in that regard.  Funds do, however, have a role to play.  We have to build about 350,000 new homes over the next ten years at a cost of about &euro;120 billion.  There is no way the State can finance all of that on its own.  We need the private sector and public sector working together and we need public housing and private housing.</p>  <p>  Before I finish I want to say this, and I really do feel this way.  Sinn F&eacute;in, the Deputy's party, speaks with a forked tongue when it comes to home ownership.  This week and last week, Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to present itself as a champion of first-time buyers and families who want to upgrade, of homeowners, but the policy of Sinn F&eacute;in is the absolute reverse.  Its constant mantra is "public housing on public land".  That is no good to people who want to own a home.  It is no good to first-time buyers or people who need to upgrade.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's actions it demonstrates this all the time.  Sinn F&eacute;in councillors all across Dublin and around the country have voted down mixed developments.  The stated reason for their voting them down is that some private housing would be built on those sites.  They did not want a single home that somebody could actually buy outright.  Yes, maybe some affordable schemes and, yes, social housing, but they have consistently voted against housing on huge sites across Dublin and around the country, exactly because homes might be built on them that people could buy.</p>  <p>  I have read and studied Sinn F&eacute;in's affordable housing policy.  It is very different from the one put forward by the Government.  It is a leasehold arrangement.  You never get to own the house.  It is never freehold.  That is a totally different vision.  It is a Sinn F&eacute;in vision.  It is an ideology that is anti-enterprise, anti-private property and, therefore, anti-home ownership.</p></speech>

The question many people are asking, however, is when Leo will deliver for the renters and for people who want to own their own homes in this city and beyond, and when Leo will deliver to make sure the wings of the vulture funds are clipped.  The T&aacute;naiste suggests that this was back in 2012 and 2013.  In 2019, six out of ten homes sold in Dublin were bought up by these vulture funds under the Government's nose.  The Government was told about this.  I told the Minister with responsibility time and again.  The Government voted just seven months ago to keep the sweetheart tax arrangements for these funds in place.  The Government continually refuses to implement Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to double capital investment in social, affordable and cost-rental accommodation.</p> <p>Last night, the Government voted against freezing rents and reducing rents by providing a refundable tax credit, which would take some of the pressure off people who are suffering as a result of its policies.  The T&aacute;naiste sat at the Cabinet table for ten years.  In that time, house prices have doubled.  They are out of the reach of generations.  Rents are through the roof.  Has the T&aacute;naiste any idea of what type of proposals will be brought forward, or will he just make another attack and blame the Opposition for the policies that he has implemented for the last ten years?</p></speech>

The Deputy knows that well, so he should stop the theatrics.  The Government is making progress on housing.  It is not enough, and I accept that.  Family homelessness is at its lowest level in five years.  The Deputy did not acknowledge that.  Individual homelessness is at its lowest level in four years.  The Deputy also did not acknowledge that.  We are now in a position where the State is building approximately 6,000 social homes a year, and more depending on how one calculates it.  Nearly one third of all homes built in Ireland last year were built by the State.  We have to refer back to the 1980s or even the 1950s or 1960s to see such high proportions.</p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge that we are not delivering for people when it comes to home ownership.  That requires us to re-examine our policies and make some changes.  We are going to make those changes.  The Deputy should not pretend that Sinn F&eacute;in is somehow on the side of first-time buyers or families who want to buy a home or upgrade.  Sinn F&eacute;in is against private enterprise, private property and home ownership.  It demonstrates that all the time on county councils where it votes against housing developments precisely because private houses might be built as homes for people to buy.</p></speech>

John O'Meara is my neighbour from Toomevara in County Tipperary.  He is a self-employed agricultural plant contractor.  He has three young children, Aoife, Jack and Tommy, aged from nine to 13 years.  His partner, Michelle Batey, was 42 years old.  She was from Nenagh and was a bank clerk with AIB.  She was a couple of years behind me in school in Nenagh.  Michelle got breast cancer in March 2018.  She spent her 40th birthday receiving chemotherapy.  She recovered.  After the cancer they had plans to get married because they knew they needed to do so to protect their future together.  However, before they could do that, sadly, Michelle contracted Covid-19 on 18 December last year and passed away on 31 January this year.  There was great shock and sadness in the community in Nenagh in which I live.</p>  <p>  As they did not get around to getting married, the State provides little or no support to John and his family.  If he had lost his livelihood while cohabiting with Michelle, he would have been assessed for jobseeker's allowance on her income.  Now he is not entitled to a widower's pension even though both of them worked all their lives.  Article 41 of the Constitutions states: "The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society ..... The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority...".  That definition of the family is founded on marriage.  However, the family unit and how it is constituted in our country has changed fundamentally.  The way people live their lives has changed.  Many couples in Ireland will choose not to get married or some will just not get around to it, like John and Michelle, unfortunately.  More people cohabit.  The Ireland we live in has changed.  The last census recorded over 150,000 cohabiting couples and over 75,000 of them living with children, an increase of 25% since 2011.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is probably aware that the Citizens' Assembly has called for Article 41 to be amended to protect private and family life, not limited to a material family.  Our laws and supports have not caught up with the way people live their lives in 2021.  There is a major gap in our social protection system.  If a couple is cohabiting, the Department of Social Protection will assess both of them and their means when carrying out a means test for a social assistance payment such as jobseeker's allowance or carer's allowance, but it does not provide any eligibility for social protection payments when one of the couple dies.  That cannot continue.</p>  <p>  Will the Government change the law on social protection payments to provide supports to cohabiting couples and surviving partners where one of the partners dies?  Is the Government committed to a referendum on Article 41 and when does the T&aacute;naiste expect this to take place?  Finally, and most importantly, what comfort can the State give to my neighbour, John O'Meara, and his family, and, indeed, many other such families?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300022#U00500"><p>I thank Deputy Kelly for sharing that story.  Often, it is only when we look at individual and real life examples that we understand how our policies and laws affect people and, sometimes, how they must change.  I express my condolences to John, his family and the wider community in Nenagh.</p>  <p>  If I understand what Deputy Kelly said correctly, John does not qualify for the widower's pension, which is a social insurance based payment, because it only applies to people who are married.  They were not married.  As every Member knows, the Constitution can only be changed by referendum.  While laws can be changed, they cannot be changed retrospectively.  However, having heard about this example, I will ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to examine the social protection law and see if, in the future, there could be changes for people who are long-term cohabitants.  I do not believe that would be unconstitutional.  It would be possible to examine and consider that, and I will ask her to do it.</p>  <p>  As regards change in the Constitution, the Government has received the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality.  As Taoiseach, I established the Citizens' Assembly in the aftermath of the referendum on the eighth amendment.  I am very impressed with the report it produced.  As is normal after a Citizens' Assembly makes its recommendations, they are considered by both the Government and the Oireachtas.  We will want to do that in the near future.  As far as I am concerned, the definition of family in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the 1937 Constitution, is out of date.  It is based on a traditional, more Christian or Catholic view of a family, which is not wrong.  It is a man and a woman, although that was changed to allow two men and two women.  However, it is based on two married people, as it were, with children.  That is what constitutes a family under the Constitution.  If that were ever true, we all know it is not true any more.  There are many different forms of families in our society, and there is great diversity in what family means.  I believe we should update, modernise and change that definition.  As is always the case with a constitutional reform, we will have to do some work on what it should be redefined as, because that is never as straightforward as it may seem.  That would require a proper consultation with the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I do not know what the plan is with regard to the Citizens' Assembly report.  With other reports, we set up a dedicated committee to examine the recommendations.  Perhaps we should do that, but that is not for me to call here today.</p></speech>

It is a very sad case.  I have been working with John to try to help him through the various issues he must deal with and some of the bureaucracy involved.  In his situation, he does not qualify for widower's pension.  He does not qualify for one-parent family payment because it is means tested on the preceding year.  He does not qualify for jobseeker's payment because he had to give up his job and was self-employed.  It is a catch-22.  He can work and not mind the young children, but he is not going to do that.  He has to look after his children, particularly in this difficult time.  There are, and will be, thousands of people like him.  There are people in his position this week.  If a couple is divorced, there is an entitlement to the widow's pension, but that is not the case if a couple did not get around to getting married.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments, but this must be changed.  In addition, when the T&aacute;naiste speaks to the Minister, will he consider if some form of interim payment could be allowable in circumstances where it can be shown that couples were together for a considerable period of time?</p></speech>

There is little or no discretion for Ministers in that regard, with the exception of exceptional needs payments.  He might have already applied for that, but perhaps not.  That might be one option as an interim solution.  Without knowing the details of the case, I do not wish to comment on it in detail, but it appears that he will qualify at some point for the one-parent family payment, which will provide a payment for him and his dependants.  He will also be able to work part-time.</p>  <p>  Perhaps the best thing to do is to set out the case in detail in writing and I will be happy to take it up with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and see what options there might be.</p></speech>

There are 72 people dead now in Gaza, 16 at least of whom are children and the death count is rising.  This follows on from the mass expulsion of Palestinians in east Jerusalem, which amounted to ethnic cleansing, the brutal assault on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the far-right lynch mobs now roaming the streets of Israeli cities looking for Palestinians to attack.  We have a situation where young people in Gaza, where 50% of the population is under the age of 18, have now experienced four military assaults in their lifetimes.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, we have reports this morning that the Israeli military are drawing up plans for a possible ground invasion.  What is the Government going to do about this?  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, called in the Israeli ambassador and made known to him that the actions of the Israeli state are unacceptable to Ireland.  I also am aware that the Irish State has sent observers to the scenes of the mass evictions in east Jerusalem.  Do these actions go far enough?  I believe they do not.   Is it enough to merely call in the ambassador?  The ambassador is the representative of a state that is pursuing a policy of systemic racism.  The ambassador should be expelled and I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that this should also be Government policy.  </p>  <p>  The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill proposed to ban the importation of Israeli goods from the occupied territories.  It is relatively modest legislation that has won the support of many human rights groups.  Yet the Government has refused to include it in the programme for Government.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the Government should reverse that position and implement that Bill.</p>  <p>  Last but not least, there is an arms trade between Ireland and Israel.  Since 2005 some &euro;15 million worth of military imports have been made to this State from Israel.  Since 2011, Ireland has exported &euro;6.5 million worth of military or dual-use hardware to Israel.  By dual-use I mean hardware that can be relatively easily converted to a military use.  For all I know or the T&aacute;naiste knows, some of that hardware is being used right now to shed the blood of innocent Palestinian civilians.</p>  <p>  My questions then are on the ambassador, the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, and on the arms trade.  What is the T&aacute;naiste and his Government now prepared to do?</p></speech>

The Government is committed to a two-state solution in the Middle East of a democratic Israel living side-by-side with a democratic Palestine, peacefully co-operating together.  Like the Deputy, I have been to the region, have met people who are Israeli and Palestinian and I admire their culture very much.  It is impressive to see the state that has been built down the years by the Jewish people in Israel and all of us abhor Hamas and what it has done in terror and in the violation of human rights of women and LGBTQ+ groups in particular.  None of us would like any of our comments to be in any way construed as support for Hamas in any way and I am sure that the Deputy in his further remarks will agree with that.</p>  <p>  Like everyone in this House, however, I believe the actions of the Israeli Government are indefensible.  Annexation, expulsion, plantation and the killing of civilians, deliberately or in terms of collateral damage, are not the behaviours of a democratic state in the 21st century and it is simply unacceptable that a democratic state or any state should behave in this way.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is very active in this area and has issued a very strong statement on behalf of the Irish Government condemning the actions of the Israeli Government.  We are members of the UN Security Council and we intend to use our position there as best we can to try to get a common UN position on this, which is never easy.  As the Deputy is aware, the Israeli ambassador has already been called in by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for difficult discussions on this issue.  We will try to co-ordinate any further action at EU level, which is the best way for us to take any particular action.</p>  <p>  On the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, the view of the Government based on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is that it is unconstitutional because it is a trade competence, which is an EU matter and is not a matter on which we can legislate for individually.  Second, it could be discriminatory unless it was applied to other occupied territories, such as Crimea, for example, which I have yet to hear the Deputy ever condemn and he may wish to do so in his further remarks.</p>  <p>  On exports, we have a control of exports regime that prevents us exporting arms to certain countries and we have a sanctions regime in that regard.  If the Deputy wants to pass on any particular information to me, I will be happy to examine it, as this is legislation which falls under my remit.  I have the power to impose certain sanctions and to ban certain exports and if the Deputy has something in particular in mind or has details that he wishes to give me about Irish products and services that might in some way be assisting the Israeli Government in its actions, I will be happy to look into that.</p></speech>

When a question is asked of him, he asks a question back.  I will take the opportunity then to give a reply before posing my questions again.</p>  <p>  The Palestinian people are an oppressed people and have a right to organise their self-defence, including armed self-defence.  They have the right to fight for their own national and social liberation.  The firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas is something that I do not support.  It has resulted in the deaths of seven people, including a five-year-old boy.  It is futile and counter-productive.  I have no truck with the right-wing policies of Hamas, which oppresses the Palestinian people themselves in Gaza.  A mass struggle is what is needed.  There will be no peace without a mass struggle against poverty, occupation and the rule of capital.  I am for an independent, socialist Palestine with its capital in east Jerusalem and for socialist change in Israel and the entire region.</p>  <p>In conclusion, the T&aacute;naiste is talking about working within the framework of the European Union but does he not recognise that the European Union itself has a very significant arms trade with Israel?  Is that something he is prepared to speak out against and totally oppose?</p></speech>

I note that he has yet to say anything about the other occupations that exist around the world and I often wonder why so little is said about them and so much about this particular one.  That does not, however, in any way take away from the fact that what is happening in Israel and what the Israeli Government is doing are indefensible.  As I said earlier, annexation, expulsions, plantations and the killing of civilians must be roundly condemned by all of us in this House and I know that we do that.</p>  <p>  Action is likely to be co-ordinated on this at an EU level and I am sure that it will be discussed at the General Affairs Council and among Prime Ministers.  Any action that is agreed by the European Union on the matters that the Deputy has raised is one that the Government will support.</p></speech>

Some &euro;10 billion is to be spent on capital projects this year with Government projections indicating upward momentum in capital spending, with an additional &euro;15 billion to be spent by 2025.  This is great news for every child in substandard classrooms, every patient in substandard hospital settings and commuters on substandard infrastructure.  This money must positively impact every Irish person.  Getting to this position is a political and social achievement brought about by national sacrifice, by seeing through a decade of financial hardship and hard choices accepted by our population.  </p>  <p>  Few Governments in the history of our State have ever been in a position to give the people of Ireland the services they deserve in the schools, universities, hospitals and clinics, the housing and municipal infrastructure, and the investment in the arts, sports, roads, cycleways and railways.  </p>  <p>  Indeed few Governments have also had the ability to address so positively the challenges that climate change is presenting to our society and ultimately to our economy.</p> <p>This money needs to be spent wisely and well.  That will require political discipline, oversight and scrutiny, as well as tenacious and vigilant project management.  I contend that the methods of oversight used thus far are not up to the task.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, good as they are, are no match for the scale of ambitions and responsibilities in spending this money.  Covid spending has taught us strong lessons regarding the difficulties in making good investment decisions when urgency and large capital outlays combine.  We will be back in the ha'penny place in no time if we fritter away this money on political codology, vanity projects and, possibly, stroke politics.</p> <p> My constituency of Waterford has suffered as a result not having had political clout for most of the history of the State.  In saying that, I am conscious that my election as a Deputy comes from the anger in Waterford and the south-east region at not having the services that are normal in other parts of the country.  We have been losers in the race to the Cabinet table, having only had three senior ministries in the past 33 D&aacute;ileanna.  Maybe we will get our elbows in at Cabinet again, but I would prefer if we evened up the game.</p> <p> The real problem is that we cannot see where money goes.  The simple act of presenting historical capital expenditure on completed projects in the form of regional and county-level analyses would transform our national understanding.  I believe such a reporting standard needs to be made a national priority.  The country can have mature conversations about capital allocations and equitable investment priorities but, in so doing, we need to have oversight and adequate understanding of how decisions on capital spending are made.  I hope this is something the T&aacute;naiste can consider implementing.</p></speech>

It is &euro;10 billion a year, money which we may struggle to spend this year because of the delays in construction but still a massive budget of &euro;10 billion a year.  It is the biggest ever investment programme in public infrastructure, creating jobs all over the country and providing new public infrastructure for citizens.  It is social housing, for which there is a budget to provide 9,000 or 10,000 houses a year, new schools, hospitals, healthcare centres, sporting infrastructure, community infrastructure, renewable energy, retrofit and the national broadband plan.</p>  <p>  Like all other parts of the country, Waterford benefits from this investment, such as through the investment in the North Quays, of which I know the Deputy and I are great advocates, the investment in University Hospital Waterford where the Dunmore wing is now open and the second catheterisation laboratory is at long last under construction and the national broadband plan which will be of particular benefit to rural parts of Waterford.  The greenway has been built and is a huge asset.  In the not too distant future, we will have the technological university of the south east, centred in Waterford city.  These are significant investments by Government that I believe will help to transform the region, particularly Waterford city, making it the capital of the south east and attracting investment, jobs and population.  That is the vision we have in Project Ireland 2040 for Waterford city and the south-east region.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Deputy's remarks regarding transparency, I think he is probably right.  This is a significant budget of &euro;10 billion a year.  There may well be, and I think there is, a case for further transparency as to how the money is spent and how we make sure it is spent well.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, will welcome any proposals the Deputy has in that regard.  I would like to see Government doing detailed analyses of that because one thing such analyses would show is that the idea of having a Cabinet member at the table is probably overrated in terms of the amount of capital investment that a particular city or constituency gets.  Maybe things used to work that way but they do not do so any more, particularly with the public spending code in place.  Some of the analyses that are done by interest groups and academics are misleading.  For example, they will exclude any investment less than &euro;20 million or less than &euro;50 million.  Of course, in areas with low population and rural areas, investments tend to be of smaller amounts.  They are spread more widely.  That creates the false impression that urban areas are doing much better than rural areas.  Also, it does not fully take into account, for example, the value of nationwide investments such as road maintenance, research grants or the national broadband plan.  I know different countries use different models.  There is a state agency in Australia that is in charge of capital development there.  There are lots of good ideas and I would certainly welcome hearing about them.</p></speech>

I believe reporting from Departments is inadequate for the House to discharge fully its responsibilities of budgetary oversight.  The Government needs to do more in demonstrating equitable investment decision making and providing the evidence that supports it.  I point out to the T&aacute;naiste that Dublin has one quarter of the population yet it receives approximately half of all capital investment.  I also point out that I recently tabled parliamentary questions regarding &euro;998 million of capital investment by the Higher Education Authority in the past decade but the Department was unable to provide me with a breakdown of projects supporting that spend.  We do have an issue in this regard.  I certainly look forward to engaging with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and maybe coming up with further initiatives that I hope would help us to share the burden and to shed light on these decisions.</p></speech>

We do, of course, have systems to monitor capital spending, not just the Committee of Public Accounts but also the Comptroller and Auditor General, although that is largely retrospective, and also the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  There are mechanisms in place.  Could there be greater transparency or can they be improved?  I think they can and I would very much welcome any suggestions from the Deputy in that regard.</p></speech>

I am sure the T&aacute;naiste, like all other Members, has seen social media videos of incidents in Malahide and other areas and I am sure constituents of his who are gravely concerned have contacted his office.  The public health message is that we will have our summer outdoors.  That means we need more facilities such as bins and public toilets.  It also means that we will need to see more garda&iacute; on our streets but, as well as that, we will need to see increased funding for community-based services and activities for younger people.  It is not fair to demonise young people, as some people have tried to do, but neither can we ignore the real concerns communities have about the rise in antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  Alongside the reopening plan, we need the Government to publish a plan for the summer outdoors which details investment in community-based services for young people as well as an increased Garda presence to keep outside spaces safe.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government publish such a plan?</p></speech>

We released a plan to have an outdoor summer and that may have issues that need to be dealt with.  Local authorities are providing more bins and public toilets.  I welcome that.  We need more of that from local authorities.</p>  <p>  As regards garda&iacute;, the budget for the Garda and the number of garda&iacute; have never been higher.  We are at record levels in terms of the size of the Garda force and that allows for more outdoor garda&iacute; and a more visible presence through the summer and that will be needed.  The points made by the Deputy regarding community services are well made.</p></speech>

In terms of the detail of this, there are issues relating to timing as regards cohorts, so this would be very positive news.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste told his parliamentary party last night that everyone who wants a vaccine will be offered one by the end of June.  That would be great news.  Can he confirm on the floor of the D&aacute;il that that is his view?  The reason this could be possible is because 10% to 15% of people are turning down the offer of a vaccine.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that he believes everyone over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccine by the end of June?  Will they get one or be offered one?  What is being done to encourage the 10% to 15% who are not taking up the offer of a vaccine?</p></speech>

That target is that 82% of adults should either have had one dose, be fully vaccinated or have been offered a vaccine by the end of June.</p> <p>I was speaking yesterday about the possibility of opening the portal to all adults before the end of June so everyone will be able to book their appointment.  They might not have the vaccine by the end of June, but they will certainly have their appointment for it in early July.  That may well be achieved because the vaccine programme is going very well and is really ramping up, and I thank the HSE, staff and volunteers for all the work they are doing in that regard, but also because of the reality that there always will be 10% or 15% of people who will choose not to take a vaccine.  That is their right and choice but we will continue to encourage them to be vaccinated and provide whatever information and reassurance we can to get those figures up as high as possible.  We need to do that.</p> <p> I do not have any news regarding NIAC at the moment but I understand there will be a decision in the coming days, certainly before Tuesday. </p></speech>

We learned from media reports this week that &euro;300 million of State funds channelled to Home Building Finance Ireland has gone to large developers to build homes that are then sold on to investment funds to rent out.  In these instances, we are talking about high-end, high-rent developments.  Why are State funds earmarked for small builders to provide homes for first-home buyers instead being used to finance large developers to build homes that are then sold on to investment funds?</p></speech>

It provides finance, which of course has to repaid, to large, medium and small builders to help them fund the construction of new homes for people to buy.  My understanding is that there may have been only one case, or a handful of cases, where HBFI invested in a build-to-let investment such as the Deputy described.  It was not the norm, did not take place in the majority of cases and was not even commonplace.  I am told that the vast majority of money has gone towards build-to-sell developments but, again, I will ask the Minister to clarify that.</p></speech>

Young people up and down the country, but especially in working class communities, are reporting an increased level of harassment by members of the Garda.  In a recent report, the Policing Authority states: "Young people were reported as believing that COVID-19 [has] been used by ... Garda&iacute; as an excuse to conduct more stops".  The same report stated that student groups described policing in this State as intimidating and negative.  It is a fact than more than 50% of Covid fines have been handed out to those aged between 18 and 25.</p>  <p>  It is also a fact that we have seen very heavy-handed policing in recent weeks against protest, not least against the Debenhams workers in Waterford, Tralee, the T&aacute;naiste's own area of Blanchardstown, and Henry Street.  In a couple of weeks' time, these emergency laws face renewal.  These laws are disproportionate and should not be renewed.  We are not out of the woods yet on Covid but repression should not be the new normal.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate whether he will oppose the renewal of those laws? </p></speech>

We have curtailed people's freedom in a way I never thought we would in the past year or so and we have given the Garda powers to do things I never thought we would give it the power to do.  However, this is an unprecedented situation.  This is a pandemic and it is not over yet but, in my view, the sooner we can expire those laws the better.  I want to see people's individual freedoms and the inviolability of their homes restored and Garda powers returned to what they should be.  The Deputy and I may come from a very different angle, philosophically, when it comes to politics but we both share a commitment to individual liberty and personal freedom.  The sooner we can get rid of these laws the better.</p></speech>

At the moment, 1,980 licences awaiting approval by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine from an ecology assessment point of view.  At the current rate, it will take two years to clear the backlog, never mind dealing with new applications.  The appropriate assessment screening threshold has changed from 3 km to 15 km, which accounts for more than 90% of the applications to be screened.  We need a single, workable licence system for the forestry industry.  Jobs and the supply chain for native timber are at risk.  The price of materials for houses is going up, which is a very important issue, and there is scarcity as a result.  We need immediate action on this.  We need to see that the farmers who are planting trees know they can fell them.  This needs to be taken up as a serious issue.</p></speech>

Many people in Ireland feel that they can neither plant nor fell a tree.  That situation cannot persist for too long.  We need the timber for construction and we need to plant more trees in order to help us meet our climate ambitions.  The Government accepts that an appropriate assessment procedure is needed for forestry-related licences and we support the ambition of Project Woodland.  We continue to implement the Mackinnon report and will continue to uphold the objectives of the forest consent system, the birds and habitat directive, the catchment management approach of the water framework directive and the forest law and enforcement governance trade regulation.  The amendments to the appropriate assessment procedure were required due to European Court of Justice and Irish legal rulings relating to the protection of Natura sites.  The new procedures involve substantive changes and have been challenging to implement, as they involve a more detailed screening process of all European sites within 15 km of a project area.  I will send the rest of the reply to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I wrote to my hospital in south Tipperary, which is an excellent hospital with excellent maternity and neonatal wards.  All my children and my eight grandchildren were born there.  The letter I received from the hospital stated that it would examine this issue and might make some small changes.  Why is there is such dysfunction and such an unlevel playing field?  It is accepted that it is hugely important for expectant mothers to have their partners, siblings or somebody with them in that situation, whether the news is bad or good.  Hospitals throughout the country are making different decisions.  It is time they were instructed.  Are they all little independent republics that can do what they like?  It is not fair on people.  We need consistency throughout the maternity hospitals on visiting for partners who are trying to help during this occasion.</p></speech>

The national guidance is that partners should be able to attend the birth of their child and the 20-week scan, and should have full access to the neonatal ICU if there are any problems after birth and their child has to be there.  It is still possible for hospitals at local level, for their own reasons, to introduce tighter restrictions, but they have to explain why they are doing that.  It is not good enough for them to say they are independent republics doing their own thing.  If they are not adhering to the national guidance, they need to explain why.  Is it because there is an outbreak in the hospital?  Is there a good reason they are not adhering to the national guidance, which is that partners should be allowed attend the birth of their child, the 20-week scan appointment and neonatal ICU?</p></speech>

Sligo County Council has asked that Sligo be included in the defective concrete blocks grant scheme, which covers 90% of the remediation costs.</p> <p>This scheme currently operates in Mayo and Donegal.  Homeowners in south and west Sligo look across the border to Mayo and in north Sligo they look across the border to Donegal and see a Government-funded remedial scheme for pyrite while their own homes crumble around their ears and they have no assistance.

I am familiar with the issue with pyrite and mica.  Pyrite occurred in my constituency and people were included in the assistance scheme.  I have been in houses with mica in them in Donegal and I worked very hard with the former Minister, Deputy Joe McHugh, to get that scheme in place.  If the situation is the same for people in Sligo as for those in Mayo and Donegal, I do not see why they would not be included in the scheme.  That would be natural justice.  Perhaps there is a reason I do not know of but I will bring it up with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and make sure the Deputy gets a reply in the very near future.</p></speech>

We currently have the Radisson vaccination centre.  I got my Covid-19 vaccination in the Radisson centre this morning.  I compliment the phenomenal work being done by the HSE and the volunteer staff.  It was very efficient.  We have a very successful roll-out in Limerick at the moment.  There is speculation that the centre will be moved to the Limerick Racecourse in Patrickswell from the Radisson.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that that is to happen and when precisely it will happen?</p>  <p>  Second, last week in the D&aacute;il I got a commitment from the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that they would look at putting a shuttle service on from Limerick city to the Radisson.  I know there is a proposal in with Paul Reid.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that shuttle will be up and running?</p></speech>

I am advised that the vaccine centre will move out of the Radisson Blu Hotel, which will go back to being a hotel, and will be relocated to the Limerick Racecourse, which will be more accessible to people, particularly those who do not have access to a car.  I do not know the arrangements in terms of a shuttle bus but I will take it up with the CEO of the HSE and see if it can be done.  I do not have the date for the relocation of the centre from the Radisson Blu Hotel to the racecourse but I can confirm it is happening and an announcement will be made soon.</p></speech>

We need to accept the disparity between a huge military power like Israel and the Palestinian people.  We have also had the <i>de facto</i>annexation and stealing of Palestinian land.  We can only consider this a continuity of a plan for Israeli expansion.  What will the Government propose in relation to our seat on the UN Security Council and in relation to the EU, which took action on the Crimea?  How will we use our relationship with Joe Biden?  We need a change in how the administration in America operates.  This needs to be done.  South African apartheid was broken by international solidarity and sanctions.  It became a pariah state.  This needs to be done for Israel and everything has to be on the agenda, even consideration in relation to the ambassador here.</p></speech>

Dental services for medical card patients in the county I come from, County Laois, have collapsed.  There is no service for adults in Laois.  Only one dentist operates under the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  I have a list that we rang around earlier in the week to see if we could get anyone.  We have been at this for weeks to see if we could get dentists to take it.  Only one is dealing with existing patients and none will take new patients.  Sixteen have resigned in Laois-Offaly in the past 12 months; eight since March.  The dental scheme is not being resourced and the system has collapsed.  There is no DTSS in County Laois for medical card holders at the moment.  Separately, there is no dental scheme-----</p></speech>

Inclusion in and access to education is the foundation for a more just and equal society.  I raise the issue of Riversdale Community College and Danu Community Special School.  There is a strong desire to support each other.  Particularly, the Riversdale board of management supports Danu Community Special School in its desire for a new school on the large seven-acre grounds it has.  However, there is shock and anger at the turn of events that will result in Riversdale losing over one third of the school permanently.  The education and training board, ETB, has broken a promise made to Danu and Riversdale.  The list of classes and support rooms that will be lost is of concern and includes the parents room, the art room, science rooms, counselling rooms etc.  The school is also being forced to move into a darker side of the building.

I still think that is the solution we will work towards and I am working with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the ETB on that.

Parents have been told that, from 1 September, hot meals will no longer be provided.  This service has been in place for the last sixteen years.  The community employment, CE, scheme is no longer providing staff, at the direction of the Department of Social Protection.  At this school, the complex functional needs of kids are addressed.  St. Mary's is a fantastic school and the staff are excellent.  However, this is not just about the provision of a free meal.  There is so much more to it.  They learn to set the table, use a knife and fork, manners at the table and cleaning up afterwards.  The school should be treated the same as a DEIS school.</p> <p>This decision is shocking and hits the most vulnerable in society.  It is an easy target once again.  This impacts children right across County Meath.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to get in touch with the Department of Social Protection and get this decision reversed.</p></speech>

We previously raised the issue.  The centre was not actually in Limerick city, it was in County Clare and I understand from HSE contacts this morning that it is moving shortly to the racecourse in Patrickswell.  That would make it more difficult for people in the city to access the vaccination centre.  The one in the Radisson hotel was working well and while there were problems, there was public transport to it.  As there is no public transport to the racecourse that I am aware of, will the Government commit to making sure there is a shuttle bus?  All Deputies from the mid-west region have been inundated with calls from people who had problems accessing the vaccine at the previous centre.  Will the Government commit to providing some sort of shuttle transfers for people to get to the vaccination centre?</p></speech>

Like Deputy O'Donnell earlier, the Deputy has raised the need for a shuttle bus in order that people can get to the racecourse, and in the interim get to the Radisson hotel until the move happens.  I am happy to raise that with the CEO of the HSE.  I will do that this week.  I cannot commit to it being done but I will certainly make sure that the HSE is aware of the request.</p></speech>

I want to query in particular the progress in putting in place a dedicated rescue process for small and micro companies.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who has responsibility for company regulation, has secured Government approval for priority drafting of the companies Bill 2021.

It is intended to get the legislation into the D&aacute;il and Seanad as soon as possible and to have the matter legislated for before the summer recess, thus allowing that option to be in place for small businesses that can survive if they are allowed to restructure.  It is intended to have that in place by the autumn.  It is, if you like, a personal insolvency regime for small companies and is an alternative to the expensive examinership process through the High Court.

It is an iconic project that will transform the centre of Waterford city for generations.  As he knows, there was a partnership between Waterford City and County Council and Falcon Real Estate Development, which has hit a brick wall.  My understanding is that the CEO of the council will be making an announcement today at the full plenary session of the council and it is not good news about the relationship.  It looks like an alternative investor will need to come on board.  Significant funding has been put on the table by the State through the urban regeneration development fund, which I welcome.  If this relationship breaks down, I ask that breathing space be given by the Department and the Government to the local authority to allow it to find alternative investors, given the importance of this project.  Could the T&aacute;naiste give that reassurance today?</p></speech>

If it is the case that the investor is pulling out, that is very bad and disappointing news.  I suppose we should wait to see what the announcement says.  If it is as the Deputy says, that is very disappointing news for the region.  He can be assured that the Government is still behind this project.  This is really important to the future of Waterford city and the south east.  The Government will allow time and space to either repair relations with the investor or find an alternative one.  I cannot give the Deputy a limitless commitment but I can certainly give him the commitment that the Government is committed to this project and will allow time and space for alternative funding to be found or an alternative investor to be found, if that is what is required.</p></speech>

Hotels and guest houses will be able to operate indoor dining from the first day they open on 2 June.  Restaurants and pubs that serve food and cafes will operate outdoor dining only from 7 June, with no date for indoor dining.  The industry is also looking for clarity as to how indoor dining can be deemed safe in hotels and guest houses but not in other businesses that serve food.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to give a date for the reopening of indoor dining in restaurants, gastropubs and cafes in order for them to plan and recruit staff, among other things?</p></speech>

I appreciate the devastating impact the pandemic has had on them.  As Deputy O'Rourke is aware, they are entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment and can still earn income while drawing that down.  There is an enterprise grant when they come off the pandemic unemployment payment and I believe fees are being waived too.  I appreciate that more will need to be done for them and they may need an individual package of some sort.  I am in discussions with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about that.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on Israel, as I said earlier, we have had a very strong statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  We will be using our position on the UN Security Council and in the EU to advocate for further action and joint action, but that is something we have to do around the table first.</p> <p> Finally, on the issue of hospitality, I understand the annoyance around the disparity between hotels and restaurants but we must bear in mind that, since day one, even during level 5 and during the worst period of the pandemic, we allowed hotels to serve meals to their guests in their restaurants, so we do not want to take that away now.  However, I appreciate that now creates a disparity between hotels and restaurants.  I anticipate that will only last for a few weeks, and we are aiming for indoor dining to resume in July, but a lot can happen between now and then.</p></speech>

Before I became a politician, I was a marine biologist and I worked with the Marine Institute.  It is something I am very proud of and still very passionate about.  My dad was quite disappointed when I told him I was getting into politics, and he thought I was leaving the environmental sector behind me.  My dad has since passed but I am delighted I am still able to work on issues that are close to my heart and that were close to his heart.</p><p>The basking shark, known as Gaeilge as liamh&aacute;n m&oacute;r gr&eacute;ine, the great fish of the sun, is the world's second largest fish.  They are regular visitors to our shores.  We all remember that, last year, we had amazing footage from the west coast as they meandered up the coast, and it really gave us a nice respite at the start of lockdown.  We have a deep cultural connection to this animal and it is often a symbol of our indigenous maritime life.  It represents the mysterious nature of our marine waters and continues to mystify us as we actually know just a small amount about this creature.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that Ireland could be home to 10% to 20% of the global population of this species.  Of the eight known coastal surface hotspots in the north-east Atlantic, five are located off the coasts of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal.  We are truly blessed to have this amazing creature come to our shores every year and call Ireland home.  However, basking sharks are endangered and they are at very high risk of extinction in the wild.  They were first classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list in 2018; they had previously been classified as vulnerable but they are now endangered.</p><p>They are protected by various international treaties and legislation in other jurisdictions and, for example, they have been protected under UK legislation since 1998.  Despite their endangered status, the basking shark is not currently listed as a protected species under Irish national marine or conservation legislation and, in fact, the basking shark has no protection at all in Irish legislation.  Unfortunately, this species continues to face a number of key threats, including boat strikes, harassment by recreational boat users and habitat alteration due to development of large-scale infrastructure.</p><p>Over the past year, I have engaged with many wildlife groups, scientists and experts on the basking shark, including the Irish Basking Shark Group and the Irish Wildlife Trust.  It is clear what needs to be done.  The Government must list this species as protected and encourage its protection to the fullest extent possible.  It is a simple legislative change but it could be a matter of life and death for basking sharks.  We need to treasure our natural heritage, our biodiversity and our own iconic species, and afford basking sharks the same protections that other countries afford them.  In fact, we should afford them the same protections we afford our whales and dolphins.  This can be done simply by amending the wildlife legislation and adding basking shark to the list of protected species.</p><p>That is why I am very proud today to be introducing my Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will list the great fish of the sun as a protected species under the Fifth Schedule of the 1976 Act.  We need to go further.  People across Ireland have been mesmerised by basking sharks swimming up and down our coasts, but with that come additional dangers to the species as people will want to get as close as possible to them, and we have the potential for a burgeoning tourism industry in regard to this species.  Therefore, we need to give them protection from harassment and injury to ensure the species can continue to grace our waters.  To ensure adequate protection is afforded to the basking shark, my Bill seeks to amend section 23 of the 1976 Act to make illegal the intentional or reckless injuring, disturbance or harassment of any protected wild animal, other than for the purposes of hunting.  Furthermore, my Bill provides the Minister with an opportunity to draft a code of conduct for the purposes of wildlife tourism or recreational activities to make sure that this fish and other protected species are not harmed as more people engage with these animals.</p><p>National biodiversity week begins on Saturday, 15 May, and it is an apt time for us to consider the protections of our iconic species and for me to introduce this Bill.  I urge the Government and every Member of this House to support the speedy progression of this Bill through the Oireachtas so this species can continue to be enjoyed for generations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300028#AA01100"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to ensure that every appeal or referral is determined within a period of 12 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the Board of the appeal or referral, or, such other period as the Minister may prescribe in accordance with section 126(4) and section 221(4), either generally or in respect of a particular class or classes of appeals or referrals. </blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill to the D&aacute;il.  It is a Bill to amend the Planning and Development Act.  It specifically obliges in law a statutory time period of 12 weeks by which An Bord Plean&aacute;la is obliged to make a decision on planning applications it receives or appeals made to it on foot of local authority decisions.  Local authorities themselves have eight weeks to initially grant, refuse or seek clarification on files, and a further four weeks in the case of receipt of further information thereafter.  The applicant has no more than six months to respond to further information requests.  Therefore, an application process can take at least 13 weeks, or three months, and at most 37 or 38 weeks, which is nine or ten months.</p><p>There is no way that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be taking so much longer and, in many cases, 18 months, two years or three years.  What happens in local authorities in three months should take that long with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Therefore, this Bill seeks to rectify that fact and this is the means by which it can and should be done.</p><p>We are in the midst of a housing crisis.  Everyone accepts that solving the housing crisis is complex and multifaceted.  We appreciate that a major issue is supply.  We recognise that a major solution is increasing supply.  Supply is restricted, slowed down and impacted by planning, by cost of construction and by bureaucracy in the way in which local authorities liaise with the Department on the construction of homes.  In this Bill, I can only seek to rectify An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s role.  I want to ensure it does not continue to unduly delay the provision of supply.  Similarly, the Government could and must put statutory time periods and constraints on judicial reviews and subsequent appeals.</p><p>Despite the best-laid plans, policies, initiatives, Bills and motions by the Government and the Opposition, they are all subsequently at the behest of the planning process.  I do not want to disregard or belittle the process of adjudication and deciding on applications.  It is transparent, independent and cognisant of development plans, strategies and provisions relating to best practice in design standards, engineering, architecture, health and safety, environment and many other aspects.  I do not want either to disregard the subsequent right of appeal, which can further challenge the initial decisions.  However, all such aspects of the system must be time-limited and, therefore, not unduly delay or put in danger the very projects which are seeking to address these issues.</p><p>I mention An Taisce in regard to the debate that has ensued this week as a result of the High Court decision and the subsequent threat of appeal on a point of law on the part of An Taisce to that decision.</p> <p>An Taisce, any of its staff, supporters or members of the public who support it can, of course, have an issue with Government policy - that is fair play, it is understandable and as it should be - but to change Government policy, it has a remit is to lobby and advise.  Anyone else who wishes to change Government policy can influence it by being elected to this House.  It should not be allowed to usurp and frustrate the likes of the Glanbia project which was approved on merit, pertaining to planning laws, resolutions, regulations, guidelines and provisions by Kilkenny County Council, by An Bord Plean&aacute;la after a protracted delay, and by the High Court which in its recent decision stated that An Taisce's issue is one of Government policy.</p> <p> Such procrastination and delays have a major impact on this country's ability to respond to housing supply shortages and to our regions' efforts to provide investment and sustainable development to replace other industries and, in this case, to deal with the implications of Brexit.</p> <p> I ask the Government to accept this Bill and to address other issues mentioned too, not simply asking An Taisce not to proceed with an appeal but by addressing and putting in place the correct measures in law and in legislation to ensure that nobody has the right to usurp or procrastinate or delay worthwhile developments, as was the case in this instance.  I commend the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  I hope that all parties would support it and contribute to make it better and do we wish it to achieve.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300030#FF00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il as ucht an am agus an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt anseo inniu.  I am honoured to be in the House to bring the Education (Leaving Certificate Examinations) (Accredited Grades) Bill 2021 forward on Second Stage and to open this debate.  As Members will be aware, the Bill has already passed through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  On Second Stage in that House, many contributions were made that demonstrated the importance Senators attach to education.  I am sure that will also be a feature of this afternoon's debate in this House.</p>  <p>  When I was appointed as Minister for Education on 27 June last year, I had three immediate priorities.  The first was the implementation of a summer programme, which was ultimately shown to be very successful and upon which we built the 2021 summer programme.  The latter was announced on Tuesday, with a doubling of available funding.  The second priority was to prepare for the reopening of schools last autumn and to recognise how it was vital to support leaving certificate students because, even under normal circumstances, completing the leaving certificate and transitioning to the next phase of life can be a challenging time for all students and their families.  In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, this challenge has been heightened for students.  The students have missed out on important rites of passage and have sacrificed time with their friends, playing sport, working in part-time jobs, and so much more in order to protect their loved ones and, indeed, broader society.  For many of these students, the continued operation of school has been an important source of routine and stability.  I commend school leaders and communities on the work they continue to do to maintain and sustain our schools and keep them open.  From the successful reopening of schools in late August and early September last year, students were able to attend school each day, which provided an important social outlet for them, ensured they received the academic support they needed and, in some cases, provided respite from challenging personal circumstances.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, in January, amid very high levels of Covid-19 and the increased challenges associated with new variants of concern, our schools were required to close for another period to support the broader minimisation of movement within Irish society.  This period of school closure, similar to last year's, inhibited many students' learning and heightened a sense of anxiety and isolation at a time when students are in particular need of academic and holistic supports.  Amid this considerable uncertainty and in the context of the loss of in-person learning, the Government took the decision to provide leaving certificate students with a choice between accredited grades and sitting examinations in a safe manner or availing of a combination of both.</p>  <p>  Last year, the decision on calculated grades was made at a time when legislation to empower the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to operate the process could not be brought forward.  As a result, the calculated grades system was operated by the Department of Education, with the support of staff seconded from the SEC.  The SEC's powers are as set out in the establishment order of 2003.  Those powers relate solely to the operation of examinations as defined in the Education Act 1998.  All this and, most acutely, the need to support the leaving certificate class of 2021 have led the Government to bring forward the Bill before the House.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the approach taken to calculated grades was debated in this House on many occasions, and there are lessons to learn and to be applied from the 2020 experience.  The approach the Government is taking to leaving certificate 2021 seeks to apply those lessons.  The Government has listened to the views and reflections of the advisory group on the State examinations, which was established in 2020 and reconvened in recent months.  Many have paid tribute to the role played by students in that group.  I add my voice in acknowledging the role played by the issue representatives and, indeed, all the partners in education who contributed to the process.</p>  <p>  It is important to set out the difference between accredited grades in 2021 and the calculated grates process in 2020.  First, subject to the enactment of this Bill, the system will be operated by the SEC.  Second, and perhaps most important, and subject to public health advice and considerations, written leaving certificate examinations will proceed according to the normal timetable this summer, with the main schedule of examinations commencing on 9 June.  This is designed to ensure that the choice afforded to students is real.</p>  <p>  A clear process has been put in place to facilitate students who are studying outside school settings, either entirely or in individual subjects, to obtain accredited grades.  I have been very clear that the school historical data, which some refer to as school profiles and which were ultimately excluded from the 2020 system, will also be excluded from the accredited grades system in 2021.  A point of concern for some teachers in 2020 related to student rank order data being released.  This year, teachers are not being asked to generate class rankings.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has engaged Educational Testing Service, ETS, as the contractor to develop and deliver the standardisation process on school-generated estimated marks.  We also expect to appoint a second quality assurance contractor shortly to provide an added layer of confidence that the process of standardisation operates as expected.</p>  <p>  While Deputies have had the opportunity to consider the Bill, I will now summarise its principal provisions.  Section 1 sets out the definitions to be used in the Bill.  The definition of "Leaving Certificate 2021" comprehends the conventional examinations and the accredited grades process, and also confirms that this legislation applies only to the 2021 leaving certificate examinations.  Section 2 sets out the main elements of the system of accredited grades, in respect of which I will make a formal determination, having taken the advice of the SEC, once the Bill is enacted.  Section 3 provides for the indemnity, previously approved by the Government, that is written comprehensively to include any person who performs a function in relation to the provision of estimated marks.  This puts the 2020 position on a statutory footing for 2021.</p> <p>Section 4 deals with canvassing of those providing estimated marks and stipulates that, where such canvassing occurs, the SEC may withhold results from a candidate.  Detailed procedures in regard will be provided for in regulations which are being prepared.</p> <p> Section 5 provides for an ability for the SEC to withhold results if false or misleading information is provided for the purpose of the award of an estimated mark.  Section 6 provides a non-exhaustive list of the functions that are to be conferred upon the SEC and should be read in conjunction with section 2.  Section 7 provides a regulation giving power to the Minister to give effect to various procedural aspects provided in other sections, principally in regard to the withholding of results and the operation and conduct of appeals.</p> <p> Section 8 contains a power to designate people to be tutors in addition to those already defined in the Bill.  This is intended as a safety net in case somebody or a class of tutors has been inadvertently omitted from the definition as currently drafted.  Section 9 provides the SEC with the power to provide a leaving certificate in respect of 2020 to students and ensures that the leaving certificate of 2020 will have the same look and feel as it would have in any other year.</p> <p> Section 10 provides a statutory basis on which the personal data of leaving certificate 2021 candidates can be processed for the purposes of the operation of the accredited grades system.  This section has been the subject of consultation with the Data Protection Commission.  Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, are standard in nature and relate to the laying of orders before the Oireachtas, expenses and how the Bill, once enacted, may be cited.</p> <p> In outlining the details of the various sections, I indicated that regulations will be required in some instances and their drafting will proceed in parallel with the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  The administrative planning for and early steps in the accredited grades process are under way, being led in the first instance by my Department pending the enactment of the Bill.  This work is done in close co-operation with the State Examinations Commission, which will assume the lead role when the appropriate legislative powers are conferred upon it.</p> <p> A variety of guidance documents have issued to students, schools and those studying outside of school settings in recent weeks.  The candidate self-service portal allows candidates to make choices in each of their subjects about whether to sit written exams, receive accredited grades, or both, for the 2021 leaving certificate.  The SEC is continuing its engagement with schools and candidates that have not yet registered or, having registered, have not confirmed their options.</p> <p> The various strands of preparatory works for the leaving certificate are well under way, with the oral and practical examinations for the vast majority of students having taken place, while last Saturday, leaving certificate vocational programme students sat link modules and those seeking accredited grades in non-curricular languages undertook proficiency assessments.  From tomorrow, 14 May, teachers may proceed to generate estimated marks in the period until 28 May, with the school alignment phase and submission of data following immediately after that.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</p></speech>

They have been through a difficult two years, having lost out on months of in-school learning, with profound uncertainty and stress about what was going to happen.  It appeared until earlier this spring that they were facing a system telling them that a traditional leaving certificate was necessary despite the fact that what they had experienced was anything but traditional or the conventional leaving certificate cycle.  They identified the alternative, the sensible approach to take, which was to have choice.  Some people favoured abolishing examinations altogether.  Students took the approach of having choice, whereby some could choose an alternative means of assessment because they were concerned they had lost too much time and it would not be possible to cover the course, while those who wanted to sit the examination would have the option to do so.</p>  <p>  Students identified and pushed for that approach, and they delivered it.  I am glad the Minister and her Department listened, and I give her credit for that.  Students showed great dignity, determination and professionalism in many respects, especially the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students' Union.  I commend its outgoing and incoming leadership on bringing us to this point because it would not have happened without them.  Sinn F&eacute;in and other political parties and organisations supported them but it was their initiative first and foremost.</p>  <p>  This Bill is important.  It is important that we pass it and ensure this process of having leaving certificate examinations and accredited grades can proceed.  Having said that, I have a number of concerns that I hope the Minister can address.  The first relates to canvassing.  I welcome that there are protections for teachers, which is important.  I hope students will acknowledge that teachers and school staff are also under pressure in this regard.  They are being asked to do a lot in the accredited grades process and have been working hard since the decision to have a choice was provided.  Teachers are also members of our communities and they should be entitled to go to their GAA clubs or to the shops and be able to walk around without fear of being approached, lobbied or anything like that.  It is important that we protect them and the supportive and close relationship between school staff, teachers and students.</p>  <p>  Further safeguards are needed to protect students given the serious repercussions an accusation of canvassing would have in particular circumstances.  It is not difficult to imagine circumstances where a person, be it a parent or someone else, would lobby a teacher on behalf of a student without the student knowing about it.  The penalty for that is the withholding of the results to the student.  It is the student who pays the penalty regardless of whether he or she knew or had any active hand, act or part in it.  That approach is wrong and I do not believe it would stand up in court.  We need to adopt an alternative approach to ensure that students who are involved in canvassing or breaking the rules face sanction, while students who are not involved in canvassing continue to be entitled to have their leaving certificate awarded.  The parent or other person who is lobbying, not the student, should be subject to a sanction either by means through a fine or by another means.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled amendments to this effect in the Seanad.  I urge the Minister again to reconsider the proposed approach.  It would not only be unfair but it would be questionable as to whether it would stand up in court.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also has concerns about the algorithm.  It is important that we get the standardisation right.  We all remember the significant distress that students faced last September due to errors in the algorithm.  First, the Bill refers to the use of junior certificate results in the standardisation process.  The Minister should clarify that the collective junior certificate results of the entire cohort rather than one individual's results will be taken into account.  Many people will approach the junior certificate in a different way.  The algorithm needs to be published in advance of results day.  We sought this last year.  The Minister's officials confirmed to us that the details of the algorithm would be published before results day but the Minister told my colleagues in the Seanad last week that she would not commit to that.</p>  <p>  Students deserve transparency.  They need to see how the standardisation process will be applied to them and they need confidence that this will be fair.  If the algorithm had been published earlier last year, the errors may have been identified and considerable stress would have been avoided.  Publishing the details of the algorithm is a self-evident and perfectly logical thing to do in the interests of transparency and to try to avoid what happened last year.  They should be published earlier.  Quality assurance is important.  I note the company involved in the error last year is also involved this year.  The second external contractor will, therefore, be important.  I hope it is vigilant and capable but the publication of the algorithm will be important for transparency.</p>  <p>  I have raised the contingency plan before and I do not understand why the Department is not moving on this.  A student who is self-isolating and unable, for that reason, to take the written examination on the date for which he or she has opted and worked towards will not have the opportunity to sit the exam, even though the accredited grade is on offer.  What is more, according to answers to parliamentary questions I received from the Minister, however unlikely it seems now, if there was a localised lockdown in Longford, Laois, Cork, or wherever, it seems that students in those areas would be denied an opportunity to sit a written exam.</p> <p>An individual deemed to be a close contact who has to isolate on the day of the exam will be in the same position.  Such individuals may be perfectly healthy and able, although deemed a close contact, or they may not be feeling well.  Whatever the circumstances, they do not have a real choice if they are not able to take the exam.  What really mystifies me about this is that it is a standard and conventional part of the leaving certificate that a B paper and a C paper are prepared.  Why can we not just prepare another paper and provide it to those students who are self-isolating and who have chosen to opt into the exam?  The Minister will tell me that they can receive an accredited grade but they chose to sit the exam because they felt it was their best opportunity and that it would help them get the maximum number of points and because they wanted to take it.  They will have studied and they may have done their oral or practical examinations.  They have decided they want to do this exam and they should get that chance.  It is not a lot of work for the Department.  The Minister should do it.</p> <p> I hope we can avoid publishing the leaving certificate results too late this year.  I hope the Minister can ensure that is not the case.  Delays in issuing results had an effect on students studying in the North, in Britain and internationally.  Some were able to organise it but others were not.  Some missed out on places and others missed out on accommodation.  We need to ensure that we keep to the time.</p> <p> I will raise the case of those students who sat the leaving certificate in previous years.  This issue does not just fall to the Minister, it falls to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, as well.  These students will have applied to the Central Applications Office, CAO, with a view to receiving a third level offer in August 2021 or will apply this year.  As a result of the inflation last year, inflation that occurred for reasons obvious to us, many students who would otherwise have qualified lost out and this may well happen again.  In my view, there are a number of approaches that could be taken to ensure they get fair treatment.  This may involve ring-fencing a number of places, adjusting the points these students received in the year of their exam according to the inflation that has occurred or allowing them into a course on the basis of the points required in the relevant year.  No more than the leaving certificate students of this year or last year, these students could not possibly have anticipated what was going to happen with regard to the pandemic.  They deserve fair treatment to ensure that they are not disadvantaged.  I firmly believe that if work is put in on this issue and if both Ministers involved adopt the right attitude, we can resolve it.</p> <p> To sum up, I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister can address my concerns.  We want to see this get through.  We want to see those students get the opportunity and choice they deserve.  In that context, we need to progress the Bill as quickly as we can but we must also take care to resolve the outstanding issues, which are significant enough.</p></speech>

I hope my time can be replenished.  My point is that, regardless of the very unusual circumstances, we have to send out a message that strictly no canvassing can take place on any level whether the student is aware of such canvassing.  If we dilute this element of the Bill or dilute the sanction, people will find loopholes, as they always do in Irish society.  We have seen that time and time again.  While this measure is strict and tough, and potentially very difficult for students, this Bill must be clear that absolutely no canvassing on any level will be tolerated.  We should proceed on that basis.  It is a very important message, albeit a difficult one for young people to have to consider.  There needs to be a sacred space for teachers to do their work without interference from anybody, whether this interference is known to the student or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The Minister made reference to school profiling, which is not part of this Bill or the accredited grades system.  That is to be welcomed.  I reiterate that it was the Minister who took out the school profiling last year following a campaign.  She listened to people who had difficulties with it and she is to be commended on that.  Again, as has already been stated, it was the advocacy and the campaigning zeal of young people and their ability to stay around the table with the Minister and her officials that got us to this point, at which young people have a choice.  If young people are ever wondering about their power or potential to affect change, they should look at what happened throughout this entire process.  It is there that the fruits of this power or potential can be seen.</p>  <p>  While we are supporting the Bill, I feel we have not yet learned the lessons of the 2020 leaving certificate.  We are still awaiting an independent review of what happened last year.  If that review had been completed, many of those lessons could have been learned and it would have impacted on the Bill.  That is a shame.  We certainly want to work with the Minister in the future to try to find a form of leaving certificate that adequately reflects the capabilities and potential of all students.  Many people are particularly critical of the leaving certificate.  While it is transparent and while people have a great level of faith in it and believe that it is fair, to a degree, there is also a sense that the leaving certificate makes one good at doing the leaving certificate rather than allowing young people to maximise their potential.  There is a sense that many young people are losing out on their chances in life because they have to jump over the hurdle of the leaving certificate in the first instance.</p>  <p>  In general, the Labour Party is supportive of the Bill.  We do not take lightly the canvassing element within the Bill.  We feel that, while it is a tough measure, it is necessary.  I can understand where the Minister is coming from with it and I will support her on it.  We feel strongly about the review of last year's leaving certificate.  I made points about the school profiling.  </p>  <p>  I know that the Minister agrees with me on my last point and that the T&aacute;naiste has made similar points.  It is an important point to make in respect of the pandemic and what we have gone through over the last year.  This year has done damage to young people and it has left scars.  A year of their school lives has been stolen, along with the socialisation and interaction they would have had.  Teachers and special needs assistants were working all the while but remote working can never replace the school experience.  While the Minister has made an announcement about summer programmes which may hope to repair some of that damage, the last year cannot be replaced or repaired over the course of a summer.  We strongly suggest that we have potentially lost a generation of young people because, as we constantly say, people over 16 years of age are not required to be in school and many young people were lost to the system.  Young people who are due to sit the leaving certificate next year are clinging on by their fingertips.</p> <p>School teachers and principals are trying hard to keep young people engaged in school and school learning.  It has been challenging.</p> <p> In order to ensure that we do not lose a third generation, as it were, or year or cohort of young people to disengagement and choices that they may regret in later life, we must invest properly in a catch-up fund for young people akin to what has been done in the UK.  Its fund is &pound;1 billion.  While its population is obviously larger than ours, something comparable would be of benefit in Ireland.  Instead of trying to tackle the issue over the course of the summer, a fund would allow us to consider class sizes and investigate the damage that has been done and how we can repair the scarring, trauma and heightened anxiety of the past year.  I do not just mean academic work, but other issues as well.  This would be important.  As the Minister knows, if there was a proposal for a road costing &euro;150 million, any number of Government and Opposition Deputies would be jumping up and down saying that we could not but spend that &euro;150 million on the road.  When it comes to young people and children, however, the suggestion that &euro;150 million would go a long way towards repairing the damage caused by a pandemic, people would scratch their heads and chins and say that that would be expensive and it could surely be spent on something else.  This is the one chance that these young people will get, though.  Unfortunately, they will have to tell their children and grandchildren for the rest of their lives how, when they were in school, there was a pandemic, as a result of which they lost out on in-class teaching.  We will have a chance next year to try to repair that damage.  The one mechanism we can use to do that is to invest in the expertise of our teachers and special needs assistants and listen to what they and school communities have to say.  Repairing the damage may not be possible.  For example, it may not be possible for infants to recover what they have lost.  It will take a long time, but we have to try at least.</p> <p> We support the Bill, accept what the Minister is saying about canvassing and understand the necessity for a legislative underpinning of what she is doing.  We have worked with her so as to forgo pre-legislative scrutiny, even though that is not something that should happen too often.  We are still waiting on the review of what happened in 2020.  Let us learn the lessons of 2020 and 2021 and ensure that if students of the leaving certificate class of 2022 are going to be in class all the time, which is our hope, proper resources are made available not just for them, but for every school group, school year, class group and class year at primary and secondary levels so that the scarring and difficulties they have experienced are recognised by the State and, at the very least, we can cling on to some of the young people who have been disconnected and discommoded and who are wondering whether they will return in September.  That is a choice that young people are making right now.  If there are 17-year-olds who are considering not going back to school in September, it poses a difficulty that they may regret for the rest of their lives.  This is the one chance we have and we should grasp it collectively.  On that basis, we support the legislation.</p></speech>

Maybe that goes to the issue of leaving certificate reform, which I will revert to shortly.</p>  <p>  As to the specific aspects of the Bill, I welcome the choice element.  This was something that was voiced consistently by young people.  I met young people across my constituency and I join in commending the students union, which was excellent and put its point across well.  That 87% of students opted to take an exam as well as accredited grades explodes the myth that this year's leaving certificate students were looking for some sort of easy way out.</p>  <p>  I welcome the role of the SEC.  Whatever else about the leaving certificate, it is impartial and transparent, and the SEC's role is important in that regard.  I also welcome the protections offered for teachers, principals and boards of management.  It is essential that teachers be free to make these decisions and educational assessments free from any sort of lobbying.  This is an important provision in the Bill.  I welcome that school historical data are excluded.  This is also an important provision.  I was going to ask for more details.  The Minister has indicated that a detailed procedures paper is in train as regards a formal process to report canvassing.  That will be important.</p>  <p>  I wish to build on a point that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised and to which Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred somewhat.  The issue of grades inflation does not just apply retrospectively.  I worry about the leaving certificate cohort of 2022.  If those students sit a more traditional leaving certificate, I wonder about how their grades will hold up against this year's and whether there will be a long-term impact in terms of competition.  I would like the Minister to consider that matter.</p>  <p>  We have a moment here to examine the idea of the leaving certificate.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to this matter.  I worry that it is an exam that rewards people who are very good at doing the leaving certificate.  I am not sure it is an exam that does well in terms of rewarding creativity or critical thinking, and neither can slow, deliberative thinking skills expect to be rewarded in the three-hour pressure cooker of an exam situation.  The 87% cohort of students who have opted to do both represent a large and valuable data set.  We should not squander the opportunity to use that data set to evaluate critically the leaving certificate system, how good a job it does and how well it rewards the students who go through it.  We should do this with an eye towards including in the longer term an increased component of continuous assessment and everything that goes with that.</p>  <p>  In light of the leaving certificate reform agenda and the commitment in the programme for Government to hold a citizens' assembly on the future of education, the student's voice has never been more critical.  I hope that the Minister finds a space to include it in the deliberations on leaving certificate reform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300033#JJ00300"><p>While I support the Bill, I am concerned about a couple of issues.  For example, if a parent, guardian or grandparent approaches a teacher or member of a school's personnel to try to influence grades but does so without the knowledge or consent of the pupil, the pupil should not be held responsible or accountable.  A fine should be imposed on the person making the approach instead of the student being denied a result.  I will point out to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that Labour voted in favour of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment on this issue in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and that we in Sinn F&eacute;in are not condoning canvassing in any shape or form.  We just believe that it would be unfair to punish a student who had no hand, act or part in canvassing.</p>  <p>  I have concerns about the exact form of standardisation that will be used.  I fear that certain schools may feel discriminated against, as happened last year.  Everyone wants the system to be fair and transparent for all concerned.</p>  <p>  I recognise the significant contribution that teachers and students made to education last year and in the first three months of this year.  Online teaching and learning proved difficult, but I commend all involved on their major effort to make it work.  Many I have spoken to acknowledge that they would much rather be in the classroom.  As such, the day that technology replaces humans as teachers is, thankfully, unforeseeable.</p>  <p>  Going with a combination of examinations and accredited grades was the right option.  It was the option most favoured by the students.  It allows many of those who wish to sit the exams to do so while also catering for those who find it difficult to learn at home where circumstances might not be conducive to doing so for various reasons, for example, access to technology or decent broadband.  The isolation of learning at home without the support of classmates proved to be the greatest challenge.  I hope that we do not have to resort to that again in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300033#JJ00400"><p>I thank the Minister for speaking on the arrangements in the legislation required for the leaving certificate model of 2021.  However, a large part of what I wish to speak about relates to the failing of the leaving certificate examination prior to the pandemic and the ambition that both sides of the Chamber should have to change it for the benefit of our younger people.</p> <p>There is an opportunity for change at this time.  The pandemic forced us to cross the Rubicon in terms of the traditional leaving certificate examination.  An immovable and archaic institution was forced to evolve and adapt in mere months.  The first examinations took place in 1924 and, prior to 2020, the format remained heavily similar, year after year, to the original model and method.<br/><br/>I am not arguing that we should necessarily retain the models used for the leaving certificate examinations in 2020 or 2021.  We certainly should not do so without a fierce interrogation of them.  Nor am I arguing that they are perfect systems.  Far from it.  I am saying that the pandemic forced our hand and we should continue to progress towards a better leaving certificate assessment model.  It should be one that provides for greater flexibility, reduces the enormous degree of pressure placed on all students and levels the playing field for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.  There should be a form of assessment that rewards learning, curiosity and application of knowledge, rather than the exercise in memorisation that has been shown to be a large proportion of what the leaving certificate examination in its current form offers.  That was confirmed in research by Dr. Denise Burns and her colleagues in 2018.<br/><br/>It is no secret that I have no great love for the traditional leaving certificate examination.  I have raised the issue at every opportunity I had, including in this Chamber in the course of this year and last.  I am not alone in this view.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concerns before the pandemic regarding the levels of stress caused to our young people by the examinations every year and charged the State with initiating reform to reduce that stress burden.  No one could have predicted the pandemic and its disruption of teaching and learning.  However, we already knew, prior to the school building closures in March 2020, that the leaving certificate examination causes extreme stress and anxiety to all students, rewards lower order skills and is an effective sorting machine for separating students who have from those who have not.  An analysis by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, of all 2017 and 2018 higher education enrolments illustrates the stark differences between the points obtained by students in the leaving certificate examination based on their socioeconomic backgrounds.  Data from 97,000 students show that those from affluent areas achieved 446 points on average, compared with 368 points for students from what were described as disadvantaged areas.  It is important not to designate the students themselves as disadvantaged.  Rather, the circumstances in which they are asked to do their schooling is what disadvantages them.<br/><br/>A total of 37% of students from disadvantaged areas achieved 400 points or more, compared with 72%, or almost double the number, of students from affluent areas.  In 2015, the HEA found that, in County Dublin, Dublin 6 had the highest progression rate to college, with 99% of leaving certificate students there going on to third level.  The Dublin postcode with the lowest progression rate saw only 15% of students going to third level.  That is a stark difference.  In pointing out these statistics, I am not trying to alienate any students who may be listening.  I want to show that the argument I am making is not merely based on a personal belief or vendetta.  It is not that students from areas like my constituency are less capable or intelligent than their peers.  My point is that the leaving certificate system locks in and rewards privilege year after year.  We do not have annual data from the Department encapsulating these facts, but the feeder school list produced every year by <i>The Irish Times</i>demonstrates very clearly who gets to go to university and who does not.<br/><br/>It is a myth that the leaving certificate examination is some great meritocratic system.  The many teachers, principals, students and parents with whom I engage, both as a public representative and in my previous role working in access, know it is a myth.  I am sure many of the Deputies in the Chamber today know it is a myth.  If not, it may be that they cannot see it because they have benefited so immensely from the existing process.  Our failure to address the inequality in the system before the Covid crisis only exacerbated the stress caused to sixth-year students in 2020 and 2021 when, at the eleventh hour and in the midst of a global pandemic, it became obvious that our terminal-style examinations could not take place.<br/><br/>I want to speak briefly about compassion.  Proponents of the leaving certificate examination champion the fact it does not take account of circumstances.  They point out that every student sits down at the same time, on the same day and answers the same questions, regardless of what is going on in their personal lives or what has happened to them up to that point in their lives.  It was only after Rhona Butler shared her personal experience of losing her mother during her leaving certificate examinations in 2018, and having no alternative but to sit the remainder, that the lack of compassion in the system was addressed.  I argue strongly that a system designed to be bluntly fair cannot be devoid of compassion.  Following on from Rhona's story, a pilot bereavement scheme was introduced in 2019, but it does not go far enough.  I am also conscious that it does not apply this year.  The scheme allows students who suffer the bereavement of the loss of a close relative during the examination period to be absent from further examinations for a three-day period.  The Department's information on the scheme states: &quot;[It] is intended to allow... time free from the Leaving Certificate examinations to prepare for and attend the funeral...&quot;  Students who have to take the three days are required to sit the missed examinations mere weeks later.  This is the leaving certificate model that is championed and obsessed over every year.  The scheme of three days of bereavement leave piloted in 2019 represents the most compassion that has ever been shown within the examinations system.<br/><br/>I have tabled an amendment to the Bill that would require the Department to look into the use of accredited grades for students who experience exceptional circumstances at any point during their sixth year.  It would also oblige the Department to use the learning from the pandemic to inform and create change to the leaving certificate examination and level the playing field for all students.  My amendment makes the case that if students who are unable to take a traditional examination this year because of the pandemic can be catered for, we might apply the same rationale in the years to come when a student has to step aside either because of illness, the illness of a family member or a bereavement.  It would be logical to enshrine that provision in law in order to keep fairness in the system.<br/><br/>I want to query the Minister on the data that will be used by the State Examinations Commission in the standardisation process for accredited grades in 2021.  The legislation provides that the commission will &quot;take account of such data, including but not limited to data relating to Junior Certificate Examinations and Leaving Certificate Examinations in preceding years...&quot;  I am not sure why we cannot, for the avoidance of doubt, have more specific details on which data will and will not be taken into account.  Based on the previous issues with the data used for the ranking order and the back and forth on using historical school data, it would be beneficial to have an exhaustive list of the data the SEC will be using for the standardisation process.<br/><br/>We cannot go back to the fairy tale that the leaving certificate examinations are just.  I urge the Minister to use the lessons of the pandemic to create true reform.  There are a couple of groups I would like to highlight that will not be catered for in this legislation.  I fully appreciate that it cannot be entirely exhaustive but there are groups that have been left behind.  I spoke yesterday to leaving certificate applied students from a number of schools across Dublin who were celebrating an awards day online as part of the Trinity College access programme.  The leaving certificate applied examination is a model that rewards curiosity and engagement.  However, in the decades since its introduction, it has too often been the case that these students who simply learn differently from what is catered for in the traditional leaving certificate examination have been held in a holding shop, with traditional pathways to university and other forms of higher education cut off for them.  The leaving certificate applied model is, in fact, a little more applicable than the traditional model to the real world and the real-life way that people learn, not only in school but in terms of acquiring the types of skills that are needed as students progress to university.<br/><br/>There is also an issue with students who, this year and last, have been unable to return to school because a family member has a serious underlying health condition.  Students in that situation are terrified of catching Covid-19 and bringing it home to their loved one.  Between January and March this year and for a time last year, they had a similar experience to their peers because everyone was learning from home.  Now, however, their peers are back in the classroom and their own continued absence is detrimental to them.  We should have catered for those students long ago.  Despite protestations from their family members, such as Jan and Michael Rynne, whose case has been highlighted in this Chamber and in the media, no action was taken.  Instead, the Department saw fit to suggest that such students would be better off in school.  There was no acknowledgement that they are terrified of bringing the virus home.  That is lamentable.  Even at this late hour, I ask that those students be catered for in any way it can be done.</p></speech>

I appreciate that very much.</p>  <p>  As a member of the committee on education, I was pleased, alongside my colleagues, to be able to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill.  It is important we play our part in getting the Bill through the Houses.  I thank the Minister for the manner in which it was brought before us through committee in respect of the discussions we had previously with her officials.  I take this opportunity to thank the students for the significant advocacy they brought to bear on this process.  The class of 2021, as fifth years, played a significant role, certainly in my constituency, coming to me to talk about the implications it would have on their education.  The class of 2021 did not lose one year of normal education but two.  It is important that this certainty is placed on the Statute Book to provide them with one less thing to worry about in the context of Covid-19 and the potential for them to contract Covid-19 prior to the leaving certificate if they have chosen to sit it, as 88% of students have done.  It is important we provide them with the option to use the accredited grades system or the written exams or both.</p>  <p>  The leaving certificate is very stressful at the best of times, never mind in the middle of a pandemic.  I am conscious of the comments of a colleague, who mentioned that the leaving certificate is excellent at teaching leaving certificate students to sit the leaving certificate.  However, in the long term - and I think the Minister is open to this conversation - we need significant reforms, as has been highlighted by a number of Deputies who have made contributions thus far in this debate.  This is an opportune time for us to have that evaluation and to look at the outcomes.  The leaving certificate exam - a terminal basis, as I think Deputy Gannon called it - as a measure of one's education, is not necessarily the most appropriate way to do things.  Things have changed dramatically, and I believe there are opportunities for us to recognise that there are other ways to further and higher education.  Sometimes the leaving certificate is not necessarily an appropriate measure to capture the intelligence or ability of a student to recall and drag out issues they have learned about in the preceding years.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged by the section of the Bill which covers canvassing.  It is appropriate that this be dealt with in black-or-white, right-or-wrong terms.  It is that simple.  It is important that we rectify the issues relating to the algorithms and the use of data that were experienced last year and that there is, as I think the Minister alluded to, a system in place to support the checking of the manner in which the system is operated by the SEC.  Quality assurance, as I think the Minister referred to it.  That is very appropriate.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the expansion of the debate on what the leaving certificate should look like and the fresh approach we should take.  In the context of further and higher education, I welcome the fact that we are broadening our apprenticeship schemes, which are an extremely important part of the State's education offering.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the Bill's progression through the House and its return to committee at some point in the near future.</p></speech>

I wrote to the Minister about this last year as well.  While the algorithm is a central aspect of the exam, it appears in the Bill as only a passing reference in the context of the standardisation process.  This does not make any sense.  This year we need absolute transparency.  The passing reference to the algorithm does not in any way absolve the Minister from her responsibility to publish details of it in advance.  Indeed, if the algorithm to be used had been published before the results last year, the errors could have been discovered in time, thereby preventing the stress and trauma to many students, their families and their teachers, as I saw in my constituency, Kildare North.  We just cannot have a repeat of that this year.  I therefore ask the Minister to publish the algorithm in advance, with detailed examination invited and scrutiny welcomed.  I urge her to commit to that and to the necessary transparency.  Transparency itself needs to be standardised across all Departments.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.</p></speech>

I was privileged enough when I was studying English literature in UCD, having entered there in 1987, that Seamus Deane was already an intellectual legend teaching in UCD.  I remember reading his wonderful book, <i>Celtic Revivals</i>, which was a <i>tour de force</i>of an introduction to and critical essays on some of the great Irish literary figures.  He was fearless in de-sanitising some of the Irish literary canon and showing its radical and often political content.  He played a big role in the Field Day project, another radical intellectual project in this country.  His loss is a great loss, I am sure most importantly to his family but also to intellectual life and academic life in this country, so it is important to make that tribute in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>The revolt of the school students against the leaving certificate in the midst of the Covid pandemic was not just about the unfairness of forcing them to sit the exam given all the difficulties of Covid - the restrictions, the unfairnesses it would have imposed on certain students, who may have had difficulty accessing online education, and the public health threat itself - but was also a long-overdue revolt against a thoroughly archaic system of education, if one could even say the leaving certificate has anything to do with education.  I would argue it has very little to do with education.  That is not in any way a critique of our wonderful teachers, who have to deal with all the difficulties of giving the students the choice they have asked for in this year's and last year's leaving certificate.  It is a critique, however, of the failure of imagination of successive Governments and politicians in general to re-envision education, how we do education and how we allow young people and people of all ages to fulfil their educational potential.</p><p>As an English student, let me point out the ridiculousness of some aspects of our education system.  You study Shakespeare from the page and you do a written exam on, in my case, <i>Othello</i>or <i>Julius Caesar</i>.  What on earth has reading Shakespeare from the page got to do with Shakespeare if it is not about acting it out, having the teaching resources and bringing the actors and directors into our schools to bring Shakespeare to life?  This is an indication of the way in which our education system sanitises and, to use that horrible word, standardises education.  If anything, Covid and the revolt of the school students should have led us, and even now should still lead us, to a radical, revolutionary change in the way we do education, and that is just one example.  It is all about the words &quot;standardisation&quot;, &quot;bell curves&quot;, &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;assessment&quot;, is it not?  What have they to do with the human imagination, the human intellect and fulfilling human potential?</p><p>Sometimes people should remember the origins of these things.</p> <p>Where did the examination system originate?  It came from imperial China in 605 under the Sui dynasty and was later expanded by the Song dynasty as a way of selecting people largely from elites - first, military elites and then bureaucratic elites - to serve in the imperial civil service and military.  It was imported into Europe in the 1500s by the Jesuits and was first pioneered on a mass scale by the British Empire in India to select people for the imperial civil service.  It was later established for the same purpose in England.  In other words, it was testing a particular type of intelligence for particular reasons.  In its origins, it was very much about perpetuating elites.</p> <p> Let us apply that to the situation today.  Whatever rationale there was for rationing access to any level of education, and I do not believe there was much, what possible rationale is there for rationing access to higher and further education or, indeed, postgraduate education in the modern world?  It is, by definition, perpetuating hierarchies and elites.  We should be thinking that now is the opportunity to revolutionise education, to bring meaning to the expression that education is a right, not a privilege, and to give everybody access by removing the leaving certificate barrier to full educational fulfilment and potential, instead of a system that stresses, alienates and degrades the real meaning of education.</p></speech>

Before doing so, however, I welcome the fact that school profiling is not part of this proposal.  That is very important.  I also welcome that there are sanctions against the lobbying of teachers, which is also important.  That took place in some areas last summer and it was completely unfair to the teachers.  It is good to have the measures indicated in the Bill.  The removal of the situation whereby teachers gave numerical rankings to their students last year is also positive.</p>  <p>  The point I wish to focus on is the fact that 84,000 people have applied for third level education through the CAO this year.  How many places are available for them?  It is fewer than 60,000.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the exact number.  The result is that there are people who are winners and get into third level and people who are losers and do not get in.  That is wrong.  One of the key roles of the leaving certificate examination in the Irish education system is to act as a filter.  It filters those who get in and those who do not get in.  The accredited grades system does the same.  We need an alternative to both.  That alternative is open access.  In the same way as barriers were removed and students were allowed to attend second level education, and the students flooded in and the educational level in the country rose, we must remove these barriers so all who wish to go to third level education can do so.  On that basis we can have the abolition of the leaving certificate examination, an outdated and extremely stressful examination and, as I said, a filter to decide who gets into third level and who is kept out.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve that, it will be necessary to have an extra 25,000 places at third level over the next couple of years.  In the short term, there could be more blended learning, the digitisation of libraries and laptops for every student.  However, it is necessary to get moving now with investment in building and providing the space for the extra 25,000 places.  It is a big job, but it is not impossible.  It would also be necessary to hire an extra 10,000 to 15,000 staff.  That would not be so difficult.  There are already 1,200 short-term, part-time people on insecure contracts who teaching at third level.  They are mainly women and mainly low paid.  They should be taken on full-time as part of an open access system.  Some 4,000 extra places are being provided by the Government this year.  That falls well short of what is required.</p>  <p>  This type of approach is not unheard of in other countries.  In the Netherlands, it is illegal to allow access to education through competitive examinations.  Mature students do not have to do competitive examinations.  There could be an omnibus entry system, which I will explain further on another day.  Students can be facilitated in studying abroad.  Just because there is no leaving certificate examination does not mean one cannot have a leaving certificate to show that one has gone through the system and has the qualifications, and one can use that abroad.</p>  <p>  Last, but not least, how can that be funded?  It will cost billions.  A Covid wealth tax would be required.  Big corporations have profited massively from the pandemic, while ordinary people have struggled.  It would be necessary to go after them with a Covid wealth tax and put some of those resources into open access to all, an idea whose time has come.</p></speech>

I am very heartened by the progress that has been made.  I believe passionately that it can be achieved.  We have an excellent basis to do so.  However, I will point out to the Minister that it is about more reform, not about more resources in the main.  It is about the quality of leadership and the quality of teaching, not about the input-output ratios that tend to be the conversation in our education system.  Most of all, one of the things that will stop us from achieving this is if we fail to reform the leaving certificate examination and do not take on a radical agenda of change now.</p>  <p>  To date, we have taken an extremely cautious approach.  We started with the junior cycle, but even in that there was no proper evaluation of the projects.  Only 10% of marks went to a student's written assessment, not to the project itself.  That sold people short.  Some 90% of the junior cycle is still memory based.  I accept that there has been much innovative thinking about the curriculum and there is a huge improvement.  The portfolio of achievements is really welcome.  However, we have not succeeded in radically changing the teaching-to-the-test approach.</p>  <p>  Society has changed dramatically and if we do not change the leaving certificate examination, we will not catch up with it.  The OECD recently warned us that we are creating an education system that will turn out second-class students if we do not undertake change.  The system is cast from the industrial production line of trying to put everyone through the same system, memory-based retention and trapping teaching and learning in a very tight straitjacket that is simply not creating adaptability and innovation, the type of things people need to survive and thrive in a rapidly changing world.  There have been innovations that I welcome.  The physical education programme, for example, is a much more interesting way of presentation and assessment.  Digital schools and the re-emergence of apprenticeships are very welcome.  However, we have not seized the opportunity to change to a more positive, student-led system of education.  It is still handing down the tablets of stone, and that is not the way.  We need to value a much wider range of intelligence, as many have said in this debate.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 exposed the weaknesses of the system, but it also showed our capacity for innovation.  The old saying that necessity is the mother of invention has been proven in our education system.  We have seized alternative assessment methods and delivered them fairly and successfully.  We have shown that we can do this.  This legislation is welcome, but it is far too narrow.  We should have a legislative framework for ambitious changes of the type that have long been sought.  The reform of the leaving certificate examination started in 2016, but it has proceeded at a snail's pace.  Five years later, and nothing has happened.  The Minister should seize the moment.  She should engage with students, primarily, and ask them if we should cut back memory retention to less than 50% of the marks.  Should we have open-book examinations?  Should we have a proper evaluation framework for projects, not this make-up thing of students writing up their experience?  Should we have stronger recognition of portfolios of experience?</p>  <p>  I believe we must force the pace of change.  It is not an industrial relations issue.  It is about the future for our children.  That change should also force change at third level and in the apprenticeship system.  We should make second-chance education the norm, not the very rare exception it is now.</p></speech>

We need grades to be provided in a more timely manner.  Students also need more clarity on the standardisation process.  Consideration also needs to be given in cases such as where one has opted for a written examination, for example, and then has to self-isolate or is struck down by Covid-19, as to what exactly happens in that situation.  Clarity is needed in all of those situations.</p>  <p>  Like many Members who have focused here today on the change from the current model leaving certificate, I wish to focus in my last minute on that issue also.  Like many people, I remember the leaving certificate.  I hated school, the leaving certificate and that whole process.  I can still remember things that we actually nearly sung off.  That is how we learned things, clapping along in a little rhyme.  To this day we can probably say those things, no problem, but we still probably do not really know why we did that.  </p>  <p>  We have to move away from this model of drilling things into children's heads for an examination where one comes out completely traumatised and stressed.  One has to ask what education or life lessons one has learned from that.  I say very little.  Education needs to more about other aspects and it cannot all be about examinations, points, scores and who is getting an "A".  It needs to be about what people are learning.  We need a lot more life skills, resilience-building and coping mechanisms for children together with practical knowledge, such as how to do one's taxes or change the wheel of a car.  These sort of things are never taught in schools and these are the practical things that one needs in life.  We need to start moving away from the traditional leaving certificate model system and to look at and examine our education system.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to be able to speak on this Bill this evening.  We have had a sea change.  I was reflecting on what Deputy Bruton was saying, on what has happened in the past two years in education and how the whole system was forced to change because of the pandemic.  Our students, teachers, parents and boards of management were all thrown into a new way of doing things.  It is very difficult but it was something that was forced on us all.  It has been a very traumatic experience and the reality is that there was a great deal of uncertainty.</p>  <p>  This Bill is giving some certainty for the leaving certificate class of this year as to what they are doing.  The decision to provide the system of accredited grades is to be welcomed but we also need to look at this right across education and what we are doing in it.  As a former lecturer in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, continuous assessment is one of the key components of a student's development and it should be brought in at first year in secondary school and, in fact, at national school level.</p>  <p>  One of the things I always refer to in respect of education is that I learned Irish for 13 years and I still cannot speak it.  There is something wrong that despite my best efforts, I cannot speak it after all that time.  We did not do much practice; we simply memorised everything.  We got it right for the examination and it went out of our heads again then straight away.</p>  <p>  There are a number of suggestions that the Minister should look at with the Department.  A review should be initiated of the whole pathway to the leaving certificate as to what is going to happen to the students who will be sitting their leaving certificate examination in 2022, as they have also been affected by this pandemic.  We should put what we have learned in the past year to 18 months to best use for next year and further on than that.</p>  <p>  We also need to look at our own performance within the Department for special needs education and how we can adapt and be more flexible with that.</p>  <p>  We need to do a review of school buildings and how we build them so that we are better prepared into the future so that the modern school can adapt in a better way.</p>  <p>  A further review is needed in respect of technology, distance and remote learning and how that can be blended into working in school to give a full experience, while at the same time giving people good experience on how to work from home as well, at particular times and on certain projects.</p>  <p>  Other aspects of the review I would like to see happening would be on the continuous professional development of teachers and how we train them on doing things differently from how they were done in the past, so that we have more continuous assessment, less testing and more development of the student skills on an incremental basis right throughout the five years of secondary school, rather than having a cliff-edge exam at the end of it.</p>  <p>  I agree that everybody should have access to third level education.  We have the opportunity to do that now.  We should look at that because the time has come for change but this change has to happen in a very progressive way.</p>  <p>  Right through this experience in education, one of the things that came to the fore is that young people truly value their education.  They want to have certainty in what they are doing and they also need a framework set out for them so that they know before the start of the year what is in front of them, be that continuous assessment, some examinations or blended learning.  I hope that this opportunity we have, with its potential for change for the better in education will stand our young people, our country, our economy and our society very well into the future.  If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we can make change when we are forced to do so.  When we are in that focus of change, we need to grasp the opportunity to change our education system to ensure that the student gets the best in life and that we produce students who will be exemplars in our society.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic as the Bill is presented today.  Months ago, when it became obvious that the leaving certificate would not be able to proceed in its usual format in 2021 and there was much debate on what should be done, I called for a choice to be given to the students between estimated grades and sitting the examinations.  I am pleased that the Government is proposing such a system and is taking the steps as part of the implementation process.</p>  <p>  The reason I called for the choice is that Covid-19 will affect different students in different ways.  We must remember that the current group of sixth year students are a great deal more disadvantaged by Covid-19 because for them, both fifth year and sixth year have been disrupted.  I am aware that that message has resounded here in the D&aacute;il today.  Some students will have adapted well to the challenges of online teaching and learning.  The feedback that I have received supports the view that teachers, students and parents went to great efforts to make the online learning process as successful as possible.  All did a tremendous job in difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  Schools made extra supports available by lending ICT equipment, by posting it out to people where necessary and by providing constant support.  We must, however, take account of those students who were significantly inconvenienced by the closure of schools and the move to online learning.  We perhaps take for granted the importance of the school routine and the structure of the day.  For some students, school provides a refuge from difficulties at home and an outlet for peer relationships and support.  The in-person interactions in the classroom on a daily basis are almost impossible to replicate in a virtual setting.  Some students rely heavily upon being able to ask questions and on having something personally explained if they are having difficulties.  Others with special educational needs get wonderful support in school.  I am aware that schools have gone to great lengths to support these students during school closures but, as I said, nothing can replicate the school environment for that type of educational support.</p>  <p>  Lack of reliable Internet connections may also have made the online learning experience quite difficult for some.  It was with all of these concerns in mind that I called for students to be given the choice.</p> <p> Another area of the Bill I wish to touch on concerns the appeals process.  Every year, we read or hear stories about a student or students who have been discommoded by the appeals process.  This usually involves a student taking an appeal and winning it, but being unable to get a place on his or her desired course as a result of the length of time the appeals process has taken.  The Bill refers to an appeals process but it does not give a timeline as to how long that process will take or whether it will be ensured that the process is completed prior to CAO offers being made.  The Minister and the officials involved should design the appeals process to ensure that those who successfully appeal a grade will be able to get a place on the course they would have been offered had it not been for the mistakes relating to the initial grades.</p> <p> Estimated grades have the potential to cause grade inflation.  The last leaving certificate completed in the usual way was in 2019.  Some CAO applicants sat their leaving certificate examinations in 2019 and are looking for CAO places in 2021.  They will have to compete with the grade inflation and may find that accredited grades have caused the points for their chosen course to rise.  I ask the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to work together to ensure that specific places are made available for deferred applicants from 2019 or earlier who could, in normal circumstances, have reached the required points level.</p> <p> On a personal level, I did not get my leaving certificate in the usual way.  For all the anxiety Covid has caused, there is hope.  Being able to do or pass one's leaving certificate examinations or whatever it entails is not the be all and end all.  I was 35 when I did my leaving certificate examinations, but I went on and completed a degree, finishing it at the age of 40, so there is always hope.  If I can achieve election to be one of 160 Deputies, anybody can get there.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for her proactive approach in the Department.  She has worked very hard and has fit into the role very well.  This Bill is the measure of what we have learned from Covid.</p></speech>

The main purpose of the Bill is to confer on the State Examinations Commission the necessary powers to run a non-examination based form of assessment to inform students' leaving certificate results.  Candidates for the leaving certificate in 2021 can now opt to sit the usual written examination in June or apply for grades accredited by the State Examinations Commission to be issued to them, or both.</p>  <p>  As the youngest Member of the House, I wish to use my time on this issue to speak about the need to reform the leaving certificate system and how continuous assessment may be a step in the right direction to such reform.  I recognise the difficult time it has been for leaving certificate students over the past two years.  They have been dealt a very difficult hand and we, as policymakers, should do all we can to ensure the system will put in place the mechanisms to ensure that all the work those students have done throughout their education will be recognised in terms of the best possible outcomes for them.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that we have all faced many challenges since Covid-19 arrived in Ireland, but it has been particularly difficult for younger people.  I am the Member of the House who most recently completed the leaving certificate and I have to say it is not an easy thing for anyone to do.  It is extraordinarily difficult and I feel a great degree of empathy for the students who are going through that process.  For them to go through it during the time of Covid-19 has been extraordinarily difficult.  The Bill is one of many measures that I hope the Department will be working on to try to alleviate some of the issues currently being encountered by leaving certificate students.</p>  <p>  I wish to heavily emphasise the requirement for the Department to work closely with the students who are coming into their examination years, such as those in fifth year, while also being cognisant of the fact that the education of those doing their leaving certificate examination this year was also badly hampered last year by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the Minister.  In her portfolio, she has had one of the most difficult tasks of any member of the Cabinet.  It is a testament to her, as a newly-elected Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that she was able to go in and do the job that she has done.  She must be commended for that.  I note that on the record of the House.  I would not wish her job on anyone at the moment because of how difficult it was but her expertise in the area of education was quite helpful.  We have to admit that she was an outsider in terms of the Oireachtas.  She worked for a local authority for many years.  In drastic situations such as Covid-19, it can be helpful to have a breath of fresh air in Departments and be able to shake things up.</p>  <p>  To come back to the central message on the area of reform, it would be very much a missed opportunity if we were not to address the many challenges that face secondary education and explore how we can reform it to make it better for students, improve their opportunities in life and improve their education overall.  I was struck by the comments of a previous speaker around the issue of the Irish language.  He is right in the sense that many people go through primary and secondary education and exit secondary school, after doing up to 16 years of study on the Irish language, without being able to speak it.  I am guilty in that regard and I try to improve my Irish every day, but we, as a Government, could definitely do more work on the whole area of foreign languages.</p>  <p>  The Minister is well aware of the significant challenges in east Cork, my area, around school capacity and the constraints and difficulties encountered in that regard by many students in the area.  I commend them on the work they have been doing while going through those particular issues.  Many of them do not have  proper school facilities in their communities.  We need to address that challenge as well.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister well in her work.  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.</p></speech>

The Bill is long overdue.  I understand that several amendments were tabled in the Seanad by my party colleagues but were not taken on board.  I urge the Minister to take another look at those amendments.</p>  <p>  We need to give students the right to be heard in the event of a review.  We also need to shift the blame in circumstances where an approach is made to a teacher without the knowledge of the student.  These are basic principles of natural justice and should be included in the Bill.</p>  <p>  We need to remove the provision of the Bill which narrows the grounds upon which an appeal can be made.  As matters stand, an appeal can only consider the technicalities of how estimated marks are transferred from the school to the State Examinations Commission.  As the system is relatively new, appeals should have a far wider scope.</p>  <p>  Finally, I know the Bill relates to the leaving certificate, but we must not forget junior certificate students.  We need clarity on whether junior certificate results will be based on results data from the year group or on the individual students' own results.</p></speech>

We know that the accredited grades system has caused a significant amount of anxiety for students and parents.  We know that in unprecedented times and events, students were discommoded.  It was a very difficult time and they were expected to adjust to the whole process.</p>  <p>  I commend the high calibre of teachers we have.  They do not get enough credit for the fantastic work they do in encouraging and supporting pupils and going well and truly beyond the call of duty most of the time in schools.  As one who spent time in the education system and having worked with fantastic teachers and having been inspired by great teachers at national school and secondary school, I know the importance of teachers.  That needs to be acknowledged as we are speaking on an education Bill.</p>  <p>  The accredited grades system has created a significant amount of concern and anxiety but I note that the Department has indicated that the principles of equity, fairness and objectivity are paramount in the SEC accredited grades system.  One would hope that those principles apply at all times and not just in these exceptional times.  </p>  <p>  I note that the guidance warns teachers to be aware of any real or perceived conflict of interest involved in giving an estimated mark to a particular student, such as a close relative, in the teacher's class.</p> <p>I think many teachers will take issue with this as it creates the perception that they are not doing their job in a professionally distant and objective manner.  I am glad to see, however, that there is an emphasis on guidance for the grading process on reasonable accommodation for students with special educational needs.</p> <p> I want to raise a point with the Minister in relation to the State Examinations Commission, which is overseeing this process.  Recently, I engaged with her Department on behalf of a constituent in the Tullamore area who was correcting for the leaving certificate in 2019 and who was invited by the State Examinations Commission to correct again this year.  He accepted this in good faith and duly corrected 104 candidate portfolios.  However, up to last week, he was not given an indication as to the rates of pay involved or the date on which the payment would be made.  The same applied to all other examiners.  I feel communication needs to improve in that regard.  As I understand it, the issue was only resolved last Tuesday evening.  I urge the Minister, to ensure the smooth operation of the grading process, to intervene with the SEC so that this does not happen this year and that the communication should be much better and clearer.  All those involved in the grading process should be treated fairly.  That goes for students, teachers and examiners.</p> <p> The final point I want to make is on an issue which is very close to my heart.  I feel that students from disadvantaged backgrounds and with special educational needs are badly in need of more supports in order to prepare adequately for the examinations in a way that does not cause them undue anxiety and stress.  I know the concerns of teachers have been raised in relation to disadvantaged students who have disengaged.  That is a real worry which must be taken onboard.  It must be addressed and acted upon.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that happens.  Having been a teacher for 12 years, I have seen first hand that education is the key to breaking a cycle of disadvantage.  It offers unique opportunities for students.  I hope the need for extra supports will be taken onboard and that the concerns of teachers, who have already sounded the alarm in terms of the disengagement of disadvantaged students, will be acted upon quickly and effectively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300039#PP00200"><p>Overall, I am blown away by the positivity towards accredited grades in secondary schools.  The system is fair and gives students a choice.  Students make the decision themselves as to whether they select accredited grades or sit the leaving certificate examination.  It seems to be the consensus this year that leaving certificate students are opting to merge this choice by both sitting examinations and taking accredited grades.</p>  <p>  One school of 1,200 students said that the students were putting themselves under pressure but did not mind as it was their own decision.  One principal said that the cohort of students and teachers were amazing during Covid and worked so well together.  It was a lack of clarity last year that was the most difficult thing.  This year, they felt it was like a tick-box process and they were offered clarity, compassion and choice.  One principal said that he was grateful for the guidance and great resources provided.  When they opened in 2020, they felt everything was against them but this year they are much more confident and happy with the situation.  However, I ask that the Minister look at fifth year students in relation to next year's leaving certificate, as they have equally been disadvantaged due to Covid.  They will have great challenges with the curriculum for many reasons.  There are difficulties with engagement when there is no examination path for them.  Having spoken to several principals, they all expressed concerns about the junior cycle in schools and that there are difficulties with the younger age groups in settling down in school after such a long absence.  Great tributes were paid to teachers for adapting in a relatively short time to online education.  Due to this engagement, students gave great credit to teachers for adapting so fast.  I give credit to students for adapting to a life-time change in doing online teaching.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the fifth year students a moment ago.  There is going to be an aftermath from this cycle for a number of years to come.  The sixth class students moving into first year lost roughly six months of teaching because of the basics involved in meeting new students, and the different classrooms.  It is only in the last month or so that they are now getting to know each other because they had been in and out prior to this.  They will also feel the impact and they will have to make up time throughout the coming years, but they have the time.  However, the fifth year students have a massive hill to climb.  Fifth year is the year they do all the different curriculums and sixth year is when they do the revision of what they have done.  I hope this will be mirrored for our fifth years students next year so we can also work with them.</p>  <p>  Experts believe this will lead to grade inflation this year and will likely send CAO points over the top.  However, I am sure due diligence has been given to the errors of last year so we will not have a repeat of that this year.  I pay tribute to students for their resilience during the pandemic and wish them all the best in their leaving certificate examinations.  I believe the Minister has fitted very well into her current role.  Going forward in this role, I believe she will work with teachers and students.</p>  <p>  I have one last point I want to draw her attention to.  The school transport system proved very difficult last year.  I hope that with the new system being rolled out this year, things will be in place for September because there are many people who do not have access to transport to school apart from the school bus.  I hope it covers all areas including rural areas and that people who are dependent on the school bus will be accommodated in the system and that extra buses will be put on to get them to school.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister well in her position.  I wish all the teachers and students the very best for this year.  They are a credit to their families and to the whole country for what they have gone through and I wish them all the best in their leaving certificate.</p></speech>

Tomorrow is the last day for the completion of any assessments associated with the accredited grades process.  From there, teachers will begin the task of awarding estimated marks to their students, so I am conscious of the stress on thousands of students right now and on their teachers.  However, I think we did the fairest thing we could by giving them a choice.  This is what the students, their parents, caregivers and teachers I engaged with wanted.</p>  <p>  I wish everyone involved in this year's leaving certificate well.  I applaud the students for their dedication in a difficult year and the professionalism of the teachers.  I know that a majority of the over 60,000 students have opted to receive accredited grades and to sit written examinations.  Everyone has engaged with this process and that is welcome.  It raises questions that only 2% of students opted only to sit the examination.</p>  <p>  I am glad we are in the process of looking at the leaving certificate as a whole now.  While I am conscious this Bill is only focused on the leaving certificate 2021, the Minister has said that no one system will meet the needs of every student and I agree with her on that point.  I am interested to know of the plans for the leaving certificate 2022.  Is consideration going to be given to making the accredited grades system a part of the leaving certificate for evermore?  We can learn what lessons we can from the past; not just look at what Covid has done but what we can learn.</p> <p>I welcome the senior cycle review.  An advisory report is due.  I am concerned that the consultation process on the Irish leaving certificate is considering splitting the course between T1 and T2 schools, that is, Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltachta&iacute; and English-speaking schools.  The T1 schools would have a more difficult exam and would not have bonus points attached.  I have had many emails about this from parents and students.  I would appreciate if the Minister came back to me on that.</p> <p> My concern about the consultation that is under way is that we have not had the full three years of the new junior cycle to see whether that model is beneficial.  Covid lockdown and the major difference in learning experience will have changed what otherwise might have come up during this review in normal times.  We must learn lessons here.  Will we rush through a consultation during two years of disruption?  Will we take that disruption into consideration?</p> <p> I compliment the Minister.  This has a difficult period but she has worked with all the different parties and stakeholders.  I know from working with Deputies that she has listened to us because we have been listening to the parents, teachers and students.  I had several Zoom and Teams meetings with students.  I felt the Minister's decision was the best road to take and I know students are happy with it.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to ensure we have a plan for 2022.  This year, all the students and families were informed early.  The leaving certificate course is already nearly finished.  It is important we work with everyone involved on what will happen next year.  Again, I congratulate the Minister.  She did an excellent job.</p></speech>

We accept that students, parents and teachers across the board had an incredibly difficult time during the pandemic.  I hope we have learned lessons from the difficulties we had with algorithms.  Fairness is essential.  We heard earlier that we almost need an audit of the entire leaving certificate process.  While it has changed in recent years with continuous assessment, it is still largely based on old-style rote learning.  We have to look at something more fitting.</p>  <p>  We also talk about access to third level.  We have alternatives in post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses and such but we need to work at an earlier stage on interventions for those families who do not have a history is education and need a greater level of connectivity.  We need to look at our entire means of delivering education to ensure it offers everyone the routes they need to take through life.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on the work she has done as regards the Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara satellite that is planned for Dundalk.  I hope she continues with that support.</p></speech>

They were concerned about the plans or lack of plans for the leaving certificate at that point.  As a former teacher and a parent, I could fully appreciate their panic because of the ongoing uncertainty.  At that time, before any decisions were taken, I suggested a hybrid model, which is basically what we have here today.  This approach gives students some choice, flexibility and certainty.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister has brought forward good legislation and that she has learned from the mistakes made last year.  That is important.  Many of the different viewpoints of students, teachers, principals and parents have been taken on board in the legislation, and that too is positive.  The Bill and the changes to the leaving certificate examination system brought about by Covid give us an opportunity to assess the examination system we have in place and to ask ourselves if it meets the needs of all involved in the process of education and, especially, if it gives our students the opportunity to reach their potential.</p>  <p>  As a former mathematics teacher, I was always largely in favour of a final examination.  For many years, I corrected exam papers and could see at first hand the impartiality and objectivity of the process.  Even in the correction of maths papers, there was always room for professional judgment.  Many students believe the role of correctors is to take marks away but giving marks is what correcting is all about.  If there is nothing on the script, a corrector cannot give marks.  However, if a reasonable or partly reasonable attempt has been made, students could easily get three out of ten, which is 30%, and that is just to begin with.</p>  <p>  I am deviating from the legislation but I say this because I know many students are under real pressure right now.  They are concerned about the time they have missed and parts of the course they may not have fully covered during class time.  There are a hundred other individual reasons students may feel pressurised.  I want those students to know that those who correct their exams are there to give them marks.  Correctors have to be objective and fair but the majority are teachers and fully understand the circumstances that all students face when they sit exams.  I say to students that correctors are their allies and if they can, they should give the correctors something to work with.</p>  <p>  I come back to the lessons we, including me, can learn from the last two years.  I do not believe we can go back to the old leaving certificate format.  I know it is a huge extra burden for teachers, schools and principals.  I know it will require a certain amount of training and upskilling but I think some form of continuous assessment in all subjects, alongside project work, practical work, oral work and a final examination, would be a better option.  It would certainly be an interim option. </p>  <p>  An examination largely guarantees an objective result on the day but only on the day.  All the learning of two to three years leads up to that day. Nonetheless, a student may not give of his or her best on the day for many reasons.  Continuous assessment has many positives but it also has challenges.  If we are to go down that road, consultation with teachers and their unions, as well as students and schools will be paramount.  Just today, I was speaking to a school principal who said the discussion in the staff room this morning was of the fact that every student is really stressed over every assessment.  It is like a mini leaving certificate for them.  All of this has to be taken into consideration.  There is no magic bullet.</p>  <p>  Teachers, year heads and school principals deserve our support and recognition for the work undertaken this year and last year to ensure we had a calculated grades process.</p> <p>A completely new system was thrust upon them and like some of our front-line staff, they undertook this important work with the seriousness, commitment and objectivity it deserved.</p> <p> The past 18 months have seen a shift in the tectonic plates of education, with students, teachers, individual schools and parents making a much stronger contribution to putting in place a system that allows students the best possible opportunity to achieve and grow in the current difficult circumstances.  There can be no going back to the old ways.  Education has become much more participatory and that trend must continue.</p> <p> As already stated, I am very supportive of the Bill.  Prohibited communication, or canvassing as we know it, is dealt with in a transparent and fair way.  The sanctions are very tough, but they need to be, so that people will not be tempted to try to influence the situation.  We all know the leaving certificate is important.  In fact, we make it far too important.  It is a milestone on the journey, it is not our destination, but because of the importance we attach to the exam it is crucial that every effort is made to discourage lobbying.  If it starts at all, even in limited circumstances, it totally undermines the objectivity of the exam.  We must be honest about it, if there is even a hint or a rumour of canvassing and that it might influence the result, it will snowball and create dissent and distrust and do untold damage to the exam system.  For that reason, sanctions need to be severe and we all need to be aware of the impact of any effort to influence outcomes.</p> <p> I am pleased that the standardisation process used last year has been modified, that rankings have been discontinued and that school profiling will not play any part in determining individual results.</p> <p> One final point is that the Minister needs to look again at contingency measures and be prepared for unexpected situations that may arise, for example, due to public health measures, local lockdowns or an outbreak of Covid in a class or a school.  Students may have to self-isolate because they were unwittingly a close contact.  I understand there can only be a certain number of safety nets, but if Covid has taught us anything, it has taught us that we need to be flexible and agile and that we need a plan C as well as a plan B.  I ask the Minister to look at that again.</p></speech>

Its core function is to help students from the leaving certificate class of 2021 to complete their schooling and to progress to the next chapter of their lives.  This progression and transition is one of the recognised milestones in so many students' lives, going back many years.  It is one of the traditions for so many students.</p>  <p>  This Bill, when enacted, will confer new or additional powers on the SEC, the body which has managed and operated the State examinations for almost 20 years in a very professional way.  The SEC enjoys the confidence of all the actors in the education system in that regard but, most importantly, through this legislation, the students of leaving certificate 2021 will be treated in a very similar fashion to their predecessors.  The leaving certificate that this year's students will receive will have the same look and feel to it as any other year.  This is true too for the class of 2020, whose certificates will issue from the SEC, also by virtue of this Bill.  The Bill, in conferring those additional powers on the SEC, allows me as Minister to ensure that we can bring some normality to the lives of students in these most unusual and, on occasion, challenging of times.</p>  <p>  Just as the country is now looking forward to reopening and returning to so much that we have had to pause since spring 2020, so too the students of the leaving certificate class of 2021 can look forward.  Deputies, through their contributions, showed their concern and interest in the education of this year's sixth-year students.  We have a shared objective in wanting the best for all students, even if at times we might differ on how exactly to achieve that.  I know there are different views, or perhaps views that seek to place an emphasis on different elements of the various processes which we have put in place.  This debate has ensured that the points of concern to Deputies have been heard.  I will reflect on all that has been presented here this afternoon, but it is important to indicate that much that was discussed here by Deputies, which I accept was in very good faith, was very much outside the remit of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill refers to the accredited grades process for leaving certificate 2021.  That is all that it refers to, and not to senior cycle reform and other such matters.  On that point - it was a thread through the debate this afternoon, as Deputies are aware - I acknowledge that the senior cycle is under review and the advisory report is due imminently.  In fairness, that will be a catalyst to affording us an opportunity to examine the senior cycle programme.  It will involve engagement from all of the partners in education and from the widest possible remit of those who have an interest in the education sector.  I look forward to the views of Deputies also on how we plan and move forward with the senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Everyone concerned with leaving certificate 2021, starting with me, my colleagues in government, the officials in my Department and the SEC, including the partners in education, are committed to ensuring that we deliver for the class of 2021.  We committed to delivering a choice.  We aimed to improve on the experience of calculated grades in 2020.  We will also be considering how we can ensure that next year's leaving certificate class is treated fairly.  I believe the Bill will deliver on the choice for students announced by the Government between accredited grades, examinations, or a combination of both.  It will deliver a fair reflection of the students' educational attainment at post-primary level and it will deliver their passport to travel to the next stage of their lives.</p>  <p>  It has been a very challenging year for the country and its people and, given our focus today, for the leaving certificate class of 2021.  Since the first Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in March of last year, we have seen enormous resilience shown right throughout society.  We have seen great solidarity being shown and we have seen solutions and supports delivered, particularly for students, through school communities across the country.  The leaving certificate class of 2021 deserve our support and this Bill is a part of ensuring that we continue to deliver for the class of 2021.  For these reasons and with the support of Members, I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300042#SS00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have this opportunity to move Second Stage of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2020.  The main purpose of the Bill is to make a number of urgent amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which will make it easier for insolvent persons, including those in financial difficulties arising from the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, to avail of the legislation effectively.</p>  <p>  A person is insolvent under the Act if he or she is unable to pay his or her debts in full as they fall due.  The 2012 Act established three statutory mechanisms for resolving unsustainable debt: the debt relief notice, which is suitable for an insolvent person with little income or assets, and debts not exceeding &euro;35,000; the debt settlement arrangement, which is suitable for an insolvent person with unsecured debt only; and the personal insolvency arrangement, which is suitable for an insolvent person with secured debt such as a mortgage, and it can also include unsecured debt.  All three mechanisms must be initiated, and agreed, by the debtor.</p>  <p>  A proposal for a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement has to be agreed by the necessary majorities of the creditors.  However, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 added that if an insolvent debtor proposes a personal insolvency arrangement which includes resolving their home mortgage arrears, and their creditors reject that proposal, the debtor may apply to court for a review of the proposal and of the refusal.  If the court is satisfied, after considering a number of balanced statutory criteria, that the proposal complies with all the statutory requirements, provides a better return to creditors than the available alternatives and is fair and reasonable to all parties, the court has the power to impose the rejected proposal on the creditors, allowing the debtor to remain in their home.  This is the "personal insolvency court review", now at section 115A of the Act.  I will be returning to it in the course of my remarks.</p>  <p>  The main changes made by the Bill fall into three groups.  First, there are two amendments to remove potential obstacles to an insolvent debtor being eligible to avail of the Personal Insolvency Act.  Perhaps the most important amendment made by this Bill is in section 14(c), which amends the eligibility conditions for an insolvent debtor to apply for a court review, under section 115A of the Act, if the creditors reject the debtor's proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement which includes the debtor's home mortgage arrears.  Under section 115A, the debtor is only eligible to apply for a court review if his or her home mortgage arrears date from before 1 January 2015.  That condition perhaps made sense in 2015, when home mortgage arrears had become a steadily declining legacy from the last recession.  However, post-Covid, it means that anyone whose financial difficulties arose after that date, for example, due to the economic impact of the pandemic, risks being ineligible to access the court review, which is a key protection for homeowners at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears.  The amendment, therefore, removes the requirement that the home mortgage arrears must have been first incurred before 1 January 2015 or, indeed, before any set date.</p>  <p>  The other amendment concerned with eligibility is section 2 of the Bill, which increases the upper limit in the Act on personal assets, including savings, for an insolvent debtor to be eligible to propose a debt relief notice to his or her creditors.  The amendment is to take account of certain social protection payments, such as fuel allowance or carer's allowance, which are paid in annual or biannual lump sums that can push the recipient temporarily over the current eligibility limit.</p>  <p>  Second, the Bill allows a short extension of time to key deadlines under the Personal Insolvency Act, providing more flexibility to deal with last-minute events or exceptional circumstances, and more clarity and certainty for all parties concerned.  Section 14(a) extends the 14-day time limit for a debtor to apply for a personal insolvency court review.  Sections 10 and 13 allow the court to extend, in certain circumstances, the protective certificate, the 70-day period during which a debtor is temporarily protected against creditor enforcement, in order to facilitate his or her personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, putting together an arrangement to resolve the debts which is likely to be agreed by their creditors, or, under section 115A, to be upheld by the court.</p>  <p>  Third, the Bill makes a number of practical changes to procedures to help debtors and their financial advisers to manage the personal insolvency process more effectively, as follows: sections 3 and 5 of the Bill allow key advisory meetings between the debtor and his or her statutory financial adviser to take place remotely, which is important during social distancing restrictions, subject to certain conditions; sections 7 and 17 provide a framework for a PIP to delegate work to another person working in the same firm, subject to certain conditions; and sections 15 and 16 provide for a simpler, less formal and less costly alternative option to a statutory declaration for debtors to solemnly confirm the facts of their financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  Many of the amendments contained in the Bill arise from submissions made by stakeholders to the public consultation on the statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts.  It was decided to bring them forward in this urgent Bill because of their relevance to the economic impact of the pandemic, to the particular health risks arising from the pandemic - for example, if a debtor or his or her financial adviser becomes unexpectedly ill due to the pandemic just before a key deadline - and to the logistical and practical challenges arising from necessary public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive further consultation in 2020, in particular with the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the Courts Service and associations representing personal insolvency practitioners on identifying the amendments most needed in the light of the pandemic and during the preparation of this Bill.  I should emphasise, however, that the Bill does not limit the amendments to the duration of the pandemic as they are considered valuable beyond that period.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a first delivery under the programme for Government commitment to "Introduce the necessary reforms to our personal insolvency legislation and ensure that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties."  A further personal insolvency (amendment) Bill is also included in the Government legislation programme, published in January 2021.  That is a larger Bill to address comprehensively the recommendations arising from the statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts.  The report of the review is expected to be completed this summer and work will begin on the general scheme of that Bill later this year.</p>  <p>  I will now address the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 increases the limit on personal assets for an insolvent person to be eligible for a debt relief notice from &euro;400 to &euro;1,500.  In addition to this figure, reasonably necessary household goods to a total value of &euro;6,000 and a motor vehicle valued up to &euro;5,000 are disregarded.  The increase is important because certain social protection payments, such as fuel allowance or carer's allowance, are paid in annual or semi-annual lump sums that exceed &euro;400.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has advised that an insolvent person who receives one of these allowances can then appear to exceed the current ceiling when his or her financial circumstances are in fact suitable to a debt relief notice.  Increasing the ceiling to &euro;1,500 will remove this problem.</p>  <p>  Sections 3 and 5 amend sections 27 and 49 of the Act, respectively, to allow the key advisory meeting between an insolvent person and an authorised financial adviser to be held remotely via electronic communications technology, subject to certain protective conditions, as an alternative to meeting in person.  Section 3 refers to a meeting with an approved intermediary about seeking a debt relief notice, while section 5 refers to a meeting with a personal insolvency practitioner about seeking a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.</p>  <p>  Section 4 is a consequential provision that supports the introduction of the new option for a debtor to sign a "confirmation of truth" instead of having to make a statutory declaration.  Section 6 corrects an erroneous cross-reference in the Act to the maximum permitted duration of a personal insolvency arrangement.</p>  <p>  Section 7 allows a personal insolvency practitioner to delegate the performance of his or her functions under the Act, subject to certain conditions, to a person employed by the PIP, or who works with the PIP in the same firm.  The delegating PIP remains responsible for the performance of the function or act by the person to whom it is delegated.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which is the professional regulatory body for PIPs, is empowered to make regulations to govern any delegation to a person who is not a PIP.  Sections 8 and 9 are consequential provisions relating to the new option of making a confirmation of truth instead of a statutory declaration.</p>  <p>  Sections 10 and 13 are important amendments which, as I outlined earlier, clarify the grounds on which a protective certificate may be extended and introduce a new additional ground, where the court considers that it would be just to extend protection by up to 40 days by reason of exceptional circumstances or other factors which are substantially outside the control of the debtor or the PIP.  Sections 11 and 12 are further consequential provisions relating to the new option of making a confirmation of truth.</p>  <p>  Section 14 is arguably the most important of the amendments.  It makes three changes to section 115A of the Act concerning the personal insolvency court review.  Section 14(a) extends the deadline for the debtor's PIP to apply for the court review.  The current deadline is 14 days and the amendment extends the deadline, in all such applications under section 115A, to 28 days from the date of the creditor refusal.  Section 14(b) clarifies that where a debtor's PIP applies for the court review within that 28-day period, whether before or after the expiry of the debtor's protective certificate, the debtor's protective certificate is continued in force until the court has decided the court review application.  This provides more certainty and clarity to both debtors and creditors.</p> <p>Section 14(c) is a key amendment.  It removes the requirement that in order to be eligible for a court review under section 115A of the Act, the home mortgage included in the debtor's proposed personal insolvency arrangement must have already been in arrears before 1 January 2015 or indeed any set date.  There is no set date put in instead of the original date.</p> <p> Sections 15 and 16 are the substantial amendments that introduce the new option for a debtor to sign a "confirmation of truth", instead of having to make a statutory declaration, when applying to the Insolvency Service of Ireland for any of the three debt resolution mechanisms.  </p> <p> Section 17 is a consequential amendment to section 7, which provides for a personal insolvency practitioner to delegate certain functions or acts to another person working in the same firm, while remaining personally responsible for their exercise.</p> <p> It is the Minister's strong view that this priority Bill is an important and urgent measure to make debt solutions more accessible to people who are in serious financial difficulties and one which will bring benefits to debtors, to creditors and to our economy and society more broadly.  The Minister hopes that with the co-operation of all sides, we can facilitate its passage through the House with a view to an early enactment.  I commend the Bill to the House.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300043#TT00200"><p>I welcome the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation.  It is slightly overdue, in that the pandemic has been going on for more than a year now.  The vast majority of measures in the Bill deal with issues that have arisen because of the pandemic and the delays people have had, not being able to meet and that type of circumstance.  Many of the key things outlined in respect of section 14 around the court and going to an appeal probably constitute the big stuff that needs to be dealt with because it has had negative impact on people who have been trying to deal with PIPs.  Speaking to people in MABS and working with Abhaile, it is something they have highlighted as needing to be fixed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  While the issues we deal with today are mainly around the pandemic, the broader context is worthy of note.  The arrival of Abhaile on the scene as a scheme within MABS has been transformative for many people.  Something that I suggest the Minister look at with some urgency is the sustainable future of that scheme within MABS to ensure it is properly funded and kept in place to ensure it is there for people.  It provides a certain degree of security to people when they have the Abhaile voucher, which allows them to get legal advice on whether they are suitable to go into a PIP scheme in the first place.  It ensures that if an arrangement is put in place by the practitioner and is rejected by the lending institution, the banks or whatever and it goes to court, people have a legal standing and are supported through all that.  The Abhaile scheme does that and is absolutely vital and is one of the more necessary things that has come from all this.  </p>  <p>  Much of the debt people are dealing with may have originated as debt they had with one of the banks, such as AIB, Bank of Ireland or Ulster Bank, many of which have moved and sold those loans on when they became distressed, as they call it, and they are now in the hands of entities, some of which are not even banks at all, such as Pepper, Start Mortgages and Everyday Finance.  People can find it very difficult to deal with some of these entities.  I understand that with the arrival of Abhaile on the scene and the fact that there is support for the person in debt so that when they go to court, often the court will uphold the arrangement put in place, many of these organisations are now accepting the arrangement and are prepared to continue with it.  Some of the banks are still resistant to it.  I think Bank of Ireland, in which the State has a share, is one of the most difficult to deal with.  That has been the experience of many people working in MABS and Abhaile.  It is something to note.  </p>  <p>  Many of the banks have various sets of criteria they put in place as to arrangements they will facilitate.  These vary between the different banks.  There is work to be done on this.  The Minister of State said the Department was hoping to deal with further legislation later in the year.  Perhaps work could be done on that to bring some sense of regulation into that area to provide certainty that when people go to negotiate with the banks, the kind of arrangement they would get would not depend on which bank or vulture fund they owed the money to but that the arrangements would be clear and people would know what they were dealing with.  Work might be needed on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and I am sure the Minister of State would acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  The general issue many people have is that they fell into debt and they find themselves often able to repay that debt but, because arrears exist, the lending institution will progress proceedings against them and may even get a court order, particularly if the assets are more than the family home - they might have land or a piece of property - even though they are meeting the repayments.  That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and acknowledged.  Many of these lending institutions are looking at what is owed and what the asset is worth.  If the asset is worth more than what is owed, they will pursue the people regardless of the impact that has on the human beings.  We have to understand these are families in many cases, who feel very distressed and are under huge pressure because of the situation in which they find themselves, often because they tried to better themselves or to progress things.  They might have tried to expand or develop a business they had and it did not work out for them.  It certainly was not their intention to fall into debt, to defraud or anything like that, yet that is how the banks treat them, that is, as though they had set out to rob the bank.  Often people's experience is the other way around, when they see the interest rates etc. we are being charged in this country by the main lending institutions.  </p>  <p>  At the core of all this is the problem in banking policy in this country and how that is to be resolved.  It a big issue that the Government needs to come to terms with.  Today, the average family home which is mortgaged is paying an interest rate almost double that of any other country in Europe, yet the money the bank borrowed to lend to the person with the average family home is borrowed at the same interest rate as in every other country in Europe, from the European Central Bank.  There is clearly a problem here.  When we investigate a little, we are told the main reason is because of bad debt in the past and the level of reserves banks need to have are higher because of the misdeeds of the past.  Of course, these misdeeds were not those of the public or the people who went out to borrow money or even the person getting the mortgage today but were the misdeeds of the banking institutions themselves.  Nevertheless, it is the public which has to carry the can.  The unfairness of that clearly jars with a lot of people and if there is to be a move towards a resolution of the banking crisis we have had for the past ten or 15 years here, it is something we really need to get to grips with.</p>  <p>  Many of the banks now talk of leaving and pulling out.  Ulster Bank is talking about leaving and I understand it is most reluctant to enter into arrangements with people because of that.  There are issues with other banks.  There have been mergers and there are proposals in place but all have the same sense of setting out to make maximum profit at the expense of ordinary people in business and ordinary workers.  The role of the Government in this regard is to provide a level playing field and to represent the vast majority of the ordinary people who are doing their best.  People are doing their best but they often find themselves in difficult circumstances and find they are not protected as they would expect, with the banks and lending institutions having the upper hand.  We need to rebalance that.  The measure here today is pandemic-related but I hope the further work coming down the track will go a considerable distance to bring balance back to that situation.  </p> <p>Apart from working on the issues of insolvency and people in debt, we need to examine the bigger picture of banking policy in this country and how we are going to get over the clear difficulties.  Those difficulties are not only a problem when people get into debt; they are also a problem for the functioning of our economy.  That also needs to be recognised.  Our economy cannot function as long as we have a broken banking system.  The vast majority of people would state that is exactly what we have.  When they need credit, they cannot get it.  The people who have money are given more and more of it.  It is one of these totally imbalanced sets of circumstances in which the Government needs to play a stronger role.  It needs to be the hand that balances and regulates because if it is simply left the markets, they will run amok, as they have done in the past.  Therefore, there is a strong role for the Government.</p> <p> We will certainly be supporting this legislation.  While we could, of course, say amendments are required and that there is this, that and the other to be done, the Bill's urgency requires its passage through these Houses with the utmost speed.  I hope we can consider further legislation later on and introduce further measures to try to rebalance the situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300044#UU00200"><p>This Bill, as the Minister has indicated, provides urgent amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which was originally designed to make it easier for insolvent persons to legally resolve their indebtedness.  It was designed at the height of the housing market collapse when people who never envisaged they would be in debt found themselves in it.  The objective of the Bill was to give a path to recovery for people trapped in debt.  The legislation originally had, and still has, graduated mechanisms to achieve this objective, depending on the level of debt and the nature of the debt involved.  This legislation was championed by my former colleague, Willie Penrose, who had great experience as a barrister in dealing with intractable cases of debt.  I remember his persistence at parliamentary party meetings, in the D&aacute;il and with Ministers and I believe his voice was pivotal in putting the original 2012 Act, important legislation, on the Statute Book.</p>  <p>  Concerns were raised initially to the effect that the co-operation of the creditor was required.  That was addressed subsequently, in the amendment introduced in 2015, to ensure an avenue for a debtor to apply to the courts where home mortgage arrears were involved and the credit institution was resisting the resolution proposed.  Consequent to the 2015 amendment, as the Minister will recall, the court can impose a resolution in these circumstances, notwithstanding the resistance of the institution.</p>  <p>  Legislation of this nature has to be reviewed regularly.  It has to be refined on the basis of its practical effect, or its outworkings in terms of real life and real cases.  Is the legislation achieving the objective we have discussed here and set in the Oireachtas?  Are the practical difficulties that we set out to address being resolved?  This Bill seeks to update the legislation, which I welcome.  We will support it.  The requirement for a mortgage to be in arrears before January 2015, which was understandable in a Covid-free world, is to be removed, which is an obvious advance.  There is no need for any date to be put in.  This is a permanent mechanism for people who find themselves in the circumstances in question, not simply an emergency proposal.  I hope that will apply.</p>  <p>  As the Minister has said, the Bill also proposes to increase the upper limit of allowed personal assets to &euro;1,500, for the reason he has set out: people could be debarred simply by getting a social welfare payment in a lump sum, which was never envisaged.  The Minister set out other changes proposed in the Bill, including changes in respect of the time limit for the application of a personal insolvency court review and numerous other issues I do not have time to deal with individually, unfortunately.  </p>  <p>  Legislation of this nature is required.  Our general bankruptcy and insolvency legislation has been hopelessly outdated.  By comparison with that of other jurisdictions, it has been completely unsympathetic.  Maybe it dates back to an attitude we had to bankruptcy in this country.  In the United States, it is not regarded as indicating failure.  We have seen many high-profile individuals residing abroad to avail of other jurisdictions' insolvency laws.  It was important for us to update ours.</p>  <p>  I can tell from experience in a job I once had that there is always concern in the Department of Finance of Central Bank about legislation of this kind.  We need to ensure we have a competitive banking market and, more important, an affordable mortgage market in this economy.  It is therefore very worrying that banks such as KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank are withdrawing from this country, as alluded to by others.  The reduction of competition in an already overly expensive mortgage market is deeply worrying.  Private equity funds have bought distressed mortgages from banks and mortgage-givers and are now complaining, in some instances, that they have not made sufficient money from the acquisition at reduced rates of these distressed loans.  They express concern that they are having difficulty in enforcing securities on unpaid mortgages.  In the aftermath of the current Covid crisis, these matters are likely to be exacerbated and we will see an increasing number of cases involving people in extreme difficulty.  We need to be able to take further action if that is the case.  If companies that have acquired distressed loans and want to foreclose on the individuals, families or businesses concerned are going to be able to go to the courts to get judgments against them, based on their wanting to make an instant profit even though a repayment schedule is perfectly feasible, it is wholly unacceptable and we must be prepared to legislate to resist it.  That is certainly an area that requires extreme vigilance on our part.</p>  <p>  Issues such as Irish banking are very important for us.  It is not an appropriate topic to discuss with the Minister for Justice but it is profoundly worrying for any of us who consider the Irish economy that we are now going to return, apparently, to a dominant duopoly involving Bank of Ireland and AIB.  The role of the European Central Bank, ECB, in this matter has to be taken into account.  The reserve required in Irish banks after the crash is unacceptable.  Why have Irish banks uniquely to have a multiple of the reserves required in other banking systems in our common banking union?  It is just not fair, equitable or acceptable.  There is a genuine debate over what is required to ensure there will not be another banking crash but if we are to have a banking union, it must be based on equity.  In other words, the interest rates that apply generally across the Union &ndash; the interest rates set by the European Central Bank &ndash; should apply here.  There is almost a punitive attitude taken in that we have to have reserves that others do not.</p>  <p>  There is an enduring debate on the necessity, or otherwise, of a State-owned bank.  On this, I would argue in the affirmative.  Those of us who have argued this for most of our political careers did not expect us to own virtually the entire banking system after the crash but we need to consider the initiatives taken in the early years of this State.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, was set up in 1927 to finance agricultural activity because it was required.  It was seen that the private sector would not build a vibrant agricultural sector sufficiently.</p> <p>That was followed by the establishment of the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, in 1933, during the Lemass era, to organise sustainable State investment and build an industrial base in this country.  Both were later sold off, the ACC sold to RaboBank in 2002 and the ICC to Bank of Scotland in 2001, when, during the Celtic era, people lost the run of themselves and wanted to move to a position well beyond that for which those banks were designed.  The Government of Bertie Ahern saw only an unending boom.  As we know, as the boom got "boomier", catastrophe loomed.</p> <p> We have to learn from the past.  There are two things I want to say about the legislation.  I strongly support the specific changes envisaged in the Bill but we need to be vigilant to see how we can do more if, in the post-Covid area, we see the necessity for further action.  I would further argue that we need to have a vibrant, State-sponsored third force to ensure that the traditional duopoly that dominated banking in this State is not returned without competition.  That would be bad for mortgage holders, bad for business and bad for our economy.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the role of the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  It was a priority in the civil law division of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and important legislation.  I was thinking about our debate yesterday on the Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill and the mechanism for the enforcement of court orders to repossess property assets.  What we are debating today is related to that and we speak about what we at one point referred to as "NAMA for debtors", the mechanism put in place by the State to help people who have got into difficulty with debt to avoid losing their assets or to restructure their personal finances in a way that helps them to retain some of those assets and move forward to the next stage of life with a greatly reduced debt burden.</p>  <p>  The personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, regime is worthwhile and valuable.  It incentivises debtors and creditors alike to restructure debts and distressed assets in a sustainable way without recourse to protracted litigation.  Much of this is rooted in the housing and banking crises, as previous speakers have mentioned, the impact of both of which is still being felt more than 13 years after the crash.</p>  <p>  Yesterday and again today, many Deputies have mentioned the need to have a competitive banking system in Ireland that mortgage interest rates were too high.  We know from the Central Bank report yesterday that mortgage interest rates in Ireland are the highest in Europe which, coupled with the macroprudential limits on mortgage lending, makes life extremely difficult for first-time buyers and other mortgage holders.  Mortgage holders must be aware that the extreme difficulty for banks to exercise their security in Ireland has significantly contributed to those high interest rates compared with Europe.</p>  <p>  Those in mortgage arrears should be treated with compassion and given meaningful help.  The PIA regime contributes to that, as do the Abhaile scheme and mortgage-to-rent schemes, all of which are designed by the State to protect the good faith person who cannot pay.  Any insolvency regime must also be rigorous in order to ensure that it benefits only those people rather than those individuals who will not pay or indeed individuals who refuse to disclose assets.  We know that they exist too.  Most people in this situation are in modest circumstances and personal difficulties, including people with illnesses and people who sustained income loss and never managed to make it up because of circumstances.  Most people are in modest and difficult circumstances, for example, older people with no opportunity to get new employment.</p>  <p>  There are 25,000 mortgage accounts in long-term arrears at present but just 5,000 PIAs in place from the past eight years, with last year being the first year that we had 1,000 in a year.  Why do we think that is when so many people are struggling with bank debt?  Is it a persistent stigma?  Is it a lack of information?  Is it that bank letters themselves are terrifying and hard to read?  Is it the transparency with which personal details are gone through in the courts?  Is it unfamiliarity with the system generally?  One gets a voucher from Abhaile to see a PIP and there is no other fee unless an arrangement is put in place.  People need to know that this is available.  I appreciate that this is in response to the effect of the pandemic and the loss of jobs and businesses.  Those risks are considerable, notwithstanding the economic supports and efforts that the State has made to try to mitigate the risk involved.  I accept that we have a good long way to go and it is important to deal with this in legislation now.</p>  <p>  I want to raise the legal cost structures relating to the PIA regime.  There is currently no real cost disincentive to taking a case or lodging an appeal on behalf of debtors, regardless of whether it is run.  In each such instance, there is a fee to be taken by the PIP, solicitor and barrister involved.  Creditors deal with their own fees.  I would be interested to see what proportion of cases lodged or appealed by creditors are actually run compared with those taken by the representatives of debtors.  There needs to be a more reasonable balance of risk.  The State needs to be careful that it is not simply financing a small proportion of practitioners at the expense of the debtors they represent, with the State supporting them in restructuring their finances as they are entitled to do.</p></speech>

It is a timely proposal, given the times were are in when so many have been affected financially by the pandemic.  People will tend to borrow more when times are good and they feel able to pay back a loan or meet a financial obligation.  They are, however, at the mercy of developments in the wider economy.  With employment becoming more and more precarious, it will be interesting to see how this legislation will affect things.  Many workers have been badly affected by the pandemic and we in Sinn F&eacute;in strongly oppose the reduction of the pandemic unemployment payment.  It will place many households in severe financial difficulty through no fault of their own.  We need a commitment from the Government that the pandemic unemployment payment will continue for as long as it is needed to support working families.</p>  <p>  I address the issue of mortgage sales.  It is wrong that mortgages are being sold to foreign vulture funds and that mortgage holders are being subjected to repeated letters and phone calls from these vultures who pass loans around with no regard for the families involved.  These are real families with real children and there needs to be better regulation to avoid pushing families over the edge.  I am aware of people who come to my office where they are mentally completely stressed.  The previous speaker referred to older people.  Our older people are in severe financial difficulty and this Government needs to do much more to help them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300045#VV00400"><p>I broadly welcome this legislation.  It is good to see that the Insolvency Service Of Ireland, MABS and the Citizens Information Board have all welcomed the Bill.  Personal insolvency is an incredibly difficult situation for anyone to be in and we have to make every effort to ensure that the process is fair and does not put people through unnecessary hardship.  Personal insolvency applications reached an all-time high in July last year, with 239 applications to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  That was a 125% increase from July 2019.</p>  <p>  This Bill makes a number of changes to the process for personal insolvency.  Most of these changes are welcome and some are long overdue.  The value of assets which a person may still have to be eligible for debt relief will be raised from &euro;400 to &euro;1,500.  The Government has stated that this has arisen as a result of issues relating to lump sums and social protection allowances, which tipped things over the limit.  The intention behind this amendment is welcome.  Social protection should never be counted towards somebody's available assets in an insolvency situation.  Will the Minister of State outline how the specific number was arrived at?  Have many cases been refused on those grounds?  Will efforts be made to follow up in respect of those individuals?</p>  <p>  The amendment to section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 allows the courts to review a personal insolvency arrangement which has been denied, usually by a bank or a hedge fund.  This Bill amends this section, removing the requirement that the mortgage in question must have been in arrears on 1 January 2015.  Both practitioners and debtors alike have highlighted this previously.  One would have to wonder why it has taken so long to make the change.  It is welcome that it is being made.  People who have fallen into mortgage arrears as a result of the pandemic should be able to avail of this review but so should others who fell into arrears between 2015 and 2020 who have been overlooked until now.  Many people who have viable proposals to deal with personal insolvency have been rejected unreasonably merely because they were not in debt prior to January 2015.</p>  <p>  Section 16 will allow a confirmation of truth to be submitted in place of a statutory declaration under certain situations where they are required.</p> <p>It also creates a new offence of signing or making such a confirmation without an honest belief as to the truth of the same.  Offences of this nature are already covered under sections 126 to 132, inclusive, of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  These allow for prosecution in instances of false representation, omission, concealment, falsification of documents and so on.  One would wonder why these sections would not come into play and why this provision is necessary.  Have incidents occurred which were not captured by the provisions of those particular sections of the 2021 Act?</p> <p> When we speak about debt and insolvency, it is important that we keep in mind that debt can happen to absolutely anyone.  Covid has really demonstrated this, just as the crash did.  Unfortunately, all too often, in both policy and the prevailing narrative, personal debt is often seen as a personal problem or a failing on the part of an individual.  This adds to the stress.  This narrow mindset ignores the macroeconomic causes of debt and the structural and political factors that lie beyond the control of many people who are in debt.  In 2019, Ireland had the sixth highest level of household debt in the EU.  Some 22% of households are in debt or are overburdened by debt repayments.  When looking solely at low-income households, that figure increases to 32%.  </p> <p> People from all sections of society are struggling with debt but some are particularly vulnerable.  Over 33% of renters in the private rented sectors are overburdened by debt repayments.  Very often, people are paying more than 30% of their income in rent.  This is a guideline which really should not be exceeded.  These renters are nearly four times more likely to go without heating due to a lack of money than those who own their own homes or who have mortgages.  Single-parent households have long been one of the groups most vulnerable to debt, with 27% of single parents facing mortgage or rental arrears while one in two state that housing costs are a very heavy burden.  </p> <p> Some 54,986 people were in arrears on their mortgages at the end of last year.  Some of these have been in arrears for a relatively short duration but others have been in arrears for in excess of two years.  Luckily, the pandemic has not had a significant impact on mortgage arrears levels so far.  This is largely due to the payment breaks agreed between borrowers and lenders.  However, the last of those breaks will be coming to an end in the coming weeks.  This makes one question whether this is an issue that needs to be looked at again because some sectors are particularly exposed.  Any delayed effect on mortgage arrears will only make itself known in this quarter.  </p> <p> Of course, an important thing to note when speaking of mortgages is the withdrawal of KBC and Ulster Bank from the market.  Between the two, approximately 28% of the entire mortgage market is currently up for grabs.  Many people around the country are anxiously waiting to see where their mortgage will end up.  The performing loan books of KBC are likely to be acquired by Bank of Ireland, which means that the bank which provided the cheapest home loans will be acquired by the bank which provides the most expensive home loans.  When it comes to loss-making loans, the vulture funds are circling.  The relationship between borrowers and vulture funds is nothing short of abusive.  While banks have at least some interest in negotiating with borrowers, vulture funds have none, nor do they have any reason to do so.  Their business model relies on evictions to make profit.  </p> <p> When entering a personal insolvency arrangement, people are rightly allowed to continue to live in reasonable conditions, aligned with the minimum essential standards of living.  There is a complete inequality in how the State treats people who were once well-off or those who are experiencing insolvency and how it treats those who have always experienced financial hardship.  If the State is able and willing to take a humane approach towards those who are experiencing debt, perhaps the Government would take a closer look at the case of those in receipt of social welfare payments.  It is absolutely unacceptable that people in receipt of social welfare payments are living below the agreed minimum essential standards of living.  These are standards which should be available to everyone.  Rather than being a ceiling for any State welfare payment, they should be a floor. </p> <p> It is an unfortunate reality that many people in Ireland who experience financial hardship turn to moneylenders.  The latest figures from the Central Bank show that 283,000 people borrowed a total of &euro;151 million from moneylenders in 2020.  The largest moneylender in the country, Provident Financial Group, announced on money that it would be ending its doorstep loan business.  It can currently charge customers up to 288% a year.  Its withdrawal may well expose people to an even bigger issue, that of unregulated moneylenders.  It is really important that we consider the impact of this move at this stage. </p> <p> It is important to state that debt does not arise in a vacuum.  The policies of successive Governments have driven people into debt and, while this Bill is welcome, the root causes of debt need to be addressed.  There can be no one-size-fits-all approach to personal debt but there are obvious solutions which would surely help.  We have to look at the issue of moneylenders.  We also have to look at the issues of housing policy and affordability.  Looking at the information we got this week with regard to people under 35, we can see that there is a generation particularly exposed in terms of income and outgoings.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach for the opportunity to speak today.  The Bill at hand makes some important changes in the area of personal insolvency and to how supports operate.  While it might seem technical in nature, the reality is that the legislation will have far-reaching consequences for those who may end up in the terrible situation of being indebted.  This Bill, therefore, is important legislation, and even more important in the context of the pandemic.  The twofold crisis of personal debt and small business debt is an issue hanging over this State like a dark cloud.  As legislators and as decent people, we have to be aware of this crisis and do all within our power to help people and businesses that have run into difficulty, especially when as a result of the pandemic.  The changes in this Bill are welcome in that regard but there is more that can, and should, be done, especially with regard to the debts of small and medium enterprises and small family-run businesses.  These SMEs have collectively warehoused more than &euro;1 billion in tax liabilities.  Many also have commercial rent arrears and bank debt.  All of this is in addition to the owners' personal debts because, as the Minister of State will be aware, business debt does not accumulate in a vacuum but is often accompanied by personal debt.</p>  <p>  This matter needs resolution and perhaps the best way to find solutions would be through a forum on debt which would be inclusive of all stakeholders.  We should look to the state aid our European counterparts provide to help businesses.  For instance, in Sweden and other places, arbitration models for rent arrears have been introduced.  I am not trying to be prescriptive because there are many models which could be considered and every state is different but the fact of the matter is that Ireland is ranked last in the European Union with regard to the amount of state aid provided to help companies deal with the pandemic in 2020.  This is just food for thought for the Government, which claims to be a great supporter of enterprise while, on the basis of the metric I have just described, being the worst in the European Union.  I therefore encourage the Government to look at small and medium enterprises and small family-run enterprises and to consider a debt forum so that ideas can be considered and solutions agreed to in order to save both jobs and businesses.</p></speech>

I welcomed the introduction of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 at the time.  It brought a structure and a recognised framework through which people could address their debt issues.  In hindsight, however, it is clear that, in many cases, those people got into debt as a result of actions over which they had little control.  We all remember when the banks were throwing money at people with no regard for their ability to repay.  The debt boom was fuelled by the banks and the fact that there was little control over their actions.  Bank-fuelled debt led to house prices rising to a level that was unsustainable and left people with debts they could never repay.  Without going over old ground, when the crash came, it was the banks that were saved while ordinary people were left carrying the can.  That must never be allowed to happen again.</p><p>As stated, I welcomed the Act when it was introduced.  It brought our laws up to date with our colleagues in Europe and gave hope to many thousands of people who, unfortunately, had gone into debt.  There is now a way out for people who are willing to engage with the system.  This amending Bill is to be welcomed in the main.  I am particularly pleased that section 14(c) will remove a restrictive condition whereby a person could only avail of a court review if his or her home mortgage arrears had commenced prior to 1 January 2015.</p><p>As the country claws its way out of the pandemic, it is more important than ever that people be afforded every protection from creditors, particularly where their homes are concerned.  Unfortunately, we will probably see a sharp rise in the number of people seeking protection because of the effects of the pandemic.  It is vital that they be given every protection and opportunity to keep ownership of their homes during this difficult time.</p><p>In my constituency office in Dundalk, I regularly deal with people who are in financial difficulty.  What is clear is that each and every one of them wants to remain in the family home.  They are willing to enter into arrangements with their creditors so long as those arrangements are fair and reasonable.  For this system to be successful, it must be understood that people cannot be left with nothing.  They must be able to live as well.  There is no point in forcing people into living a life with no hope at all.  People undoubtedly overborrowed, but we must ask why.  Did the banks do enough due diligence into people's ability to repay?  We must also ask why the cost of houses was too high.</p><p>When we look back now, it is clear where the mistakes were made &ndash; the banks offered credit without doing proper due diligence, regulation by the Government was too weak and the general approach was to borrow as much as one could.</p><p>We must look to the future, though.  If people are willing to engage in debt relationships, they should be given every opportunity to start again, but I fear that we are heading into another situation where the cost of housing is getting too high.  It is clear that big landlords and vulture funds are purchasing large volumes of housing for the rental market.  This is leading to unsustainable rents.  In Dundalk, one can expect to pay more than &euro;1,400 per month in rent for a three-bedroom house, which is &euro;323 per week.  This is another form of control by debt.  If a person loses his or her home as a result of an unsustainable mortgage and becomes homeless, he or she is no different than someone who loses a home as a result of unsustainable rents.  In some ways, people who have mortgages are afforded a certain level of protection under the Bill whereas renters do not have the same protections.</p><p>One amendment to the Bill would offer a better level of protection to mortgage holders, in particular older ones.  Section 102(<i>f</i>) of the Act reads, &quot;that the principal sum due on the secured debt be reduced provided that the secured creditor be granted a share in the debtor&rsquo;s equity in the property the subject of the security&quot;.  I propose that this be changed to read, &quot;that the principal sum due on the secured debt be reduced provided that the secured creditor be granted a share in the debtor&rsquo;s equity in the property the subject of the security without the agreement of the secured creditor&quot;.  This small amendment could allow courts to force debt-for-equity solutions onto mortgage lenders, thereby removing many mortgage holders' fear of losing their homes.</p><p>There are people engaging with their creditors and they must be given every opportunity to get satisfactory solutions.  We must not forget that we are dealing with real people in real situations.  Unfortunately, banks simply treat debtors as file numbers in some cases.  These are real people with real families and real lives.</p></speech>

Given that many families have already gone through a challenging and difficult time with the banks and courts over the past ten years, some might consider that the progress of this Bill and the Government has been slow.  It is also incredible that there are still families winding through the courts and negotiating their indebtedness with the banks.  They are the collateral damage of the previous crisis, yet we are discussing their situation at a time when we have already entered the next housing crisis.  We have not even fixed the difficulties of the previous one, yet people are now dealing with spiking rents and house prices, 75 people died in homelessness on the streets of Dublin alone last year and 38 have died in homelessness so far this year.  The Government feigns surprise that international investors and vulture funds are hoovering up housing units in competition with young families who are trying to purchase houses, but Fine Gael rolled out the red carpet for such funds just a number of years ago.</p>  <p>  What has happened to this country?  That is a big question that we have to ask ourselves.  A generation or two ago, it was commonplace for a family living on a single income and potentially with more children than is the case nowadays to be able to buy a home.  Today, most families are smaller and have two incomes but are struggling to pay rents or mortgages, if they can get one of the latter at all.  Young people, many of whom have been maligned by Members of this House during the pandemic, are suffering the most in terms of being unable to afford rents and buy houses.  They are suffering 25% unemployment in general.  For certain cohorts of young people, the unemployment rate can be as high as 60%, which is incredible.  There is no doubt in my mind that, when travel reopens, many of them will unfortunately do what young people in this country have done for generations, that being, leave for foreign shores for work purposes.  That is incredible.  We are discussing a society where this generation is worse off than the previous one.  That is not progress, but regression in most people's lives.  Any one of the issues of homeownership, mortgage repayments, rent, the commuter crisis, childcare costs, the cost of living, high levels of personal taxation, salary stagnation and economic instability is a significant challenge to a family on an average income and an insurmountable challenge for most families on low incomes.</p>  <p>  Many of the banks have not done right by families in mortgage distress.  I have dealt with hundreds of people, small businesses and farmers who were in mortgage distress or insolvency situations.  The greatest issue they have been facing is that banks will not do business with them, will ignore them or will have their cases dealt with by ten different staff who are operating through call centres where no individual is identified to handle their needs.</p>  <p>  This leads me back to what is happening in the banking market.  The banking market is intrinsically linked to the housing crisis.</p> <p>The Government created what was, in effect, a duopoly or two-pillar banking system, and that lack of competition has been further concentrated with the exiting from the market of Ulster Bank and KBC Bank.  The more concentrated the system becomes, the less competition there is and the less ability customers have to influence those institutions to meet their needs.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill and the changes it will bring.  However, I cannot remember there being a Bill for a long time for which the phrase "too little, too late" was more apt.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it is a technical Bill but there are anomalies in it that need to be addressed in the context of the particular situation in which we find ourselves with the Covid pandemic.  I am sure that every Deputy in the Chamber and outside it has encountered multiple people who find themselves in the type of situation this Bill seeks to address.  There are people still dealing with the outworkings of the financial crash.  There are people who are struggling with the high cost of living in this State, as mentioned by a previous speaker.  We have been talking a great deal this week about the housing crisis and making the point that the systems and policies that are in place are not delivering for people.  Until that issue is addressed, we will be dealing with more people in situations like those being discussed today.</p>  <p>  We also have a situation where people on the periphery and who are under pressure cannot access credit.  They might previously have had a relationship with the local credit union, for example, that may not be available to them any more.  People in that situation may end up turning to moneylenders.  The legislation on this issue that was brought forward by Deputy Doherty needs to be looked at with a view, at least, to putting protections in place for people in those circumstances.  We do not want more people to fall into a situation where they need those types of services.  We must do everything we can to ensure security for people by dealing with the cost of living and housing and delivering real solutions if they do fall into circumstances such as personal insolvency.</p></speech>

However, in considering the provisions it contains, we have to look at the past.  I spoke in the House last night about how, at the time of the financial crash in 2008, people went to the banks looking to negotiate.  Many people were in trouble because of the inflation that led to the price of housing going through the roof.  The banks would not deal with them, however, and they were just told that they had to keep paying.  It was only when it got to the stage where people stopped paying that the banks listened to them.</p>  <p>  I have been involved in construction since the late 1980s and am still involved in it.  The inflation that is being brought into the housing market once again is making homes even more expensive and will add to people's difficulties.  People may end up in trouble if they have to borrow more to get the same product.  Over the past 12 months, the price of materials for housing has increased by 38%.  The cost of insulation, timber, blocks, concrete and everything else has gone up, yet there is no functioning housing market.  That is because there is no supply to meet the demand of people who need homes.  Last night in the House, the Government voted against the motion introduced by the Rural Independent Group on Project Ireland 2040 that would have amended the plan to allow people to build houses in the rural areas, towns and villages in which they live.  They can no longer do so because everything is being shoved into cities, where there is existing infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In County Limerick, houses that were making &euro;375,000 only six months ago have now soared in price to &euro;450,000.  This is because of supply and demand and, again, that situation will feed into the rate of insolvencies because people have to borrow more.  A total of 34% of houses sold in Limerick in recent times were bought by people relocating from Dublin.  People moving to Limerick from cities and towns elsewhere in the country can afford to pay higher prices than people living in Limerick.  A three-bedroom or four-bedroom house in Dublin could sell for &euro;700,000 to &euro;800,000.  People who sell their house for that price can come to Limerick and put people there out of the market.</p>  <p>  We have seen people get into trouble with their mortgages through no fault of their own, perhaps because they lost their job.  They tried to make deals with the banks, as I said, but they were not listened to.  When they try to contact the banks, there is nobody to talk to or else they find themselves talking to someone in a different country.  The banks took away the ability to make deals from local bank managers and staff and moved the whole process to a central telephone service.  We need protections for people but we also need the capacity for people to make contact with banks and resolve their issues.  There have been problems in that regard for the past ten years or more.  Much of the fault lies with the unwillingness of the banks to negotiate with landowners and people who have got themselves into trouble.  There is a minority of people who do not care about their debt, but it is a minority.  There are an awful lot of people who wanted to sort out their issues but were not given the opportunity to do so.</p>  <p>  There are many people in the country who are trying to get onto the first-time housing market but cannot do so because of inflation.  The problem is not just the cost of housing and materials but also the price of labour.  That has arisen because of the lack of investment in training apprentices.  After 2008, the Government pushed everyone into higher level education, which led to a shortage of tradespeople and apprentices.  We were told there were too many tradespeople but now we are ten years behind in training people to do the basic maintenance that is required in different areas.  That is another factor that feeds into the overall problem.  The tradespeople who are operating are charging a lot more than they might do if there was a balance between supply and demand.  Again, this situation has happened because of a failure of Government.</p>  <p>  We need to take a holistic approach to this issue.  I was very disappointed that our motion on the 2040 plan was not even supported by rural Members of the parties in government.  A failure to amend that plan will add to the problem of prices going up countrywide.  I have to hand 25 pages detailing 63 cases in which people in rural areas of County Limerick have a problem with planning permission.  Since I have been involved in politics and during all my time in construction, I have never had more than ten cases at a time where I am trying to help people with planning issues.  My telephone is hopping with calls from people who know I have a construction background and do a lot of work on planning.  They are scared for the future of their children and grandchildren because of the lack of vision by the Government and the lack of investment in rural areas that would enable us to balance supply and demand.  The Government set up the Land Development Agency LDA, to invest in different areas but everything it is investing in is city-based.</p>  <p>  We all want to help people to move forward and ensure they and the generation after them can continue to live in the areas in which they were born.  This Bill will not help if we do not address the issues that are causing more inflation, leading to many more problems and putting families in trouble.</p> <p>We will have to do our utmost to help.  The Bill goes a long way towards helping but, as other speakers said, it is now a little too late.  On one hand the Government is bringing in this Bill, which will help, and, on the other, it is actually creating a problem and lighting a fire that will spill out of control and that the Government will not be able to manage.  While the Bill is welcome, the inflation the Government is causing under the 2040 plan will feed into this and cause more hardship, not only in the towns and the cities.  The whole country will suffer because the Government's left hand does not know what its right hand is doing.</p> <p> As I said, I support what the Bill does.  It is a little too late but something that goes a little bit of the way will help.  I hope the Government looks at the other side and understands that it has been the cause of an awful lot of the problems in this country because it does not know about supply and demand.  Rural areas were able to do this themselves recently and now the Government is cutting off even that lifeline.  The only way we will help this insolvency plan going forward and stop the price increases, which will stop people borrowing more money, is by investing in infrastructure and giving extra capacity to areas, towns and villages, which will drive down prices.  Building more houses will bring down prices and people will not have to borrow as much.  They can then live their lives and will not spend 40 years trying to pay off the mortgage on a house that should have taken only 20 years to pay off, as it did when I was growing up.  I welcome the support the Bill will provide but, as I said, it is a little too late.  I will, however, work with anything that is there to help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300049#ZZ00200"><p>This is a very important Bill.  I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy McEntee, who introduced the Bill.  I thank Deputies for their contributions and engagement.  I welcome their comments and will consider carefully the various important points that have been raised.</p>  <p>  Families and individuals do not enter into insolvency lightly.  It is a very difficult situation and a difficult and challenging decision for anyone to take.  When people enter into that process, we have to ensure they do not face undue hardship.  We should allow as much compassion as possible in those circumstances.  There is no shame in anybody entering into an insolvency.  It can happen to anybody and it is usually beyond people's responsibility or control.  Insolvency is certainly not an easy way out.  It provides a pathway in order that people can get back to solvency and re-engage with society.  In that respect, it is an extremely important mechanism.  I thank MABS, the Free Legal Advice Centres, and other organisations and individuals who reach out and help people when they find themselves in these very challenging circumstances.</p>  <p>  The original Bill was hugely important when it was introduced, and I acknowledge the role of the former Deputy, Willie Penrose, in that respect.  At the time, brakes were placed on the legislation, which was radical for Ireland.  Property rights are protected within our Constitution.  There were some concerns that if the Bill went a little too far, it could be challenged in the courts.  As I said, some brakes were put on the Bill at the time, understandably so.  The legislation has proved to be extremely robust and the courts have interpreted it in a very fair manner.  What we are attempting to do today is amend that legislation to take off the brakes to some extent and allow it to be even more compassionate for people in particular circumstances.  A larger, more comprehensive Bill will be brought forward later.  A review is being carried out and is expected to be completed at the end of the second quarter, with a scheme prepared at the end of this year to address some of the concerns Deputies have raised in this debate.  That will be an important review.</p>  <p>  I will now address some of the specific concerns and issues Deputies raised.  Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of the sustainability of Abhaile.  I assure the Deputy that funding to Abhaile has been extended until at least the end of 2022 and there is a further commitment to resource the service within the programme for Government.  A comprehensive review of Abhaile's operation is being carried out but the Government is fully supportive of the service.</p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked why confirmation of truth should be introduced when a declaration of truth was introduced in the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020.  She pondered whether there may be some issue with the 2020 provision.  I assure the Deputy there is no issue with the provision within the 2020 Act.  The miscellaneous provisions Act of 2020 was about declarations of truth within the courts system.  Here, however, we have a quasi-judicial situation.  To ensure there is no difficulty or challenge around that, we have decided to include the declaration of truth in this legislation in respect of the Insolvency Service of Ireland where a declaration of truth is being used.  This belt-and-braces approach will ensure there can be no challenge in that regard.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about SME debt.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, is preparing a Bill to introduce a lighter, cheaper and quicker form of examinership to help SMEs restructure and recover their debts.  That will be a very important part of the overall work the Government is doing to address insolvency for companies and businesses.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to his Committee Stage amendment.  I will deal with amendments when they arise on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Again, I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the Bill to date.  There are important amendments in the Bill.  That is why they had to be brought forward before the more comprehensive reforming Bill, which will be introduced later to help people who find themselves, unfortunately, and through no fault of their own, in very serious financial circumstances as a result of the pandemic.  While the Government has introduced substantial supports for individuals and businesses, inevitably and unfortunately, some will not make it through financially to the other side of the pandemic.  That is why these amendments are so important and urgent.  As I said, the Bill responds to real needs across the economy and society and forms part of a suite of amendments, supports and programmes brought in by the Government.  With the co-operation of all sides of the House, I expect and hope it will have a swift passage through the House and be enacted as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300049#ZZ00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  This legislation bans ticket touting and the reselling of tickets for large events above face value.  It will promote fair access for fans to cultural, entertainment, recreational and sporting events.  We all look forward to a time when we will be able to attend a show, a concert or a match again.  While no events are being held at present due to Covid-19, we need to prepare for what could be a high demand for tickets for events once reopening becomes possible.  We do not want to see fans taken advantage of due to a limitation on attendance numbers.  We are all too familiar from past experience with fans waiting patiently to buy tickets at 9 a.m. only to be disappointed to see those same tickets minutes later on a secondary website for far more than they can afford.  This is not pricing dictated by artists, sportsmen or sportswomen or events organisers.</p> <p>It is being dictated by the systematic purchasing of tickets by touts and secondary resellers, seeking to make a profit without doing any real work.  A public consultation on ticket resale in 2017 and subsequent discussions with stakeholders showed widespread, although not universal, support for legislation along the lines contained in this Bill.  A statutory ban on the resale of tickets above their face value was supported by two of the three main sporting bodies, the GAA and the FAI, and the two main event promoters in the country, Aiken Promotions and MCD Live Nation, the Consumers Association of Ireland as well as many public representatives and consumers.  As has been seen in the press, many leading artists and entertainers have also expressed their disapproval of the secondary ticket market, made much worse now that it has gone digital.  Opposition to a price cap at the time came mainly from primary ticket service providers and secondary ticket platforms.<br/><br/>At that time, one of the largest primary sellers was also in the market of resale.  However, in 2018, Ticketmaster announced that it was closing its secondary resale websites, Seatwave and Get Me In, and would launch a fan-to-fan ticket exchange in which tickets could be resold for no more than their original price.  The fan exchange was launched in 2019 and facilitates people who cannot attend events to transfer their tickets and recoup their costs, but not make a profit.  While commercial considerations no doubt played a part in Ticketmaster&rsquo;s decision, it was also a response to the growing resentment from fans, consumers, sporting bodies, promoters and entertainers to the secondary ticket market.<br/><br/>Members of the Oireachtas have been active on this issue for some years.  In 2017, the former Deputy, Noel Rock, and the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, introduced a cross-party Private Members&rsquo; Bill seeking the prohibition of above-cost ticket touting, and later that year Deputy Quinlivan introduced his Bill.  In 2018, the Government made the decision to support the Bill from Deputy Stephen Donnelly and the former Deputy, Noel Rock, on Second Stage and approved the drafting of some amendments to the Bill.  Unfortunately, the Bill lapsed upon the dissolution of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  Although the Bill before the House differs from the previous Bill in a number of respects, it has the same objective - to see fans treated fairly.  I regret that it has taken so long to bring the Government's Bill before the House, but I hope we can progress it quickly through the Houses and enact it in line with the reopening of the economy.<br/><br/>The Bill prohibits the sale or advertising for sale of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price for designated events or events taking place in designated venues that have a capacity of 1,000 people or more.  The Bill&rsquo;s application will be limited to those events that give rise to significant demand or where it would otherwise be in the public interest to prohibit above original sale value resale.  Designation will also make the task of monitoring and enforcing the legislation more effective because it will apply to either a particular individual event or a list of venues contained in a register.  In line with a commitment given by the Government to UEFA, the Bill will also prohibit the unauthorised sale of tickets for matches during Euro 2020.  While the matches are not now going ahead in Dublin, the undertaking given by the Government to UEFA was not restricted to matches to be held here.  It is important that the Government honour commitments given to international sporting bodies as part of a bid to host major events here.<br/><br/>I will now turn to the 27 sections of the Bill and set out what each seeks to achieve.  Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, contain the definitions of the terms that feature in the Bill along with standard provisions on commencement, expenses, regulations, the service of documents and the application of the Act.  Section 2 includes clarification in the definition of venue operator which, we believe, meets two of the recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report from the Oireachtas joint committee.  This section also now includes a definition of ticket package in line with a further recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.<br/><br/>Section 7 provides that a venue operator can make a written application to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to have a venue designated if it has the capacity to hold 1,000 or more and the applicant is of the reasonable opinion that the events in the venue may give rise to the resale of tickets or ticket packages for a price exceeding their original sale price.  This latter requirement meets one of the recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The Minister may designate the venue where he or she is satisfied that the application satisfies the conditions for designation or may refuse to designate where he or she is not so satisfied.  The Minister will also have a reserve power to designate venues, including those with a capacity of fewer than 1,000, subject to certain criteria.<br/><br/>Section 8 provides that the Minister may revoke a venue designation where he or she is no longer satisfied that the conditions for designation are met or where the venue is no longer in operation or has ceased to hold events.  It further specifies the requirements for the notification by the Minister of a refusal or revocation of a designation and provides that the venue applicant or operator may make representations under section 12, and an appeal under section 13, against such a revocation or refusal, or in the case of a refusal for venue designation, may apply instead for the designation of an event under section 9.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides that an event organiser or venue operator may apply to the Minister to have an event designated for the purposes of the Act if, having regard to the nature of the event, the applicant is of the reasonable opinion that it may give rise to the sale of tickets by a secondary ticket seller for a price exceeding the original sale price.  An application may be made for the designation of an event which takes place on an annual or other periodic basis in the same venue.  The Minister may designate an event where he or she is satisfied that the application satisfies the conditions for designation or may refuse to designate an event where he or she is not so satisfied.  Subject to specified conditions, the section also permits the Minister, after consultation with the event organiser or venue operator, to designate an event that has not been the subject of an application for designation.<br/><br/>Section 10 provides that the Minister may revoke the designation of an event where he or she is no longer satisfied that the conditions for designation are met.  The section also sets out the requirements for the notification by the Minister of a refusal or revocation of a designation, and provides that the event applicant, event organiser or venue operator may make representations under section 12 and an appeal under section 13 against such a revocation or refusal.<br/><br/>Section 11 provides that where the Minister makes or revokes a venue or event designation, notification of the making or revocation of the designation will be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>and information made publicly available in other appropriate ways with specified details of the designation or revocation.<br/><br/>Section 12 provides that an applicant, event organiser or venue operator may make representations to the Minister within 14 days of being notified of a proposed refusal or revocation of a venue or event designation.  The Minister shall have regard to any such representations in deciding whether to proceed with the refusal or revocation of a designation.  The Minister must notify the venue operator or event organiser in writing of the decision and, unless an appeal is brought, the revocation will come into effect 28 days from the notification.<br/><br/>Section 13 provides that an appeal can be made to the District Court against the refusal or revocation of a venue or event designation or against a designation made by the Minister, where no application was made by the venue operator or event organiser.<br/><br/>Section 14 provides that the Minister shall establish and maintain a register of designated events and venues, and shall publish it on the Internet or in another appropriate manner.<br/><br/>Section 15 provides that a secondary ticket seller who sells, or advertises for sale, a ticket or ticket package for an event in a designated venue or a designated event for a price exceeding the original sale price is guilty of an offence.<br/><br/>Section 16 provides that a primary ticket seller shall not sell, or advertise for sale, a ticket or ticket package for an event in a designated venue or a designated event without providing information that the ticket or ticket package is for such an event and that its sale for a price exceeding the original sale price is prohibited.  A primary ticket seller who sells or advertises for sale a ticket or ticket package in contravention of the section is guilty of an offence.<br/><br/>Section 17 provides that a secondary ticket seller shall not advertise or offer for sale on a secondary ticket marketplace a ticket or ticket package for an event in a designated venue or a designated event without providing information on the original sale price of the ticket and the location of the seat or standing area to which the ticket entitles the holder to gain admission.  The section also requires the operator of a secondary ticket marketplace to ensure that a ticket or ticket package is not advertised or offered for sale on its marketplace without the secondary ticket seller providing this information.  A primary ticket seller or secondary ticket operator who contravenes the section is guilty of an offence.<br/><br/>Section 18 provides that sections 15 to 17 will not apply to the sale, or advertising for sale, of a ticket or ticket package by or on behalf of a charitable organisation or amateur sports club if its sale has been approved by an event organiser and the proceeds of the sale are used only to fund the activities of the charitable organisation or sports club.</p> <p> Section 19 provides that a term in a contract between a primary ticket seller and another person shall be void insofar as it excludes or limits the transfer of a ticket or ticket package for no monetary consideration or its sale for a price not exceeding the original sale price.  The section does not apply to a term in a contract for the sale of a ticket or ticket package for EURO 2020 or for an event which excludes or limits the transfer or sale of a ticket or ticket package on the grounds of safety, public health or public order.  It provides that nothing in the section shall prevent or limit an event organiser from enforcing a term in a contract for the sale of a ticket or ticket package that prohibits the sale of the ticket or ticket package for a price exceeding the original sale price.</p> <p> Section 20 provides that a secondary ticket seller who sells, or advertises for sale, a ticket or ticket package for a match or official event in the EURO 2020 championship without written authorisation from UEFA is guilty of an offence.</p> <p> Section 21 provides for the powers of entry and search, and of examination, seizure and retention of evidence, of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is committing, or has committed, an offence under the Act, or that evidence relating to such an offence may be found in a place.  It further requires persons at, or in charge of, such a place to provide such assistance and information, and produce such books, records or other documents, as a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may reasonably require for the purposes of his or her functions under the Act.  The section further provides that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not enter a dwelling other than with the consent of the occupier or in accordance with a warrant issued by a District Court judge and specifies the requirements for the issuing of such warrants.</p> <p> Section 22 provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she obstructs or interferes with a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising a power conferred by the Act or a warrant issued under it or impedes the exercise by the member of such power.  It further provides that a person commits an offence if he or she fails or refuses to comply with a request or a requirement under section 21 or provides false or misleading information in respect of such a request or requirement.</p> <p> Section 23 provides that where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na finds a person committing an offence under section 15 or 20 of the Act, the member may arrest that person without warrant and demand his or her name and address.  The person who fails or refuses to give his or her name or address, or who gives a false or misleading name or address, is guilty of an offence.  Section 24 sets out the penalties that apply to persons found guilty of an offence under the Act.</p> <p> Section 25 provides that it is a defence for a person against whom proceedings are brought under the Act to show that he or she made all reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of the Act alleged to have been contravened.  Section 26 provides that, subject to specified conditions, it is a defence to the offences prescribed under section 15 (3), section 17(5) and section 20(2) for the operator of a secondary ticket marketplace to show that he or she was providing for a specified purpose an information society service consisting of the transmission or storage of information provided by a recipient of the service.  The defences provided for in the section are based on the provisions of Articles 12 to 14, inclusive of EU directive 31 of 2000 on legal aspects of information society services, in particular e-commerce, in the Internal Market.  Section 27 sets out provisions relating to the disclosure or taking of privileged legal material pursuant to the Act.</p> <p> This Bill will act as a deterrent to individuals and entities that buy up tickets at the expense of sports and music fans, sporting bodies, artists and promoters.  I look forward to working with the House on Committee and Report Stages, including on any amendments that may be proposed.  The Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and has been adapted in light of the committee&rsquo;s report.  I hope, therefore, we can have cross-party support to ensure that we get this Bill enacted as soon as possible so that genuine fans are protected once we enter the summer.  In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the House.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party and I will be supporting this legislation and are happy to see it before the D&aacute;il.  As referred to by the T&aacute;naiste, it is an issue that I raised in the previous D&aacute;il but unfortunately we did not solve the problem then.  As such, I welcome that we are now able to move this Bill forward, albeit four years later.  While I am pleased that we are moving forward with this Bill today, it should be noted that the opportunity to deal with this issue presented itself in the 32nd D&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, intransigence from the then Government and the implementation of a money message meant that in the intervening years consumers have continued to pay the price in the absence of legislation on it.</p>  <p>  First, the Government, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, after initially supporting the Bill introduced an amendment on Second Stage which delayed the Bill for nine months.  I introduced this Bill in March 2017 with the aim of tackling ticket touting and to protect consumers.  At every opportunity, the then Government sought to delay the Bill.  Fine Gael spent the past four years talking out of both sides of its mouth on this issue, demanding an end to ticket touting while actively obstructing a solution to the problem.  It was delay after delay.  We are, thankfully, here today and I very much welcome the Bill that has come forward.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste said, in December 2020 this issue came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am Chairman.  I acknowledge the work of the committee members on the matter.  There is a cross-party consensus that this is a problem that needs to be addressed.  We all acknowledge the need for steps to be taken to address the issue of above-sale-price tickets and this must be done in the interests of consumers.  The committee produced a report, which the previous committee had also done in 2018 and which, in fairness, was something of a waste of time, resources and effort of all involved during a pandemic.</p>  <p>  I will make some comments on this new Bill, which I welcome and support.  The basic intention of the Bill is to prohibit the sale or advertisement of tickets above selling price.  It outlines the powers that can be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the penalties for a breach of this Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  It outlines information that must be provided by primary and secondary ticket sellers and allows for exemptions for charities and amateur sports, which I very much welcome.  This legislation will be good for consumers and bad for ticket touts.  The crux of the Bill, and of previous incarnations of it, was and is to protect consumers and fans from overpricing.  This will promote fairer access to event tickets by prohibiting the sale or advertising for sale of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price for events taking place in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 people or more.</p>  <p>  We are, of course, still in a period of restriction with regard to the opening of venues and I would like to acknowledge how much of a challenge this year has been not just for the venues, but for the artists, sound technicians and other supporting staff who accompany the staging of any production, concert or similarly ticketed event.  I, for one, am extremely excited about the reopening of this avenue of entertainment over the coming months.  It can be anticipated that on reopening after the Covid-19 period there will be an initial period of reduced capacity at such events.  However, after such a period of restrictions, we can be confident that there will be a great demand for tickets to support our cultural events across the State.  This will create an obvious opportunity for the resale of tickets.  As such I will contend that this legislation be enacted in advance of the reopening of that section of our economy.  This is another positive step forward for accountability in the sector, in particular secondary ticketing platforms.</p>  <p>  We would all have had people coming to us over the years having been gouged with ticket sales, especially where children could not get tickets which were on sale for a vast increase in price.</p>  <p>  Venue operators can apply for the venue to be deemed a designated venue if it has a capacity exceeding 1,000 people and-or the operator is of the opinion that the venue will hold one or more events that would give rise to the sale of tickets by a secondary ticket seller.  I mention this aspect of the Bill specifically because it is important to recognise that this designation is a convenience for monitoring.  </p>  <p>  First, above-face-value resale affects a small proportion of events and it is good practice to limit regulation where it is necessary. Second, the prohibition on the above-sale-price resale can be more effectively monitored and enforced if it is employed to events in a list of known venues.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides enforcement powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant authorities and outlines the level of penalties that can be imposed on those who are deemed to have breached the provisions on above-sale-price selling.  This sends an important signal that there will be enforcement of this legislation, which is also welcome.  The range of available penalties extend to a fine of up to &euro;100,000 and-or imprisonment for up to two years on conviction.  Hopefully, we will not have to go down that line but at least there is a penalty we can use if we need to.  These possible penalties and the powers granted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of search and inspection powers are powerful elements of this Bill and a strong deterrent to those who might otherwise be inclined to engage in above-sale-price ticketing.</p>  <p>  For many of us, when we think of the above-sale-price of tickets, we think of the person outside of the GAA stadium or other venues selling tickets to fans waiting outside.  While this has been an issue with consumers in the past who paid over the odds for tickets outside of venues, there are more sophisticated organisations that buy tickets on release and subsequently sell them to consumers at higher prices.  This is what the Bill sets out to curb and it is something I am wholly supportive of.  I hope this Bill will achieve that aim.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are welcome exemptions in respect of the sale or advertising of tickets or ticket packages by charitable organisations and amateur sports.  We all understand how important it is for some of those groups to use tickets like that for their fundraising efforts.</p> <p>This is on the condition that the sale has been approved by the event organisers and the proceeds are used for the funding of the charity or amateur sports organisation.  This is an important exemption as all Members know how difficult it is for such organisations to raise funds and the exemption ensures they can continue to use the sale of tickets as a fundraising activity.</p> <p> On the issue of the competition authority, there is no doubt that there is a need for such legislation.  In 2018 alone, 350 complaints relating to ticket touting were lodged with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Each of these were lodged by individual consumers who believed they had been charged excessive prices for tickets.  The figure for the first half of 2019 stood at 182 complaints.  Obviously, the number of complaints in 2020 is minimal as a result of the arrival of the pandemic and the closure of venues for public health reasons.  We as a country have come through and are coming through a very difficult and, for many, very lonely time of restrictions.  It is to be hoped that people will be eager to return to venues when the option to do so presents itself.  They should not have to pay over the odds for tickets.</p> <p> In conclusion, as I mentioned at the start of my remarks, I introduced a similar Bill in 2017.  Although was am extremely disappointed that the then Government stymied it at the time, I will be supporting this Bill and very much welcome it.  It is important that the legislation is introduced, consumers are protected and the profiteering by secondary vendors who charge excessive prices for ticket resales is stopped.  The regret, of course, is that it was not done sooner.  However, here we are.  My party and I will be offering our full support for the Bill.</p></speech>

It has been a long time coming and, as noted by the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Quinlivan, there have been several attempts to get this done.  It is welcome that we are having this discussion.  It is regrettable that the opportunity to run with the Bill introduced by Deputy Quinlivan was not taken in the previous D&aacute;il but, as was stated, we are where we are.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not precious about solutions to this issue.  We want to be constructive and work with all parties to ensure the safe and swift passage of the Bill.</p>  <p>  I know that during the course of the debate there will be reference to fans and true fans, etc., but we should spare a thought also for parents who have to bring their kids to gigs of which they may not be fans.  As presents, etc., for their kids, they are forced not just to pay over the odds for tickets for the kids, but to pay over the odds for tickets for themselves, which is incredibly cruel.  Having accompanied my daughter to some quite questionable gigs while she was growing up and at which she had to have an adult with her, much and all as she did not like it, paying face value was bad enough.  Having to pay more than face value would be a step too far even for the most devoted of parents.  In solidarity with them, the Bill is very welcome.  They now will not have to pay over the odds.  It is bad enough to have to sit through a couple of hours at a particular gig - I will not name the artist because my daughter would be mortified - without knowing that you are being gouged at the same time.  That just drives people up the wall.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, parts of the Bill are dated.  Of course, that can be tidied up on Committee Stage.  The section regarding UEFA 2020 and those games in particular reminds me, and others who have more of an interest in this than I do, of what could have been.  It is a pity that those games will now be played in other host cities.  I heard the Taoiseach state that the decision to withdraw the games and move them to London and Russia was out of order.  However, the decision was made because the Government could not guarantee a 25% spectator attendance at the Aviva Stadium.  I do not think the remarks of the Taoiseach were helpful; I think they were silly.  It is not the fault of UEFA that the Government could not roll out the vaccination programme quickly enough to allow us to have the requisite level of spectators in the Lansdowne Road stadium.  If one looks up the road to the North or across the Irish Sea, one will see spectators at games outdoors and at indoor sports.  There was recently a full house in the Crucible to watch the World Snooker Championship final.  The English league cup final had 8,000 spectators in attendance.  From Monday, 17 May, stadiums in England will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity or have up to 10,000 fans.  While others are getting things done, the Taoiseach simply blames other people.  I do not think that is helpful or productive.  It is regrettable that the UEFA games will now be held in other cities.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, when we work our way through the Covid crisis and get back to having attendees at live music and sporting events, this legislation will make a discernible difference.  For too long, ticket touts have profiteered off ordinary supporters and fans who love music and sport.  How often have we heard crazy stories of supporters having to pay hundreds of euro for a ticket to the All-Ireland final or an important football or rugby international?  The same was the case every summer, when tickets for Electric Picnic and other festivals were being sold at absolutely astronomical prices.  As outlined by Deputy Quinlivan, it was not the fellas standing outside the stadium asking if anyone was buying or selling tickets; these were actually very organised companies that were effectively operating as ticket touts and profiteering off people's love of music.  I hope that through the implementation of the Bill we will address these issues and bring an end to these practices.  </p>  <p>  On another note, without investment in grassroots sports and cultural spaces and support for artists, we will not have any events to go to.  I think that is sometimes lost on Deputies.  If one goes outside this Chamber and speaks to the sporting community or to artists, they will say that the lack of support from the State is damaging their ability to develop the next generation of football, Gaelic games or rugby players and is suppressing the ability of artists to grow and develop.  The State likes to pride itself on the artists who have come from here.  I use that phrase very specifically because, in many ways, although they come from here, they are developed and helped to grow in London, Glasgow, Berlin and elsewhere.  They leave to pursue their artistic dreams in cities and countries that will help to foster their talent and help them to flourish but, when they do flourish, then Ireland loves to claim them.  The State loves a finished product that someone else helped to develop.  If you are famous, we want to know all about you, but successive Governments have never wanted to invest and help them to achieve their potential and their dreams at home.  Instead, the Government presides over the destruction of cultural spaces and a dearth of public spaces for the arts, music, drama and so on.  Most artists who stay here and fulfil their potential will say that they do so in spite of, and not because of, the State.  All the problems I have mentioned, such as a lack of creative and cultural spaces among others, are accompanied by a lack of affordable housing, poverty wages, grants that take weeks to apply for and nearly always result in a negative response and astronomical insurance costs which are a barrier for all artists, musicians, visual artists, those in drama and others in putting on shows.  If we want to have gigs, festivals, theatre productions, art shows and galleries, we have to fund the creation of this brilliant art.  We will pass this legislation and it will clamp down on ticket touting but if the State persists in driving artists from our towns and cities and pushing them into the arms of cities such as London, Liverpool, Berlin and Glasgow, there will be no future gigs to which to go.</p>  <p>  The same applies in the case of football players.  What does the State do?  It pushes them abroad to fulfil their talent.  For many decades, the failure of the FAI in the first instance and the State in the second instance to provide career pathways and top-level technical and tactical training has meant that young boys in particular have had to leave on planes or boats at 15 or 16 years of age to go to Scotland or England just to fulfil their talent and be able to make a career for themselves.  Surely, given the implications of Brexit in the area of football, we can invest in order to provide for young footballers here in this State.  That means that grassroots football needs to be supported to recover from decades of mismanagement at the highest level - we have had plenty of discussions about that.  The same goes for rugby and Gaelic games.  If we are not ensuring that these organisations and young people are funded and supported properly, there will be no ticket touts to clamp down on because there will be no worthwhile days out in Thurles, no evenings in MacHale Park, no day in the sun in Killarney or Clones, no rugby in Thomond Park or the RDS, no football in Turner's Cross, Tallaght Stadium, Finn Park or Dalymount, and there most certainly will be no big days out at Croke Park or Lansdowne Road.</p>  <p>  If we want to have a vibrant arts culture and sporting scene, we have to fund it.  It really is that simple.  Too often, people look at the moneys invested but never take into account the benefit that is derived from it.  How much of the funding for arts, culture and sport is repaid hand over fist when people go to an art exhibition, the cinema, the theatre, a gig in Whelan's or a football match at Tolka Park?  That is before one even gets into the revenue generated from tens of thousands of people going to an All-Ireland championship match, a festival or a big gig.  Funding for arts, culture and sport is an investment.  It is an investment in people, communities and countless hours of enjoyment and the public who benefit from that.</p> <p>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that we all missed the arts.  The last year has been absolutely awful.  I had the chance to go to a socially-distanced gig in town.  I went to see the comedian Tadhg Hickey, which was absolutely brilliant, but it was nearly a year ago now and is the only arts experience I have had during the past year.  We really missed the arts when they were gone.  We said how awful it was that we could not go to a gig and have that shared and collective experience, but the simple fact is that if we do not invest in the arts then all of the legislation to clamp down on ticket touting will not make any difference because there simply will not be those gigs to go to.  We do not want to turn into a place known only for hosting big international gigs.  That is brilliant and absolutely fantastic if one gets the opportunity to go, but we need to resource local and community events.  If we do not ensure we have cultural spaces, truly public spaces, such as municipal sporting stadiums that can host football and include a library, studios, cr&egrave;ches and gyms, and provide a truly public utility, there will be no gigs or events worth going to.</p> <p> As outlined by my colleague, I reiterate that we will support this legislation.  It is regrettable that it has taken this long, but it has.  It behoves all of us to ensure we get this legislation through quickly so that it can be implemented quickly and we can take money from the ticket touts.  They do not deserve that hard-earned money.  As the T&aacute;naiste outlined, none of that money goes to artists, sound engineers, or the people checking tickets, doing security, cleaning venues and putting up and taking down the rigs.  They do not benefit at all.  A very small number of people benefit.  I absolutely welcome this legislation and Sinn F&eacute;in will work to ensure its swift passage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300053#DDD00200"><p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak on this vitally important legislation.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for speaking on it.  In preparation for this debate I looked at a very old picture of a fresh-faced Deputy Denis Naughten with my predecessor, as Deputy for my constituency, Alan Shatter, preparing legislation in this area; that was not today or yesterday.  I pay particular credit to our colleague, former Deputy Noel Rock, who spent so much time and effort in the last D&aacute;il on this legislation along with the current Minister for Health.  I share with Deputy O'Reilly the sheer despondency of not getting to a match or gig for so long.  Many of us are already dreaming of the day, hopefully not too far away, when we return to our favourite venue or stadium to enjoy the experience of sport, arts and culture.  It really is a lived experience.  No matter what the efforts of the television companies and very inventive artists online have been, nothing compares to being there.</p>  <p>  Crucially, being there has to mean something - it should mean being open to everyone.  It should not be simply thrown to the wolves and to people who can bid the highest or take the opportunity to play on the emotional attachment of so many people to their team or artist.  I have been going to Ireland rugby matches since 1991.  When England came over, there were always tales of tickets selling for &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000.  It always made me sick to the stomach that someone could put a price on the hours I put in at my club, be it coaching mini-rugby or washing jerseys or whatever else.  A price cannot be put on that commitment to a chosen sport or activity.  That is why this legislation is so important.</p>  <p>  I will point out a couple of things within the legislation about which I hope we will potentially see a little more clarity on Committee Stage.  I fear, to use a horrible phrase, there may be some unintended consequences.  I refer to Part 3, section 18, which provides an exemption to the ban on reselling tickets over the original price when the sale of a ticket is on behalf of a charitable organisation or an amateur sports club, as well as an exemption to the requirement to provide information on the original sale price of said ticket.  We need to ensure the definition and clarity is in this legislation because the last thing we want is a GAA, rugby or soccer club finding itself breaking the law because it is holding a fundraising raffle or is trying to get in some much-needed funds to build up the grassroots of the sport.  That clarity is so important.</p>  <p>  It is certainly the experience of my club and many clubs within my constituency that they rely on ticket sales, be they for international or inter-provincial games, and the goodwill of the national governing bodies of their sports to ensure they can roll those tickets out.  I want to make sure those rights are protected and that the many grey areas surrounding this are boxed off to ensure they do not have a negative impact.  We need to have balance regarding local and community sports.  No fan should ever have to pay twice or even five times the cost of a ticket to see a match or concert, but we have to acknowledge the important role ticket sales play within our sporting organisations.</p>  <p>  As I said, I really look forward to getting back to the Royal Dublin Society, RDS, the Aviva stadium, Croke Park or wherever it may be, hopefully this summer or very soon.  I use the opportunity of the T&aacute;naiste's presence in the House to underline the importance of looking with an ambitious eye on how we can get fans back to matches, concerts, festivals and events, not just in the coming months or throughout the summer, but possibly in the coming weeks.  We should look at the ambitious and sensible proposals from various sporting bodies to do trial runs.  We have heard the news, announced today, that Northern Ireland will allow a thousand fans attend matches.  We have all seen the experimental concerts in Barcelona and how many fans will be able to get to the Champions League final and to Wembley.</p>  <p>  It is so important we use this time to ensure we get people back, because I absolutely hope and aspire to be at a fully attended Ireland rugby match in November in the Aviva stadium.  I look forward to that, as many of us do.  I look forward to ensuring tickets are available through all the streams and no fans get ripped off, that we have a mechanism where clubs and community organisations can use these vital tickets to ensure the next generation is supported and to ensure community roll out and that fans have a safe and proper way to resell tickets if they cannot go to an event.  Not everyone who resells a ticket is looking to make a fast buck or profit; many people may be season ticket holders.  There are plenty of examples of websites where tickets can be sold on or where ticket exchanges can take place.</p>  <p>  We have to ensure that this legislation protects the rights of fans and that we do not have any empty seats at sold-out matches or concerts.  We must ensure that the lived fan experience is just as important as ever.  Sport, in particular, as well as culture, music and the arts, goes to very fabric of this country.  We come together so well when we have that collective support, whether it is for a national, county or provincial team.  It is so important that we ensure those tickets are there, that people can access them, that they are affordable and do not become the playthings of corporate entities and are not abused and that we retain the ability to ensure there are no empty seats.</p>  <p>  That is why this legislation is so welcome.  I am so grateful that the T&aacute;naiste has brought it forward and I look forward to working with him and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, as this goes through the various Stages in the House.  We have to make sure we put fans, spectators and people who have committed their adult lives to their chosen sport, art or cultural passion at the very heart of this legislation, and that there are no unintended consequences detrimental to their involvement and engagement.  This legislation is long overdue and extremely welcome.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on bringing it to the House.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has facilitated my speaking slot.  Deputy Richmond decided to walk to the convention centre rather get a lift with me, which would probably be illegal anyway, so he was here before me.</p>  <p>  This Bill is welcomed by the Labour Party.  We can all appreciate the burden carried by the events industry and the workers in it, particularly those involved in music, arts, cultural festivals and large sporting events over the last 14 months.  If we are lucky and reach a high vaccination rate, I hope we will see a return to being able to go to gigs, matches, shows and theatres, which we have missed so much, as soon as we possibly can.  The human need to get together in celebration of life itself through events of all shapes and sizes, whether these are sport, music, art, performance or festivals, has never been more apparent.  We miss it and its value has never been more keenly felt.  </p>  <p> In that context, this Bill is as important as ever.  The Bill looks to address the blatant exploitation by ticket touts, middle men and online scalpers of the huge demand for sporting, artistic and cultural events to drive huge profits into their own pockets well beyond any work they have done to earn the money.</p> <p>It is a classic example of where unfettered market rules disadvantage ordinary people, act as a drain on society and need to be curtailed for the common good.  The pre-Internet days were bad enough for ordinary fans who could not get tickets, often being priced out of the chance of getting a second-hand ticket by the huge mark-ups charged by professional touts.  Anyone who goes regularly to gigs or matches will know the feeling of being left with a spare ticket or multiple spare tickets due to the last minute backing out of a friend or group of friends from an event.  You used to have to go to the ground and hope you could tell the difference between a genuine fan looking to see a match and a scalper looking to make a margin.</p> <p> It was a badge of honour for ordinary fans not to sell to ticket touts but with the advent of online selling, more and more people have been sucked into the idea that buying tickets for a big event is an opportunity to make a few quid.  A larger and larger proportion of tickets seem to end up being bought at a price far higher than face value.  Online ticket bots and sites have become an ever larger problem with orchestrated attempts to corner whole events and then drip feed the tickets out to genuine fans, to try to extract the last penny of cash far above the face value of the ticket.</p> <p> This is unbridled capitalism in its most naked expression and I welcome the Bill from the Government.  It follows on from Bills from former Deputy Noel Rock and the now Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and from Deputy Quinlivan, all of whom should be congratulated for ensuring the issue became highlighted and is now being addressed.</p> <p> The other industry where we have an orchestrated drip feed of supply into a market of unsustainable prices by profit-driven monopolists is the property market.  Some of the principles of fairness and capping sales prices at a sustainable level might be applied to try to solve the ongoing housing crisis in the country and to allow the property market to become one where builders are incentivised to create and build affordable homes for people and families, rather than one where speculators drive and create shortages and bubbles to exploit for maximum gain.</p> <p> On the detail of the Bill, I note the Department said it had been intended to tackle the use of bot software to purchase tickets but that it now plans to implement that as part of a Bill to implement EU Directive No. 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules, to be submitted to Government early next year.  The delay concerns me as the bot issue should be addressed urgently and to pass a Bill without bot provision could conceivably leave us longer than necessary without appropriate protection.</p> <p> Within the Bill there are specific provisions for Euro 2020.  Given that we are no longer hosting matches, do we need such specific provision in the legislation in the pandemic?  The Bill also includes for secondary ticket markets the defence that they were providing an online service for others to comply with Directive No. 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce in the Internal Market.  The concern I have is that the defence could be exploited to allow the profit of secondary platforms from this now illegal activity, based on them only supplying an information service to the people committing the crime.  While it would be difficult to prevent private conversations through online and social media platforms like email, Facebook, Instagram or other services, platforms and actors could build a business model explicitly on the sale of tickets while turning a blind eye to lawbreaking and over-face-value sales and would be able to use section 26 as a defence to render the Bill ineffective and flout the law. </p> <p> Many of the other provisions of the Bill seemed straightforward mechanisms for application for registration of venues and events.  These designations seem reasonable, as do the provisions for arrest and the penalties.  I look forward to a constructive debate and may submit amendments as needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300054#EEE00200"><p>A number of Bills have been put forward on ticket touting over the years.  There is cross-party support on progressing this legislation, as there was in respect of previous legislation.  It is welcome to see this before the House and that the Government has committed to enacting this legislation, hopefully prior to the reopening of live events.</p><p>Everyone has felt the absence of sports, music and live events in terms of normal activity over the past year or so.  The industry has suffered immensely during the pandemic and has done its best at every turn to adapt to the circumstances and provide alternatives to its audiences and workers.  With so much time spent at home during lockdowns, we have turned to the arts, entertainment and sports industries to see us through the monotony of days stuck indoors.  It was an experience which drove home the importance of the industry, not just for employment and revenue but for the joy and excitement it brings to all our lives.  Arts and culture have always been at the heart of Irish society.  They are tied intrinsically to our perception of what Ireland is. </p><p>When we are lucky enough to reopen live events, there is no doubt but that there will be incredibly high demand for tickets.  Given that venue capacity will be limited, there is no possibility of supply reaching demand.  It will be a prime market for ticket touts.  We cannot face a situation where the only people in attendance at live events are those who can pay inflated prices.  Live events are already quite expensive in Ireland in comparison to other European countries and it is essential that access to the arts, sports and entertainment is available to everyone.  To ensure there is no wealth barrier to accessing these events, ticket touting must be tackled.</p><p>The reality of modern-day touting is not just a seller on the street with a handful of tickets.  It is an international market utilising bots to mass purchase hundreds of tickets for the most popular events the instant they go on sale.  Some sellers are making millions and regular buyers do not stand a chance.  True fans of artists and sporting teams miss out or pay ridiculous sums of money for the experience of watching their favourite acts or players in person, while others profit from the lack of supply they have created.  Festival organisers in the UK face this problem at present with ticket touts snapping up tickets in high demand, so it is not just here.  <i>The Guardian</i>looked at listings for festival tickets on a couple of sites and found just over a hundred tickets on sale for a combined value of &pound;65,000.  A ticket for the Creamfields festival was on sale for &pound;800, where the face value was &pound;100.  There is a pent-up demand for live events and regulation has to be in place to tackle the inevitable exploitation of fans will be desperate to attend.</p><p>In the context of Covid, there is another element to consider, namely, contact tracing.  While we have not yet worked out how the reopening of life events will work, and hopefully that will happen soon, it stands to reason we will have some contact tracing mechanisms by which live events must abide.  In the UK, festival organisers are asked to keep attendees' details for 21 days after the event to assist in contact tracing.  Should we have something similar?  Ticket resale will make this particularly difficult.</p><p>While this Bill is aimed at ensuring consumers pay a fair price for tickets, it would be remiss to discuss it without acknowledging the hardship faced by workers in the live events and entertainment industry since March of last year.  Our domestic events and entertainment industry employs around 35,000 workers, most of whom have not had an opportunity to work since March of last year.  The hundreds of theatres, sports grounds, clubs, festivals and venues across the country were the first industry to shut down and, most likely, will be the last to open up.</p><p>Annually, the sector contributes something like &euro;3.5 billion to the national economy.  It is estimated that for every euro spent on a ticket, &euro;6 is spent in the wider tourism economy.  The eventual return of live sports and events will not be a boost to that sector alone but to taxis, restaurants, private bus companies, hotels and so on.  That is not to mention the boost to the morale of the country when we can gather together.  It will be a challenge to this sector because I have heard from people like sound engineers and those involved on a self-employed basis who have had to sell their equipment to pay the mortgage.</p> <p>Some of the challenges are yet to play out.  Some of the individuals affected have not received any support other than the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, because they do not have a business premises and operate from home or from a vehicle.  That will be a challenge.  Consideration must be given to how people can be supported to get back to using their expertise to make a living, as many were doing for years.</p> <p> The Social Democrats support the legislation but a number of areas in the Bill could be strengthened on Committee Stage.  There are a wide variety of venue types and operators in the country.  The definitions in the Bill must be examined more closely to provide for temporary venue structures and events with multiple venues as well as cases where the venue operator may not be the primary party in making the decision to opt in.  The legislation deals primarily with secondary ticket sellers.  Has an examination been done of how the Bill will impact on the behaviour of large primary ticket sellers?  Regardless of who the seller is, consumers need to know the total number of tickets available for sale by a ticket provider and an accurate number of tickets remaining.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste dealt with Euro 2020.  I did not understand why that event was still included but I now accept that it make sense given that a commitment has been made and people will still be going to the event wherever it is held.</p> <p> The Government has stated that it intended to include a provision prohibiting the use of bot software to purchase tickets but withdrew it on the basis that a European directive on this matter will be introduced early this year.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have an update on when he expects the directive to be brought to the House and in what form?  Will it be brought into effect before many events are expected to resume?</p> <p> While this Bill will make great strides in regulating the ticket resale market, international examples have shown that there is a difficulty applying regulations to offshore platforms.  We must take great care to avoid circumstances in which events open up after a long absence and ticket resale sites based offshore are able to grab large quantities of tickets using bots and sell them at inflated prices without any repercussions.</p> <p> This is very welcome legislation and I hope it will pass Committee and Remaining Stages very quickly.</p></speech>

They have had a tough time this year due to the pandemic.  I look forward to going to football matches, watching bands and listening to live music again.</p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation.  As stated by Deputy Quinlivan, it is unfortunate that this Bill comes many years too late for thousands of people who have been the victims of ticket touting.  I welcome that community groups, sports organisations and charities are exempted from its provisions as millions of euro are raised by genuine groups for many good causes.</p>  <p>  Like many others, I have personal experience of the sheer frustration of missing a major event because I could not get a ticket.  I attended my first all-Ireland final in 1983 when the "12 apostles" beat a spirited Galway team.  I know Galway people have a different take on that team and what they would call it.  If we roll on to 1995, which was the next time Dublin won an all-Ireland, I stood outside Croke Park with thousands of others trying to get tickets.  There were so many people there selling handfuls of tickets at exorbitant prices.  This happens at venues across a range of events in the arts, music and sport.  It is deeply upsetting to see it happen.  Every year since then, I have seen young people outside venues or trying to get tickets online for various events.  It is frustrating to see how quickly tickets are snapped up, in particular online.  I look forward to the Bill preventing that practice and allowing people to enjoy concerts at cost price.</p>  <p>  Enforcement is a critical aspect of this legislation and, unfortunately, all other legislation.  I look forward to the Garda working with people to ensure the Bill makes the difference it is intended to achieve.  There is no point putting legislation in place if there is no plan or strategy to enforce it.  I look forward to supporting the Bill in the House and enjoying concerts and matches in the near future.</p></speech>

Most Deputies in the House will agree that a degree of gratitude must also be extended to Deputy Quinlivan, who has long championed this cause, having introduced previous Bills on the topic to this House.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us aims to promote fairer access to tickets for cultural, entertainment, recreational and sporting events by prohibiting the sale or advertising for sale of tickets or ticket packages at a higher price than their original sale price.  This cannot come soon enough for all genuine fans of sport, music and the arts.  Ticket touting has almost become an industry in itself.  We have all had the experience of friends of family eagerly awaiting the 9 a.m. sale time, computer at the ready, only to miss out on securing a ticket for their chosen event.  Ten minutes later, they see that links are being shared in messages and social media for tickets on sale for three times the sale price, resulting in dedicated, genuine fans sometimes missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see their favourite teams, musicians or artists live.  It is vital, therefore, that the ticket touting market is eradicated for good.</p>  <p>  Artists, musicians and sports personalities tell us that the real joy of performing or playing is being euphorically cheered on and connecting with their fans.  The last thing they want to see is fans being ripped off by gougers and ticket touts.  Performers, sportspersons and artists would be the first to say that everyone loses out when genuine fans are exploited, the only people who can attend events are those who can afford the extortionate prices of ticket touts and the full variety and complement of fans cannot attend.  The price gouging of third parties allows them to make a greedy profit off the backs of hardworking, dedicated and talented people, one they have no right to make.</p>  <p>  Coming out of Covid-19, arts, culture and sport will be a lifeline and an outlet for all of us to enjoy and appreciate much more.  They will be more prominent in our lives than ever.  The ticket touts and third parties must be squeezed out.  I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and I look forward to the day when this long overdue legislation finally sounds the death knell for the ticket touts who exploit the genuine fans of this world.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300055#FFF00500"><p>I welcome the Bill and the support it has received from the Cabinet.  It is important that we put in place measures to tackle ticket touting.  As society continues to reopen and as live events open again to the public, hopefully soon albeit with restricted numbers, it is safe to say that tickets will be in high demand.  It is, however, disappointing that it has taken so long to get to this stage.  It is four years since my colleague, an Teachta Quinlivan, introduced anti-ticket touting legislation to the D&aacute;il, only to have it blocked by the Government.  In the past, Fine Gael claimed, on the one hand, that it wanted to put an end to ticket touting while, on the other hand, actively putting up barriers against ticket touting legislation.</p>  <p>  I hope this legislation can be enacted as soon as possible for the benefit of music and sports fans as we open up live events.  Sporting events are so important to so many of us.  That includes going to watch a game of cricket in Claremont Road in Sandymount, which is a great community hub.  Unfortunately, the YMCA is trying to sell the ground, which would be a major loss to the local Sandymount community and a great blow to the cricketing community.  The cricket club has been in Sandymount for 110 years and the YMCA is now trying to extinguish this amazing facility.</p> <p>The club was developing the facility as a hub for cricket development.  It is vital to preserve facilities like Claremont Road and I urge the YMCA to reflect on its plans to sell off the site.  In my view, the sale of the YMCA grounds is contrary to its own ethos.  The State has invested in this site and the facilities of the YMCA over the years but now the YMCA just wants to pack up and go off.  It is not acceptable.  I believe there needs to be Government intervention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300056#GGG00200"><p>I welcome the Bill which while overdue is a genuine effort to tackle the scourge of touting.  Nobody likes to be ripped off; it goes against human pride and principles.  Yet, every time a major and attractive event takes place, genuine fans and supporters can be forced to pay way over the odds to get their hands on a ticket.  They know it is probably the only way to get a ticket; the seller knows this and will manipulate the buyer.</p>  <p>  Until now, the Government has been unable to take action.  It has come to the brink but then faltered due to circumstances.  This Bill has been a victim of Covid but has now become a necessity due to Covid.  The need to reopen our entertainment industry to people has made the Bill a matter of urgency.  However, this urgency cannot blur the fact that the Bill must be a long-term means of ensuring that fairness prevails for ticket buyers.  It is imperative that this Bill be passed into law but it is crucial that it encompasses powers necessary to cover all eventualities.  Otherwise, it will be difficult to enforce and open to being violated.  The parameter for what constitutes an offence must be clearly defined and not left open to any form of interpretation.  There can be no grey areas in this Bill because grey areas are a haven for opportunists.</p>  <p>  The problem with the sale of tickets for more than their face value is not just restricted to known websites or unscrupulous ticket touts, and the issue goes way beyond this.  There are small operators who will legitimately purchase the allowable number of tickets for a desirable event, and they will do it over and over again, using false names and different payment methods.  The number of tickets they acquire may be small by comparison to the bigger operators but their intention to swindle remains the same.  They will discreetly peddle tickets in pubs and clubs, outside sports grounds and even in schools and colleges for significantly more than their value.  They operate largely under the radar and because they are small players, they remain inconspicuous and undetected.</p>  <p>  Purchasers are willing to part with money to attend events.  Irish people are lovers of music, dance and live entertainment.  A rare opportunity to see a favourite artist perform is difficult to resist.  The chance to see their county lift Liam MacCarthy or Sam Maguire tests the temptation of most.  If it requires paying well above the price, the ultimate reward is considered worth the cost.</p>  <p>  How will this Bill address such occurrences?  How will it be possible to monitor activities that occur on a small scale but to a widespread extent?  The fear is that, over time, the small scale will mushroom and the black market will explode.  The roots are already established and there must be stringent measures in place to eradicate them.  If these actions are not clearly seen to be nipped in the bud, the desired objectives and value of this Bill will be lost.</p>  <p>  The exemption of events being run in aid of charitable organisations has the potential to be exploited.  Charities seldom have the resources or manpower needed to organise and stage major events and they depend on the goodwill of others to help them.  In the case of a private company organising a major event to aid a charity, does this Bill stipulate that the entire proceeds are handed over to the charity?  Is it possible we will see charities being used as a screen for profiteering by organisers who can stay within the law simply by making a token donation to a charity?</p>  <p>  Despite the fact this Bill is worthy and welcome, I have reservations about its ability to deliver the desired result.  It falls on Government to identify and make provision within the Bill for any unscrupulous activity that may result from the introduction and interpretation of this new law.  If the black market is permitted to take hold and the sale of tickets becomes a lucrative option for minor criminals and opportunists, then the fallout could result in serious and unforeseen consequences.</p>  <p>  While expanding the powers of the Garda to enforce this new law is a welcome idea, it must be acknowledged that garda&iacute; are already stretched to the limit.  Garda numbers on the ground are insufficient and rural Garda stations have been closed and left unmanned.  Placing additional duties on the shoulders of an already overstretched Garda force is neither acceptable nor doable.  Similarly, extending the already burgeoning court lists to deal with petty peddlers is not feasible.  The plans to tackle these possible issues must be set in stone if this Bill is to prove successful in the long term.</p>  <p>  I welcome the general thrust of the Bill but envisage that it can be strengthened on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300056#GGG00300"><p>I am very pleased to welcome the Bill, which will end many years of heartache and the taking advantage of enthusiastic concert goers and sports fans.  It will mean that sporting and music fans benefit from a fairer sale system for tickets for live events, matches and concerts when the country reopens.</p>  <p>  Ticket touts have been a scourge for many years, ripping people off, forcing up ticket prices and raising barriers to getting a ticket in the first place.  This new law will make sure that everybody gets a fair price.  It is good legislation for fans and it is also good news for sports organisations and artistic performers.  The Bill will stop opportunists with no interest or involvement in music or sport from enriching themselves at the expense of sports and music fans.</p>  <p>  Importantly, fans will have all the information they need to ensure they are not being ripped off.  While, unfortunately, matches and concerts with fans are still some way off, it is expected that the numbers allowed to attend are likely to be restricted in the initial phases of eased restrictions.  Ticket touts will only be too willing to exploit the opportunities presented by restricted attendances for popular events over the summer.  With this in mind, the Bill includes a provision for the fast-track designation of events or venues if the normal designation procedure cannot be completed before events attended by fans resume.  I am pleased that there is an exemption for amateur sports clubs and also registered charities for fundraising purposes.</p>  <p>  The legislation will only be as effective as the penalties.  To that end, any person found guilty of an offence under the Act will face a fine of up to &euro;100,000 or two years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  Once enacted, operators of venues with a capacity to hold 1,000 people or more will be able to apply to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for designation of that venue.  Once designated, reselling of tickets above the original sale price for that venue will be prohibited.  When a ticket is sold for an event which has been designated, or which is to take place in a designated venue, then the original seller must be given clear information that tickets cannot be resold above face value for the event in question.  Resellers of tickets must also provide information on the original sale price of the ticket and the location of the seat or standing area to which the ticket entitles the holder to gain admission.</p>  <p>  This legislation is very welcome and will put an end to the unsavoury actions of ticket touts who have for decades, unfortunately, capitalised on the enthusiasm and loyalty of so many fans.  It was opportunism at its worst.  I commend the Minister and all who have worked on this Bill to this point.  I look forward to its implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300056#GGG00400"><p>I give credit where credit is due and this Bill is very welcome.  It will stop ticket touts with no interest or involvement in music, sport or other cultural events rewarding themselves at the expense of fans, sporting bodies, artists and promoters.  Everyone can be comforted by the fact that, as fans, they will now have the information they need to ensure they are not being ripped off.  When people know their rights, they can be in a much stronger position.  There is only one situation where reselling tickets above face value is allowed, for example, when charities are fundraising, but again I feel this could be exploited.</p> <p>We need to tighten it up much more.</p> <p> I hope the Bill will also stipulate the commissions that can be charged by various companies.  If and when this Bill passes, how will it be enforced?  The biggest problem in this country is enforcement.</p> <p> How would anyone like to have the golden ticket, as in Willy Wonka?  A situation arose last week with Penneys.  Customers of Penneys may book a private appointment online.  However, slots are being batted around on Buy and Sell with prices between &euro;10 and &euro;100.  Companies are facilitating the slots, set up to allow for social distance.  People are on different social media platforms exploiting this to fill their own pockets.  After everything people have gone through, there is no compassion given to people around them.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  I hope it goes far enough, stops the touts and protects people and their hard-earned money but also for people's mental health, when they need to go to Penneys or their matches.  I could see myself in 2018 or 2020 when Limerick came to Dublin and won the all-Ireland and how hard it was to get tickets.  I used to go to every match with my sons, but I remember how hard it was to get any ticket, whether terrace or stand, and there were people throughout the country trying to do the same for their matches.  We could see when online and when we arrived in Dublin there were people with fists full of tickets for sale.  I hope when this Bill passes the money goes back to the people who have been ripped off for years upon years by these touts and others profiteering, who make no investment in any of our culture or sports.  I commend the Minister on this and will support it 100%.</p> <p> With the permission of an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste a question that I have been trying to ask him all week.  He can decide whether he wants to answer - it does not matter - but I must ask it for 150 people and families in Limerick and in Cork.</p></speech>

I want to clarify a statement the T&aacute;naiste made in the D&aacute;il about the Kerry Group and 150 jobs, among 150 families in Cork and Limerick, that are being lost in the Kerry Group in Charleville.  The T&aacute;naiste said the redundancies were voluntary.  This is not the case.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify if he knows that?  I have 100% information that those 150 people who are being made redundant were not asked about their jobs.  Some people have been told their jobs are safe and now see their jobs are advertised in different countries.</p></speech>

My understanding was that this is a consolidation between Charleville and Naas and they would offer voluntary redundancies and redeployment in the first instance, not that compulsory redundancies would be ruled out.  I will double-check and come back to the Deputy on that.</p>  <p>  On the Bill, I thank Deputies for their strong support and comments.  The question of clarity on the definition around charitable organisations, secondary marketplaces etc. have been noted by my officials and will be examined before Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  As I said in moving the Bill, we believe it will act as a deterrent to gougers and opportunists who buy up tickets at the expense of sports and music fans, sporting bodies, artists and promoters.  I look forward to working with the House during the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill, including on any amendments that may be proposed.  As I mentioned, the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny by the joint committee and has been adapted to reflect several of the recommendations in the committee's report, so I hope we can have cross-party support to ensure we get this Bill enacted before the recess and as soon as possible so that genuine fans are protected.</p>  <p>  One of the amendments to the Private Members Bill approved by the Government in 2018 related to the prohibition on the use of bots to circumvent limits on the number of permitted ticket purchases.  In 2019 the EU adopted legislation requiring member states to introduce a similar prohibition.  That legislation took the form of an amendment to the unfair commercial practices directive which Deputy Murphy mentioned earlier, which is given effect here in the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  Additional requirements apply to the provisions of the EU consumer protection law in areas such as consumer protection co-operation and penalties which do not apply to the provisions of purely domestic legislation.  It is preferable, therefore, to include the provision on bots in amendments to the Consumer Protection Act which, along with a number of other amendments to the unfair commercial practices directives, forms part of the general scheme of a new consumer rights Bill.  This was recently approved by the Government for drafting and should be enacted by the end of the year or the first half of next year.  Bots are used to purchase tickets from the primary seller and this legislation before the House deals with secondary ticket resale.  Therefore, even if bots are used to purchase tickets initially, this Bill, once enacted, will cover the resale of such tickets for a price above the original sale price.</p>  <p>  In response to some of the earlier contributions, I neglected to mention in my opening remarks that Deputy Quinlivan had also proposed a Private Members Bill on this matter and I acknowledge that now.</p>  <p>  Like Deputy O'Reilly, I also want to see some sporting and artistic events being piloted this summer.  We have seen this in other countries.  We are ahead of them in terms of vaccines and getting the incidence of the virus down, and I do not see why we should not now try to catch up with them in putting on some different events.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has an interest on that in the sporting and artistic side.  Leinster Rugby has made proposals that I think are worthy of consideration although there may not be matches left to do that, but I am sure we will find an appropriate fixture through the GAA or somebody else down the line.</p>  <p>  I heard what the Deputy said about arts.  I would like to point out that in 2017 I made a commitment as Taoiseach that we would double spending on the arts by 2025.  We actually got there last year.  That is not acknowledged much but the budget for arts, culture and heritage in 2020 was more than double what it was in 2017.  Yes, some of that is one-off funding relating to the pandemic, is being repeated this year and will not be retained forever, but I still see us coming out of this pandemic with a much higher budget for arts, culture and heritage than we had going into it and meeting the commitment to double spending in 2017 through to 2025.  It is not recognised much and I think it should be.  I can understand why people in any sector will always campaign for more funding for their sector, but a bit of acknowledgement when they get a huge or substantial increase might be a wise lobbying strategy.</p>  <p>  Similarly, sports have seen a big increase in funding, particularly for women's sport and sport for children.  We have massive capital programmes in arts and sports and our national cultural institutions.  The National Gallery has had a fabulous new extension and work is due to begin soon on the National Concert Hall.  There are really exciting plans to replace the Abbey Theatre.  Not all of this is in Dublin.  There are big investments in sports campuses and sporting facilities throughout the country through the large-scale sports infrastructure fund.</p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond mentioned the law of unintended consequences, which we always debate in this House.  We never debate one law but two, when we debate the unintended consequences.  I will double-check on raffles but I am comfortable there will not be any restrictions on raffles by charities or sports clubs because a raffle is not a resale of a ticket, it is a competition.</p> <p>Deputy Lowry mentioned the possibility that charities and sports clubs could be used as a loophole to create a secondary market.  We need to bear in mind that possibility.  We will consider that between now and the conclusion of this Bill.</p> <p> I very much agree with what Deputy Catherine Murphy said about the events sector.  It is a sector that we all really appreciate.  It has given us the best days, evenings and weekends of our lives in many cases.  I really look forward to the return of mass events and major events.  The pandemic has been devastating for the businesses and staff in the sector.  Financial support, including the PUP, is available from the Government.  The wage subsidy scheme applies to all companies with a turnover that is down by 30% or more.  Those that have a rateable premises benefit from the CRSS, although I appreciate that many do not.  The small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, is also available.  We appreciate, however, that, even now, some businesses are falling between two stools so I am considering what we can do in phase 2 of the SBASC, particularly for businesses that do not operate from a rateable premises or that may be vehicle-based.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, hopes to launch a business assistance scheme for the music and events industry quite soon and is determining how we can assist the larger events companies in that regard.  I hope we will have something ready for next week or the week after.</p></speech>

It has been liberating to hear them open up about women's health issues and, for far too long, an issue that has been buried behind walls of fear, shame, denial, hurt and ignorance.  Joe Duffy allowed these women to kick the lid off decades of silence on a topic that needs a radical shift in attitude from our health service.  We know that 40% to 70% of women in Ireland say that menopause is still a taboo subject.  Education and research are central to removing taboos around menopause, informing women about a key life change and recognising it as part of a life course approach to women's health.  From my research, the HSE states that only one in ten women seek medical advice when they go through menopause.  While menopause may not impact all women, some are affected and find it difficult to function in the course of their normal life.</p>  <p>  I seek a commitment from the Minister of State for a public awareness campaign to break the taboo and stigma of speaking about menopause.  I compliment the Minister of State because in my time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and long before my time, she has proven herself to be one of the most proactive and progressive Ministers with responsibility for health as part of the team in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I have absolute confidence that she will deliver on this important issue for the women of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Key to all of this is education for the next generation of young women.  That is why I am calling on the Minister of State to collaborate with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to deliver menopause education through the social, personal and health education curriculum for all teenage boys and girls, as introduced in the UK in July 2019.  This is important as raising awareness of menopause and perimenopause will enable the issue to be discussed for women transitioning from menopause to seek and receive support.  It is clear that menopause is under-represented in what we discuss and there is a lack of information which can leave women going through this especially difficult part of their life misdiagnosed and feeling that they are alone, when they are actually experiencing common symptoms which other women in their lives, around them and in their community have.</p>  <p>  We must support women to lead healthy and fulfilling lives through menopause and we can do that.  We need to provide the information about menopause, its symptoms and its impact, and provide a space for women to have conversations about their personal, lived experience with menopause.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the Midlife Women Rock Caf&eacute;s which began in County Waterford.  I heard them yesterday on Joe Duffy's show, talking about how they started as a small acorn and have now developed in to a big oak tree, and they are now delivering those information caf&eacute;s virtually across the country.  As somebody who is from that county, I ask the Minister of State to look at that as a model that could be rolled out to provide compassion.  That model is there and appears to have worked and they have all of that experience.  It is another part of the model of care that we could provide and look at.</p>  <p>  We should help women to find solutions and supports for themselves, supporting women in their own lives.  This is not just an issue for women but also for men.  Men should be aware, educated and able to provide women support in their lives as they go through this difficult journey.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that the broadcasting in the last two weeks, although I have not heard all the programmes myself and will listen to them later, did the State some service.  I was looking over the notes tonight and saw that the topic was menopause.  As one of the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, I am probably well placed to speak on menopause.  It is timely that we are having that discussion, that I am here tonight and that I can understand what some of those women are going through.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Government recognises that menopause is a key health issue for women in Ireland today, and work is under way to drive progress in this area.  This is being driven by the women's health task force, which was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.  A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the task force, with the issue of menopause recognised and included as one of these priority areas.  It is great that that has happened.  I thank Deputy Smyth for her interest in so many issues related to women's health.  As Deputy Smyth quite rightly said, there is a taboo about talking about menopause openly when it affects so many people's lives.  Some 51% of the population of Ireland are female.  Many people have husbands and partners so men know much about menopause too.  It is great to have us talking on the airwaves about issues which affect everyday life.</p>  <p>  Work was undertaken in 2020 to identify areas for activity related to menopause.  Evidence, research and stakeholder engagement, which included advocates and women who had experienced menopause, health professionals and policy makers, informed a number of suggested actions to enhance supports for women through menopause.  Final actions are still under discussion and development, and it is hoped to announce finalised activity shortly.</p>  <p>  The issue of menopause has also been emphasised through the nationwide "radical listening" exercise, which is currently under way, by the women's health task force.  This exercise aims to enable women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services.  There is a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  A representative sample of 228 women have participated in open interviews and workshops to date, and interim findings have highlighted issues, one of which is menopause.  Through this process, taboo around discussing menopause and a lack of trusted information were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, increased education and information on menopause is one of the clear requests that has been raised by women, and I am happy to share commitments to deliver on this today.  Menopause will be included as a topic within the new online citizen health guides, which are under development by the HSE to meet the health information needs of Irish citizens.  Online citizen health guides will support the current and future information needs of citizens by providing a reliable, single source of information which can be republished across other healthcare systems.  A women's health information repository site of trusted sources will be developed over the coming months, which will include the topic of menopause.  The women's health task force intends to run an education and communication campaign to highlight information on specific women's health issues, which will include menopause.</p></speech>

Her response is positive news.  As the Minister of State knows, the women's health task force has identified menopause as a critical issue as it affects every woman in the country and a spectrum of supports is needed.  It noted that for something with such far-reaching impacts, it is very much overlooked.  Following wide consultation with women around Ireland, it has called for us to reframe that conversation to reduce stigma and to positively impact public conversation.  For 2021, it has called for enhanced information, education and access to menopause information and service around the topic.  The average Irish woman will spend more than one third of her life in the aftermath of menopause.  The quality of her life for these years depends on whether diseases partially linked to menopause, such as coronary heart disease, develop.  I believe that there is a body of work to be done around education and support for our general practitioners, GPs, and health workers at the front-line, interacting and engaging with women who are going through this.</p>  <p>  One striking comment and conversation for some women was about the lack of healthcare provision through GP services.  That is not the case in every GP service but there is definitely a deficiency that we must address.  I am delighted to hear the information the Minister of State has imparted tonight.  It is good news.  Joe Duffy, along with the team in RT&Eacute;, has certainly blown the lid on this.  Following the last two weeks of public discourse and debate on the matter, the women of Ireland can look forward to a much more positive and compassionate health service when it comes to menopause.</p></speech>

The women&rsquo;s health task force, set up in 2019 to drive progress on this issue, identified menopause as a priority issue.  It has listened to women about what they would like to see delivered in this area, and the call for information and education has been heard strongly.  The three key points are: menopause will be included as a topic within the new online citizens' health guides; a repository site of trusted sources of women's health information, including the topic of menopause, will be developed over the coming months; and the women&rsquo;s health task force intends to run an education and communication campaign.</p>  <p>  I will take on board the point the Deputy made about having it included in the roll-out of SPHE in secondary schools with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  Activity is planned or under way to provide the best support in this area.  Women&rsquo;s health will be represented on the healthy workplace framework implementation group, to be set up later this year.  Through delivering this activity, the Department will ensure heightened awareness of menopause and access to trusted information for the women of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The highlighting of women&rsquo;s health is overdue and is much welcomed.  I compliment the Joe Duffy programme for highlighting this issue and giving women the forum that they needed to talk to other people.  As I was travelling yesterday, there was a doctor on the radio who was able to answer some really significant questions.</p> <p>For some of the women, it was the first time they had ever aired or spoken about this subject in public.  I am very happy to work with the Deputies to get this over the line.</p></speech>

I raised this issue in the previous D&aacute;il whenever I could and I also raised it with the T&aacute;naiste last week.  There seems to be a problem in our hospital.  One always knows there is a big problem when the nurses ask for someone to do something.  They have asked the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to do an inspection.  I reiterate my support for that call.  That needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  There is an ongoing crisis with trolleys and waiting.  Everyone tells me that once they get through the emergency department and into the hospital, the staff are fantastic and that they get a very good service.  They are very pleased with that but families are being put under stress.  The past year has been very difficult for people.  As a result of Covid, families cannot visit or be with people in the hospitals.</p>  <p>  I want to put some information on the record.  The figures this year are stark.  In January, there were 949 people on trolleys in the middle of a pandemic; 914 in February; 1,059 in March; 1,020 in April; and 420 in May to date.  This is off the scale, even compared to last year when many people did not go to the emergency department because of the pandemic.  Today might be considered a good day in that only 35 people are on trolleys but that is 35 families who were affected.  One day last week, there were 75 people on trolleys.  </p>  <p>  We need an intervention.  A modular unit was recently opened.  It was supposed to be a panacea that would help fix the issue.  It did not do so.  We did not expect it to.  There is a 96-bed unit in progress.  We need to know where it is at.  Is it going to be expedited?  We were all shocked to hear the HSE's recent statement that only half of those beds would be delivered, rather than 96 new beds.  We need to make sure we get the 96 new beds.  The amalgamation of the three hospitals, those in Nenagh, Ennis and Limerick, is at the root of this problem, which has been ongoing for a number of years.  It needs to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300060#MMM00600"><p>I want to address two aspects.  The Minister of State will probably be aware that we have had consistently high trolley numbers in Limerick over the recent period.  There is an historic issue.  There was a consultant's report from Teamwork a number of years ago, which stated that we should get at least 138 additional beds.  To date, we have got approximately 98 additional beds, including a 60-bed modular block.  These are all single-person bedrooms, which makes them very important in the fight against the Covid virus.  They certainly kept the incidence rate in the hospital and, by extension, the rate among people in Limerick, down.  What plans have been put in place to reduce the number of people on trolleys, which has been, on average, 54 this month?  Planning permission for a 96-bed block has been granted to the HSE.  The project is due to go out to tender and a preferred bidder will probably be in place by the end of the year.  We must ensure this is approved by the HSE board and included in the Government's capital programme so that we can start to build next year with a view to completion by early 2024.  Will the Minister of State give us an update on the status of that 96-bed block so that we can reach that critical number of 136 or more?  I believe we need more because of Covid and because of the correct move away from Nightingale wards towards single-bed rooms, such as exist in the 60-bed block.  This four-storey block of 96 acute beds is to be built over the existing dialysis unit in the hospital.  Will the Minister of State give us an update on that?  We want to see not only the 98 beds, including the 60-bed block, but also this 96-bed block being built as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I have heard both Deputies raise similar issues on many occasions.  I acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency departments cause to patients, their families, and the front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  I also acknowledge the work of staff and their commitment to ensuring the uninterrupted provision of emergency care throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The emergency department at UHL is one of the busiest emergency departments in the country, with 65,824 presentations in 2020.  As both Deputies have mentioned, over the past number of weeks, the hospital has experienced considerable demand for inpatient beds.  This is attributed to a sharp increase in overall emergency department attendance, particularly among those aged over 75 who present with higher acuity, and to increased lengths of hospital stay.  The number of presentations between January and April this year was 22,202, an increase of 10.1% on the same period last year.  The attendance of those over 75 has increased by 16%.</p>  <p>  Additionally, while attendance and admission numbers have now returned to pre-pandemic levels, the continued requirement to provide separate Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways presents an additional challenge to patient flow in all hospitals, including UHL.</p>  <p>  The winter plan provided several hospital avoidance measures to support UHL.  These include the appointment of a dementia adviser, recruitment for enhanced community care in the south of the city and west Limerick and additional capacity in Nenagh and Croom hospitals.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that acute bed capacity shortages in the mid-west are a major contributor to overcrowding at the emergency department in UHL.  The provision of 98 additional beds in the hospital over the past year has been a significant step in addressing this.  These include a new 60-bed modular ward block, providing modern, single-room inpatient accommodation.  As well as improving patient experience in terms of comfort, privacy, and dignity, it also improves infection prevention and control capabilities, including better isolation of patients, where necessary.  The remaining 38 beds were provided through the completion of two separate rapid-build projects delivered under the Government national action plan in response to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Both Deputies asked about the 96-bed replacement ward.  I am pleased that funding has been provided in the 2021 HSE capital plan for a 96-bed replacement ward block at UHL.  Following receipt of the final grant of planning permission in early March 2021, the design team have now commenced detailed design and preparation of the procurement documents for this development.  It is planned to have the project tendered and a preferred contractor selected by the end of 2021.  The construction period from contractor appointment will be approximately 18 months.  As we know, all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages in line with the public spending code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement, before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.</p></speech>

I will come back on the 96-bed unit.  Our concern is that the HSE recently told us that there will not be 96 additional beds, but 48.  This will not address the problem we have.  Unfortunately, there are more than 48 people on trolleys in UHL every day, which is a national scandal.  I agree with the call from the INMO for HIQA to investigate the hospital.  That should be done as a matter of urgency.  I thank all the staff in the hospital, who have done a really good job.  I refer to the consultants, the nurses, the porters, the kitchen staff and everybody else in that hospital.  Unfortunately, I have family members there myself.  It is very difficult for families.  We cannot continue like this.  We cannot continue having to come into the D&aacute;il every week to talk about a service that should be delivered to everybody.  Everybody is equal but there is a sense in the mid-west that we are not equal.  The three hospitals announced the other day are to be situated in Galway, Cork and Dublin.  Limerick was forgotten about again.  There was no vaccination centre in Limerick; it was in the Radisson Hotel in Clare.  The new one is to be located in Patrickswell, which is welcome but, again, Limerick feels left out.  I hope this will be addressed.</p></speech>

I seek clarification of a number of points.  First, after the 96-bed block has gone to tender and the preferred bidder is in place, will the Government support its approval by the HSE board?  We can get that block started in January and then built.  It will be a significant build of 18 months of thereabouts.  Second, will a plan be put in place now to determine how to reduce the number of people on trolleys?  This month's average of 54 is too high.  In that context, I acknowledge the fantastic work being done under difficult circumstances by the staff at UHL.  People get great care there.</p>  <p>  Our region has an historical issue.  The 60-bed block has made a major difference, as has the 38-bed block, but we need the 96-bed block.  We may even need further beds in future, but the 96-bed block must be got under way as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

To be clear, Project Ireland 2040 includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at UHL.  Funding for this design work has been provided for in the 2021 HSE capital plan.  Following receipt of planning permission in early March, the design team has commenced work on the detailed design and preparation of the procurement documents for the development.  The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work with local hospital management to improve the patient experience in UHL further.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that the national development plan provides for the recommended 2,590 additional beds.  Compared with the number of beds available at the end of 2019, an additional 834 beds have been provided on a permanent basis.  The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to continuing investment in our healthcare services in line with the recommendations of the health service capacity review.</p>  <p>  I will take the Deputies' comments on board.  It is no secret that University Hospital Limerick has been plagued for a long time with a large number of people on trolleys.  We hear about it in the House on a weekly basis.  The provision of the 96-bed replacement ward will make a significant difference.  As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, though, it must happen very quickly.  I will bring the Deputies' concerns to the Minister.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the courtesy of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in alerting me to his inability to take this matter, for which he has a good reason.</p>  <p>  I voted against the programme for Government last year.  I stood alone on the issue of strategic housing developments, SHDs, having witnessed their impact on my constituency, including their lack of democratic input and transparency and the fact that they so easily ignore and override local area plans and county development plans.  As the Ceann Comhairle well knows, county development plans are arrived at by democratic agreement following what is usually 99 weeks of extensive public consultation and engagement and are approved by locally elected public representatives who have, by the end of the 99 weeks, attained a solid sense of what their communities can bear, taking into account national imperatives around housing needs.</p>  <p>  The recent furore around investment funds seemed to surprise people, yet the first such bulk buy that I witnessed was of the former Notre Dame convent site in south Dublin.  Young couples had eagerly placed their names on the list for apartments to buy in the development only to be told when the apartments were completed that none of them was to go for sale on the open market and that all of them would be rented.  That must be close to four years ago.  I believe it was an Irish pension fund that invested in them.</p>  <p>  Strategic housing developments are a tantalising prospect for investment funds.  We now see that some of them are applying the same rules to residential developments as they have applied to commercial developments for many years, leaving vacant units lying idle rather than reducing their rents in order to maintain the capital value of those units over time and keeping local rents high to boot.</p>  <p>  From 2019, I witnessed the torrent of young adults returning, quite literally in their droves, to their family homes.  No matter how loving the welcome or how secure the tenure offered by their parents, being forced to return home to live with one's folks because one cannot afford rents is humiliating and embarrassing, strong emotions that, if left unresponded to, will surely manifest in individual and public anger eventually.</p>  <p>  The journalist, Mr. Killian Woods, wrote extensively at the time of the introduction of SHDs about how developers had pulled the wool over the eyes of officials and the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who were sold on the concept lock, stock and barrel because SHDs promised fast-track planning.  However, half of the permissions granted in 2018 and 2019, never mind in later years, have not been acted on and no ground has been broken on them.</p>  <p>  Disturbingly, it is not only apartment developments that are now subject to either SHDs or bulk buying in my constituency, but even housing estates are becoming build-to-rents at colossal rents.  One such estate is White Pines on Stocking Avenue.  Twenty SHDs are in the system for Tallaght, the most famous locally being the Cosgrave lands in Knocklyon, where almost 600 apartments will be built to rent close by mature residential estates housing the very same young adults who have been forced home to live because they cannot afford market rents.  The worst example that I have heard of was of a 60-year-old woman who had returned to live with her 80-year-old mother because she could not afford a rental in Dublin.</p>  <p>  Investment funds have a place in the modern building environment but they have begun to dominate it in my constituency.</p></speech>

The primary purpose of the SHD arrangements was to speed up the planning decision-making process, thereby providing greater planning certainty for developers in terms of the timelines within which proposals for such developments could be determined, while fully respecting the statutory requirements for public consultation in respect of such proposals.</p>  <p>  The SHD arrangements have been successful in delivering on this objective, resulting up to the end of March in the granting of planning permission in respect of 49,291 housing units, comprising 12,991 houses, 27,816 apartments and 8,484 build-to-rent properties, as well as 769 shared accommodation units and 12,173 student bed spaces.  In particular, the number of apartments approved annually under the SHD arrangements trebled in the period from 2017 to 2020.</p>  <p>  SHDs are, by their nature, developments of at least 100 units.  The financing of large-scale developments and the viability of apartment development in urban areas are challenging.  This is an area where investment funds can, and do, play a role to enable investment and promote viability.  This represents additionality in terms of supply, which would not otherwise have come forward for rent or purchase.  Enabling development at scale in urban areas, particularly of apartments, is key to ensuring that we meet the need for housing in the coming years, which we know is likely to be around 33,000 dwellings per year.</p>  <p>  However, the Government shares the concerns expressed widely regarding the purchase by investment funds of traditional houses that might otherwise have been sold to ordinary families.  The Government has clearly signalled that they should not be competing with first-time buyers and it has committed to proposing as a matter of urgency appropriate solutions through a mix of planning and taxation or related measures to ensure that the pathway to home ownership is protected in low-density suburban developments and enabled in high-density apartment developments.</p> <p>The Government will take steps to deal with this issue and the relevant Ministers are working on proposals in that regard.<br/><br/>I note the points raised by the Deputy in terms of the impact on his constituency, particularly in Tallaght.  There probably are some unforeseen consequences of what were intended to be good provisions.  Good legislation can sometimes have unintended consequences.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to acknowledge the focus and motivation of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in this area.  I commend his incredible energy in addressing his portfolio.</p><p>This issue is worthy of interrogation.  The Minister of State pointed out in his reply that the arrangements for SHDs apply for a limited period.  One of the reasons I voted against the programme for Government was the inclusion of provision for SHDs, although Fianna F&aacute;il has succeeded in ensuring the limited time extension will lapse on 31 December this year.  The problem is that this time limit accelerated the rate of SHD activity.  Developers know the scheme is coming to an end in December and have piled on the applications.  Half of the permissions granted have not been acted on.  If a developer gets planning permission via a SHD for 1,000 units, there is a huge increase in the value of the land to which the application pertains.  The Minister of State said that permission has been given for more than 27,000 apartments.  How many of them have been built?  The number of planning permissions granted for apartments has tripled but, as I said, only half of the developments that were given permission since 2018 or 2019 have been built.</p><p>My concern is that the rents being charged on these apartments leave absolutely no saving room for those who rent them if they want to move on and buy their own homes.  That is assuming they can afford the rent.  In my constituency, people are looking at paying approximately &euro;2,000 per month.  In addition, as I keep saying, these apartments are being built adjacent to housing estates where young people have returned in droves to live in their family homes because they cannot afford current rents.  As Killian Woods recently pointed out in the <i>Business Post</i>, vacant apartments in these new blocks will be left idle rather than let at a lower rate in order to protect the ongoing capital value of the entire development.  We have seen the same thing happen with shopping centres and other commercial developments for a number of years.  Rather than reduce the rents, the funds are leaving the apartments idle or, in some cases, as we are learning from Killian Woods, they are offering incentives for tenants to rent them.</p></speech>

He highlighted in his opening comments a lack of transparency and public engagement around SHDs, which he described as "a tantalising prospect" for development funds and a cause of inflated rents.  They have undoubtedly had a distorting impact on the housing market.  I take on board the point that putting a deadline into the legislation at the outset has perhaps led to a rush of applications for SHDs.  However, viability in the housing sector remains a very significant issue.  Any combination of planning and taxation measures to support home ownership in lower density types of developments must be balanced and proportionate, while remaining cognisant of the ongoing viability issues.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, recently brought to Cabinet measures that will increase Part V provision from 10% to 20% and include affordable-purchase housing as well as social housing.  That will prevent investment funds from snapping up entire developments.  We will also continue to prioritise the range of measures that are in place to increase supply and support first-time buyers to take their first step onto the property ladder.  The SHD arrangements are being extended to 25 February 2022, after which they will expire.  Work is ongoing on the development of new legislative proposals for the wind-up of the current SHD arrangements and dealing with the submission of large-scale housing planning applications, including student accommodation, to local planning authorities.  It is intended to publish the general scheme of a Bill for this purpose as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Another innocent life has been taken, that of Aoibheann Duffy, an 11-year-old girl from County Kerry who was out for a cycle on a summer evening near her home.  We have failed this young girl and her family.  We have failed in our duty of care towards people living in rural areas.  We have failed because we are willing to tolerate roads that are simply no longer safe for the people living along them.</p>  <p>  This is a relatively recent phenomenon.  It is only in the past 20 or 30 years that our rural roads have become the sole preserve of the car, van and truck.  Before that, our roadways were shared and people could, and did, walk and cycle safely on them.  Vehicles have got bigger and faster and roads have been widened and designed for speed to the extent that many families are locked inside their front gates, unable to go anywhere unless they do so by car.  We have made people in rural Ireland more dependent than ever on cars, with all the dire health and social impacts that go with that.  In our towns and cities, we have rightly adopted a hierarchy of road users when we design roads.  This hierarchy states that we must satisfy the needs of the most vulnerable first.  The order of priority goes from the most vulnerable road user to the least vulnerable.  In rural Ireland, perversely, we have, in effect, inversed that hierarchy and it is the fast, powerful vehicle that dominates.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has a commitment to active travel and to the health and environmental benefits that travelling under one's own steam brings.  He and his colleagues, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, have been starting a revolution in active travel, with unprecedented investment in walking and cycling infrastructure, safe routes to schools and greenways in rural areas.  We need to give more attention to our rural roads.  Cycling and walking are not solely urban activities.  We must afford everyone the opportunity to get the exercise they need to stay healthy.  In addition, not everyone wants to, or can, use a car for all their daily mobility needs.  Making our rural roads safer to walk and cycle on is the fair and right thing to do for our environment, our health and our society.</p>  <p>  We can do more to stop families from experiencing the preventable death of a child on the roads.  I want to extend my sympathies to the Duffy family in Kerry and, indeed, to all the families who have lost loved ones in road accidents.  One of my own family members was killed by a driver while cycling and I know the hurt and pain of such a loss can persist for decades.  In the Netherlands, an active travel revolution was started in the 1970s with the call to "Stop de Kindermoord", which means "stop the child murder".  This past year has demonstrated the capacity of the State to act to prevent premature deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.  We have stayed at home, worn masks and kept our distance.  We do not have to shut down our economy to prevent children from dying on the roads of rural Ireland.  We just need to stop, think of the unbearable grief suffered by families and demonstrate the same capacity for action to prevent the premature deaths of children in road accidents.</p></speech>

First, I take this opportunity, on behalf of both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, to express our deepest sympathies to the family of Aoibheann Duffy, who was killed in a collision near Abbeydorney on Monday night.  Any death on the road is a death too many but we can all agree that the loss of a young child - in this case, only 11 years of age - is desperately sad.</p>  <p>  I understand Aoibheann was cycling near her home on Monday when she was struck by a van.  This has become an all too familiar story on our roads, particularly in rural Ireland, as Deputy Leddin outlined.  While we have made remarkable progress in the field of road safety over the past 20 years and fatalities on Irish roads have reduced dramatically since we first started following a strategic approach to road safety in 1998, deaths and serious injuries among vulnerable road users remain a serious concern.  The next road safety strategy, which will run from 2021 to 2030, is being prepared by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the programme for Government has committed to focusing the new strategy on protecting vulnerable road users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, rural roads throw up a whole different set of infrastructural and safety challenges compared with roads in more built-up, urban areas.  I must make absolutely clear that the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads, including the maintenance of traffic management systems and the responsibility for setting or amending speed limits, lies with the elected members of the relevant local authority.</p> <p> The provision of footpaths and cycle lanes also falls under the responsibility of local authorities.  Under the regional and local roads grants programme operated by the Department of Transport, provision has been made for local authorities to apply for funding for safety improvement works.  It is the responsibility of the local authority to identify and determine the appropriateness of schemes for submission for safety improvement works.  The Department also provides a range of publications to local authorities to assist them in promoting safer interaction with road users.  These include the Department's updated guidelines for setting and managing speed limits across Ireland, which outline: a range of criteria relating to the setting of speed limits; the traffic management guidelines, which detail the options available to local authorities to facilitate traffic calming measures; and the traffic signs manual, which is a ministerial directive published by the Department of Transport and is the standard for signing and road marking in this country.  While the provision of safer infrastructure is critical to bringing down the number of cyclist and pedestrian fatalities, it is clear that this goal cannot be met through infrastructure alone.  Protecting the safety of vulnerable road users demands a multifaceted strategy to promote a greater understanding of and a mutual respect between everyone who uses the road, irrespective of the mode of transport.</p> <p> As the House may recall, the previous Minister with responsibility for transport, Sir Shane Ross, introduced a new law in 2019 making it an offence for motorists to dangerously overtake cyclists.  It is the intention that this law, bolstered by widespread RSA education and media campaigns, will lead to a heightened awareness of the importance of sharing road space in a respectful and considerate manner.  Nowhere is this respect and awareness more important than on our network of rural roads.  Deputy Leddin is correct: as the summer approaches it is so important that people can go out and enjoy our rural areas on whatever mode of transport they choose and should not have to face into these terrible challenges, with speeds reaching sinister and dangerous new levels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-05-13a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300063#PPP00200"><p>As the Minister of State has acknowledged, we have made progress on road deaths, and fatalities have decreased significantly in the past decade.  Paradoxically, however, by making roads safer for those in cars, vans and trucks, we have inadvertently made them lethal for those who are not in such vehicles.  It is a questionable success if it relies on our roads being so dangerous that our young and old are too terrified to walk or cycle along them because of the high risk they bring.</p>  <p>  There is one area that could be examined in respect of our rural roads.  This year we have budgeted &euro;584 million for the maintenance and upkeep of regional and local roads.  Work in this regard is managed and funded through our local authorities.  I am aware of arguments that this is necessary investment to achieve a steady state in the condition of our regional roads, but I would argue that if this is a steady state that involves children getting killed while walking and cycling, it is an unacceptable steady state.  Most of our regional roads in rural areas are bordered by drainage ditches and hedgerows.  There is scope on many if not most regional roads to provide a segregated section for walkers and cyclists.  It may require narrowing carriageway widths in some places and taking away parts of ditches but it is very possible and is done in other countries.  If we did this, we would provide people living in rural areas with the freedom to leave their front gates in safety.  While we maintain and upgrade rural roads with that approximately &euro;500 million annually, we can also make them much safer for children and adults who wish to go for a walk or to hop on a bike.</p></speech>

There are many factors involved in road safety.  Vehicle standards, road conditions and, above all, road user and driver behaviour have an impact on how safe our roads are.  In just over two decades we have seen a large reduction in the number of fatalities on our roads, from 472 in 1997 to a record low of 138 in 2018.  This remarkable transformation was due to many actions by many people and organisations and was achieved against a backdrop of a significant increase in the number of vehicles on our roads.  However, we cannot be complacent.  As the number of deaths has reduced, it has become harder to get it down further.  In 2020 there were 149 deaths, nine more than in 2019, and this happened in spite of an unprecedented drop in traffic volumes as part of that period during the pandemic.  Both the RSA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have indicated that they will focus on education and enforcement for the remainder of the year.  Later this year, the RSA is planning to develop a new road safety campaign that will focus on the safety of rural roads.  The campaign will have a particular focus on appropriate measures on excessive speeding by drivers and the need to always expect the unexpected.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Leddin for the constructive comment he has made and his proposal.  The Department should give serious consideration to it.  It is something that has been raised in my constituency, where rural communities are proposing such infrastructure on rural verges.  This is an opportunity we should seize with additional funding for cycling and walking, which was unprecedented in the most recent budget.  It is vitally important we tackle this issue.  As already stated, young people and people of all ages should be able to enjoy our rural countryside in safety without vehicles getting faster and bigger.  We have a serious challenge ahead but it is important that the Government tackles it.</p></speech>
