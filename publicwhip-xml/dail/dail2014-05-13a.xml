Can the Minister give an assessment of the success of the scheme one year later and will he indicate how many places have been taken up?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300003#A00500"><p>As part of budget 2013, my predecessor, together with our colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, announced a new after-school child care initiative which is targeted at low income parents availing of employment opportunities.  Lack of access to affordable, quality child care is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities.  This initiative is intended to provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and the Department of Social Protection's labour activation agenda as set out in the document, Pathways to Work.</p><p>  The programme provides &euro;35 per week per child of eligible parents enrolled in a participating service for after-school services.  This payment can rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A maximum of &euro;20 per week per child is payable by the parent to the provider in both instances.</p><p>The new after-school child care programme augments the programme of child care supports for low income families, including the community child care subvention and the child care education and training support programmes.  The Department of Social Protection determines the eligibility of parents for inclusion in the after-school child care programme.  My Department's role is to ensure quality places are available for those deemed eligible for support and its function is to contract suitable child care places with qualifying providers.  A substantial number of child care providers have expressed a willingness to make places available for qualified parents participating in the programme, and a sufficient number of places have been secured to meet the demands of the programme.</p><p>The initiative was intended to provide an important support measure to enable qualifying parents to avail of job opportunities, and in 2013 a provision was made for a maximum of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school.  The scheme was piloted from April 2013 but the take-up was low, with fewer clients than expected identified by the Department of Social Protection as eligible and likely to require after-school support for the purposes of labour activation.  Following a review of the pilot phase, a decision was made to re-focus part of the funding allocated for the after-school programme to support parents on community employment programmes and to provide for quality improvement initiatives in the child care sector.  To date in 2014 approximately 400 part-time child care places have been provided to parents participating in community employment schemes.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Some &euro;2 million has been retained to support the after-school programme, and this figure will provide for up to 800 child care places.  The number of qualifying parents identified by the Department of Social Protection and provided with an after-school place under the scheme is 31, with 42 children receiving after-school child care under the programme in the week ending 2 May 2014.  While it is accepted that the initiative will require time to become established, the Department of Social Protection and my Department are considering the experience to date with a view to establishing the reasons for the low uptake.  The allocation of child care places and funding for both the after-school programme and community employment scheme will continue to be monitored and reviewed during 2014.</p></speech>

I have seen figures that showed only 32 of the 6,000 earmarked places were taken up.  In his reply the Minister said he is refocusing the &euro;14 million allocated to the scheme towards other schemes.  How much of the &euro;14 million has been spent on the scheme, how much has been diverted to other schemes and what are those schemes?  Child care affordability is a serious issue and the Minister alluded to the fact that the cost of child care is a barrier to those who wish to take up employment.  It is clear that the scheme has not worked.  How much of the &euro;14 million will be ring-fenced to improve affordability and to what schemes will it be diverted?</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection has identified 31 qualifying parents and provided them with an after-school place under the scheme, with 42 children receiving after-school child care under the programme in the week ending 2 May 2014.  I accept the initiative will require more time to become established.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Social Protection, with which my Department is in constant contact to establish the reasons for the low uptake.  We have made the places available.  I accept we may need to increase the number of parents.  We have 400 places, and more funding is coming on stream.  I reject out of hand the Deputy's assertion that the scheme is a disaster.</p></speech>

It is nothing but a disaster.  The scheme is more than a year and a half old.</p><p>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, identified this scheme to tackle the problems facing those who cannot afford child care.  It was put in place to assist low income families who wished to return to the work place, but only 41 of the Government target of 6,000 places identified 18 months ago have been allocated.  There are only 400 places identified, so even if the uptake of the scheme were greater, the places are not available.</p><p> I asked a specific question regarding the &euro;14 million identified for this process.  How much has been spent and on what is the balance being expended?  Is the balance ring-fenced for the initial target, which was to support working parents with a concern about the affordability of child care?  It is one of the biggest challenges facing the Minister's Department.</p></speech>

Parents opt for full-day and half-day care and this is another scheme.  I accept the uptake could be better and it will be better.  There are 400 spaces and there is no shortage.  The low uptake on the after-school programme allows for the refocusing of some of the allocated funding to support participants under community employment schemes.  This reallocation of &euro;7.5 million of funding to support qualifying community employment participants is expected to provide approximately 1,800 places, which will prioritise those under five.  Approximately 400 part-time child care places have been provided under the programme to date.  There is ongoing progress between the Departments of Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs, and I will report on the progress at the next available opportunity.</p></speech>

I wish the current Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, well in his new responsibilities.</p><p>  I seek to know the understanding and acceptance of the new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs of the invaluable role played by preschool child care providers.  I speak particularly with regard to education and preparation not only for young life but lifetime achievement.  I refer specifically to all preschool facilities, without exception, including those covered by the community sector and private providers.  It is critical that we have a shared understanding of the important role they play.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300005#C00500"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his comments about my predecessor and accept his good wishes towards myself.  More than 4,300 preschool child care facilities, which is nearly all of the preschool services in the country, are participating in the early childhood care and education programme, ECCE.  The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school.  Approximately 68,000 children benefit from the programme annually.  It is a condition of the scheme that participating services must provide an appropriate educational programme for children which adheres to the principles of S&iacute;olta, the national quality framework for early childhood education.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's assertion that the process should be based on education, which should be a fundamental scope in the scheme.  S&iacute;olta is a quality assurance process which addresses all aspects of practice in early childhood care and education services.  It is designed to support practitioners to develop high quality services for children from birth to the age of six.</p><p>In addition, the curricular framework for early learning, Aistear, has been developed in consultation with the sector by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.<b></b>Aistear supports practitioners in planning for and providing enriching, challenging and enjoyable learning opportunities for children up to the age of six.</p><p>It is intended that the current minimum qualification requirement of FETAC level 5 for preschool leaders delivering the preschool year be increased to level 6, and that all preschool assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a preschool service, be subject to a minimum requirement of level 5.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i></p><p>There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and child care in the earliest years, and my Department continues to support the development of quality child care services with a particular focus on educational components.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300006#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response.  The preschool setting plays an incredibly important role in our children&rsquo;s development at the most important time in their lives.  It is not unfair to say we in Ireland were very slow to appreciate and realise the importance of preschool support.  Parents and experts know that children thrive in an environment where the numbers are small, they learn through play and can learn to manage well in group situations.  That was not always the experience for many, certainly not in my time.</p><p>The impact of early years education on future development is well recognised.  Preschool facilities are educational facilities in the first instance and should be properly recognised as such.  When I drafted my questions for today the previous Minister was <i>in situ</i>.  I appreciate that the present Minister is new to the position.  Will he consider taking particular steps to ensure that this cornerstone of the reality of preschool provision is accepted across the board?  Education and preparation for a lifetime of achievement is crucial and I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s support in this respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300006#D00300"><p>I do not disagree with what the Deputy said.  There have been developments to improve the infrastructure of facilities.  I expect there will be more announcements and more capital funding available within a short time.</p><p>  My Department has introduced measures to support training for child care staff to enable them to upskill to meet the increased qualification requirements and &euro;3 million is being made available over the next two years for this initiative.</p><p>  Following the successful completion of the pilot joint inspection of several early childhood care and education services, my Department is working with the inspection service of the Department of Education and Skills to consider how that service might support education-focussed inspections of services providing the free preschool year, and good progress is being made in the development of proposals in this regard.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy and will report progress to him as we improve the quality of education and child care particularly in the earliest years and we will continue to support the development of quality child care services with a particular focus on the educational component, as requested by the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300006#D00400"><p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response and the fact that he shares my view of the educational role of preschool facilities.  I appreciate he is reading himself into his brief.  Nevertheless, I appeal to him because this is a question of quality child care provision, one of the key components of which is resourcing when resources are under a great deal of strain.  Will the Minister consider the exemption of preschool child care facilities from commercial rates?  This has been lobbied for over a long period.  It would be another means of ensuring that more of the moneys earmarked for preschool child care provision would be spent at the coal-face of service provision.  Will the Minister look favourably on this argument?</p><p>This is the appropriate time to make such a case to his colleagues at the Cabinet table, or to the Minister for Finance as the case may be.  I bring to his attention that the county authority in my home base, Monaghan County Council, with the support of his party colleagues, unanimously passed a motion making that appeal in recent months.  Without making a distinction between the State, the community or private provision, it is about the child in the first instance and I would greatly appreciate the Minister taking up that argument.</p></speech>

It is not something that is directly under the remit of this Department and it involves engagement with other Departments.  It will impact substantially on local government funding but I undertake, as the Deputy suggested, to have a further look at it and see if a decision can be arrived at that will ultimately free up more money for the spending on either infrastructure on the one part or quality training on the other.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300007#E00750"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 102 together.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for his questions and I know this is a matter upon which he has engaged on previous occasions with the previous Minister and in the course of other debates.</p><p>  Under our adoption legislation, as the Deputy will be aware, when a child is registered on the register of adoption the child is deemed to be the legal child of the adoptive parent or couple, having exactly the same legal status as any biological child of the couple born to them within their marriage.  In effect, once an adoption takes place, all previous links to the birth family are severed and the adopted person is considered part of the adopted family.  In the case of step-parent adoptions, it is therefore necessary for the birth mother to adopt her child as part of the adoption process. </p><p>  I am aware of the anomalies with respect to adoption by step-parents and I know the Deputy has made this point previously.  These provisions first originated in the 1952 Adoption Act and were further consolidated in the Adoption Act 2010.  My Department is undertaking a review of adoption policy and the operation of the Adoption Act 2010.  As part of this review I will examine how to address the anomalies in relation to step-parent adoption, including the requirement for a natural parent to adopt their own child and the creation of a new birth certificate recognising the newly-adoptive parents and possibly removing the recognition of a birth parent.  I accept that this is an issue that is causing anxiety, upset and trauma for many parents and people.  </p><p>  It is more than three years since the commencement of the Adoption Act 2010 and I am conscious that in this time several issues, including those in regard to step-parent adoptions, have arisen in relation to the operation of that Act.  There are a number of general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime and I consider it timely to undertake a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption, the scoping of this review will involve prioritisation of the areas to be dealt with and the order within which they will be addressed.  These anomalies, and in particular the anomaly referred to by the Deputy, are issues that will gain priority on my agenda.  I give the Deputy an assurance that this specific issue will be prioritised.  It is important that the issues are examined in the overall context of adoption law reform in order to identify potential knock-on implications or interactions with other aspects under contemplation.</p><p>When my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, addressed this matter with the Deputy in October 2013, she referred to work under way in the Department of Justice and Equality in the area of guardianship, which is of potential relevance to some of the family situations where step-parent adoption is among the options being considered.  This work led in January this year to the publication by the then Minister for Justice and Equality of the general scheme of the child and family relationship Bill.  This scheme outlines the legal provisions by which a non-marital father will automatically be a guardian of his child where he has cohabited with the child's mother for at least a year before the birth of the child.</p><p> Other people will also be able to obtain guardianship by agreement and others by court order, such as step-parents.  My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality on the work under way and to further develop the child and family relationship Bill, which is at draft stage.</p></reply>

In other words and as the Deputy highlighted, such parents must undergo the adoption procedure as if the child were a stranger to them.  It is almost like starting out afresh.  A further anomaly relates to the creation of a wholly new birth certificate recognising the newly-adoptive parents and possibly removing the recognition of a birth parent, very often the father.</blockquote>Nobody could have put it better.  That is absolutely unacceptable, and I hope the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will endorse her further comments:<blockquote>I am of the view that the law must be changed in order that birth parents will no longer be obliged to adopt their own children in order to facilitate adoption by step-parents.  It is not appropriate that we continue to subject birth parents to outdated legal conventions when it comes to step-parent adoption.</blockquote>She went on to say that this would happen towards the end of 2013 or in the parentage Bill to be introduced early in 2014.  It is not enough for those parents who are waiting in limbo to be told that this will happen at some stage under what the Minister calls a review.  I ask him to give us some sort of guarantee that this will be done within a timeframe that will give relief to those parents - mothers in particular - who feel utterly humiliated at the procedure that requires them going through an absurdity of adopting their own children.</p></speech>

I am unable to give a definite timeframe, but I fully agree with the Deputy that this is an anomaly that must be addressed.  I agree that it is a most sensitive and personal issue, visiting trauma and upset on all those involved.  However, it would not be appropriate to deal with the issue in isolation.</p><p>  Since the issue was first raised by the Deputy, some other anomalies and apparent injustices have arisen.  These are issues that should and will be addressed in the context of a review that will give rise to new legislation.  I am including the issue of step-parent adoption, the rights of birth mothers and also birth fathers.  There are issues relating to the rights to an assessment; the age limit of prospective adoptive parents; the tenure of declarations of eligibility and suitability; the habitual residence of applicants; the possibility of introducing open adoption; and various operational matters, including the composition of the adoption authority.</p><p>  I would not like the Deputy to take the view that there has been some change or what he describes as a &quot;lukewarm response&quot;.  I agree with his assertion that this is unjust.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister's statement that new issues have arisen around the age of the adoptive parents and issues like that, but this one is wrong.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say it is unjust.  There is an injustice here.  If there is an injustice here, as acknowledged by the Minister and his predecessor, it is no good to those parents suffering under this injustice to say there are other issues which we will have to include in a Bill, that they will have to wait and that the intrusion on their private lives and on their relationship with their children will continue until we sort out these other problems.  This problem is solvable today and it would take the deletion of approximately two lines from legislation to sort it out.  Why does the Minister not sort this out and not produce some sort of red herrings, which give him a reason to delay this.  I am not saying he is using it as an excuse.  It is an injustice and the Minister should put it right now.</p></speech>

I am committed to having this review at the earliest opportunity.  The chair of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, has been asked by my Department to carry out a review of the Act.  There is a number of issues which he quite rightly referred to as being important in the context of change.</p><p>  As the Deputy well knows, this is not something that can be changed at the stroke of a pen.  Legislation does not work like that.  The Deputy has been in this House and has served in the Seanad for a long time and he know right well that this is not something that can be done immediately.</p></speech>

The scheme was quite restrictive in that it was only possible for community child care providers and community play schools to avail of the capital grant scheme.  In light of the fact the scheme closed last Wednesday, would the Minister be favourably disposed to expanding the criteria for and eligibility of people who can apply for that scheme?  Perhaps the Minister might be able to indicate the level of uptake of this scheme.</p></reply>

This funding is also intended to improve building energy ratings and support sustainability.</p><p>  The State has a particular responsibility to protect the capital investment that has been made to date in the community child care sector.  Community child care services play a major role in ensuring that disadvantaged and low income families have access to quality and affordable child care.  The community not-for-profit services provide access to the community child care Subvention programme which is funded by my Department.  Approximately &euro;45 million is allocated each year to participating community services to enable them to deliver child care to disadvantaged and low income families at reduced rates.  </p><p>  Many community child care facilities were built with the support of significant State investment and many are now more than ten years old with consequent issues arising in terms of repair, maintenance and upgrade.  These issues must now be addressed to ensure that quality child care services can continue to be provided at these facilities.  In rolling out capital funding in the current year, it was decided to target the current scheme towards community not-for-profit child care services to ensure that these services are in a position to continue to provide quality services, in particular in areas of disadvantage, and also to protect previous State investment in this area. </p><p>  In 2012 and 2013, it was possible to provide capital funding programmes which were not restricted to community not-for-profit facilities and for which a wider range of child care services providers were eligible.  I do not intend to expand the criteria for the 2014 programme.</p></speech>

At the time I highlighted the unfair and inequitable criteria set out in the scheme, as a result of which 70% of child care providers are ineligible to apply for the scheme.  Regardless of whether we like it, 70% of child care providers are private and for profit.  Some of the schemes are small and do not make large-scale profits but provide a service in communities where the State does not.</p><p>  The Minister alluded to the State&rsquo;s responsibility to support and protect previous investment.  We also need to support and protect investment made by the private sector.  Private sector child care services availed of large-scale capital grants and they need the support of capital grant schemes.  The Minister might not have to hand the information on the uptake of the scheme to date, but perhaps he could forward it.  I was informed that only 60 applications had been submitted at the end of April 2014, which appears to be very low.</p></speech>

I refer to my initial response to Deputy Troy who seeks more capital investment and more money.  He will be aware that between 2008 and 2011 his own party in government cut &euro;384 million or 60% from the child care budget.  It is a bit rich for him to come to the House and bemoan the lack of capital investment, having regard to the fact we all know capital investment and money across a range of Departments has been in very limited supply.  Nevertheless, significant administrative work is under way by Pobal, on behalf of the Department, to implement the current programme.  More than 200 applications currently require assessment.  When work is completed later this year, we will review the position.  I hope to be in a position then to announce a follow-on scheme which would be open to a broader range of providers.  A commitment has never been given to undertake all strands of capital child care schemes every year or at the same time.</p></speech>

One could ask why there has been a big change.  Why is the Minister leaving 70% of child care providers out in the cold?  That is what is happening.  Given that there are more than 4,000 child care providers nationally, the figure provided by the Minister of 200 applications is quite low.</p><p>  I have been told that Pobal has been encouraging private sector providers to submit an application under strand two to see how it goes case by case.  It is either open to the for-profit sector or it is not.  What way is that to conduct business if Pobal is suggesting people to submit applications, see how it goes and that it will adjudicate case by case?  I accept the budget is restricted.  I did not ask the Minister to make additional money available.  I asked him to make the scheme fair and equitable for all.</p><p>If 70% of the scheme is left out in the cold, it is not fair to the private providers who have stepped in where the State has not provided child care facilities.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will agree the priority must be to ensure the continuation of the provision of a quality service, particularly in areas of disadvantage in the Deputy's constituency and beyond.  I reiterate the fact that a commitment to opening up the scheme was never given.  Notwithstanding this, I hope to provide access to all relevant providers to capital support at suitable intervals, having regard to the administrative and financial resources available.  In this regard, the Deputy might be surprised to learn I expect to make an imminent announcement of further capital funding.</p></speech>

I wish to assure the House that this will be at the top of my agenda, as it was for my predecessor.  The transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys has already taken place and this commitment under the programme for Government will be met in full later this year when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.</p><p>  Following the appointment of the main contractor and a number of sub-contractors, construction on the Oberstown development project started on 23 September 2013.  The project will increase the number of children detention places available on the campus to a total of 90 and will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all under 18 years.  The first three units of residential accommodation are scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year in order to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system.  A further three residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will replace existing detention buildings used by Oberstown Boys School which have reached the end of their useful life.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is overseeing the delivery of the project with the contractor involved, BAM Building Limited.  I understand there has been some weeks' delay in the construction programme due to weather and other issues but the OPW and the Department continue to emphasise the need to make up any time possible in order to meet the agreed project timeline for delivery of the first three units by the end of this year.</p></speech>

That said, there are reports - I would like the Minister to clarify these if he is in a position to do so - of a number of HR issues.  The Minister indicated weather and other issues arose.  It is the other issues I would like to explore.  Are there HR issues still outstanding?  I am not in a position to confirm but there are reports of an injunction against the Irish Youth Justice Service by the director of Trinity House.</p><p>Will the Minister please advise on the factual position in respect of same and discount it if this is not the case?  Is it the case that because of this and other human resources issues, including the postponement of the recruitment of new staff, the scheduled opening of the new units in September 2013 is in some question?</p></speech>

The manager reports to the board of management and is responsible for driving the reforms that are taking place at Oberstown.  I advise further that a care staff recruitment programme to meet the needs of the increased capacity in children detention places at Oberstown campus is under way in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service.  I am advised that the first interviews are due to take place very soon and it is intended to deploy the new staff to Oberstown for training and orientation on a staged basis in the third quarter of this year.  Consequently, construction, staffing and management development, together with overall business planning encompassing all aspects, are well advanced.  The Deputy may wish to know I intend to visit the Oberstown site and campus tomorrow.  He made some specific reference to issues, including court action.  While I do not wish to comment on those at this stage, I undertake to the House to meet all the interested parties on site tomorrow morning with a view towards ensuring this development proceeds at the earliest possible opportunity and is on target for later this year.</p></speech>

I ask that he informs himself through inquiry as to the situation applying to the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, and whether an injunction exists in that regard.  Were the Minister to revert to me subsequently, I would welcome clarification on that matter.  The Minister should reassure Members that the outstanding human resources issues - that particular matter aside - will be progressed with the necessary speed and that they will be looking forward to the commencement of occupancy and full utilisation of the facilities, as had been signalled, by September of this year.

This is in order to minimise re-offending and to support the early re-integration into the community.</p><p>  A number of criteria have been taken into account in assessing the level of management risk with each child in detention, including their age, the medical and mental health background, the availability of family supports, the level of educational attainment and the history of criminal offending.  These factors are recorded when a child is admitted to the campus and they are factored into an individualised management plan in each case.</p><p>  Only yesterday I attended an event organised by Business in the Community, a group which seeks sponsorship from industry in order to ensure an element of re-integration, employment opportunities, education and training.

On 27 March 2014, my predecessor informed the Deputy that she considered that the Estimate provision for the Department is facilitating the delivery of a significant level of public services as well as a number of new policy measures.  These include the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which took effect on 1 January 2014 and for which the level of funding allocated was more than &euro;600 million in current funding and &euro;6.8 million in capital spending; an additional &euro;4 million to support implementation of the pre-school quality agenda; an increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding to address child poverty through the new area based childhood programme as part of a total budget allocation for this programme over the period from 2013 to 2016 of almost &euro;30 million;  and &euro;31 million in capital funding to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new children detention school facilities at Oberstown, Lusk, an issue we discussed a few moments ago. </p><p>  Some of the issues mentioned by the Deputy, particularly the reporting of child abuse, consequent protection measures and the issues of child abuse generally, including sexual abuse, are now the responsibility of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1 January last.  The overall level of funding available to the agency, which is significant by any measurement, is designed to ensure it can provide a comprehensive and integrated service to children and families who require support.  In budget 2014, an additional sum of &euro;6.7 million was made available to support the agency's reform of child welfare and protection services.  This allocation will increase to &euro;15 million in 2015. </p></speech>

Approximately 68,000 children are availing of the provision in the current academic year.  In spite of the challenging budgetary situation, the preschool year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring a significant number of children can avail of quality preschool services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.</p><p>There is an increasing body of Irish and international evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in improving outcomes for children and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the State.  In this context, I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.  A second free preschool year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free child care to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000 to 5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time.</p><p>However, the introduction of a second preschool year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all the available evidence indicates the quality of preschool provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The preschool quality agenda being progressed by my Department, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal child care provision.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-20, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a second free preschool year within the lifetime of the framework, once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the preschool quality agenda.</p></reply>

It was, as was understood at the time of its introduction, a step on the road.  It is well-documented that many parents want to keep their child in preschool for a second year but the reality is that they cannot afford to do so.  There are consequences, accordingly, not just for the child but for the parent or parents.  We also know that children with special needs would greatly benefit from a second year of support from a special needs assistant.</p><p> The Minister may not be familiar with the Donegal County Childcare Committee's Indecon research report entitled, Supporting working families - Releasing a brake on economic growth, but I refer to it.  The report highlighted that such a move would have a significant economic benefit.  I emphasise that because it is critically important.  While the Minister's initial response is in terms of what would be the outlay on its introduction, we must also look at the significant return on this proposition.  In real terms, the return would be a multiple of that investment over time.  Will the Minister consider prioritising the roll-out of a universal second free preschool year over the remaining time of this D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

In fact, I agree fully with his sentiment and comments.  The Deputy will be aware that Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people over the years 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive social and emotional development.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a second free preschool year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  The Deputy has asked me specifically, in order of priority, to list objectives, aims and targets, and this is one.  I agree with what the Deputy has said in terms of outcomes regarding the importance and the benefits.</p><p>  The one area where perhaps we disagree is the availability of funding.  The Deputy seems to suggest that funds are readily available.  Notwithstanding that, I assure the Deputy that both my Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the preschool quality agenda.</p></speech>

If the prospects of extending the free preschool year to a second year are impeded by budgetary constraints, as the Minister states, and I would argue that such is penny wise and pound foolish because there is never bad time to invest in preschool care for children as the return will unquestionably justify all the investment made, will the Minister at least give some commitment to extend the current single year scheme to 48 weeks as proposed by Early Childhood Ireland in its recently launched pre-budget 2015 submission?  Early Childhood Ireland advocates for a system which allows for services to mirror the timeframe of primary schools operating for 38 weeks of the year and for staff to have contracts of employment covering an initial 48 weeks.  This development, Early Childhood Ireland states, is essential to create viable careers in early childhood which is what we want to see, not part-time low-paid jobs.  We want to see careers from childhood provision to retain qualified staff and to build on existing investment in training.</p></speech>

A delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland in October 2013 for further discussions on a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption between both countries.  The meeting was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, as well as the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  In order to explore the potential for agreement of specific areas addressed in the discussions, my Department subsequently undertook work on a revised draft wording which was forwarded to the Russian authorities in February of this year.  In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.</p><p>  The Russian Ministry of Education and Science has advised the Irish embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how it deals with adoption agreements in general.  It is understood that the Russian supreme court recently made recommendations regarding adoption agreements and these are being considered by the Russian Government.  It is hoped that following the Russian Government's consideration of these matters, it will be in a position to examine and respond to these proposals as furnished.</p></speech>

Will the Department of Children and Youth Affairs also be in touch with the Russian authorities to try to speed up this process?  I understand the need for it to be done legally and properly, because nobody wants problems in years to come.  I understand, however, that there are 537 declarations of eligibility in existence and that only 11 post-Hague adoptions have been completed since 2010.  In the meantime, we know what is happening to children in state care in Russia and about the families who are waiting to receive them into their homes in Ireland.  It seems as if it is up to the Russian authorities, but can the Minister's Department do more to put pressure on them to come to a speedier resolution?

My Department prepared a revised draft wording on a number of specific points that were forwarded recently to the authorities in Russia.  It was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  The Russian Ministry for education has again been in touch with our embassy.  The Deputy will be aware that the Russian supreme court recently made some substantial proposals with regard to the text of the proposed agreement.  These have not yet been completed or finally signed off on by the Russian Government.</p><p>  Intergovernmental discussions on this precise issue were proposed in recent weeks but the embassy has agreed to speak to them again for a further update in the next couple of weeks.  I assure Deputy O'Sullivan that we will try to have this matter resolved at the earliest opportunity.  I hope she will accept the fact that at this stage the resolution is perhaps beyond our immediate capacity.</p></speech>

We know from other agencies that are working with children in state care in Russia of the dire need for those children to get away from there as soon as possible.  I accept what the Minister has said and I hope this can be resolved.  The matter has been ongoing for four years and there was supposed to be a decision at the end of April.  We are now into May, yet the Minister is talking about a few more weeks, so it is dragging on.  I take the Minister's word, however, that he will be following this up in order that we might get something sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Having read the report, it seems clear that the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, resigned as a response to chapters 19 and 20 of that report and the conclusions arrived at, and not just because he wanted to spare any embarrassment to the Government parties in the run-up to the local and European elections.  At the centre of those conclusions is the fact that there was no independent investigation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe's complaints and that the Minister has a specific role and function in terms of ordering an independent inquiry into such allegations and did not do so.</p><p>  In addition, Mr. Guerin makes the point that there is cause for concern as to the adequacy of the investigation of the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe to the Minister.  He states that there is sufficient basis for concern as to whether all appropriate steps were taken by the Minister to investigate and address the specified complaints. </p><p>  There is also the question of the departmental response.  In chapters 19 and 20 the report refers strongly to that issue.  It states that there was no submission to the Minister by his officials, in particular at times when the exercise of specific statutory functions by the Minister arose.  Mr. Guerin said he found it very difficult to find material which demonstrates that the Department identified and understood the significant independent statutory role which the Minister had to perform in respect of these matters.</p><p>  I also wish to raise the Department of the Taoiseach's response to these issues.  As far back as August 2012, Sergeant McCabe e-mailed the Taoiseach and his Department concerning the penalty points dossier.  There was also a covering letter about the serious incidents he alleged were occurring in Bailieborough.  Nothing happened for months in that regard.  Sergeant McCabe was so frustrated with the Department of the Taoiseach that he made a formal complaint to the Department about the lack of a response to the serious issues he was raising.  He went further in making a complaint to the Ombudsman.</p><p>  Taking all three matters together, they refer back to the fundamental conclusion of Mr. Guerin that, in essence and despite the gravity of the complaints that were made, nobody within the Government took them at all seriously.  There is a whole of Government response that needs serious analysis and questioning, not just the former Minister for Justice and Equality himself.</p><p>  Did the Taoiseach ask the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, to resign specifically because of the conclusions in chapters 19 and 20?  What are the implications for the Department of Justice and Equality?  Has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality discussed the implications of the report with the secretary general of the Department of Justice and Equality, and his response to the report's conclusions in chapters 19 and 20?  What about the Taoiseach's response and that of his Department to these allegations?  Would he agree that there was total inertia and a lack of any independent analysis or questioning about the response to these issues?</p></speech>

I recall a departmental official going before an Oireachtas committee on two occasions confirming that the Deputy had been told about a particular report a number of years ago, about which he had denied all responsibility.  Perhaps the Deputy recalls it.</p></speech>

After some independent Deputies raised these matters in the first instance, I considered the matters serious and I treated them with gravity.  The Government appointed Mr. Guerin to produce a report, which has been published, and this morning the Cabinet made a number of decisions regarding it.  First, we decided to establish a commission of investigation, as proposed in the report.  Second, we decided the Garda Inspectorate should carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation, management, operational and procedural issues.  Third, we agreed to bring forward legislation strengthening the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  Fourth, we decided to commission an expert review of the performance management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality with a very short timeline to report.</p><p>  We reflected, again, on the decision already taken by the Government that an independent and statutory Garda authority should be established and, hopefully, be operational by the end of the year.  The new Cabinet sub-committee, which I chair, will hold its second meeting on it next Tuesday.  We also made the decision, which has already been announced, to begin the process of recruiting a new Garda Commissioner by open competition and in parallel with the establishment of the statutory authority.  I already answered the questions the Deputy asked about the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, on a number of occasions last week.</p></speech>

The local and European elections should have nothing to do with it, although the Minister alluded to them in his letter.  Is it the Taoiseach's view that the former Minister failed to exercise appropriately the statutory functions he had to establish an independent inquiry?  Does the Taoiseach accept Mr. Guerin's conclusions in that regard?  I am entitled to an answer.</p><p>  Over the weekend, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said the Department of Justice and Equality was not fit for purpose.  The new Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, did not express confidence in the Department or in the Secretary General, which left many questions unanswered and many people asking questions.</p></speech>

There was silence from the Government when the conversation between the confidential recipient and Sergeant Maurice McCabe was leaked.  I asked two questions on it in the House and the Taoiseach said nothing.  The first day I asked if there were significant discussions in the Cabinet about the penalty points dossier.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, caused the O'Mahony report to be referred to the Road Safety Authority, which the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, did not want.  Although Ministers were aware there were very serious and substantive issues within the Department of Justice and Equality, the Taoiseach chose to turn a blind eye to much of it for too long.</p></speech>

Although he said that following the Guerin report there is a need for root and branch analysis, in the last few months he defended the same justice system, attacked the Opposition for asking very legitimate questions, said time out of mind that the former Minister for Justice and Equality was doing a great job reforming the justice system, and strongly rejected suggestions the former Minister or the former Garda Commissioner should resign.  The Taoiseach and the Government bear responsibility for what happened.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, met Sergeant McCabe two years ago.  Sergeant McCabe wrote to the Taoiseach a long time ago.  Deputy Shatter, therefore, was not alone.</p><p>  Citizens were rightly shocked by the findings of the Guerin report, which clearly vindicated Sergeant McCabe and Garda John Wilson, who have performed a great service for the State.  I welcome the fact that Sergeant McCabe now has access to the PULSE system.  Last week, I wrote to the acting Garda Commissioner on the issue.  Sergeant McCabe should be allowed to get on with his normal Garda duties.  The Taoiseach has a chance to reflect on this.  Would he, on behalf of the State and the Government, apologise to Sergeant McCabe for the way he was treated for doing his duty?</p></speech>

The Guerin report has found that, in particular, Sergeant McCabe has been vindicated in the issues he raised.  Arising from this report the Government has responded in acting decisively and clearly to have a commission of investigation into the issues that were raised in the report.  As the Deputy is aware, Mr. Guerin's report indicates for each of these, with one exception, that the case warrants further inquiry in an appropriate forum in the public interest.  The Government has responded to that clearly and decisively and it will set out the terms of reference that would be appropriate for the scale of this commission of investigation because of the nature of the cases it would cover.</p><p>  Deputy Adams is aware that at some time in the future - I cannot say when - Mr. Justice Cooke will also present his report, and it would be appropriate, as Deputy Clare Daly mentioned on a number of occasions last week, that instead of having a long list of commissions of inquiry, it would be appropriate to consider what is the best structure to deal with the issues that warrant investigation in these cases.</p><p>  I have already spoken of the importance of the right of people to bring issues to public notice that should be brought to such notice.  The Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, or the whistleblowers legislation, will resume on Committee Stage in the House tomorrow.  In that regard I have no problem apologising to Sergeant McCabe for the issues he raised and because his raising of these matters was not dealt with more speedily in the first instance.</p></speech>

It is disappointing as if the Taoiseach had indicated that the Government accepts it did not handle the issue properly, it would have been a very good signal.  We wish the Minister well in her work and we will support her in a critical way in doing that work.  If the Taoiseach had accepted that the Government had a responsibility but did not handle the matter properly, it would have been a very good signal for a new beginning of policing.</p><p>  As the scandal developed much focus has been on people who lost their jobs but the real victims are the ordinary citizens whose rights were undermined.  We cannot get away from the Government's failure to recognise the gravity of these issues when they were brought to the Taoiseach's attention both by whistleblowers and Deputies from this side of the House.  The Taoiseach ridiculed what we said, dismissed our comments and actively undermined our right to bring forward what were quite legitimate concerns.  He sought to undermine the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and he inaccurately quoted the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act on a number of occasions to misrepresent GSOC's responsibility.  He had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to deal with the issue.</p><p>  Do not get me wrong, as it is good that this happened and there is support for the need for a new and independent Garda authority and the strengthening of GSOC.  We have been suggesting this to the Government since we came into this D&aacute;il.  I warned the Taoiseach that his unquestioning support for the former Minister for Justice and Equality would bring his own office into disrepute.  As he stumbles from one debacle to another - with a scandal per day arising from unfair water taxes to this policing issue - will the Taoiseach acknowledge there is no energy, commitment or intent in the Government for the type of root and branch reform required to deal with the lack of regulation?  This concerns charities, banker bonuses and the need for a new beginning with policing.  In the second part of the Government's term, it would be a good start to stand up and say how there is an appetite to tackle these issues and that it has learned a lesson from this.</p></speech>

Approximately 300,000 people lost employment, which brought catastrophic economic consequences on their backs, but we have reversed that process to a point where we are now creating at least 1,000 jobs per week.  We still have a long way to go but the Deputy should not come here to portray this position as akin to what it was three years ago.</p><p>  I do not accept Deputy Adams's assertions that we have not acted decisively on this issue.

Under the old Common Agricultural Policy, which is still in place, the top 2,000 farmers got over &euro;150 million but the bottom 52,000 farmers got &euro;125 million.  This is socialism for the rich, as it cannot really be called anything else, but the Government is standing by it.</p><p>  I understand the Government is moving in the right direction through an idea called &quot;approximation&quot;, and there have been many reports in the press about how the small farmer is getting more money.  Of course they are getting more money, as if they were to get a cent more, such a statement would be correct, and that is pretty much all they are getting.  Under the new system, the top 2,000 farmers will get &euro;135 million and the bottom 52,000 farmers will get in the region of &euro;140 million.  That is hardly a sea change.  The EU agricultural Commissioner, Mr. Cioloş, has a proposal and under his &quot;flattened&quot; system, payments to farmers in Mayo, for example, would increase by &euro;30 million.  Under the system being backed by the Government, they will only increase by &euro;4 million.</p><p>  With regard to individual farmers, we have heard that small farmers will get more, but how much more will that be?  A farmer on &euro;36 per hectare will see a rise to &euro;149 per hectare, and this is good news.  The farmer on &euro;643 per hectare will be reduced to &euro;543.  That does not change the position we have now, and which will exist in future, whereby a small farmer in Mayo will get &euro;390 less per hectare than a rich farmer in Kilkenny.  On top of that, we have the greening scandal, with a third of the payment going to environmental factors.</p></speech>

He forgets one factor in his analysis of the agricultural sector, which is productivity.  The original intention from many of the former eastern bloc countries was to have a flat rate payment across the board.</p><p>Were that to happen productivity in this country would drop drastically.  One cannot equate a 300 acre farm in west Waterford which has an intensive level of dairy production with 300 acres in many parts of my native county in terms of their capacity to produce.  The Deputy seems to forget that.  He also seems to forget that the negotiations, which opened under very difficult circumstances for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency last year, were not expected to be successful in the first instance, yet the conclusion was a &euro;12.5 billion investment from 2014 to 2020, as a result of which the incomes of the more productive farmers at the higher level were reduced and that was given to the bottom 50,000 plus farmers to raise their incomes.  A further &euro;100 million was added specifically for the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.</p><p> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has also introduced a replacement for the environmental scheme, which is not as extensive or as flush as one might like it to be but which is a big help to the small farmers the Deputy mentioned.  I do not accept his assertion that we should change the nature of the reform that has taken place.  It is a question of giving an opportunity to the small farmers at the lower end of the scale to increase their incomes and to have an incentive to get into farming, which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has dealt with in the past two budgets through the tax regime.  The Deputy needs to understand too that we cannot disincentivise productivity.  He is aware that when EU quotas are abolished next year, this country will become the most productive agrisector country on the planet.  Productivity is an essential and core ingredient of that development because the land will not produce itself unless it is worked and worked well and unless farming practices are of the highest standard, which I am happy to say applies almost universally now in Ireland.</p></speech>

One can also be on a small payment and be productive.  If one is getting &euro;500,000 one does not have to try quite so hard to be productive.</p><p>  Under the last round of Common Agricultural Policy payments, according to George Lee &ndash; the Taoiseach might remember him, he was the one with the brains in his party - &euro;4.5 billion was spent off-farm.  What will be done to prevent that happening again?  The money was intended to support farmers but the rich farmer has bought himself an apartment in Croatia, or maybe in Bulgaria, or a second apartment in Dublin, and that money is not going into farming.  My proposal would put money in the pockets of the small farmer and if the Government does this, it is to be hoped the next time I visit Castlebar town that I will not have to talk to one shopkeeper after another telling me they are on their knees and that it is not a question of if but when they close.</p><p>  I suggest the Taoiseach gets out of his bubble, gets into reality, goes back to his town, where he was elected, and wakes up to the fact that he is crippling its people in many ways.  This is one way because the small farmer spends every last cent locally.  The man getting this payment is sitting beside Lake Garda sipping his cocktail.  Who does the Taoiseach support?  Him?</p></speech>

Good luck to him with the electorate.  They may well decide to send him there for more reasons than one.  The Deputy is perfectly entitled to raise his case.  The environmental scheme I mentioned, introduced by the Minister, puts &euro;1.45 billion into the pockets of small farmers mostly and smaller entities, because they have had difficulty measuring up here.  There is also a special allocation for those small farmers from places the Deputy has forgotten about or maybe never visited, &euro;1.37 million for the farmers on the islands off our coast, and a further &euro;250 million for the rural development scheme under the Leader programme, which also goes mostly to rural areas.  On top of that there is a &euro;395 million capital investment for farm buildings under Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  The Deputy raises a valid point about main street development in every town in the country.  People these days have a clear choice.  The retail sector has been hit hard and it is important that not only do shops offer a range of goods, competitive prices and good service, which they do, but they must also move online to give people choice.  The young generation may well visit a premises and buy on their mobile phones or from the Internet in many ways.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s view that the Government has not been concerned about, or has not delivered for, the agrisector in general, big and small.  During the process of the negotiations at the European Presidency meetings, we deliberately restructured the payments so that the small farmer at the lower end of the scale gets the benefit and that is taken off the big farmers at the top of the scale.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan does not want to recognise that producing a high quality product is essential for this economy and is responsible in the main for hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That is why the Kerry Group is investing &euro;100 million in Naas and Glanbia is investing very heavily on the Kilkenny-Carlow border.  That is why there is movement in respect of land acquisition and retention, passing farms on to younger farmers, and why agricultural colleges are booked out by young farmers who want to get onto their courses.  They see a very bright future in the agrisector, even if the Deputy does not.</p></speech>

I answered a question in this respect on the last occasion in January of this year and at that time and in light of previous representations, I took questions in two groups and on a thematic basis to allow for a structured debate on the issues that were raised by Deputies.  However, as it has now been some time since I answered questions in the House on these issues, I have chosen to group the questions together on this occasion in order that a full and timely discussion can be had on these topics of interest.</p><p>  Recent events have reminded us once again of the complexity and fragility of the situation in Northern Ireland, including the difficulties faced by victims of violence and their relatives.  Now more than ever there is a need for maturity, leadership and engagement by all the political parties in Northern Ireland.  Recently, I have met Prime Minister Cameron, President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Boehner, Dr. Haass, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p><p>  I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron by phone last Sunday week following the arrest and the questioning of Deputy Adams.  We took the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  We and our Administrations will continue to work closely to do all we can to make them work, and to support the political parties in their efforts to build a better Northern Ireland.  I also spoke to the Deputy First Minister over the phone that weekend and the T&aacute;naiste spoke to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Deputy Prime Minister Clegg and the Deputy First Minister.  Officials contacted other parties.</p><p>  Turning to wider matters, it is two years since Prime Minister Cameron and I agreed our joint statement setting out a ten year vision for ever closer bilateral co-operation between Ireland and Britain.  We met in Downing Street again on 11 March and I am pleased our bilateral economic relations continue to go from strength to strength.  There have been significant developments on progressing recommendations outlined in the joint economic study which we jointly published in July 2013.  Examples include further collaboration in research and development to maximise access to Horizon 2020 funding, collaboration to unblock barriers to trade in agrifood products, and the sharing of best practice on Common Agricultural Policy implementation.</p><p>  The successful completion of a joint trade mission, including ministerial representation from Northern Ireland, to the Singapore Airshow and exhibition in February was a unique event which I believe we can replicate in future.  Of course, our joint visit to the war graves in Flanders last December to honour Irish and British soldiers who died in the First World War was also significant, being the first such joint event to commemorate the loss of life that occurred.  We also had an open and constructive discussion about political, economic and security developments in Northern Ireland, including the issues of victims and of dealing with the past.  We re-affirmed the support of both Governments for the full implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.</p><p>  At my meeting with the British Prime Minister we also availed of the opportunity to discuss very wide common interests that we share on the EU agenda, including the spring European Council which took place in March.  In that context, I also reminded the Prime Minister of the June 2012 European Council conclusions regarding banking and sovereign debt which remain to be fully implemented, and the implications for Ireland.  We also briefly discussed developments in Ukraine which is also featuring very prominently in EU discussions.  We acknowledged the ongoing co-operation between the two countries on the reciprocal short-stay common travel area visa arrangements.  We discussed the programme of wind exports between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Further analysis by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change has concluded that it will not be possible to put in place an intergovernmental agreement to facilitate green energy export from the midlands by 2020.  I regret that it has not been possible at this time to conclude an agreement as envisaged.  However, I believe that in the context of a European Internal Market and greater integration, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post-2020 scenario.  The Prime Minister and I remain committed to meeting at annual summits to review and oversee progress in our joint work, and I look forward to our next annual review summit in 2015.</p><p>  After our meeting I went to the annual CHAMP reception at Westminster which was sponsored by Tourism Ireland, an event which was attended by many involved in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I did not have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron or other UK political leaders during the state visit in April.  As I said earlier, the current political situation in Northern Ireland remains fragile.  Following my discussions with Prime Minister Cameron in London, I met President Obama, Vice President Biden and Speaker Boehner in Washington over the St. Patrick's Day period.  I also met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Washington over that same period.  We discussed the political situation in the North, including prospects for political talks on dealing with contentious issues and the past.  I emphasised the need for courage and leadership from the Northern Ireland Executive and the political parties and said that both Governments would support them in their work.  I also availed of the opportunity to meet Dr. Haass in New York over the St. Patrick's Day period to hear at first hand his assessment of the talks process and prospects for further progress between the political parties there.  The T&aacute;naiste met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland most recently in April to discuss the talks and the support which both Governments are giving to the process.</p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, I met the Ballymurphy families in Dublin in January as part of my series of meetings with victims and relatives affected by the Troubles.  The families explained their proposals for an independent panel review of the events that took place in Belfast in August 1971 when 11 people were shot dead.  I told the families that the Government supported their case.  Following my meeting with the families in January, I wrote to Prime Minister Cameron asking that their request for a limited review be granted.  I also raised the matter with him directly at our bilateral meeting in London on 11 March.  The decision by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland not to agree to their proposals for an independent panel is something that I regard as very disappointing.  Notwithstanding this particular setback, I hope it will still be possible to find a way for the families to get the truth and to vindicate fully the good names of their loved ones.  I also recall the suffering of the families of those killed and injured in the La Mon bombing, and I note the Secretary of State's decision not to initiate a review of that case.  These incidents remind us of the needs of all those who have lost family members to violence during the Troubles.</p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, this coming Saturday will be the 40th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I am deeply honoured to have been invited to the commemoration service.  Despite the passage of time, I know that the resulting pain is still being felt by the families of those killed and injured and our thoughts will be with them on this Saturday and indeed every day.</p><p>  Last summer, I met the representatives of Justice for the Forgotten and the families of those killed in the bombings.  I was struck by their unwavering commitment to seek justice for their loved ones.  This Government has continually urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.  I have raised the matter directly with Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the T&aacute;naiste has also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p><p>  I also raised the Pat Finucane case directly with the Prime Minister.  As I have previously indicated to the House, the Government's position continues to be that the British Government should fulfil the commitments entered into at Weston Park, as we did with the publication of the Smithwick tribunal report.</p><p>  In relation to the so-called on the run cases, Prime Minister Cameron has established an inquiry led by Justice Hallett.  In the circumstances, I believe we should await the outcome of this process, and in the meantime, the two Governments and the Executive should focus on the many other important challenges that must be faced.</p><p>  I expect to host the next North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting in Dublin on 4 July and plan to visit Northern Ireland afterwards.  We had a useful and constructive debate on Northern Ireland matters in the D&aacute;il in February.  The date for the next D&aacute;il debate on Northern Ireland remains to be agreed between the Whips.</p></reply>

Fifteen of those 37 questions are in my name.  This grouping of questions span issues related to the Ballymurphy murders, the Hyde Park atrocity, retrospective banking debt in regard to Europe and the bilateral meetings and so on with Prime Minister Cameron.  They could have easily been segmented into those related to the Ballymurphy murders, the Hyde Park atrocity, the Pat Finucane case and other economic issues that are separate altogether.  Including the situation in Russia and Ukraine in the middle of this grouping seems to be utterly absurd and ridiculous and brings Question Time into disrepute.</p><p>  In terms of the questions on the Ballymurphy murders, there is no doubt that innocent people were murdered by British soldiers in Ballymurphy in August of 1971.  Forty-three years later, the official account has not been corrected and the families have been denied the right of being told exactly how these murders happened.  The British Government, as the Taoiseach said, through the Northern Secretary, recently asserted that there should be no review of the murders because of what she called &quot;the balance of public interest&quot;.  This goes to the nub of the ongoing detachment and mishandling of the peace process and reconciliation generally.  It speaks of a policy that suggests that everything has been achieved, all the big things have been achieved and we do not need to deal with these issues.  I met the Ballymurphy group some years ago and it seemed to me that, at the very least, an independent panel of investigators, with some international dimension attached to it, should have been established to report on the murders, such is the appalling nature of what happened. </p><p>It needs more than just the Taoiseach articulating here that it is very disappointing that the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said this.  Was there any consultation between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP, prior to the decision not to set up a panel to investigate those murders?</p><p>While I strongly support the need for this, it equally has to be said that the family of Jean McConville is also entitled to justice and truth in respect of her murder a year later.  Both cases show that different sides are trying to be selective in their approach to the past.  The British Government will pursue one case but will say there is no need to deal with the murder of 11 people in 1971 because of some obscure balance of public interest reasons.  Likewise, I do not believe one can deny the family of a mother of ten who was murdered in 1972 the right to truth, justice and information, and yet Sinn F&eacute;in would probably want that denied.</p><p>The breakdown of the Haass talks is related and the decision to take a hands-off approach to that up to now has failed.  I see from recent comments that that has been accepted and that there is a need for intervention.  What steps does the Taoiseach intend to take regarding the Ballymurphy question?  How does he intend to get the British Government to change its mind on pursuing the establishment of an independent panel to investigate the murders?</p><p>Regarding the Boston College tapes of interviews relating to the McConville case, a disturbing trend is emerging whereby those with anything to do with the Boston College project are being labelled as touts, and as greedy and reckless.  A hate campaign is being developed by foot soldiers within the Sinn F&eacute;in movement, as far as I can ascertain, to target people.  Regardless of whether one likes it, I believe the people involved in the Boston College project saw it as an historical project.  They did not envisage the British prosecuting authorities seeking release of the tapes, Boston College being acquiescent, to say the very least, in opposing that until it was forced into a position where now certain tapes relating to the prosecution of that case have been released.</p><p>Now a hate campaign has developed where those responsible for conceiving the project and doing the interviews are being targeted in language that is very dangerous.  The Taoiseach might have seen recent articles in which Mr. Ivor Bell is called the &quot;Boston tout&quot;.  People are under pressure to come clean about the contents of the controversial Boston tapes.  It is very sinister and almost sets people up for attack.  It makes people very insecure and anxious.  There should be no toleration of it.  It is extremely important that it is nipped in the bud and that all responsible people would deal with that.  I ask for the Taoiseach's comments on the implications of that.</p><p>The families of the four soldiers who were so barbarically killed in the Hyde Park bombing felt very let down by the trial's collapse.  That anger and frustration is completely understandable.  The Northern Ireland Attorney General, Mr. John Larkin, actually expressed the controversial view at the time, which I feel inflamed the situation then, in requesting legislation to allow for an amnesty in certain cases.  Following the Weston Park talks, the Northern Ireland authorities and the British Government were developing legislation, in essence to facilitate the on-the-runs but also to facilitate official state forces - British soldiers and police officers who had committed crimes.  Ultimately, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the bit that would have disallowed, in essence, prosecutions of British soldiers who had been involved in Bloody Sunday or the Ballymurphy killings.  Officially, therefore, the legislation did not materialise.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach outline how the Government views those issues in terms of the past, the prosecuting of various cases and those who are on the run?  How does the Government propose to deal with that contentious issue?  Has there been any discussion of the Hyde Park bombing case and related matters with the British Prime Minister in the various meetings the Taoiseach had with him?  Does the Taoiseach believe there should be a general amnesty?  Is that now the Government's position regardless of the perpetrators of a particular crime or should justice continue to be done in those cases?</p><p>Where does the Taoiseach see the role of victims in the overall hierarchy of these complex and difficult issues?  Invariably when proposals are made, the views and perspectives of victims seem to matter the least.  The families of the victims believe they are the last to be consulted by those devising the various plans and approaches.  Will the Taoiseach deal with those questions initially?</p><p>Does the Taoiseach have any further developments to outline on the need for an independent inquiry into the Pat Finucane case?  Did the Taoiseach discuss it in his recent meeting with the British Prime Minister?</p><p>The two remaining issues are unrelated.  Will the Taoiseach outline any discussions he had with the British Prime Minister on the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Russia and Ukraine?</p><p>With permission, I might come back to the retrospective debt issue because I do not believe it falls into this particular group of questions.  If I get a chance I would like to come back on that matter, if appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300022#U00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  On the previous occasion, we split these questions into Northern Ireland and issues related to the Prime Minister.  Two of the 37 questions grouped together related to Ukraine and Russia and I did not refer to those in my reply.  Perhaps I should have put those two as a subsection.  As I have told the Deputy before, I am willing to have Taoiseach's Questions in a priority questions system for Deputies if they have a particular issue they wish to raise.</p><p>  I had quite an emotional meeting with the people from Ballymurphy.  They expressed their case with clarity on behalf of those who were shot and died at the scene or later.  The effect was no different, in the sense of their being citizens, than those who lost loved ones in the Kingsmill massacre or the relatives of those who were killed at the cenotaph in Enniskillen.  When one speaks to them all, irrespective of their background or their creed, the loss is the same.  The young lad, who is now a an adult, obviously, told me that he saw half his father's head blown away while standing beside him.  For him that is an end-of-life picture he will carry with him all the days of his life.  The pain of those from Ballymurphy was palpable.  There was a very emotional charge from them about the issue that arose over those few days.</p><p>  I know Deputy Martin has visited Ballymurphy before.  Deputy Adams has been there many times.  It is my intention to visit the location with the relatives on the next occasion I go to Belfast.  In the next few weeks we should have an opportunity to have an all-party motion about Ballymurphy.  I presume there would be no disagreement on this as there was not with the Finucane case.  We can draft that motion in consultation with the Opposition leaders.  We should do this to show solidarity with the relatives.  I was disappointed by the response of the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  It was not the full-blown Saville-type inquiry that was being sought here.  It was not some sort of endless tribunal but a short-term limited analysis and investigation, as happened in the tragedy at the football match abroad a number of years ago.  It may be possible to come back to that again.</p><p>In respect of Jean McConville, I agree with Deputy Martin's sentiments here.  I will not stray into the area of Deputy Adams's arrest or the questions he was asked over the number of days he was in custody.  Deputy Adams may wish to comment on that himself but I was struck by the argument, and the force of argument, of the McConville children.  From my knowledge of the IRA and the way it operated when it was in existence in its cell formations, clearly somebody ordered that a number of men to go to the McConville dwelling, take out Jean McConville screaming in front of her family, abduct her, instruct that somebody drive her to a location and that there she be executed and buried.  Her body was not found for very many years afterwards.  That family was orphaned of their mother and the children were left in that sorry state and still bear that pain.  I am quite sure information about Mrs. McConville's abduction and the ordering of her execution is more than likely available.  It points out the difficulty and the complexity of dealing with issues of the past.  This family deserves closure.</p><p>As I understand this, the number of people who have been questioned about this is six or seven -  Deputy Adams will know that - and that one of those is being charged with conspiracy by association.  Whether that moves through to the PPS to a further stage is something that I cannot predict.  I think everybody in this country is haunted by the picture of Jean McConville and a number of her children - that black and white photograph - which has appeared thousands of times over the years.  I know from meeting people who have lost loved ones at sea or whatever, through a tragedy or just an accident, that a sense of closure, not being able to say where they are and who was responsible and that justice be seen to be done is very powerful.  </p><p>I agree with a comment made by Deputy Martin in regard to the Boston College tapes that there seems to be a sort of campaign that these are not valid, authentic or real contributions.  Somebody who knows something about this said to me that some of the contributors were either dependant on alcohol or requiring of substance use all the time.  I suppose the old saying <i>in vino veritas</i>is still valid.  These are part of, and a background to, the problem we have with the past and the legacy of what that means.  I share Uachtar&aacute;in Higgins's response, when commenting on this, I think, in Chicago, that nobody should be above law and that we cannot have one law for one and a different one for somebody else.</p><p>If the garda&iacute; did not have the intelligence and communications they have available to them and the sharing of knowledge with the PSNI, this incident at Finnstown House recently could have been very serious, with the possibility of international repercussions for Ireland of the most serious kind, and the loss of life.  </p><p>The issues arising over the last period in regard to the question of the past, parades and so on goes back to a comment made by the T&aacute;naiste that there is a short opportunity after the electoral process is finished here and before the marching season gets into full swing in which we should perhaps refocus on what it is we may be able to do here.  When I look at what is happening in Derry and I see the excitement, the expansion of the economy, the jobs being created and the view of the future where people really want to get on with the business of providing for their children, opportunities and so on, I see a difference between that and what is happening in places in Belfast.  That is regrettable.  I saw the television pictures, and Deputy Adams was involved.  Perhaps there is an opportunity here to refocus, as two Governments, to help the Northern Ireland Executive and the parties in Northern Ireland.  President Clinton said that we have to finish the job, it cannot be finished for them, it has got to come from inside and we have to give them all the encouragement we can.</p><p>I raised the question of the Pat Finuncane case again directly with the Prime Minister.  He knows my very strong view on this and I said that to Pat Finucane's wife on a number of occasions.  I know that people will say it is not just good enough to raise it.  What else can one do here?  Is there a facility that we can use or work with, perhaps to move this forward?  These are serious matters and I would like to think that, in respect of Ballymurphy, we could frame a motion here which would be acceptable to everybody in the House in the next short period and have that debated.  </p><p>In regard to the McConville murder, all I can say is that the information available now to the PPS and the people interviewed, and taking that against the background of these Boston College tapes, this may be progressed.  I feel for and admire the courage of the McConville children who from their knowledge of so many years ago of the people who might have been involved gave that to the PSNI.  I think that has been reflected by all parties.  Anybody with information should do this.  </p><p>I have spoken to Deputy Adams before about the disappeared and the best knowledge available to those who were involved in IRA activities at the time to pinpoint where the remains of those people are.  Even after all the years, it brings a sense of closure to find those remains so that those who are left behind can actually say where they are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300023#V00200"><p>To start with, I welcome the Taoiseach's willingness to go to Ballymurphy, his support for the families there and the notion of putting together an Oireachtas motion.  That is good but I have to say that these issues are more serious than to have the Taoiseach or, indeed, Teachta Martin swapping anecdotes, no matter how serious and genuine they may be, about what is happening in the North and the suffering of victims' families.  Of course, the suffering of all of the victims is the same.  The family of an IRA volunteer, of a British soldier, of an RUC officer, of a UDR officer and, most particularly, of civilian feel the same way and I say that as a member of a family which has buried two family members.  One was a victim of loyalist butchers - a young man coming from a traditional music session was left in a quarry after being stabbed to death - and the other was my brother-in-law who was shot to death by the British Army.  I have been shot myself, although I do not see myself as a victim.</p><p>  I think the Government needs to go a little bit further than what the Taoiseach's responses have been.  It is a tendency in here all the time to talk about the need for all the parties in the North - it is a refrain from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach's Government - to engage.</p><p>Both the Taoiseach and Teachta Martin know the leadership role played by Martin McGuinness in the North.  We know that the problem is that the Unionists, for reasons I have articulated in the past which I understand although I do not accept, are the ones who do not want to engage fully.  The Taoiseach also knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has signed up for the compromise proposals of Richard Haass and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  He should also know that the British Government has not signed up to them.  If he wants to know why Peter Robinson or Mike Nesbitt have not, it is because David Cameron has not.  We know from our experience in the process that Unionist leaders, notwithstanding the support for all of these moves by Unionist grassroots, will only move when a British Government lets them know that there is really little other option and that has not been the case.</p><p>My arrest has brought some of these issues into sharp focus but I have come to the House and asked for a rational and reasoned debate on the past.  I have asked for us to set aside our partisan views and willingness to score points on a party-political basis.  The Taoiseach referred to Ballymurphy.  I am from Ballymurphy.  It is where I live.  My home is not in the Ballymurphy estate but it is in the townland of Ballymurphy.  I am there nearly every weekend.  Most of my family still live there.  The people who were killed are my neighbours.  These are real issues for someone like me.  The thing about Ballymurphy is that the people there look to the Government to do something about it because they know that the British Government will not do anything about it.  The British Secretary of State made it very clear that there was a one-sided approach to deaths in which the state was involved.  She made those remarks recently.  The question to the Taoiseach is whether the Government got notice of the remarks she made and what he did when he was told she would make such a statement.  The Secretary of State also dismissed, as the Taoiseach noted, any notion of an inquiry as sought by the people of Ballymurphy or any notion of an inquiry into the La Mon House Hotel firebombing by the IRA.  Did the Government get notice of it and what did it do on foot of that?  If the Government did not get notice, why was that the case?  Why was the Government not told?  These are hugely important and significant statements.</p><p>The Secretary of State also said just last month that no one could plausibly argue that the institutions must be set in stone for all time.  She said that her government would welcome moves that facilitate a more normal system at Stormont that allows for formal opposition; in other words &ndash; majority rule.  Did the Taoiseach get notice of those remarks?  If not, why not, and what was the response of the T&aacute;naiste?</p><p><i>The Guardian</i>broke a story about the Prime Minister, David Cameron, hosting the DUP leadership at an engagement in the garden of No. 10 Downing Street.  <i>The Guardian</i>described it as Mr. Cameron playing the &quot;Orange&quot; card, the suggestion being that he is trying to make sure that there is some courtship of the DUP should he require it following the next election.  That happened with John Major which famously led to the entire collapse of the process.  He wished to ensure there would be Unionist votes for his government.  The British representative in the Northern part of our country said that the institutions are not set in stone, that there is too much of a focus on killings by the state, and she dismissed a cause to which the Taoiseach has given his support.  What did the Taoiseach do about any of that?</p><p>The Good Friday Agreement is the people&rsquo;s agreement.  Perhaps the Government does not have any investment in it but I guess the Taoiseach voted for it and Fine Gael and Labour came out in support of it.  Under the terms of the Agreement the Government is the joint guarantor along with the British Government.  I have worked with more taoisigh on this matter than anyone else in this D&aacute;il.  With one or two exceptions I have found that taoisigh are very deferential to the British.  They behave as junior partners.  I accept that one has to raise an issue at a meeting but where is the proactive strategy?  What is in place in terms of the recognition now that the process might be in some difficulty?  All of these things are very predictable.  What is needed is a political and diplomatic defence of the peace process led by the Government.  The big shift in Sinn F&eacute;in, which many historians missed, was when we recognised the responsibility of the Government to be in the lead against and with the British Government in terms of trying to carve out a peace process.</p><p>The Taoiseach noted the 40th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The British Government persistently and consistently rejected any motion, appeal or responsibility it has to provide information on those matters.</p><p>I return to the issue of victims.  I will conclude on this matter.  Irish Republicans have acknowledged many times the hurt caused during the war.  I would welcome if Teachta Martin said &ldquo;This is Sinn F&eacute;in&rdquo; but he uses sleveen, sleekit, weasel words such as &ldquo;It appears to be Sinn F&eacute;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;As far as I can see&rdquo;, &ldquo;It appears to me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;As far as I have been able to ascertain&rdquo;.  Let me be very clear about this; all the victims deserve justice &ndash; every single one, particularly the victims of the Irish Republican Army.  I say that as a republican because I cannot rail against injustices inflicted by the British or others if I do not take the same consistent position in terms of those who were bereaved by people whose legitimacy I recognised.  Both the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il recognised the legitimacy of the IRA cause, but in another decade.  Somewhere along the line they became revisionist on the issue.  I wish to be very clear that, first, it is the right thing to do morally; second, it is the right thing to do for the peace process and; third, I understand because I am from that community.  That is where I come from.</p><p>Having said all of that, we need to straighten out these issues.  The peace process cannot be allowed to meander.  The road has too many pitfalls.  There are too many powerful elements on the fringes of nationalism, within unionism and the British system who want to derail the process and build obstacles to it.  For all the issues pressing down on the Government and all the pressing economic issues that impinge upon people&rsquo;s lives every single day, the people of this island, the diaspora and the international community believe in the peace process so we need to be proactive and pre-emptive.  The peace process is in trouble.  Graphically describing the distress of victims will not assist although I do not for a moment impinge upon the Taoiseach&rsquo;s right to do that.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s plan and strategy for holding the British Government to account?  I have given him three examples of the British Government stepping right outside the terms of the Good Friday Agreement of which the Taoiseach is a co-guarantor.  I asked the Taoiseach if he had prior notice of the remarks and if not, why not, and what was his response to them.</p></speech>

Everybody can agree that the suffering of all victims is the same.</p><p>Therefore they deserve justice and for the truth to emerge in respect of each of their sad and tragic cases.</p><p> It is true to say that Sinn F&eacute;in has signed up to the Haass talks and that other parties have not.  Therefore when two parties such as these have a disagreement about an issue the question is whether one can bring them closer together where they can both agree on what the fundamentals of it might be.  When I went around the corner in the little town of Windsor on the occasion of the visit of the Uachtar&aacute;n what struck me was the streetscape.  Having equal status and being of equal size with the Union Jack was the Tricolour, on every lamppost outside the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II, which is a strong signal in its own way.</p><p> Without issuing any plam&aacute;s for the Ceann Comhairle, he has done a great deal of work, along with the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay, MLA, in putting together something people thought might never happen in North-South parliamentary dialogue.  I know from reports that where matters were deemed not to be talked about, both of them, as leaders, brought about great understanding in so many ways.  This is part of the strategy, Deputy Adams, to see if we can deal with the issues of the past, flags and parades.  To coin a phrase they are not going to go away and it is a case of trying to inch forward.</p><p> When I spoke to Dr. Haass in New York he was not without hope of being able to resurrect some elements of this and that it might be possible to bring a conclusion to some pieces of it.  I understand that he will come over to receive the peace prize in Tipperary later on and that he might make further remarks about this.</p><p> I recall being in the United States in 1984 after the New Ireland Forum when all the parties were there with one exception.  It was Seamus Mallon who raised the question that the Sinn F&eacute;in Party was not there and asked who formed the party.  I recall his words very clearly.  He stated they were his neighbours in Markethill to whom people might have to give a hand with a tractor as the case might be.  As Deputy Adams stated, the people in Ballymurphy are his neighbours but so also are the others.</p><p> I was informed of the intention of the Secretary of State to issue a statement about not going ahead in respect of an inquiry for Ballymurphy.  I was informed of it late the night before and I did not have a copy of the statement.  One of the senior officials at my Department informed me the Department had been told and it was related to it that the Secretary of State intended to issue the statement.  It may well be some more detail might have been made available to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Secretary of State is in regular contact on these issues with the T&aacute;naiste as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I cannot confirm this to the Deputy now but we can check it later.</p><p> There is nothing to stop the Prime Minister hosting occasions in the gardens of Downing Street for groups of people.  The Deputy states it is political with regard to dealing with the Unionist parties.  People were speaking down here about Deputies Adams and Martin getting together at one stage.  I do not suppose it was just for discussions, but that is neither here nor there and it is not for me to comment.</p><p> I hope the institutions are not set in stone because if they are not set in stone then there is a possibility of change and if there is a possibility of a change, or change of heart, then some of these issues of the past might be able to be moved forward and dealt with.  The Good Friday Agreement is the Agreement of the people and all parties here.  All parties, in fairness to them, made their contribution over the years in some small way towards the production and process of the Good Friday Agreement becoming a reality, irrespective of what Taoiseach stood here or what party they represented.  In their own way they made some element of progress, perhaps not as much as people might have liked at the time, but individually and collectively the Oireachtas and the governments here were amenable to moving the situation in Northern Ireland to a point where we could get agreement.</p><p>  I know Sinn F&eacute;in stated it is a big change when governments are in the lead, and of course it is a true statement of historic fact that the people in a different decade, and now a different century, did support the campaign but it had the legitimacy of the people's endorsement.  It was a very different matter to what was the subject of the so-called war by the IRA which did not have the legitimacy and backing of the people and resulted in soldiers, members of the Garda and innocent civilians here being blown asunder also.  The Deputy is not coming from the same base in making that point.</p><p> The peace process cannot be allowed to be static and nor can we have a situation where a blockage of politics disallows the next generation to move outside that and move on ahead.  This is why I am happy to state I was in Donegal yesterday where we examined the question of the Peace Bridge as being symbolic of the new movement ahead.  It is a &euro;15 million development of a new science collaboration between the institute of technology in Derry and Letterkenny Institute of Technology with facilities of 50,000 sq. ft. and 20,000 sq. ft.  This is the future.  In the case of Derry it is a very progressive forward-thinking outlook for the people.</p><p> I also like to think the engagement that is genuinely going on between Ministers on a very regular basis is productive and is part of the process of people being able to work together on a range of issues in the interests of North and South, our peoples and our economies.  It is the politics of this which are the issue.</p><p> I am willing to listen to valid suggestions as to how, when the current electoral process is over, we might be able to move forward again in respect of the three issues Dr. Haass was dealing with.  It is not for the co-guarantors, either the Government here or the British Government, to say to the parties in Northern Ireland they are the elected representatives of the people and now they must do this, because this will not work either.  If both Governments were to lead to a situation where it goes on interminably this would not be satisfactory either.</p><p> President Clinton stated very clearly that he was here 20 years ago when the peace process was put together and that the parties must finish the job.  On behalf of the Government here let me state we are more than willing to support the initiatives of the parties.  I take it the Deputy has signed up for the Haass talks.  He might differ on other opinions with the other parties.  At the end of the day, and I see it in Europe on a regular basis where there are disagreements on other matters, compromise and agreement on fundamentals are what make the difference.</p></speech>

One of the questions I put to the Taoiseach was that the past is a key issue, but what is going on right now with regard to the past is, in my view, reprehensible.  A hate campaign has developed against those involved in the Boston exercise.  Those involved, those who did the taping and contributed to the tapes, genuinely believed they would not be released until after the participants were dead.  Sinn F&eacute;in has an issue with this as do others but it is unacceptable that on the front page of the <i>Sunday World</i>one reads that Boston tout Ivor Bell is under pressure to come clean on the contents of the controversial Boston tapes.</p><p>There is graffiti now on the walls in the North about the touts, the informers and the greed.  The salaries of those who actually did the interviews is out as though it represents some astronomical amount of money and that it was all for greed.  Comparisons are being made between those who were involved in the project and those who cracked under pressure in Castlereagh and became informers and who were dealt with by the then IRA.</p><p> One gets good cop and bad cop all the time.  On the one hand, one gets the nice presentation but on the other hand, this is going on right now.  I have been contacted about this and people are worried about their lives.  People are worried about the security aspect to it.  It should be condemned and Sinn F&eacute;in should make sure that anyone associated with the party who is involved in this regard should stop and cease, no matter how uncomfortable or inconvenient it is.  While the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in will accuse others of revisionism, I put it to the Taoiseach that it is absurd revisionism to suggest that any just war was going on over those 30-odd years from 1974.  Many ex-combatants would say there was no justification, in retrospect, for anything that went on after Sunningdale.  There was no great war, there was a war and terror and people were killed who did not need to be for far too long.  It went on for years and years and now we all are being cosied to accept language around conflicts, war, sides and all that.  Too many appalling atrocities were carried out that cannot be justified in any shape or form.</p><p> Moreover, I make the point to the Taoiseach that the peace process belongs to the Irish people, not to the Taoiseach, to me or indeed to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  Yet, when someone gets arrested who the Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not like getting arrested, its members will organise protests outside the police station as they did in the case of the prominent arrest of one of its members with regard to the McCartney murder, when 300 people turned up outside a police station and when a member of the policing board, namely, Gerry Kelly, said this was an outrage.  When they want to threaten the peace process, they will do it.  The same happened in recent weeks, because Sinn F&eacute;in did not like a particular arrest.  The peace process now was under threat and policing support was under threat.  One cannot have it both ways; one either supports it or one does not.  One cannot just switch up, switch off or switch down the temperature when it suits and the temperature was switched up deliberately two weeks ago.  No one should be under any doubt or illusion about that.  The mask slipped for a few days but it did so deliberately.  The word to the authorities was were they to keep going, they would not have a peace process.  Were they to keep going, they would not have support for policing in Northern Ireland.</p><p> My final point to the Taoiseach is to ask him whether he has concerns regarding victims of republican paramilitary violence in unsolved cases.  I do not refer to recent cases but to other cases and the victims believe these cases never will be solved.  They believe it would be too politically inconvenient to solve them and to bring people to judgment in respect of them.  While this may or may not be true, that is the view of quite a number of victims.  They believe some of those cases will never be dealt with properly by the authorities because it would be too politically inconvenient to so do.</p></speech>

This is extremely clear and I condemn these threats and everyone has stated more times than enough that people must be able to go about their business without any fear of any threat whatsoever.  Moreover, for the information of Teachta Martin, the Haass proposals include the right of families to seek legal redress if they wish and Sinn F&eacute;in supports that concept.  One must understand here that there are multiple narratives.  In the same way as there are the Fine Gael, Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il narratives, in more recent times there are the Sinn F&eacute;in and the republican narratives, as well as Unionist, British Army and IRA narratives.  We would get some sense of our history were we willing to lay all those narratives side by side as opposed to undermining any of them.  Moreover, for the record, no generation of the IRA had a mandate, not in 1916, not during the Tan war and not during the Civil War or since.  However, every generation of the IRA had sufficient endorsement of enough people to continue, including in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s until thankfully, the war was brought to a close.</p><p>  While the Uachtar&aacute;n's visit to Britain was taking place, which I welcomed and in which Martin McGuinness also played a key role, I told the Taoiseach in this Chamber that we needed peace on the streets as well as the big houses and I repeat that point.  I agree with the Taoiseach that all Taoisigh and all Governments have played their role in this ongoing peace process.  I have acknowledged this and I commend them all.  In response to my question, the Taoiseach replied that while he was given notice, he did not have the detail as to what Secretary of State Villiers was going to say but that perhaps someone in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade may have it.  Was the Government given notice of my arrest?  I ask the Taoiseach to revisit his response to my question on whether he was given notice about what the British Secretary of State was going to say because this, as well as the Taoiseach's response to it, shows where the Government is failing.  I say this in the most fraternal and positive way possible, because I want this peace process to work and will do everything possible to make sure it does so.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on what I have said.  In addition, was the Government given notice of my arrest?</p></speech>

I will have to check for Deputy Adams to ascertain whether the copy of the statement was submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or to the Department of the Taoiseach.  As for when I first learned of the Deputy's arrest, he answered questions here - sorry, he asked questions, he was going off to answer questions - here on the Wednesday.  I remained in the House myself for quite some time and on my way out, someone stopped me in the corridor over there and said an arrest had taken place.  That was the first I heard of it and so I cannot confirm to the Deputy whether notice was received.  I do not think it was but I will advise the Deputy on that.</p><p>  I might note that at least we now know the IRA has gone and that the army council has disbanded and we know there was no just war here.  I spoke by telephone to the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, on the Saturday during which the Deputy was in custody.  I told him that if the position was that he believed there is a cabal operating within the PSNI and that this was the dark side of the PSNI, I chair a committee down here whose purpose is to put in place a statutory independent authority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following a Government decision.  One issue that always is held out is one should consider how matters are structured in Northern Ireland, where there is an oversight and overseeing responsibility for the ombudsman.  I suggested to the Deputy First Minister that if it was his belief, this having been told to him by very senior personnel within the PSNI as he said himself, that there is a dark side and a cabal operating therein, the test of the authenticity of the oversight review is then vested in the ombudsman's office and that he should make a formal complaint.  I am not sure whether the Deputy First Minister wishes to do that but if there is an issue in this regard, that is where the oversight review is lodged.</p><p>  I must state that when I saw the people presenting and preparing the mural of Deputy Adams in Belfast, as is their right, comments were made there by some people to the effect that &quot;We have not gone away&quot;.  Who are the &quot;we&quot; and to whom they were referring when they said &quot;We have not gone away&quot;?  These clearly are supporters of Sinn F&eacute;in and I am unsure what interpretation to put on this.  I hope we can move this forward.  Certainly, I assure the Deputy that from the point of view of the Government, there certainly is no lack of interest in this regard.  Both Governments will be happy to co-operate with, work with and encourage the parties if they can see there is an opportunity to move forward any of these issues to a point where a better outcome can be achieved.</p><p>Nobody wants to see a return to what went on before.  Nobody wants to see garda&iacute; in the Republic having to evacuate innocent people because of a live bomb and a timer or people being evacuated anywhere else.  We want to leave those days behind us and it behoves everyone to so do.  That bears repetition.  With the agreement of the other leaders, I will frame a motion in respect of Ballymurphy in the next while for their consideration.</p></speech>

He said we will not see 2016.  This seems to have been supported by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore.  Apparently the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is regarded as the praetorian guard of the coalition.  He stressed the need for urgent action and he warned that unless the Government gets a firm grip on the political agenda, he would be "fearful of our chances of seeing 2016 as a Government".  This is a quote from a senior Minister of the Government: "[T]hings have been sliding for the past three months, things have been going off the rails."  He said that the coalition parties needed to meet behind closed doors and settle on a programme of renewal: "There is no point in taking flight or panicking, but we need, in the light of criticisms, to settle on a new direction."  The Minister is saying that there will be amendments to the programme for Government and a new programme for Government.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that there will be a review of the programme for Government and that a new programme for Government will be negotiated shortly, as per the Minister's statement?</p></speech>

I understand the closing date for submissions is 6 June.  The Taoiseach will be aware that each year 500 people die through suicide in this State and 300 die by suicide in the North.  Countless other people self-harm.  This is a crisis on a huge scale.  I refer to the participation by many people in the Darkness into Light suicide awareness and fund-raising event recently.  When does the Taoiseach expect the report to be published?  Will he consider examining the possibility of putting in place an all-Ireland, all-island suicide prevention strategy?</p><p>  Last week, the Government published the terms of reference of the expert panel to review projects by EirGrid, Grid Link and Grid West.  It may also consider the North-South interconnector.

I cannot answer for Mrs. Justice McGuinness's group.  It has published its terms of reference and it is now analysing the situation in respect of EirGrid, the western and southern routes and also the question of the interconnector for the North.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has made it perfectly clear that we need to deal with this question of Northern Ireland because the energy situation warrants it.  I cannot speak for Mrs. Justice McGuinness as to when she will respond.</p><p>  The framework for suicide is called Reach Out and it will end its ten-year term this year.  The Department of Health and the HSE, with the direct involvement of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, have begun the process of developing that new framework strategy for suicide prevention for the period 2015 to 1018, to build on the work contained in that Reach Out programme.  The aim of the framework will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide while aiming for better co-ordination and the integration of services.  This is being led by the Department of Health but it is being managed by the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently approved the establishment of a planning oversight group and five advisory groups, covering research, policy, practice, engagement and communications and media, to drive the process.  It is expected that the framework will be in place by the end of this year.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is already dealing with her Northern Ireland counterpart and I would have no objection to having co-operation on an all-island strategy.  There should not be any difference in these matters.  I will ask the Minister of State to update the Deputy in due course.</p></speech>

Many people continue to travel to the county hall on Prospect Hill to inquire about driver licences or renew existing licences.  This service ceased in the county hall in November last and is now provided by the office located in Ballybrit.  People find it difficult to find the new office, which has resulted in Galway County Council's decision to produce a map featuring directions from the city centre to the Ballybrit office.  Signage in Ballybrit is poor and many motorists who have travelled long distances to Galway find it difficult to locate it. </p><p>There is a ruling, however, that one must apply in person at the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, in Ballybrit.  The signage for the centre could be much better.  The question arises as to why people have to travel to a centre to appear in person to make an application.  Galway is the second largest county and members of the public, particularly those from outside of the city and elderly rural residents who are not familiar with Ballybrit, find it difficult to go to the office when they are used to the old city centre licensing office.  It has been suggested an express postal service, similar to that for passport applications, could be put in place, with the added security of the photograph for an application being verified by a garda&rsquo;s signature.  I hope such a service could be put in place as it would be practical, efficient and ensure people would not have to travel long distances to attend the NDLS offices in person.</p></speech>

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, had intended to take this matter but he is in the Seanad.</p><p>  In 2011, the Government decided to centralise the driver licensing service, following an examination of the options related to the requirement for all EU member states to introduce a plastic card licence.  The examination found that a centralised system would offer enhanced security and consistency, as well as being more efficient and cost-effective.  The Government appointed the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as the lead agency for the plastic card project and for the centralised driver licence system.  The necessary legislation to transfer powers for driver licensing to the RSA was put in place through the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012.</p><p>  The RSA operates driver licensing through the NDLS.  The NDLS comprises a central unit in the RSA and three outsourced contractors.  These are a card producer for the plastic card licence, a front office to engage with the public and a back office to process applications.  This service came into operation from 29 October 2013.</p><p>  There were problems with the speed of processing applications in the NDLS when the system came on stream.  Inevitably, these early difficulties led to the build-up of a backlog.  The Minister discussed with the RSA at the time the difficulties people were experiencing and how it proposed to address them.  The RSA acknowledged there were teething problems when the service opened.  The authority responded by increasing resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence-processing centre and providing further training to staff.</p><p>  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  A booking system to allow for customers to make appointments was successfully piloted and is in use in Dublin, Cork and Tullamore.  It will be extended on a phased basis to all NDLS offices.  The problems which the NDLS experienced in its earlier days are now largely in the past.</p><p>  In number terms, 250,071 applications have been received since the NDLS was launched on 29 October, with 242,875 of these completed.  The total number of applications on hand is 7,196 with licence applications being turned around in five to eight days.  Dealing with problem applications is taking longer.  These are cases where the application is incomplete, or where further information or documentation is needed to process the application.  This involves contacting the customer and finalisation of these applications takes several weeks.</p><p>  It is evident there are significant numbers of customers who attend NDLS centres without getting their application processed because they have incomplete or incorrect documentation.  Some of this arises because there is a tighter ID regime in place than before the NDLS, in line with the SAFE 2 standard.  In implementing the Government&rsquo;s decision to produce the plastic card licence and centralise the licensing service, the RSA was directed to do so using the SAFE 2 standard to authenticate customers' ID.  An essential feature of SAFE 2 is face-to-face validation of identity.  This process necessitates that customers apply in person for their driving licences or learner permits and have their photograph and signature captured digitally onsite.</p><p>  Once authenticated under SAFE 2, the person does not need to have their identity verified again.  NDLS enhancements under way will in due course provide additional channels through telephone supported by postal and online access for those customers who have been SAFE 2 authenticated.  This means those customers who have been through an NDLS office will not have to revisit the service personally once the additional channels are in place.  Work is ongoing also with the Department of Social Protection to capture customers who have been through the SAFE 2 process with that Department so as to enable those also to apply or renew licences or permits without having to attend at an NDLS office.</p><p>  The Minister is continuing to monitor progress in the NDLS but, overall, he is satisfied the RSA has taken appropriate actions to address the problems which have arisen.</p><p>  I also have engaged with the RSA recently on the signage for its offices in Galway.  It informed me additional signage will be erected in the near future to make it easier for people to find them.</p></speech>

There is better signage for the other businesses in Ballybrit than there is for the NDLS offices there.</p><p>  Will the Minister engage with the RSA on the requirement for people to appear personally at the Ballybrit NDLS office?  I already mentioned how this affects the elderly.  Emigrants working away from home will find it impossible to have their driving licences renewed too.  Young Galway emigrants, as the Minister of State knows, are living and working in Australia, Canada, the United States and other countries.  They will also find it impossible to have their driving licences renewed or permits issued if they cannot travel personally to the NDLS centre.</p><p>  The RSA should review having an express postal system similar to that for passport applications which would involve the Garda verifying the applicant&rsquo;s identity and sign his or her photograph.  This would be a practical and efficient way to do business.  I hope the RSA will review this as the requirement to attend the NDLS office puts a lot of trouble on people to travel to a centre which they might not be used to travelling to.  This requirement also inconveniences many in rural areas as Galway is the second largest county.  Whether one is elderly or an emigrant, one will find it difficult to apply or renew a driving licence if this requirement is not changed.</p></speech>

Once that has happened, there is no further need for any customer of the NDLS to attend its offices in person.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Kitt, however, that there are questions about how our diaspora can go about renewing driving licences.  I will raise this with the RSA and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and revert to the Deputy with their responses.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach stated a few weeks ago that when subsidies from central taxation to water production are ended, which is the Government and the European Union policy, the average tax would be &euro;580 per year per household.  I wonder whether the Government has any clue of the crushing new economic burden that these demands will place on ordinary householders.</p><p>  On the immediate issue on which I need clarification today, Deputy Hogan stated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 6 May, that an allowance of 38,000 litres a year for those under 18 meant &quot;that water charges will...only apply to adults&quot;.  On national RTE television news on Tuesday also, the Minister stated that, effectively, children, meaning those under 18 years, are free.  On Wednesday, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, stated that the 38,000 litres a year allowance for every under 18 year old, &quot;results in free water for children.&quot;  That is false and I require the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to correct that today.</p><p>  The study, Water Supply Project - Dublin Region, which was commissioned and sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, found average usage of water in Dublin to be 148 litres per person per day, that is, 54,000 litres a year.  The Government states that so-called &quot;free&quot; water for those under 18 years means 38,000 litres per year.  A 17 year old does not need to wash less, drink less or use sanitary facilities less than, let us say, a 20 year old and the 38,000 litre allowance for a 17 year old is 16,000 litres short of what, according to the water supply project of the Department, a 17 year old would use in a year.  Therefore, there is not free water for those under 18 years, as the Ministers state.  In case Deputy Jan O'Sullivan comes back and states that perhaps they could economise, according to the projections in the document to which I refer, with all metering and charging in place by 2030 the average use will be 130 litres per person per day, which is still 10,000 litres more than the free allowance for those under 18 years.  I need the Minister of State to clarify, tell the people the truth of this matter, admit that the figures are incorrect and correct them.</p></speech>

The announcement included details of the free allowance, which will be provided to all customers of Irish Water, which will equate to 30,000 litres per household.  An additional allowance will be provided in respect of each child under the age of 18 to cover the normal usage by every child in his or her primary residence.  The allowance will be based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit.  This allowance will be up to 38,000 litres per child per year.  The level of consumption on which the level of the free allowance for children is based, will be verified by water metering data to be provided to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The provision of the free allowance for children in this way means that no additional charges arise for children and will increase the affordability of water charges for families with children.</p><p>  Supporting the affordability of water charges is a critical policy objective of the Government.  The provision of the free allowance along with a number of other policy measures demonstrates the Government's commitment in this regard.  Among the additional measures are a decision that there will be no standing charge for households and that a minimum charge may apply to properties, such as holiday homes, which are not permanently occupied; support for those with certain medical conditions by capping the level of charge at the assessed charge - details of this are being finalised with the Department of Health; the provision of additional support for pensioners, persons with disabilities and carers who receive the household benefits package; a commitment to maintain the average charge for domestic water charges at &euro;240 for 2015 and 2016; a requirement for assessed charges to be based on occupancy to provide the best proxy for usage, with provision for rebates for those moving from assessed to metered charges; and the introduction of a &quot;first fix free&quot; scheme by Irish Water at a cost of &euro;51 million.</p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has been provided with statutory responsibility for the economic regulation of Irish Water.  Under the legislation, the CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan prepared by Irish Water.  The CER has announced that it will be consulting on the water charges plan in June this year, and that the approved water charges plan will be announced in August.  Accordingly, households will have full clarity on the level of charges in advance of their introduction.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has announced his intention to use his powers under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the Commission for Energy Regulation to provide that the Government's decision on the funding model is incorporated into the water charges plan to be approved by the Commission.</p></speech>

She singularly failed to address the key issue I raised, which is, that an allowance of 38,000 litres a year for an under 18 year old does not amount to what she called "free" water for children - those under 18 years.  I have quoted the Department's study to prove that.  Will she address that?  That is the only point I want addressed.</p><p>  I am aware of all the other stuff and what a considerable burden this will be for families.  In two or three years, when EU policy and the Government's neoconservative policies come into effect and the subsidy from central taxation is removed, the price of water for families will shoot up.  Of course, we hope to build a movement of opposition that will force the abolition of this progressive and reactionary tax on households.</p><p>  I need the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, since she was deputised by the senior Minister, Deputy Hogan, to come in here today, to answer the net point.  Why does she state that 38,000 litres per year is so-called &quot;free&quot; water for those under 18 years when the Department's own study shows that a 17 year old will use on average 54,000 litres and, in the best possible circumstances, would also in 16 years' time be way over that limit?  It is simple.  I ask her to clarify.</p></speech>

If I put on a wash in my washing machine, and I have a five or six-person household, a person in a one-person household puts a wash in a washing machine as well but he or she is only catering for one person.  That is only one example.  It is not correct to state if one has a four-person household, one multiplies by four the amount of water consumed in a one-person household.  I merely want to make that point to the Deputy.  The Atkins study is the study upon which the figures were based and that study suggests that the amount of allocation for children is enough to ensure that children are free.</p></speech>

Over the past few years, there have been cuts to the budgets across a broad range of funders.  In the case of Darndale, 260 child care places are in jeopardy.  Some of them are from among the most deprived and vulnerable in our society.  </p><p>  Some 98 jobs are at risk with skills and experience that cannot be replaced.  I remind the Minister that the 1916 Proclamation states that we must cherish all the children of our nation equally.  We must ensure that badly needed services for our children and their families are provided and maintained.  Darndale is one of the biggest cr&egrave;ches in the country.  An additional &euro;200,000 a year would make it viable both now and into the future.  Everything has been tried, including pay cuts, cost reductions and fund-raising, just like other cr&egrave;ches have done around the country.</p><p>  It is worth noting that &euro;240,000 a year goes to the Revenue, so the Minister is getting money back.  It may not be his Department, but another one.  Some &euro;330,000 a year is raised from contributions by parents.  The social consequences of closing this cr&egrave;che are huge.  Not only will it put people on the dole, but it will also affect parents who themselves work and help in the community.  There is no flexibility in funding from Tusla, the DSP, Early Years policy programmes and other funders.  </p><p>  The Early Years policy programme calculations are based purely on child numbers and the band their parents fit into.  The DSP reimburses wages and has set allocations for materials and training based on participants' numbers.  For one fifth of the money needed for Darndale, we also have a cr&egrave;che under threat in Ballymun.  It is not just this cr&egrave;che; there are also other serious problems with cr&egrave;ches.</p></speech>

It was incongruous because at the same time as we were opening the seniors' centre, public representatives heard of the massive threat posed to the Jigsaw integrated child care cr&egrave;che centre.  </p><p>  As Deputy Ellis said, the Jigsaw centre is the largest community cr&egrave;che in the country and provides services to 260 children.  Its team comprises 55 core staff and 44 community employment, jobs initiative and T&uacute;s participants.  Some 90% of the children come from the immediate area, which has long been designated by the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments as one of serious social disadvantage.  One sixth of the children cared for come from our local Traveller community.</p><p>  The Jigsaw centre opened in 2001 and was originally to cater for a maximum of 150 children but it is now catering for almost double that number.  The centre's CEO, Kelda Barnes, has rightly pointed out that it provides an important link between social and health services and the local community.</p><p>  The centre provides much needed employment to the local area with 60% of the staff coming from the immediate locality.  In addition, the centre has a history of great distinction, having received a S&iacute;olta award in 2013 for its work in looking after young children.</p><p>  As Deputy Ellis also said, the centre has come under incredible pressure in recent years due to a growing deficit.  In 2012, the deficit was &euro;65,000, in 2013 it was &euro;63,000 and this year it is heading towards &euro;200,000.</p><p>  I am informed that there are cuts to community employment support and changes to payments from Pobal.  In addition, the HSE has been relentlessly cutting funding for this service.  Fund-raising undertaken by the centre has been in grave difficulties due to the recession.  My constituents in Dublin Bay North and in Darndale-Belcamp parish in particular are pleading with the Minister to take decisive, necessary and immediate action to solve this serious crisis and ensure the continued viability and success of the wonderful Jigsaw centre.</p></speech>

Some 90% of these children are from the immediate catchment area of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview, which is a recognised area of social disadvantage.  It also includes a Traveller community.  In fact, one sixth of the children attending the cr&egrave;che are from the Traveller community. </p><p>  The cr&egrave;che service currently employs 55 core staff, some of whom have been there for the 13 years of its existence, and 44 staff from community employment, jobs initiative and T&uacute;s.  They include one full-time and eight community employment participants from the Traveller community.  In this regard, I believe they are unique.</p><p>  In recognition of its excellence as a cr&egrave;che, Jigsaw was presented with the S&iacute;olta award by the previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I had the pleasure of being present at the award ceremony as a Deputy for the area.</p><p>  Over recent years, the centre has had to accept financial cuts which it absorbed by way of pay cuts, changing the centre's structure, and fund-raising to the extent of &euro;112,000 in 2013.  The centre has now reached a crisis and has been in discussion with its main funders - Tusla, the Department of Social Protection, and the Childcare Directorate - to try to source an additional &euro;200,000 to keep the centre open.  The centre was recently informed by the previous Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, that further payments from Tusla would be made available while a long-term solution was being worked out.</p><p>  I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has only just commenced work in his new Department.  However, the situation is quite stark for the centre.  The only way it will remain open is by direct intervention from the Minister himself.  As a Dublin North East Deputy, I believe it is unacceptable that such a vital service as the Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service, which has the full support of the local community and public representatives, would close.</p><p>  The centre needs to know this week that these funds can be provided, as its cash flow is drying up.  The centre has informed the staff and parents of the actual date of closure, which will be by month's end or else they face the risk of trading recklessly.</p></speech>

I had an opportunity of discussing the matter briefly with Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny on the day following my appointment last Friday.</p><p>  I would like to acknowledge the importance of the services delivered by Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service Limited to some 260 children across the areas of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview.  The centre was established in January 2001 and has evolved into the largest cr&egrave;che nationally.</p><p>  In 2013, the Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022 million and received funding amounting to &euro;1.96 million.  This resulted in a deficit of some &euro;62,000.  I am aware that the centre has been experiencing cash-flow difficulties recently and that this has given rise to concerns regarding its future operation.</p><p>  In order to assist the centre, the Child and Family Agency recently prepaid funding due in May and June.  I want to acknowledge the support of the agency in this regard.  I would expect that the agency will be open to providing some further pre-payments to the centre if this is of assistance in seeking to resolve underlying issues.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency is one of a number of State agencies which provide funding to support the provision of services at the centre.  The level of support provided is significant and is being provided at a time when all service providers are faced with particular challenges arising from the need to restore order to our public finances.  The Child and Family Agency provided funding of almost &euro;360,000 last year.</p><p>  My Department is responsible for funding three child care schemes, including the community child care subvention programme, the child care education and training support programme - which are both administered by Pobal - and the early childhood care and education programme which is administered directly by my Department.  Funding to the centre under these schemes amounted to over &euro;550,000 in 2013.  This represents total funding in excess of &euro;900,000 from my Department's Vote.</p><p>  Funding is paid to the service in respect of actual attendance of children under the various programmes and funding is paid according to national capitation rates paid to all pre-school services.  The Department does not provide a grant to the service directly for salaries or administration in any way.</p><p>  I have asked my officials to meet urgently with the Child and Family Agency and with Pobal, which administers a number of child care schemes on behalf of my Department, to explore all possible solutions to the current difficulties, which I acknowledge are real.</p><p> My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently advised the centre that, in her view, the overall provision of early years services in the area might usefully be considered in seeking solutions to the current difficulties.  I concur with this view as we need to ensure all available resources to support these key services are maximised.  All services in receipt of State funding have had to generate efficiency savings and, while I appreciate the challenges involved, it is important that all such avenues are fully explored.</p><p> I mentioned the centre incurred a deficit of &euro;62,000, partly achieved through successful fund-raising.  Fund-raising projections for this year are not as strong and there is a risk of a projected deficit of up to &euro;200,000.  While I acknowledge the need to avoid such a deficit, the centre's income projections show income of &euro;1.8 million continues to be available.  With such a level of financial support, it should be possible to work constructively to achieve continued services and avoid the closure scenario the Deputies outlined.  The funders will be available to support this process.  My Department is giving the matter priority attention.  I hope a resolution to the current difficulties can be found within the total resources available to the centre and to support the provision of early years services generally in the area.</p></speech>

In the past, the HSE promised the centre funding for a specific number of staff and 40 children and operational costs, which never materialised.  Instead, it reduced funding by &euro;300,000 in the past five years.  Had the commitment been honoured, it would have given an additional &euro;191,000 for 2014.  The Minister could investigate whether the HSE reneged on a commitment.  Alternatively, Tusla could redirect some of its funding.  The question whether the Department can provide additional funding is very important because we have the most vulnerable children and the social consequences if they and their families do not have such support would be very significant.  We need urgent action.  I heard the Minister say he would try to get as many people as possible involved to try to find a solution.  It is imperative we find a solution.  This is not the only problem we have with cr&egrave;ches.  I mentioned the Ballymun cr&egrave;che earlier.  Other problems arise because of how funding is directed.</p></speech>

Is it possible for the Minister to visit the Jigsaw centre and work with Ms Kelda Barnes and her staff to examine all possible ways the project can continue throughout 2014?  Everybody is thinking of the global changes that must be made in budgetary spending and the need for a much more expansive approach from next year.  In that context, the core point facing the Minister and the centre is to get through 2014 and then to have a proper budgetary consideration for 2015.</p><p>  A few days ago I asked the Minister's predecessor about the after-school child care initiative for which &euro;14 million was allocated and under which only 42 children have been allocated places so far.  Some funding could be available in the Department that could be the core element in keeping the project open and working successfully to the end of the year.  It is the linchpin in many aspects of Darndale-Belcamp parish and the wider area.  The success of children going on to finish second level education and the growing success of people going on to third level is all based on what the cr&egrave;che does.</p></speech>

I am also glad the Minister's officials are giving the matter priority to ensure it receives funding on a proper basis.  I support the points made by the other Deputies on the importance of the centre for the entire Darndale-Belcamp area.  The area has gone through many difficulties and is beginning to improve.  The public and community services provided to children at this young age help them to get into primary school and go on to second level and third level and they are the key to tackling social disadvantage.  It is important the Minister and his officials give it the priority it needs to put the centre on a proper, permanent basis.</p></speech>

A number of options have been proposed, involving the HSE, the Child and Family Agency and my Department.  All possible options are being explored.  There have been a number of high level meetings and these will continue until resolution can be found.  I am acutely aware that access to affordable, quality child care can be a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families availing of work opportunities.  I have heard from the Deputies that it is the case in this area.  This year, my Department is providing investment totalling more than &euro;260 million to support the programmes.</p><p>  I attach a significant priority to child and family services, including the provision of early years services, which we are discussing.  I hope the difficulties at the Darndale-Belcamp centre can be satisfactorily resolved.  All the parties mentioned must work to resolve the difficulties in a constructive and proportionate manner.  I am very conscious of the point Deputy Ellis made regarding the health services and the manner in which commitments may not have been fulfilled as projected.</p><p>  As a first step, I have arranged for a meeting of the funding agencies, following which I expect there will be an early meeting with the centre to explore on a constructive basis all options for achieving a sustainable approach to the operations at the centre.  I ask all parties to work with this process, as indicated by my predecessor, to use whatever space can be provided to identify constructive solutions, of which we have had some today, which will continue to deliver a service to young children and their parents in the Darndale-Belcamp area.  I undertake to keep in close contact with the Deputies and others on the issue.</p></speech>

Today, Dr. Edel Duggan, clinical director of the National Poisons Information Centre, informed my office that she, too, is very worried about the dangers posed by electronic cigarettes.  She is especially concerned about the alarming spike in the number of children in particular who have suffered from nicotine poisoning in the past two years.  Dr. Duggan believes there could be a fatality if the problem is not addressed urgently.  Nearly as many cases of nicotine poisoning were recorded in the first three months of this year as in the whole of 2013.  The statistics we received today were frightening.  They include 17 cases, comprising 11 children under the age of six, two teenagers and four adults.  The National Poisons Information Centre believes the real number of nicotine poisoning cases is likely to be much higher.</p><p>  An electronic cigarette is a battery operated device designed to deliver nicotine, flavour and other chemicals which are vaporised into an aerosol and inhaled by the user.</p><p>These e-cigarettes contain liquid nicotine, which can cause acute illness and vomiting in young children.  Severe nicotine poisoning can lead to coma, convulsions, heart attack and respiratory arrest.  A measure of 40 milligrams per millilitre has the potential to be fatal, and some of these e-cigarettes on the market have 36 milligrams of nicotine per millilitre, which is too close for comfort.  The e-cigarette industry advises that the e-cigarette cartridges should be stored out of reach of children but as we know, children are well able to get something they want, especially if it is attractive.</p><p> Sales of e-cigarettes in Ireland have increased by 500% in the past year and it is a business in this country worth over &euro;7.3 million.  The industry is reported to have been worth &euro;3 billion on a global scale last year.  E-cigarette packaging is attractive and they have attractive flavours, which is a deliberate attempt by the industry to target young people.  The marketing is clever in that it avoids falling under any other regulatory framework that would otherwise protect the public and children in particular.  I am worried, Dr. Duggan is worried and the Minister for Health should be worried.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300033#FF00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issues.  As the Deputy is aware, I have been very public regarding my aims and objectives regarding smoking and tobacco, particularly the harm they cause in Ireland.  With regard to e-cigarettes, these products are not presented by the manufacturer as medicinal products for smoking cessation or as medical devices with a therapeutic purpose, so they do not fall under the medicinal products or medical devices legislation.  As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they are not currently regulated under Irish tobacco legislation.</p><p>  At the European level, the European Council has recently adopted a new EU tobacco products directive, which will come into force later this month.  This new directive provides for the regulation of e-cigarettes by setting mandatory safety and quality requirements, such as those on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms, etc., for e-cigarettes.  It also looks to ensure products are child-proof and tamper-proof, and this is clearly a relevant issue from what the Deputy has stated.  The directive would also make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory, introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes and impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  The tobacco products directive also states that member states are free to regulate such matters within the remit of their own jurisdiction and are encouraged to do so.</p><p>  A World Health Organization study group report concluded that the safety and extent of nicotine uptake from e-cigarettes has not been established and not enough scientific evidence existed to validate the claim that the products were smoking cessation aids.  The report also notes that the delivery of nicotine to the lung might be dangerous and that it was of global importance to address lung delivery in scientific studies.  Further research and clinical trials were recommended by that group at that time.  Of further concern, although not directly related to exposure to the potential harm from second-hand aerosol, is the impact that the use of e-cigarettes might have on the enforcement of the ban on smoking in enclosed public places.  As e-cigarettes can often look like cigarettes and emit smoke-like material, it can cause considerable confusion as to whether the person using the e-cigarettes is smoking a cigarette.</p><p>  Additionally, there is a concern that the policy objective of denormalisation of tobacco use could be compromised by the open use of e-cigarettes in places where cigarette smoking is prohibited.  This is a critical point to understand.  If one asks a smoker why he or she began the habit, the response will not be because he or she liked it.  Most people feel ill the first time they inhale smoke, as it is a toxin, a carcinogen and cigarettes kill one in two people who take up the smoking habit.  People are drawn to the habit because they feel it makes them seem &quot;cool&quot;.  If we allow e-cigarettes to facilitate people to continue with a habit that resembles smoking, we will undermine the public health policy of denormalising smoking, particularly where children are present.</p><p>  Following this rationale, the use of e-cigarettes will no longer be permitted in any of the Health Service Executive's facilities or campuses.  The ban commenced on 1 May as part of the HSE's tobacco-free campus policy, which, in line with Tobacco Free Ireland, our national policy, aims to denormalise smoking and protect the health of staff and patients.  The executive has committed to reviewing this policy as new evidence becomes available.  Other bodies have also taken the initiative, including larnr&oacute;d Eireann, and all organisations and agencies are free to do so on a voluntary basis.  My Department is currently reviewing the available international research and literature relating to e-cigarettes, including the health effects of these devices.  Based on the results of this exercise, it is my intention to introduce further regulation on e-cigarettes as necessary and appropriate.</p><p>  I acknowledge, understand and share the Deputy's concerns regarding the use of devices such as e-cigarettes.  I understand this from a health perspective both in terms of the user and people exposed to the emissions.  I am also concerned from a tobacco denormalisation perspective and taking into account any erosion of significant developments in the tobacco area in the last decade.  As stated, there is a lack of research and evidence regarding the long-term effects of such devices given that they are a relatively new phenomenon.  Whereas anecdotal evidence is emerging regarding the assistance of such devices in achieving smoking cessation, no hard evidence supports this conclusively.</p><p>  It is important to state that the majority of the manufacturers of these products do not present or licence them as smoking cessation aids.  With this in mind, the steps taken by the EU Commission in the new tobacco products directive on the regulation of e-cigarettes is a positive development.  As stated, my Department is reviewing this area and based on this I intend to further regulate this area as appropriate.</p></speech>

I welcome the HSE banning the use of e-cigarettes on its facilities, and I welcome other organisations who have voluntarily banned the use of e-cigarettes, including Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Dublin Airport and Aviva.  However, I am worried by what people like Harvard professor and director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at Harvard University, Gregory Connolly, stated recently in Dublin.  He argued that, if unregulated, e-cigarettes could be the panacea for the tobacco industry's woes by discouraging quitting and encouraging children to take up smoking.  He also indicated that, if regulated, e-cigarettes could offer a miracle in helping people to quit smoking.  Professor Connolly urged Ireland to show leadership within the EU by passing a law to regulate e-cigarettes as medical devices.</p><p>  In the meantime I will listen to Dr. Duggan's concerns that e-cigarettes could cause a fatality.  She is urging parents to keep them out of the sight and reach of children at home and be especially careful in disposing of them after use.  E-cigarettes are unregulated but they should be regulated.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, there have been 17 cases of liquid nicotine poisoning reported by the National Poisons Information Centre in Ireland and God knows how many there have been elsewhere around the world.  Nicotine is a highly addictive and dangerous drug and of what benefit is it to become addicted to nicotine?  There is no benefit, so why would one allow marketing of these products to people as a lifestyle choice when all that can come of it is harm?  If e-cigarettes have a role in smoking cessation, let it be proven before claims are made in this regard.</p><p>The World Health Organization strongly advises against the use of e-cigarettes until they are proven safe.  Studies to be published later this month indicate that some e-cigarettes produce a known carcinogen that would be inhaled by users because of fumes produced at such a high temperature.  A second study prepared for the same journal has similar findings, and I am aware of a study which indicates that nicotine by itself can facilitate progression and metastases of tumours.  A study published in <i>The Lancet</i>indicates that 94% of people who attempted to quit smoking using e-cigarettes had failed to do so after six months, which is a pretty lousy return.</p><p>E-cigarette use among teenagers in the US has doubled in a single year, which must be a grave concern for us.  Almost a quarter of teenager e-cigarette users in the US do not smoke regular cigarettes.  We all know the impact of smoking on our society, with one in two smokers dying of a related disease.  Families suffer hardship from cancers, strokes, heart attacks and the loss of meaningful and useful life years as a consequence of the habit.</p><p> I disagree utterly with the outrageous statement made by an individual on the radio recently suggesting that the very welcome reduction in people smoking was due to these products.  There is no evidence to support that for half a moment.  This reduction has been the result of tremendous work done by the Health Service Executive, HSE, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Irish Cancer Society, the Asthma Society, the Irish Lung Foundation and many others who have worked to try to inform people of the dangers of this heinous and deadly product and to prevent our children's ever taking up this habit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300034#GG00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  I am delighted to be here today to initiate the passage of this important housing Bill, which provides for innovative and necessary changes to social housing support and assistance in Ireland.  One thing that was made very clear from all contributions during the recent Private Members' debate on housing was the passion that Members feel about the need to tackle housing issues.  This Government, and I as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, share this strong passion, which we are committed to turning into effective action and reform.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 before us today is one such reforming action, an important Bill that will bring radical change to our framework of social housing support.</p><p>  As Members may be aware, the Government, in December of last year, approved the referral of the proposals contained within the Bill to the Oireachtas Sub-committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny and priority drafting of the required legislation.  In respect of the pre-legislative process, my Department submitted the proposals for such consideration in early March of this year.  I was subsequently informed by the committee, that given the overall timeline in respect of publication and enactment, it would be unable to meet the requirements of pre-legislative scrutiny by facilitating a session for consideration of the Bill and requested instead an alternative session on wider housing issues, a date for which is yet to be set.</p><p>  With the publication of this Bill, the Government meets another commitment in the programme for Government and achieves one of the key reforms announced in the policy statement of June 2011.  The priority afforded by the Government to housing will again be clearly articulated in the soon-to-be-published construction strategy.  In concert with the construction strategy, work is under way in my Department on reviewing and renewing our social housing policy, which will be published later this year.  The current housing policy statement is quite categorical in that the main focus of housing supports must be on meeting the most acute needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  This is particularly so because of the constraints on our resources.  Nevertheless, there are clear signs that we are turning the corner in respect of the Government's aims of achieving economic recovery and growing employment, which will ultimately enhance what we can achieve in housing and help reduce the numbers of those at risk.</p><p>  We are all only too familiar with the issues arising in the private and public housing sectors, most acutely seen perhaps here in Dublin than anywhere else.  The serious constraints and supply problems turn the spotlight on our housing policy and finances.  Are we getting value for money from our investment?  Are we efficient and effective?  Is our system coherent and equitable?  Most important, are we assisting the vulnerable sections of our society?</p><p>  As public representatives we see the growing and changing demand for housing supports every day.  We need a system of housing supports that is more effective, more efficient, more coherent and that better serves the needs of people.  It has long been accepted that one of our key State housing supports, the rent supplement system, was ill-used and was becoming a much more long-term support than was ever intended.  This Bill is a key step in reforming rent supplement.  The new housing assistance payment, HAP, which is provided for in the Bill, will introduce a more coherent and joined-up system of housing support that will be better for tenants, landlords and housing authorities.</p><p>  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 in providing for a more coherent, responsive system of housing support, places all long-term supports with local authorities which will make for a better, fairer system.  In addition, the Bill provides for the implementation of mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions due to housing authorities from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants which is a key provision in avoiding and combatting the build-up of rent arrears that cause significant financial difficulty for local authorities but most of all for tenants.  The HAP is an opportunity to improve standards and levels of compliance, to remove employment traps, and to create a more equal and fair social housing system where the rights and opportunities available to tenants in different forms of social housing are vastly improved.  The Bill also provides for two other significant areas of reform, namely, the termination of local authority tenancies and tenant purchase of local authority houses.</p><p>  Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 has withstood judicial scrutiny over the years but the enactment of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 resulted in a stream of litigation claiming that the section 62 repossession procedure used by housing authorities is incompatible with the convention.  The Supreme Court delivered a judgment in 2012 in two such cases, making a declaration under the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 in respect of one of these cases.  In its judgment, it declared that section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 is incompatible with the convention where there was a factual dispute about the basis for the evictions, as it does not provide for an independent hearing of the merits of the proposed eviction.  The court, however, made no such declaration in the second case, where it found there was no dispute as to the basis for the proposed repossession.  New legislation is therefore required in this area in order to provide for repossession procedures that are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights Act.</p><p>  I believe the changes proposed in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 deserve the widespread support of both Houses and of all Members of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is set out in five parts with 51 sections and I will refer in some detail to the main provisions.</p><p>  Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with Title, collective citations, construction and commencement.  It also provides for interpretation of key terms, regulations, orders and directions, repeals, revocations and amendments to the Housing Acts, including the Housing Act 2009 which remains a core housing statute, as well as other technical provisions such as legal savers and provision for expenses.</p><p>  Part 2 repeals the repossession procedure set out in section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 and sets out a revised procedure for repossessing local authority dwellings where serious breaches of tenancy agreements have occurred, including anti-social behaviour and breaches of rescheduling arrangements for rent arrears.  Warnings issued to tenants by housing authorities for such breaches will include the right of the tenant to request a review of the warning.  Sections 7 to 11 set out procedures for tenancy warnings and their review.  In the case of non-compliance with tenancy warnings for anti-social behaviour, housing authorities will have strengthened powers under sections 12 and 13 to either recover possession of the dwelling or seek an exclusion order as appropriate.</p><p>  Sections 14 to 17 deal with abandoned local authority dwellings and recovery of property in the case of death of a tenant and certain other cases.  This part also provides a legislative mechanism to update all existing local authority tenancy agreements to reflect new legislation without the necessity to terminate all existing agreements for the purpose of entering into new agreements incorporating updated terms and conditions.</p><p>  I think we can all agree that we do not wish to see many tenancies terminated in this way, but we all also know the havoc and misery that anti-social behaviour can cause to communities.  It is important that we have a mechanism available that meets the highest standards of the human and civil rights obligations of all concerned.</p><p>  I will now to turn to one of the measures contained in the Bill most sought after by tenants.  Part 3 provides for an incremental purchase scheme for existing houses which will cover local authority houses other than newly-built or newly-acquired houses and local authority apartments, which are covered by the existing incremental purchase schemes under the 2009 Act.  The incremental purchase scheme detailed in sections 21 to 31 offers several key benefits.  For families, the scheme offers the path to home ownership for those willing and able to undertake a house purchase.  The scheme is also structured to make it attractive for people to retain long-term roots in the community and to continue their commitment to an area, thereby contributing to more stable and integrated communities.</p><p>  In due course, I will make regulations on specific aspects of the new scheme, including the qualifying conditions for applicants, calculation of discounts, the method used by local authorities to determine the purchase price and discount, and the period of the charging order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.321" nospeaker="true" time="19:20:00" ><p>Consideration is also being given to the inclusion of certain other criteria for discounts in certain circumstances while a provision for clawback is being planned for in respect of the State benefiting appropriately from any resale of purchased property.  This is a worthwhile and innovative initiative deserving the support of the House.</p><p>I would like to turn to what is probably the most important and certainly the most reforming part of the Bill.  Part 4 provides the statutory framework for the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  This new scheme is being designed to bring all long-term social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system.  In order for a household to qualify for HAP, its qualification for social housing support will have to be determined by a housing authority through a statutory social housing assessment and the authority must be satisfied that assistance under the scheme is an appropriate form of support for that household.  HAP beneficiaries will source their own accommodation in the private rented market, as currently happens with rent supplement, and will enter into a tenancy agreement with the landlord concerned.  The housing authority will pay the rent for the accommodation directly to the landlord on behalf of the household, which will be required to pay a rent contribution to the authority calculated in accordance with the authority's differential rent scheme.  To be included in the HAP scheme, the accommodation must meet the statutory standards for rented accommodation and the landlord must be tax compliant.  These provisions will provide a new framework for the provision of long-term rental assistance and, in collaboration with other measures, can facilitate the removal of some existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.</p><p>The Bill also includes provisions detailing when a household would be considered ineligible to receive HAP, or cease to receive such support, and provisions on controls around tenancy changes and amendments to the Housing Acts 1966 to 2013 that are consequential on the introduction of HAP.  There are also provisions allowing for transitional arrangements to facilitate the roll-out of HAP in Limerick and the six housing authorities selected for participation in the first phase of HAP, following the successful progress of this Bill.</p><p>Part 5 includes a number of miscellaneous provisions, notably section 49 which provides for the implementation of mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions due to housing authorities from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants.  This Part also includes provisions for data sharing and exchange between housing authorities, the Department of Social Protection, my Department and other relevant bodies for the administration of the housing functions of local authorities.</p><p>While the Bill before the House addresses a wide range of issues, there are additional aspects still under development, which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.  Following review of the proposals concerned, I will bring appropriate text to Government in relation to these and any related amendments for approval for inclusion on Committee Stage.  The main areas concerned are residency requirements for households seeking social housing support, an internal review procedure for certain HAP decisions, a power to allow a local authority to enter into an agreement with another body in relation to the performance of one or more of its housing functions and a number of amendments to the social welfare code, consequent to the introduction of HAP.</p><p>This Bill provides long awaited coherence and equity to long-term social housing support.  I am confident that it will improve the ability of housing authorities to plan and deliver their services in a coherent, flexible and responsive manner by bringing all long-term social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system.  The Bill provides equity for those in receipt of housing assistance from the State, for those in receipt of long-term rent supplement and for those in traditional social housing.  It also provides for legal clarity in respect of repossession procedures and brings coherence and consistency to tenant purchase within the State.  This Bill is more than anything else tenant-focused and it will change the housing landscape in Ireland to the benefit of the tenant.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I have serious concerns about the legislation.  For those who are homeless, on social housing lists and renting on a low or middle income, the economic recovery's most tangible impact is to make the prospect of home ownership and stable accommodation a more distant possibility than possibly ever before.  This Bill does not address the chronic lack of supply in housing units and the Government's inaction on the matter.  Instead it seeks to address matters that would be relevant if there was an adequate supply of social housing and a rental market that was not in crisis.  This is not the situation in towns and cities across the country where people are struggling to get a foothold.</p><p>In terms of the specific details of the Bill, there are a number of issues I would like to address.  To access the housing assistance payments, HAP, scheme a household will complete a social housing assessment by the local authority.  Once the household has secured appropriate accommodation in the private rented sector, the local authority will pay the landlord directly, with a contribution by the household paid directly to the local authority.  As everyone in this House is acutely aware, there is a massive shortage of accommodation in the rental sector.  Not only will this adversely affect the cost of rent paid by the householder, but the sheer shortage of supply will severely reduce the number of people who can avail of the HAP scheme.  Furthermore, by placing the onus on the tenant to find suitable private accommodation, the Government is merely attempting to cover for its own shortcomings and abysmal record in delivering housing to those in need.  </p><p>The volatility of the rental market at present, with rents reaching run-away levels, will severely hinder the capacity or the capability of HAP and the rental supplement.  The existence of a maximum level of rent which can be subsidised by the local authority requires tenants to pay a top-up from their social welfare payment which will impact on their standard of living and force tenants back towards substandard accommodation that is not approved under the scheme.  The core issue is the lack of adequate supply in the social housing market, which the Government is doing precious little to alleviate, and no amount of window dressing will distract people from the real problem at hand.</p><p>We appreciate that there may be extenuating circumstances by which continued breach of a tenancy agreement may require extraordinary action to be taken.  However, surely the focus should be on dissuading the tenant from committing such breaches.  If a housing authority is to recover such a dwelling, who becomes responsible for housing the tenant who has been evicted?  Removing people from their homes simply feeds into the cycle of homelessness and passes the problem back to the local authority which is legally obliged to house such people.</p><p>The tenant purchase element of the Bill makes no allowance for the reinvestment of funds gained by the local authority through tenants buying their local authority dwelling.  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently identified the need for local authorities to ring-fence and reinvest money collected locally into the very services that will benefit the local authority's immediate area.</p><p>In a week in which the United Nations committee behind the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty is meeting in Dublin, the latest statistics present a damning indictment of this Government's abysmal performance in providing the most basic need of housing for the Irish people.  Inner City Helping Homeless, ICHH, recently said the issue of homelessness in Dublin has surpassed &quot;crisis point&quot;.  The Dublin regional homeless executive confirmed that rough sleeping in the city had increased by &quot;a shocking 200 per cent in the past 12 months&quot;.  Focus Ireland had reported an 18% increase in demand for its services this year.  Experts in the area calculate that an estimated 3,000 housing units are needed to address long-term homelessness with the &quot;housing first&quot; policy.  There can be absolutely no doubt that the Government is presiding over the greatest crisis in homelessness in the history of this State.</p><p>The latest quarterly report by property website <i>daft.ie</i>, written by Trinity College assistant professor of economics, Ronan Lyons, has identified some alarming trends in the rental sector and has stated the country is now in the midst of a housing crisis.  Rental prices are now approaching levels they were at during the peak of the boom.  Rents have risen in all cities, with Cork and Galway experiencing a 6% rise, Limerick a 5% rise and Waterford a 1% rise.  Dublin has experienced the largest annual increase in rent of 14%.  Supply of accommodation needs to quadruple in Dublin; otherwise, those on lower incomes will be further marginalised and pushed right out of the market.</p><p>The lack of social housing means there now exists little or no safety net for a housing market that is fast becoming the preserve of a few at the expense of those on middle and low incomes.</p><p> There are now almost 100,000 people on the social housing waiting list.  Legislation the Government introduced such as the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, which is essentially a home repossession Act, has further exacerbated the problem by giving banks the power to repossess struggling home owners' properties.</p><p> There have been consistent delays in transferring NAMA properties, as we have said on numerous occasions during Question Time and other debates in the House, with only 500 transferred to date even though ten times that amount has been identified by NAMA as suitable for transfer.  That is a very poor reflection on the House.  We should think of the social dividend that was to have been availed of from NAMA.  We have had announcements, year on year, about what NAMA would deliver.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a dedicated, section within each local authority to speed up that process and address the major deficiencies and under-achievements in realising the expectations the Minister of State and others had, given what NAMA had at its disposal.</p><p> In 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, stated that 2,000 housing units would be made available in 2012 to people on social housing lists through NAMA.  Two years on, we are nowhere near that level of progress.  The commitment given by the senior Minister that 2,000 housing units would be made available has failed.  It needs a new focus, direction and commitment.  A dedicated section within each local authority to deal with the mechanics - legal or otherwise - would be well informed and would have the potential to achieve the sorts of results we had all hoped would have been achieved by now.</p><p> To make matters worse, overall capital expenditure by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been reduced from &euro;740 million in 2013 to &euro; 311 million this year.  It gives me no great pleasure to say that these figures along with what has gone before represent a litany of broken promises by the Government and offer no comfort to the tens of thousands of people who are being consumed by the crisis in the housing sector.</p><p> We have outlined a series of real and practical steps the Government should seek to include in any future housing legislation the Minister of State might bring before the House.  At the conclusion of her speech, she said she hoped to introduce a more comprehensive housing Bill to address these issues in the coming weeks.  That is needed to tackle the interlinked private and social housing crisis.  The Government should develop voluntary housing associations to a scale where they can access credit and start to build.  It should use the tenant purchase scheme to fund future investments by local authorities.  It should allow families on waiting lists to move into vacant homes and defray the costs of refurbishing them from future rent.  We all know about the many empty units boarded up and not being availed of while many people on housing lists are crying out for those units.  There is obviously something preventing the Minister of State from allowing families to refurbish them and have the cost defrayed on their rent.  She should investigate doing that. </p><p> The Government should move towards a new capital expenditure programme for local authorities in excess of what it has promised.  I know there are constraints on what it can do, but it should consider the National Pensions Reserve Fund in this regard.</p><p> The Government should ease restrictions on planning permissions and reduce development levies.  These levies must be looked at and the Minister of State must give direction and leadership in that area to provide openings in the housing sector to spur on development.  The Government should reduce windfall zoning tax to encourage development and introduce a vacant site levy.  It should enable local authorities to suspend Part V requirements for a two-year period in order to see if that will encourage the sort of development we want to see.  It should digitise planning process to improve times and reduce costs.</p><p> We are committed, as I am sure the Minister of State is also, to tackling the social housing waiting list.  We need to revitalise the construction sector on a sustainable footing to get construction workers back in long-term employment and re-assert the fundamental right to housing for all citizens.</p><p> The Minister of State has stated the legislation will give effect to three important elements of the Government's housing policy.  It is clear from the social housing crisis, a rental market that has reached boom time levels and record levels of homelessness that the Government does not have a housing policy of any substance.  This Bill unfortunately falls abysmally short of what is required and represents a cynical ploy in box ticking and electioneering in the midst of the local election campaign.</p></speech>

I welcome that we are discussing the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  I am concerned at some of the comments the Minister of State made.  I am disappointed that when we are discussing homelessness, as we have been for some weeks in the D&aacute;il, and when we are discussing the issue of increasing rents, we are not here this evening talking about doing something that would lead to extra housing or addressing the issue of rents.</p><p>  The most positive thing to come from the Minister of State is the tenant purchase scheme, which is not a new scheme and is one many that tenants have been awaiting.  We have had these schemes in the past.  When a scheme is about to finish, people are worried if the following scheme will be better or worse than the previous one.</p><p>  Having listened to the Minister of State, she obviously has other things to say about exclusions to the scheme.  In responding, I hope she will refer to the situations where there would be exclusions to the tenant purchase scheme.  She has referred in particular to section 30 which provides that the Minister may proscribe other classes of houses to which the scheme shall not apply, which concerns me.</p><p>  I am also concerned that in many cases tenants cannot purchase a house.  In some cases where I have supported voluntary housing associations getting involved in housing, tenants then find they cannot purchase the house.  I have always argued for it.  Even when my party was in power we were not able to do it and I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not addressed that most important issue in the Bill.  There are many categories of housing in which tenants cannot buy out the house and it should be clarified.</p><p>  The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill states that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the following: a tenancy warning by a housing authority, which sounds very negative; a procedure to recover possession of a dwelling, which I presume would be as a last resort but again is very negative; a scheme of tenant purchase, which I welcome but would like more detail; a new scheme of housing assistance payments, HAP, which sounds like it is cutting red tape if the local authority is to be involved; and a mandatory facility for the deduction from social welfare payments due to local authority tenants and HAP and RAS beneficiaries of rents, rent contributions and rent arrears payable to housing authorities, which again is very negative and deals with recoupment.</p><p>  I am very concerned that we are not talking about the real issue, which is helping homeless people and people who are paying rents and above all looking at the issue of building houses.</p><p>Given the Government's commitment to construction, I hope there will be construction of social housing in the very near future because there is a crisis.  Every expert in the field has said we face a crisis in housing.</p><p>I refer to the headlines in the newspapers over the past few days.  The<i>Irish Independent</i>stated that rents jumped by 9% over chronic homes shortage while <i>The Irish Times</i>referred, in particular, to Dublin where, according to <i>daft.ie</i>, rents have jumped 14% in one year.  The average increase in rent was 9% while in Dublin it was 14%.  There has been a reduction in the amount of rental properties available.  Some 10,000 rental properties were advertised in Dublin in the first four months of the year compared to 18,000 in the same four month period in 2012.  </p><p>There is a crisis which we should discuss.  Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to do that because this Bill is as its Title suggests and relates to miscellaneous provisions.  It does not deal with the real issues.  We have already seen increases in cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  In Wicklow and Kildare, the commuter belt of Dublin, there was an increase of 9%.</p><p>The economist, Ronan Lyons, said that the latest <i>daft.ie</i>report showed that the housing crisis in Dublin is getting worse.  He said the solution was not capping rents, which would limit the supply of new homes, but rather addressing the underlying problems, in particular, streamlining the cost of land and regulation.  In all the debates I have heard, even on &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night, people have talked about what could be done with planning permissions and they mentioned, in particular, that 30,000 planning permissions were not used.  These are the issues which should be looked at.  Any steps that can be taken, as Deputy Cowen mentioned, to try to make more housing available, whether by reforming planning, looking at the levies, looking at VAT and so on, should certainly be considered.  I hope we will have a serious look at what we are doing in regard to housing.  </p><p>Two weeks ago we had a debate on a motion tabled by the Technical Group.  There was much emphasis on Dublin, and rightly so because cities like Dublin and other urban centres are now facing real problems.  People have told some harrowing stories of the plight of homeless families.  We are now talking about families and children rather than just individuals becoming homeless.  There was the well publicised example of the mother and her five children who spent three months in a hotel room in Dublin and of another mother and her three children who lived in a car, although I know efforts were made to help the family.  I hope we can look at these situations.  It is not enough to talk about helping people because, as has been pointed out in the debates, sometimes we move families away from their own areas and even move children from their schools.  We talk about the education of children but it is very unfortunate that families can be sent to accommodation, welcome as it may be, a long way from where the children go to school or where they lived.  </p><p>If the figures are correct, more than 170 families, including 500 children, have been allocated temporary hotel accommodation by the local authorities.  These families, like many others, are in a queue for social housing.  We should look at the situation with NAMA.  We have been told NAMA units are available for housing and yet we do not have dedicated units for NAMA in local authorities.  I suggest there should be dedicated units in NAMA itself.  </p><p>The construction industry has been in decline, with a collapse to approximately 6.5% of GNP, which is well below the international average.  There has been a reduction in the private sector and we understand that only 10% of homes earmarked by NAMA for social housing have been transferred to local authorities.  Much more can be done in this area to make housing available and to support voluntary housing, in particular.  I have put proposals to the Minister in regard to Ballinasloe and I hope voluntary housing can be promoted and can get the credit and facilities to start building for people who are homeless and disadvantaged.  </p><p>I am disappointed in the Bill in that we are not discussing the issues but talking about penalties and what can be done about possession and repossession of houses.  I would like to get more information on the tenant purchase scheme, in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="19:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300037#KK00200"><p>Irish to follow.</p><p>We have waited more than three years for a significant legislation on housing from this Government.  This Bill is certainly significant and contains some improvements to how local authority tenancies are managed but it will do very little to change the course of the housing crisis we currently face.</p><p>Currently, just under 90,000 households are on housing waiting lists across the State.  This represents well over 100,000 men, women and children who are currently not adequately housed.  Some are living in dangerous, overcrowded, unsecure, unaffordable and downright inhumane conditions.  Many others simply cannot afford to house themselves in the private market due to unemployment, poverty or other factors.  These figures represent the most vulnerable in our society - those who are denied the most basic right of a secure roof over their heads.  They occupy modern slums, emergency accommodation, overcrowded family homes, hostels, bed and breakfasts and hotels, most of which is at the expense of local authorities.  They sleep on friends sofas.  I have spoken to people who are not living but are simply surviving as heart-breaking testimonials to the ability of human beings to endure.  Some are even sleeping in cars as we have seen recently.</p><p>Some 78,000 households are unable to afford the private market must rely on rent supplement from the State.  This subsidy, which is a subsidy of a private market which cannot provide for those in need, costs us &euro;344 million a year.  That is nearly &euro;4,500 per household in receipt of it.  Many on rent supplement are dependent on social welfare, in part due to a ban on them working over a very limited number of hours.  Illegal top-ups following the introduction of two separate cuts to rent supplement rates and the new rent thresholds have led many families to extreme deprivation in order to meet exorbitant rents which is the only term one could use to describe rent rates currently.  </p><p>In Dublin alone, rents have gone up by 14% since this time last year and rents had already been rising steadily for the past four years.  There is one simple reason for this which the Minister seems to want to ignore.  Landlords are in a position now where they can charge anything they want and people desperate for a decent place to live will pay -  <i>daft.ie</i>has never been so empty as rent properties are snapped up in hours, taken without even a viewing.  Landlords are now abandoning rent supplement and RAS as they believe they can do very well without such State aid and the annoyance of the greater bureaucracy and the choice between setting reasonable rents or demanding illegal top-ups.</p><p>The Government seems to have forgotten that the private market is about profit and right now profits are very good.</p><p>There is no desire for private landlords to provide housing for all; in fact, that is bad for business as far as they are concerned.  It is a very basic case of supply and demand.  That is why we need the State to intervene where the public good is not served by this model.  I do not believe there are many cases where it does serve the public good but certainly in housing the profit model left to itself is actively damaging to the public good.  It was the profit model in housing and the light touch regulation which led us into economic collapse and it will do nothing to tackle the housing crisis it created.</p><p> The recent Constitutional Convention recommended that the right to a home be enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and that it be enforced by the courts.  We believe that people do have a right to a home whether it is enshrined in the Constitution or not.  We urge the Government to set a date for the referendum but we strongly urge that the Minister work in the here and now to realise a right which has already been signed up to by the State under the UN convention.  At present, the right to a home is a sick joke in the State.  There are measures which the Government could undertake today which would ease the problems in housing and the suffering of so many people.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined how &euro;1 billion identified in the strategic investment fund could be invested in social housing.  The plan would see the building of approximately 7,500 homes over 18 months while creating jobs, raising council revenue and saving money on emergency accommodation and rent supplement.  The new housing stock would also help to reduce rent rates which would further bring down the rent supplement bill and protect private tenants at risk of losing their homes due to soaring rent rates.  Of the &euro;1 billion, &euro;985 million could be spent on building 6,502 new homes for social housing, as well as renovating the final 948 homes left over after recently announced Government plans to deal with long-term vacant housing.</p><p> Those 7,500 homes represent 7,500 families given a new lease of life, a secure home and a chance to live in dignity.  It represents thousands of jobs and millions in savings for the State.  If 7,500 families were taken off rent supplement, it would save more than &euro;30 million a year on the budget.  It would reduce waiting lists in 18 months by nearly a tenth on top of housing promised by the Government already.  The cost of allowing people to remain homeless and in emergency accommodation is so great that many other housing authorities around the world have decided it would be more cost effective simply to house as many as possible immediately in whatever housing is available and suitable.  The authorities would then pay the entire rent and provide supports as needed.  That has been found to be more cost effective and has been shown to be a successful way to end homelessness or at least cut down on homeless numbers considerably.  In Utah, the housing authority is on track not just with strategy, but in real terms, to end homelessness.  It decided that to house people was a more cost-effective route and that is exactly what it did.  It has reduced long-term homelessness by 74% over eight years while the approach in this country has seen homeless figures rise by similar percentages in recent years.</p><p> At present, almost 300 people are staying in hotels across Dublin every single day.  The cost to the city is approximately &euro;20,000 a day and millions a year.  That is a wrong approach.  This is the busy season for hotels and any person put out of a hotel now adds to the homeless list.  I am aware of examples of that happening.  The Minister of State has supported some Housing First pilot schemes but we face a major problem in emulating Utah and other places which have put full support behind the model.  We do not have sufficient homes available to house people.  That is a major problem and there is one solution.  A major investment in social housing is required, as outlined previously by me and Sinn F&eacute;in.  One cannot house people in homes that do not exist or further distort the private market with State subsidy of rents.</p><p> That brings me to the important point of the urgent need to deal with rents.  Rents are too high and it is damaging to society and the economy.  Landlords are cleaning up while local businesses falter as people struggle to make their rent which represents a growing portion of their outgoings - swallowing up their monthly income.  Rent control is not a new idea.  It has been tried and tested in many places around the world and has been successful in keeping rents at a fair level when implemented reasonably and in conjunction with the provision of social housing.  Just last month the British Labour Party unveiled a plan to introduce rent controls.  Perhaps it is time the Labour Party took a leaf out of the book of its sister party across the pond.</p><p> I recognise and appreciate that the Minister has commissioned a report on rent control but that is not enough.  We need action on rents now.  A major rent bubble is being created.  A report was commissioned on deposit retention schemes by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in 2009.  We are still waiting for the scheme which is badly needed.  In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in submitted an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Bill in 2013 which would have provided for such a scheme but it was rejected by the Minister.  This cannot be a re-run.</p><p> I also call on the Minister to deal with the immediate and very worrying problem being faced by rent supplement recipients who face eviction due to their landlords demanding rent above the current threshold.  That is a very serious and widespread problem and poses a real danger to many families of being put on the street and therefore in need of emergency accommodation.  The Minister of State has made remarks on directing community welfare officers, CWOs, to operate with discretion in order to avoid evictions.  I urge that she would push at Cabinet level that the Department of Social Protection would issue a directive in that regard.  The Department must look beyond the short-term cost of breaking its own threshold and consider the long-term expense and human suffering of the families being made homeless and forced to take up emergency accommodation.  Is it not better that families are kept in their homes for a few euro more a day than to be placed in a hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation for close to &euro;100 a night without cooking or cleaning facilities and at the whim of the management?  Homeless people have been told to queue up in hotel foyers and wait until accommodation becomes available.  In many cases more than one room is required for families.  In some cases it costs a couple of hundred euro a day to accommodate a family in a hotel.  It is that kind of short-term thinking that got us to the position where the biggest local authority in the State - Dublin City Council - built only 29 homes last year while tens of thousands in the city are desperate for homes.</p><p> Those are the great problems faced by the people in need of housing in the State and this Bill will not do much for them.  That said, there are some welcome improvements on current policy, although more could be done even on those points.  The eviction of local authority tenants and repossession of the home is a very difficult subject but I welcome that the Bill does take steps towards improving what was a wholly insufficient procedure in terms of the rights of the tenant but also those around them - the people who have to suffer where there are anti-social elements.  The current legislation has been shown to be in violation of the EU Convention on Human Rights.  It allowed local authorities to summarily evict people with a rubber stamp from the District Court.  That was rightly ruled by the Supreme Court to be incompatible with the State's obligations.  Tenants who face eviction should have the right to a fair hearing and due process.  A local authority cannot be allowed to evict tenants on a whim or for other biased and unfair reasons, as evident in the case of my friend, Councillor John Brady, in Bray, who was given an eviction notice for rocking the boat and advocating on behalf of two women who were forced to live with their children in completely unsuitable emergency accommodation.</p><p> In the early stages of the drafting of the Bill, it stated that local authorities would have to give 15 days warning to any tenant that they were seeking to evict, allowing them time to prepare for the process.  That has been reduced to ten working days.  Focus Ireland rightly said that this should be 30 days in order to allow appropriate time to gather advice and information.  I support the call and will seek an amendment in this regard on the next Stage.  Eviction is not a solution to anti­social behaviour issues and it is and should always be a last resort.</p><p>This would allow appropriate time to gather advice and information.  I support this call and we will seek an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</p><p> Eviction is not the solution to anti-social issues and it should always be a last resort.  Anyone evicted from a local authority tenancy is then the responsibility of the local authority when he or she requires emergency accommodation.  This should not be forgotten, and the damage this can do to a family unit can be much greater potentially than the anti-social behaviour in which a person was engaging.  This trauma could make it even more difficult to deal properly with anti­social elements in a family.  It must also be remembered that where criminal activity takes place it is a matter for the Garda.</p><p> The provision for giving tenancy warnings could be useful in preventing minor anti-social issues from developing into very serious problems.  Issuing these warnings and the process which follows must be clear and transparent and allow for proper engagement between the tenant, the party responsible for the problem and the council.  This should not be allowed to be a measure for punishing or penalising people who are seen as a nuisance by council officials for whatever reason not related to actual anti-social behaviour.  As tenants deserve a fair hearing in the eviction process, they must also be allowed a fair hearing in this regard.</p><p> We feel, considering the housing crisis we face, that allowing someone with no succession rights to stay in a home which could be completely inappropriate for them for six months is not acceptable.  There have been cases where single people who did not have any right to the former home of their deceased family member stayed in the property for an extended period of time.  I recently came across this with regard to a four-bedroomed home.  With so many families in desperate need, it is unacceptable that people should stay for long periods after being told to leave the premises.  This needs to be addressed.  If one does not have a recognised housing need and succession rights, there should be no more than a period of respect for the bereaved and an appropriate opportunity for the person to find alternative accommodation and remove possessions or other items.  A problem often faced by local authorities is that people are very slow to remove items from houses.  In some cases it is a sentimental issue as the houses are regarded as family homes, although the people involved have no succession rights.  However, this sentimentality does not give them a right to stay there and this is clear.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in respects the right of local authority tenants to buy, and this is important in maintaining communities and avoiding poor social mix, but this must not be allowed to deplete the social housing stock without sufficient replacement and an increase in the stock.  While we support the inclusion of a tenant purchase scheme, we believe the State must implement a significant house building initiative as a matter of priority.  We also believe the money obtained from these houses should go back into social housing and should be targeted in this way.  The State should not be allowed throw the money into the mix for other measures.  It is very important to replace the stock and give people the right to buy their own house.</p><p> We welcome the introduction of the housing assistance payment as a much needed improvement on the rent supplement system, but it marks a failure of this Government and successive Governments to ensure that rent supplement remained a stop-gap measure for private tenants in difficulty.  The Government has now adopted an approach which seems to desire a system whereby the State does not provide housing but incentivises the private profit market to do its job in social housing.  The voluntary housing groups are doing a massive job, but the main delivery of social housing should come from local authorities because they are the best source.  Unfortunately, we seem to be going in the opposite direction and the Government is drawing back.  This approach cannot and will not work because the private market is incapable of providing housing to the extent it is needed at the value required.  The State is the only vehicle for the delivery of quality affordable housing for those most in need.</p><p> We support the improved provision for people to work while receiving housing assistance, but share Focus Ireland's concern that maintaining people who have become unemployed more recently on rent supplement is unlikely to help end the poverty trap it has perpetuated over the years, given these are the people most likely to return to work in the short or medium term.  Placing only those who are long-term unemployed in the position whereby they can work while allowing those newly unemployed to remain within rent supplement constraints makes no sense.</p><p> We also share the Simon Communities' concerns about the standards of accommodation.  The State should strongly avoid subsidising landlords providing substandard housing.  It is already scandalous that some landlords in receipt of rent supplement are not even registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  This is totally unacceptable.</p><p> I strongly oppose the idea of putting in place a system to mandatorily deduct rent arrears from the income and social welfare of tenants and rent assistance recipients.  Social housing has been allowed by successive Governments to become the last resort for the most vulnerable and poorest in society.  Those in social housing or receiving social housing support are not affluent.  In cases where arrears are owed, usually the people involved have failed to budget correctly following a drop in income or a new expense.  New medicines, social welfare cuts, water charges, back to school expenses and accidentally undeclared new incomes are often the cause of accrued rent arrears.</p><p> In most cases tenants are happy to work with councils to plan repayments.  Most of the tenants with rent arrears whom I have dealt with would have no problem with a direct debit type scheme for repayment of arrears which was reasonable.  To do this mandatorily would be a very negative step in how councils and their tenants relate to each other.  It certainly would not be acceptable for a private landlord to be able to syphon money out of a tenant's account without permission to pay arrears.  My experience of local authorities, in particular Dublin City Council, is that they pull out all the stops to deal with people in arrears and they are generally very flexible.  We need to be careful about making this mandatory and taking the money from social welfare payments.  In the past some people have had a choice between putting bread on the table or paying rent and in some cases this is how the rent fell behind.  The current system of repayment of arrears, while not perfect and requiring renewed focus, has the potential to work well and is based on co-operation between tenants and the councils.  This change would be devastating if applied in some cases and I am strongly opposed to it.</p><p> The Minister of State said the plan is to end long-term homelessness by 2016.  At present, given that 5,000 people are homeless, this target seems virtually impossible to achieve.  Last month, approximately 40 new people were reported as homeless.  How will we end it?  I support the idea of home purchase and the right of tenants to purchase their own homes.  I will wait to see the method and mechanism to be used and these are extremely important.  I would like to see financial contributions used more to get more housing.  It has proved successful in the past and delivered much housing for local authorities.  Without rent control, all we will do is increase prices because once the local authorities start trying to buy prices go through the roof and we have seen this happen in the past.</p><p> In many of the cases where homeless people are in hotels they are not near schools.  They have been put in far away places and moved around.  They must be kept as close as possible to their communities, schools and places they access.  This should be a priority.  I acknowledge there is desperation, that hotels are being chased and people are being put left, right and centre.  Some people have been obliged to attend two or three different schools within months because their families have been moved from one place to another.  This is absolutely scandalous and is putting enormous pressure on people.</p><p> Over the past two years, a number of rules have been introduced in respect of local authorities.  I believe the change regarding the crossing over from one local authority to another has caused huge problems and must be reconsidered.  In the so-called good times, many people went to places such as Cavan or wherever and bought into them but now find themselves in serious trouble.  Many people are trying to get back to places where their families were or where they had their communities only to meet this obstacle of crossing over from one local authority to another.  It is the same in respect of people on the housing waiting lists in that one cannot go on to Fingal's list if one is living within Dublin City Council's limits or if one lives in Fingal, one cannot go on to the city council's lists.  This policy, which has only been introduced within the last couple of years, must be reconsidered.  It has cut down the choices for many people in respect of places in which they had lived and where they wished to be.</p><p> There is another issue about which I remain unclear.  I refer to people who had family homes but who lost those homes or in cases in which there was familial discord between the husband and wife or the partners and people were obliged to move out.  The experience in some local authorities has been that such people cannot get housing through rent supplement.  In some cases, Dublin City Council has been more flexible and provided such people with a housing needs letter enabling them to approach the welfare officers.  This issue must be examined as it is highly unfair that in some local authorities, someone who unfortunately breaks up with a partner and now finds him or herself out of a home and who is unemployed etc., is being excluded from getting on the housing list.  The rule must be applied across the board.  One cannot have one rule in Cork and another rule in Dublin because from what I have heard, this seems to be what is happening across the country.  This issue also must be examined because the position must be clarified for people.</p><p> The housing crisis now is in the worst state I have ever seen.  I have never seen so many people in desperate need and have never seen so many people in such dire situations.  I acknowledge this did not simply happen on the Minister of State's watch.  It happened under the previous Government and unfortunately, even during the so-called boom, the quantity of social housing that should have been produced was not produced.  However, another area that may require reconsideration or re-examination is the Part V provisions.  The Minister of State has indicated there will be some changes in this regard but were building to recommence, I would not like to think the 20% provision that originally had been gained from large housing groups and schemes would be conceded.  Members should be reluctant to concede in this regard and that position should be maintained.  I acknowledge the Labour Party has strong views in this respect and I certainly believe Members should remain strong on this issue.  Members should not concede that provision too easily.  I acknowledge that not many houses are being built at present but if things are moving and if the housing market begins to be addressed, it is important to get those units.  In addition, Members should consider the issue of affordable housing with a view to ensuring the State is in a position to pursue it.  That is an area that has worked very well over the years with the local authorities.</p><p> The Minister of State has an awful job ahead of her because the housing situation is absolutely calamitous at present.  Moreover, it will get worse because a huge number of people are in mortgage distress.  The homeless situation will continue and in my opinion it will increase.  The housing lists will lengthen because the authorities are firefighting at present and even those firefighting measures are going nowhere near helping to alleviate the situation because it has become so bad.  Were the banks to become more aggressive - all the signs are that they will - this country will be facing one of the worst human problems seen here for many a year.  That is my worry and the banks must be put in their place in this regard.  Consideration must be given to demanding that people who cannot afford a mortgage should remain in their homes and pay rent.  This possibility must be considered and Members need to be making the point that people cannot be put out.  It does not make sense economically to seize these homes and for people to be put out.  This issue must be addressed and while I do not know the Minister of State's intentions on this issue, I certainly will be watching closely as to what is to be done and how this problem will be tackled because this is the major crisis that is yet to come.  While it already is with us, it will get worse.</p></speech>

One aspect of the legislation may have a marginal impact on the crisis we face and I will turn to that in a minute.  However, against the overall background of record numbers of people presenting as homeless, that is, six per day, probably the longest housing waiting list seen in the history of the State, families with children presenting in increasing number as homeless because of a dramatic rise in rents and a chronic shortage of local authority housing, this Bill really is pathetic.</p><p>  I had wished to see something positive because all I really want now is to be able to turn around to the families who are presenting to my clinic and to tell them there is a solution, there is light at the end of the tunnel and that they may have somewhere secure to live in a few weeks' time or even in a few months' time.  Unfortunately however, this Bill does not offer that and nor does it offer any means to deal with the underlying madness of social housing policy as it is has been administered in recent years under both the present Government and its predecessor.  This is because even if this measure works as the Minister of State hopes, the net result will be that the State still will be pouring approximately three quarters of a billion euro a year into the pockets of private landlords, which is just money down the drain.  Moreover, it is completely unsustainable financially and in terms of providing the security of tenure social housing tenants need.  It simply will not work.  It is a waste of money and will not work and I wish the Government would realise that.</p><p>  In the debate Members held on this issue a week or so ago, the Minister of State rightly stated this was not a problem that started with her and that the previous Government had laid the foundations of the current crisis.  That is absolutely true and in fact, successive Governments, probably over the past 20 years or so, have laid the foundations for this crisis by dramatically reducing the direct provision of council housing and essentially outsourcing social housing to the private sector in the form of rent allowance and more recently, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, arrangements and other leasing arrangements.</p><p>That policy was not really very sustainable even during the boom period but the chickens have come home to roost in the current situation of economic crisis, with people's incomes being slashed and huge extra numbers of people needing social and affordable housing.  This crisis is the consequence of the policy failures of successive Governments.  When this Government came into office, instead of correctly analysing what was at the root of the problem and beginning to move in a different direction that could address the problem, every single action taken by the Government has made it worse and in fact has accelerated the processes that led to the crisis in the first place.  </p><p> The Minister of State referred in her speech last week to the policy document produced by her Department in June 2011.  I am not sure if Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was the Minister of State at that time because Deputy Penrose may have been the Minister of State then.  That document to which the Minister of State still refers, sets out the ingredients of the current crisis.  At the time there was no discussion in the D&aacute;il.  I refer to press releases which I issued on 14 June 2011 stating that this policy would be a disaster because the Government was accelerating the privatisation of social and affordable housing.  We held a press conference in Buswell's Hotel with groups like Tenants First and a number of people on the housing list.  We said at the time that this policy would be a disaster.  I raised the matter with the T&aacute;naiste in July 2012.  I said that the combined effect of the policies set out in that document - I will paraphrase the policies but the reference can be checked if necessary by anyone who is interested - was to cease the direct provision of new capital projects for building social housing and to rely primarily on leasing arrangements with the private sector and some talk of the voluntary sector as well.  That was the policy which combined with reductions in the rent caps which followed in two subsequent budgets, have acted as a pincer which has produced the housing crisis and the homeless emergency.  In July 2012 I said to the T&aacute;naiste that it was not an exaggeration to say that the Government's new housing policy and cuts to rent allowance would lead to a new era of homelessness and a return to slum landlords and tenement conditions.  I did not know how right I was at that stage because the real crisis was only unleashed in the years following that, reaching a crescendo in the past number of months.</p><p> The poverty of understanding of this crisis at all sorts of levels in Irish society is extraordinary.  I was talking to a senior media figure whom I will not name because it would not be fair.  I wanted to discuss the failure of the Irish media even to understand, never mind cover, the housing crisis in this country.  At least this particular senior executive in one of the major broadcasting institutions admitted: &quot;Most of the people who work with me and whom I know, might have mortgage difficulties but they would not know anything about being on a council housing list.&quot;  Of course, that is the bloody truth.  They do not understand because they have no experience of what it is like for hundreds of thousands of families who really are a silent, if not majority, a very significant silent minority, voiceless, but in desperate situations, whose suffering - there is no other word for it - is not articulated in a mainstream debate and much of the time until very recently was not articulated in debate in this House.  Despite some of us screaming for a debate on this issue, it has taken until the last few months to get even a serious discussion about how bad this issue is and only now because the crisis is staring us in the face and because the worse predictions have come to pass.</p><p> When the rent caps were introduced the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, with a solemn face ridiculed those critics of that policy and she told us solemnly that rents would come down.  Oh my God, how wrong can one be?  It shows a fundamental poverty of analysis about how the housing market works and about the attitude of the private sector to housing.  We still have the same poverty of analysis now when I hear the Taoiseach saying that we need 80,000 houses and that supply is the fundamental problem.  I am sorry, the fundamental problem is not supply; it is part of the problem.  Did we have supply between 2002 and 2008?  We had massive supply, 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year.  Did that in any way improve the housing list position or the level of homelessness?  Not at all; it got worse during that period, even though we were building record numbers of houses.</p><p> It is a simple elementary fact and I have not heard one economist - so-called expert - in the past few weeks who understands that elementary point.  Supply does not equal demand or supply does not rise to meet demand.  That is textbook rubbish.  In reality, supply rises to meet effective demand and demand where profits can be made.  Effective demand is demand where people have the money to pay and that is where the market will orientate, towards people who can afford to pay hefty rents or hefty prices for property.  It does not and will not orientate towards people who do not have enough money to put a roof over their head and who need low cost housing.  I hear every day for the past week that incentivising private developers or even removing the Part V stipulation so that they do not need to provide social housing, will mean that prices will come down because they will provide so much housing.  This is absolute rubbish.  It is stuff one sees in leaving certificate economics where one line of demand meets one line of supply in the middle, in this beautiful equilibrium.  This is rubbish and it is not the real world.  It is textbook neoliberal dogma.  That is not just my view, it is the experience of 2002 to 2008.  How do we meet the need for housing of people who do not have the money to pay these high rents or to pay the massively rising property prices for housing in the Dublin property market?  The answer is that the State provides subsidised housing.  This is the only answer there has ever been.  That is how we moved from the slums of the nineteenth century and the squalor associated with them, to some semblance of civilisation and equality in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  Tragically, we have been rolling back on that since the 1980s with disastrous consequences, to the benefit of private developers and landlords, turning the property sector completely into a casino with disastrous consequences particularly when an economic recession hits.</p><p> Against this background this Bill facilitates evictions which is not wonderful, in my opinion.  I agree there should be a streamlined process and that there needs to be fairness which there has not been.  Cases were brought under the EU Convention on Human Rights because there was no fairness.  Extraordinary draconian powers were in the hands of anti-social officers in local authorities who essentially, on the basis of their own personal discretion, could evict people.  Sometimes this was justified and in many cases it was totally unjustified.  There needs to be an independent fair process to adjudicate matters such as that and we need to examine the detail in this regard but it will not solve the problem.  </p><p> The issue of incremental purchase of council houses is a good thing in itself, so long as these are replaced with new build of social housing, otherwise all that will happen is the existing stock of social housing will be run down and there will be problems stored up for the future.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is the one substantial provision in the Bill.  At least this will, depending on the detail of the proposal, remove the ridiculous anomaly whereby local authorities in leasing arrangements with private landlords are paying way in excess of the rent caps which community welfare officers are allowed to pay.  A person who is homeless or is threatened with homelessness goes to the community welfare officer who says he or she can only provide &euro;1,000 a month for a three-bedroom house, when in south Dublin, one could not rent a box for that amount and would have to pay &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 a month.</p><p>The person is then sent to homeless services, which will send him or her to a hotel on the other side of Dublin or, failing that, he or she will be left to sleep in a car or on the sofa of a relative.  At the same time, the local authority has entered into a crazy arrangement with landlords under which it pays rents of &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,400 per month.  I cannot understand how these arrangements have been allowed to persist for so long.  The legislation should at least remove this ridiculous anomaly and force councils to vary the rent caps, as Deputies on this side have argued.  We must, however, see the detail before deciding if that is the case.  Even if it addresses that issue, it will not solve the fundamental problem.  Local authorities will become sitting ducks for landlords who want to jack up rents or pull out of current leasing arrangements.  We know this will happen because some of them are already doing so.</p><p> While the legislation removes one anomaly and may also remove a second anomaly under which people who take up employment lose money, it is not sustainable because it does not resolve the fundamental problem.  The only solution is to return to large-scale building of local authority houses.  I do not accept the view that this cannot be done because of current economic constraints.  We built tens of thousands of council houses in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and no one can tell me we cannot afford to do so now, especially as the alternative is to spend &euro;750 million on rent allowance and leasing arrangements.  This money pours into the pockets of landlords and down the drain.  The alternative is to build council houses.  I plead with the Government to start to do so.</p></speech>

When I raised the issue of housing on Leaders' Questions two weeks ago the Taoiseach agreed with me that there is a housing crisis.  I expected the Government to provide a comprehensive response to this crisis.  What we have seen thus far, however, is thoroughly inadequate.  It is heart-breaking that Deputies are unable to suggest any form of solution to people who visit our clinics in turmoil because they are worried about where they and their families will live the following week.  A response is needed to this horror but none has been forthcoming.</p><p>  The Bill is divided into five Parts.  I first read Part 1, which deals with the housing assistance payment, HAP, a scheme that has been heralded as a great initiative which will address all the problems in housing.  One of my criticisms of the rent accommodation payment, RAS, scheme is that it produces a poverty trap and does not encourage people to return to employment because people who start a job at entry level cannot afford to lose the payment.  I refer specifically to families with children.  My heart sank when I read some of the provisions relating to the housing accommodation payment.  As I noted, we have a massive problem in the housing area, with 98,000 individuals and families on the housing waiting list.  With 45,000 of these located in only six local authority areas, it is clear that the problem is much worse in some areas, including mine, than in others.  </p><p>  How will the HAP scheme work?  As with the RAS, the tenant must find a house to rent and contact his or her local authority seeking a payment under the scheme.  The local authority will then spend several weeks deciding whether to send a member of staff to visit the home and assess its suitability.  In the meantime, the landlord will have rented the house to someone else.</p><p>  The scheme is based on a view that local authorities have sufficient staff.  County Meath, which has a slightly smaller population than the combined population of Limerick city and county, has 620 staff compared to a combined total of 1,074 in Limerick city and county councils.  This scheme cannot be administered without more staff.  The local authority areas that are worst affected by the housing crisis are also those which will have the greatest difficulty with staff, yet the Minister for Social Protection has stated she will not transfer staff to assist local authorities in administering the scheme.  That is the first flaw in the HAP. </p><p>  The second flaw arises from the decision to impose caps similar to those that apply to the rental accommodation scheme.  I have not heard anything to indicate that additional funds will be provided for the HAP scheme, even in the short term.  While I have no great desire to put large sums of money into landlords' pockets, the reality is that people are being excluded from the rental market by virtue of rent caps.</p><p>  Last week, representatives of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Limerick City Council and Roscommon County Council appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The spokespersons for Roscommon County Council  and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council stated that their councils have been unable to secure housing on the rental accommodation scheme without exceeding the caps.  The representative of Limerick City Council stated that landlords were withdrawing from the RAS.  Caps are also provided for under the housing assistance payment scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection has become the minister for homelessness because she will not listen.  By refusing to accept that tenants are topping up their rent payments, she is denying the problem and her part in it. </p><p>  The HAP scheme will be the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, rather than the Minister for Social Protection.  It does not matter who is responsible; what matters is that the funding provided not be sufficient.  That is the second problem with the scheme. </p><p>  The third problem with this legislation is that it does not provide for the construction of social housing.  If rents are to be kept down, we must build new social housing.  Having the working poor and people on housing waiting lists competing for the same housing causes serious damage to the economy.  Basic shelter has become unaffordable in areas where people have a prospect of securing employment. </p><p>  The HAP scheme is seriously flawed.  When someone finds accommodation he or she must ask the local authority to have it assessed by a member of staff.  If, however, a landlord has a long list of people who are willing to rent the house, as is currently the case with most accommodation, he or she will have the vacancy filled by somebody else.  </p></speech>

This is a serious problem.</p><p>  The issue of staffing cannot be viewed one dimensionally.  Workforce planning is required to identify who will deliver the housing assistance payment scheme.  Limerick City Council is supposed to have developed a business plan for this scheme.  When I asked who was drawing up the plan, I was informed that it is not yet complete.  As such, we do not yet know what is the full business case for the scheme.  We were informed that staff in Limerick City Council were transferred from the rental accommodation scheme to the housing assistance payment scheme.  Such an approach would not work in County Kildare as it only has one member of staff dealing with the rental accommodation scheme.  Moreover, the individual in question is engaged full-time in dealing with landlords.  The council does not have any capacity to deal with new cases under the scheme.  When a scheme that is good in theory faces many impediments in practice, one must ask how it will help address the current abysmal circumstances.</p><p>  I acknowledge the recent announcement by the Minister of State that funding has been provided to allow Dublin City Council to purchase a small number of houses.  More funding is required for other local authorities in areas which face exactly the same pressure.  It takes time to build houses, however.  If, for example, the Minister were to announce a major house building programme today, not one house would be occupied by 2016 when the next general election is due. </p><p>We are talking about a big lead-in time.  Up to &euro;340 million is spent on rent supplement alone with more moneys spent on the rental accommodation scheme and long-term leasing.  These moneys need to be replaced by a more normal funding arrangement in time.</p></speech>

We in Sinn F&eacute;in, and others in the Opposition, have repeatedly brought this to the attention of the Minister for Health and his junior colleagues only to be met with a stonewall.  Up until recently, the Minister and his colleagues refused to recognise there was even a problem with discretionary medical cards, even to the point that, at one stage, they denied that such a category of card exists.</p><p>The current widespread review and extensive culling of medical cards is causing huge distress and worry to thousands of people.  That is undeniable.  All Members of the Oireachtas, if they are honest, will testify to the truth of this statement because they know it from the representations they are receiving from constituents and representative groups.  The numbers holding discretionary medical cards has fallen dramatically.  The Minister's own figures for the number with full medical cards and general practitioner visit cards on a discretionary basis in March 2011 was 97,120.  By March 2014, that had fallen to 78,310, a drop of nearly 19,000.</p><p>It was only after a recent Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting that the Minister grudgingly recognised there is a problem.  He was reported as stating, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve asked the TDs to give a list of any of the hard cases they have, the ones that they feel should have been given cards&rdquo;.  This request was confined to his own party colleagues.  Did it extend to back bench Labour Deputies?  It certainly did not reach me or any of my D&aacute;il party colleagues.  The Minister also spoke vaguely about some sort of third tier of services.  We found out from the media at the weekend that he has since written to his Fine Gael Party colleagues stating he will not be creating a so-called third tier of medical cards.</p><p>Significantly, he also stated unemployment has fallen under the current Government but that there are far more medical cards in circulation now than when the Government came into office.  What is not often pointed out, certainly not by the Minister, is that the number of medical cards in circulation is an indicator of income across the population while a great many of the jobs created are low-paid or part-time or are schemes concocted by this Government to disguise the jobless figures.  Real, decently paid jobs would indeed see more people earning over the income threshold for the medical card, and thus fewer income-based cards in circulation.  That, however, is not the situation in the Government's boasted recovery that is only a recovery for some.</p><p>Our focus in this motion is the discretionary medical card.  We are calling on the Government to reverse the cuts to discretionary medical cards imposed in the Health Service Executive 2014 service plan.  It should ensure the HSE treats with due respect and compassion all applicants for medical cards, taking fully into account not only incomes but the burdens imposed by medical conditions, illnesses and disabilities.  The Minister should consult all Oireachtas Members, not just his own party as he has done, on the effects of the cuts on citizens.</p><p>In budget 2014, a figure of &euro;113 million of medical card cuts was announced by the euphemism &ldquo;probity measures&rdquo;.  The Minister for Health has been unable to give us any account of how this figure was arrived at.  It was apparently dictated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the 2014 HSE service plan was published, the figure had magically changed to &euro;23 million.  This surely calls into question the entire management of health funding and health services by the Minister and the Government.</p><p>While the Cabinet's juggling with figures is shrouded in mystery, there is no mystery about the effects of the cuts on real people with real illnesses and medical needs.  The Minister knows those effects very well.  As recently as last Friday, 9 May, he received a letter from the Jack and Jill Foundation's specialist children's nurses.  I wish to read some of that letter into the D&aacute;il record:<blockquote>Dear Minister Reilly,<br /><br />As the team of nationwide specialist children's nurses responsible for designing and managing home care plans for the 300 precious children under the Jack and Jill Foundation's wing, we are compelled to write this letter to you to outline our serious concerns in relation to the allocation, or rather non-allocation, of discretionary medical cards to our patients.  Medical cards have always been an issue since the establishment of Jack and Jill in 1997.  However, the situation has become particularly vicious over the past two years. The situation is critical.<br /><br />It is only a matter of time before somebody, most likely a stressed out parent, is pushed over the edge by this unjust system.  We see the danger signs already.  Parents worn out, reduced to tears, not sleeping, not coping and worried out of their minds in relation to their child's medical card.  The &quot;lucky&quot; ones who have a temporary six or 12 month medical card live in dread of the next review and the whole torturous process of form filling, rejection letters, more visits to GPs for supporting evidence etc. etc. etc. which starts all over again.<br /><br />We are particularly worried about the parents who suffer in silence.  The parents who have given up already.  Depressed and beaten into submission by a system that is just too hard, where parents have to fight for every little support for their child.<br /><br />The medical card system in Ireland is broken.  It lacks humanity.  Is unjust.  Inconsistent.  A hellish lottery.<br /><br />We know it is a real issue on the doorstep for local and European election candidates.  We know the pressure coming to bear on you from backbenchers unhappy with the medical card complaints from their constituents.  However, it is for the sake of the children, rather than any election process that this system must be radically overhauled.  And quickly.  Time is something the families of children with life limiting and life threatening conditions don't have.<br /><br />We will make ourselves available to you to show you the reality of medical cards and the stress being subjected on our families in every community in Ireland.  It's time to diagnose the true extent of the problem with medical card allocation in Ireland and to come up with a timely and cost effective solution to the benefit of all, especially the children we support.<br /><br />Our call to action is simple Minister.  Review, refresh and redesign this system of discretionary medical cards.  Recognise the child in his or her own right.  The system is broken and we need you to fix it.</blockquote>The Jack and Jill Foundation and other representative groups, such as the charity Aoibheann's Pink Tie, which works with children with cancer and their families, have repeatedly pointed out the significant problems they encounter with the medical card system.  This includes the excessive bureaucracy, the distress of parents not knowing where to turn, and the worry that a card has been refused or an existing card will be discontinued.  They point to the massive savings to the State when families look after their very ill children at home rather than in a hospital bed.</p><p>During this debate, we will hear many examples of what the Minister has called hard cases.</p><p>These are by no means exceptional.  They are far too common.  I quote one experience of many posted on social media by the Jack and Jill Foundation:<blockquote>Having spent months filling in forms in an attempt to get a medical card for my 3 year old who had a stroke (which she didn't get) I often thought if the HSE cut out a lot of the red tape and bureaucracy and staff repeatedly telling me to send more and more forms etc there would be a lot more money for medical cards for the people who need them.  I knew my income was over the limit and was applying for my daughter's card based on her medical needs (I couldn't get a splint for her leg without one and couldn't buy one either it seems) yet I had to send endless information about my financial status (which is by no means excessive) over 4 months ... waste of time and money which could have paid for several splints! ... And don't get me started on the stupidity of having to reapply yearly for children with lifelong conditions.</blockquote>We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, support the principle of free GP care for all, but this Government has undermined public support for that principle by its skewed policy and mismanagement of the health services.  People are rightly asking why a healthy child of five will automatically qualify for a free GP card but an older sister or brother with a severe disability, with a rare disease or with cancer will not.</p><p>At the conference of the Irish Council of General Practitioners, ICGP, last weekend, a County Wicklow GP, whose disabled patient was the subject of a discretionary medical card removal, told the meeting that the removal of these cards was the &quot;single most evil thing our society is standing over&quot;.  She stated if the discretionary medical card issue was not addressed she would have no stomach for taking part in the planned free GP care scheme for children under six.  Mr. John Hennessy, the HSE's national director of primary care, - one should heed this particular contribution - stated that the way some had been treated was indefensible and described one case as an example of &quot;how we should not be doing things&quot;.  A GP from Galway told the ICGP meeting his medical card patient list had been reduced, from 800 to 600.</p><p>We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, are calling for a clear, time-tabled and transparent roll-out of free GP care for all.  Anything short of that will only serve to increase inequality.  We also need to see this done in such a manner that at least no-one entitled to a full medical card under the current rules will lose any of the services provided under the card in the context of a free GP care-for-all system.</p><p>I have tabled a parliamentary question for answer tomorrow in the course of Minister's questions on the process and formula used by the HSE to assess financial hardship in the case of discretionary medical cards.  I have asked, in the interest of transparency, for the precise nature of this analysis for new applicants or those seeking to retain their medical cards and who have been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, MND.  There can be no doubt that those with MND face significant financial hardship as a result of their progressive and terminal illness.  As the PQ lottery has placed this question at No. 42 and beyond reach in tomorrow's brief engagement, I invite the Minister to share the detail of his answer this evening when he rises to respond.</p><p>Would the Minister like to further comment on the most disturbing and insensitive practice of the medical card managers who repeatedly require those with life-limiting illnesses and permanent disabilities to respond to review after review, despite the ongoing progression of their illness and that they accept the reality that there is no recovery from their disablement?  This compounds their hurt and pain and enrages their loved ones and carers.</p><p>What of those over 70, over 80 and beyond who, despite their range of infirmities and the steady deterioration of their general health, are regularly subjected to review after review, despite the false assurance on their card that it expires in 2016 or 2020?  Why do this to our senior citizens?  Why subject them to this constant worry and stress?  Why subject them to the distress of having their medical cards taken from them?  GP-only cards only go so far.  The real issue for them is their medication supply and for many, it becomes a choice between their essential prescription drugs or heating in their home.</p><p>This morning I received a copy of a HSE client registration unit letter of the past two weeks.  It advises that a couple and their dependent child who have had a GP-only card was being withdrawn because the calculation of their circumstances showed they exceeded the threshold for qualification by &euro;3.17.  The consequence of this decision for this family already shows in the strain in their faces and the fear that now occupies so much of their daily and nightly thoughts.  Why do this to those who, across the board, have suffered so much from cuts and the austerity agenda of this and the previous Government?</p><p>We do not accept the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment as it omits our call for a reversal of the cuts, as well as our call for people's entitlements and rights to health care to be clearly outlined in law.  The previous three Fianna F&aacute;il-led governments promised to do this in legislation, with a Bill listed for years but never published.  They failed to deliver.  The Minister's self-congratulatory amendment is a sad reflection of the ostrich approach to the crisis in health care delivery, especially the hardships being borne by tens of thousands of citizens across the State who have had their medical card withdrawn or their application refused despite their undoubted need.</p><p>We believe it is vital that we clearly set out in legislation people's entitlements to health care and, in line with the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention, we call on the Government to provide for an amendment to the Constitution to recognise the right to health care.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300044#RR00200"><p>T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och labhairt ar son an PMB seo.</p><p>  The past few years has seen chronic and constant confusion with regard to medical cards.  Many of the cases that I have come across in my constituency have defied imagination in terms of the reasons given for the refusal to grant their medical cards.  We are witnessing a startling fall in the number of persons who are granted or retaining discretionary medical cards.  My constituency office has been inundated with medical card refusals over the past year and each one of these refusals not only comes with a heart­breaking story but places a considerable amount of trauma and pressure on an increasingly vulnerable section of the community.  The Fine Gael- Labour Government is now implementing the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il which those parties so vehemently opposed when they themselves were in opposition.</p><p>  The Government must immediately reverse the cuts to discretionary medical cards and ensure that the HSE begins to treat all those who apply for medical cards with the respect and compassion that they deserve.  Burdens imposed by medical conditions, illnesses and disabilities must all be taken fully into account, with qualification not simply based on income.  We are calling on the Government, in extending free GP care to all, to do so on a programmed, time-tabled and transparent basis and in such a way that no-one entitled to a full medical card under the current rules will lose any of the services provided under the card in the context of a free GP care-for-all system.</p><p>  Many who have depended on discretionary medical cards have not retained their cards, and many others who were hoping to receive their cards will not be doing so during the course of this year.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in provided for the extension of free GP care to all children aged five and under without depriving anyone else of their medical card entitlement.  This is the fair thing to do.  The current medical card eligibility system is in urgent need of replacement.  It, like so many other aspects of the State, is not fit for purpose.</p><p>  I am a proud republican and I believe in a real republic.  As republicans, equality is at the heart of all that we believe in and we strive for this every day in the course of our work and activism.  We believe in a new republic, a republic where all citizens are equal regardless of the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs, their sexual orientation, where they live or what they do, and in which all citizens have equal access to the services that they need.  Any genuine republic will be judged upon how it treats the most vulnerable and those who are most in need of being helped and for this sitting Government, the conclusion reached will not be a good one.</p><p>The withdrawal of medical cards from the sick and the elderly is a stain on this State.  I would like to cite a number of examples of cases that have come to the attention of my office recently.</p><p> A cancer sufferer, a multiple sclerosis sufferer or a person with Parkinson's disease will not get a medical card if their income exceeds the threshold.  The current threshold is &euro;184 for a single person and &euro;201 for a couple.  The basic rate of social welfare is &euro;188 for jobseekers.  A discretionary card may be granted where one can prove that the absence of a card is unduly burdensome or will cause hardship.  This is difficult to prove, however, as there are many debts and bills that are not taken into account such as the household charge, utility bills, debts and loans.  In addition, there are extra costs to do with illness that are not on prescription, specialist food one may need for an illness, wheelchairs, stair-lifts and physiotherapy.</p><p> I wish to mention a number of examples of cases I have dealt with recently.  An 82-year-old woman living alone with huge debts due to personal family circumstances, with a medical card valid until 2016, was sent a review form last week.  This woman will now lose her card as she has a private pension.  Over 70s medical cards are assessed on gross income, not net income, so the tax she pays to Government on her pension is assessed as income so this puts her over the threshold of &euro;500.  This woman worked from the age of 14 to 78.  Over 70s are assessed on their gross income so what they pay in tax, pension levies and USC are all assessed as income, even though they are not income but outgoings paid to the Government.</p><p> A man who worked for 40 years in a factory, reached 65 years and got a pension of &euro;18 a week from the factory now has to pay &euro;750 per annum for hospital visits and &euro;144 per month for medication purely because he was unfortunate enough to get a pension from his job, which he cannot return or cash in.  I have a hundred of examples like this.  </p><p> There are many situations where people are no longer taking their medication as they simply cannot afford it.  They are cutting back on inhalers, they are not paying their house insurance, they do not have enough to eat, or do not eat the proper food with ailments such as diabetes.</p><p> The lack of a medical card will have huge consequences for health services in future as people are not taking their medication and their health is deteriorating as a result.  They are not eating properly and are suffering from huge stress and worry.  Old people are living in fear of getting sick.  Doctors say there is little point in prescribing medication as people can no longer afford it.  Worst of all, people are dying with stress and worry due to the absence of a medical card.</p><p> We want to see GP care for all.  The provision of a public health care system is a principle we hold dear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-13a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="21:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051300045#SS00200"><p>I am sure the Minister of State, more than anyone else in this Chamber, has people coming into his constituency office about medical card issues.  No Deputy can say that in the last three years nobody has attended their constituency offices to inquire about a medical card application or the withdrawal of a card as part of the review process.</p><p>  I turned on the radio while driving yesterday and got the end of an interview.  I am not sure whether the speaker was a departmental official or a journalist speaking about discretionary medical cards.  At the end of the interview the speaker said that, according to the Department of Health, anyone who is in receipt of a discretionary medical card and is currently undergoing a review process will not have that card withdrawn as long as they are in correspondence with the Department.  The Minister of State might be able to clarify whether or not that is the case.  If that is the official policy from the Department, it is not what is happening on the ground.  I know of cases where people are in receipt of a discretionary medical card and were asked to take part in a review.  The review went on for so long, however, that they received a letter stating that their medical card was being withdrawn at the end of the month.</p><p>  One case that has come to the attention of my office concerns a woman with spinal cancer.  She had a medical card but was called for a review.  She submitted documentation on her condition, outlining all the expenses associated with it.  When she went back to her consultant last month, she was informed that she now has brain cancer.  She returned from the hospital having got that devastating news, only to find the letter from the HSE stating that the medical card was no longer valid from the end of this month.  I will forward the Minister of State those details.  I have already forwarded them to the medical card section and the Minister himself for review.</p><p>  I have another case of a young girl whose parents are both teachers.  While they exceed the income limits, they have a young child with severe difficulties.  One of the issues I find disturbing is that when one applies for a medical card or is in receipt of a discretionary medical card because one is over the income limits and it is based on medical needs, and when one takes part in a review, they take into account one's income but not all of the expenditure associated with a particular disability, illness or sickness.  </p><p>  In some cases people are spending enormous amounts of money caring for loved ones, including children and parents, who are sick.  I will give an example from my constituency office, which I will pass on if the Minister of State's officials want it.  These are the facts concerning a young girl with a rare genetic condition.  She is almost three years old but cannot walk, talk or crawl.  She cannot sit up unaided and cannot feed herself.  She is unable to chew food or drink from a cup.  She is completely non-verbal, does not cry and has no way of expressing her own basic needs.  She is attending numerous doctors and specialists, including neurologists, eye specialists, respiratory specialists, paediatricians, dieticians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.</p><p>  Given that list, the Minister of State will be aware that her care needs are extremely high.  She also has other issues concerning her arm and hip joints in particular.  Any slight increase in body temperature can lead to seizures of up to 40 minutes for that young girl.  Because of all those conditions and the ongoing nature of her illness, it is impossible for her parents to ascertain the future medical costs of caring for that child.  However, that particular child lost her medical card.  She is not up for review and the card was withdrawn before Christmas on the basis that her parents exceeded the income limit.</p><p>  I know of another young girl, aged 11, who has CP.  Her case has been raised here publicly in the past.  She is one of only six people in the world with this particular type of syndrome.  She is severely intellectually delayed in addition to being visually impaired to the extent that she is blind.  She is deaf in one ear, non-verbal and has movement delays.  At the age of 11, she is still in nappies.  </p><p>  Doctors have issued letters of support concerning her ongoing medical requirements.  In one such letter, the doctor stated that the medical requirements for this young girl are over and above that experienced in the normal population.  She had a medical card for ten years, from June 2002 to 2012, but it was then withdrawn.  Her parents appealed it but the appeal was denied.  If anything, that child's condition has worsened, yet the medical card has been withdrawn from her on the basis of income and that there was not enough medical evidence to support the application to grant a medical card on discretionary grounds.  </p><p>  Her father submitted payslips stating that he was over the income limit.  He earns &euro;636 a week.</p><p>The mother receives a carer's allowance of &euro;900 per year.  I spoke to them today and although the child's total annual medical costs alone exceed &euro;10,000, they cannot get a medical card.  It is beyond belief.  I do not think the Department knows the true story of the issue on the ground.  There are stories and evidence, and I am sure the Minister of State has them in his party.  The Fine Gael backbenchers recently raised it with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, at a parliamentary party meeting.  People rely on discretionary medical cards to provide proper care for their loved ones.</p><p> Some people with terminal illnesses cannot get medical cards or have had their medical cards withdrawn.  There is no such thing as recovering from a terminal illness.  If anything, one's condition will worsen until one passes away.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever cared for a terminally ill person.  I have, and many other people have.  The last thing a carer needs is to worry about how he or she will cover the cost of caring for the loved one.  A carer does not want to run up and down to doctors getting letters outlining his or her loved one's condition to support a medical card application because the medical card assessor's letter has said the patient's medical condition does not merit a discretionary medical card.</p><p> We have come through a very difficult period economically during which the State lost not only its economic sovereignty, but its compassion and respect for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly our sick people.  If anybody needed evidence of that, it is in the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards.  The Government cannot justify the revocation of discretionary medical cards from people who clearly need them.  That is a damning indictment on our society and this Government.</p></speech>

When speaking in the D&aacute;il, I have had occasion to wonder why this Parliament seems to have lost more than its economic compass in recent years.  The Government parties seem to have lost all decency, humanity, empathy and compassion.  While I have no doubt the Minister and Government backbenchers are decent, humane, compassionate people, we must ask what sort of sick society takes medical cards from children with severe disabilities or life-threatening and sometimes terminal illnesses.  What sort of sick society will tell the parents of a young child with such disabilities and illnesses that the continuation of the child's medical card depends on the parents jumping through bureaucratic hoops to prove they do not earn too much?  Why are we removing discretionary medical cards from children and adults who received them some years ago, whose medical conditions have deteriorated rather than improved and whose disposable incomes are lower than they enjoyed when the cards were originally granted?  How have we sunk low enough to penalise sick and vulnerable adults and children to further subsidise the wealthy and powerful in our society?</p><p>  Have the Minister of State, the Government and the Department so lost touch with humanity and basic societal decency that they do not understand the very great challenges facing these people and their families?  Do they not understand that the parents and families of the very ill children and adults devote their very lives and every bit of their energy to trying to ensure the best possible outcome for their loved ones?  Do they understand the sleepless hours parents spend nightly wondering and worrying where the Government axe will fall next?  Do they understand that those who care for their very ill family members, whether children or adults, are terrified that any small domiciliary care allowance or carer's allowance they receive will be removed from them as ruthlessly and suddenly as their medical cards were?</p><p>  Access to quality health care should be a right, not a concession to be granted or withheld by any government, Minister or civil servant.  People believed the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, when he said, before the general election, that he aimed to end the two-tier health care system and that every Irish person who needed health care would have that need met, and that medical needs, not ability to pay, would be the determining factor.  How does that pre-election objective sit with the practice of withdrawing medical cards from the most sick and vulnerable adults and children in our society?</p><p>  Earlier, I asked what sort of sick society would withdraw medical cards from children with severe disabilities or life-threatening or terminal illnesses.  My question was wrongly targeted.  I do not believe Irish society is sick but that governance in this country is sick.  That confuses me.  I believe we live in a democracy.  Government spokespersons daily tell us we live in a democracy and that the people are paramount.  However the actions, choices and decisions of this Government and its predecessor give the lie to this.  Does democracy apply only on polling day?  What happens after the elections?</p><p>  A democratic government should reflect the values, vision and aspirations of the people of the nation.  If this is true, and the Irish people were asked the very simple question whether they agree that children and adults with terminal or a life-limiting illnesses should have access to health care and adequate personal support irrespective of means, I know how they would respond.  They would say we should do whatever is necessary to support their neighbours in need.  They would say we should forget about getting P45s, P60s, PAYE balancing statements, bank statements, evidence of mortgage payments, social welfare searches, etc.  They would say that once a person's illness or disability has been credibly confirmed, the State should do all in its power to help and support the person.</p><p>  However, we saw how this Government and the Minister responded when we first raised the wholesale withdrawal of discretionary medical cards from vulnerable children and adults.  For several months the Minister and Government spokesperson were in denial.  They said there was no change of policy on eligibility for discretionary medical cards.  When the evidence became so overwhelming that denial was no longer credible, the Government changed tack.  Now the story runs that medical cards that were granted in previous years should not have been granted in the first place.  Apparently, eligibility decision-makers in local offices were too humane, generous and decent in granting these cards and we must have consistency, even if it is based on inhumanity, lack of generosity and indecency in the new, improved, centralised system.  Rules are rules, according to the Minister, and everybody must abide by the same rules.  The number of children and adults losing discretionary medical cards continues to rise, as does the level of hopelessness and despair for those losing their cards and for their carers.</p><p>  The latest stunt to get the Government past 23 May is that HSE staff will phone people whose discretionary medical cards have been refused or withdrawn to tell them about all the other wonderful services that might be available to them.</p><p>They will have to pay for GP visits and prescribed pharmaceuticals, although they will know about other services for which they have not asked and which will prove to be of little, if any, benefit.  That is how I see it.</p><p> We have an island of decent, caring people who would choose to help vulnerable children and adults as much as possible but the Government's vision only extends to the end of the financial year.  It pays lip service to those most in need of care while it bluffs and blunders through governance, promising everything while delivering nothing.  The worst part is that choices could have been made.  Such choices were put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in in its pre-budget submission last year.  Shame on the Government and shame on all of us if we cannot fix this problem.</p></speech>

There is no deliberate so-called targeting to reduce the number of these cards.  There is no targeting of any patient group holding these cards, nor would this even be possible, as I have explained before.  I accept that some individuals have lost eligibility.  We have not denied that although the suggestion has been that we have.  However, cards are not being arbitrarily withdrawn or refused.  There has been no change in the rules governing the awarding of medical cards where discretion is involved.  On the contrary, I can tell Deputies that the medical card scheme continues to operate so that those who suffer undue financial hardship, as assessed under published guidelines, in the arranging of GP services are awarded a medical card in accordance with the legislation passed by this House.</p><p>For ease of discussion in our debate, I am going to use the term &quot;discretionary medical card&quot; but it is important to be clear that medical cards are awarded by the HSE, in accordance with the legislation, on the basis of means assessment or where the HSE exercises discretion in circumstances where a person exceeds the income guidelines.  I repeat what I have stated in the past in that there is no separate entity of a so-called discretionary medical card, as there is no distinction between any medical cards in terms of eligibility for services and all medical cards are identical in terms of coverage for services.  That is irrespective of the route which a person has travelled, in a matter of speaking, to obtain a medical card.</p><p>The motion before the House calls on the Government to &quot;reverse the cuts to discretionary medical cards imposed in the Health Service Executive ... 2014 Service Plan&quot;.  I must respectfully ask where these cuts, or any target for such cuts, is to be found in the national service plan.  I searched the plan to find a reference to discretionary cards<b></b>and no such reference is to be found therein.  Of course, discretion is referred to in the plan, but discretion is not a stand-alone exercise.  Rather, the exercise of discretion has been and remains an integral element of the assessment process for a medical card.  The Deputies will be aware that medical cards are awarded on a number of grounds which are set out in the HSE national assessment guidelines.  However, it is important to be clear that neither the Department nor the HSE has in place differentiated targets for the awarding of medical cards, such as the allocation of so many in this or that category.  It would simply not be possible to stipulate or to prescribe in advance the number of medical cards in circulation based on the income guidelines, the number of medical cards based on entitlements under EU legislation or the number awarded on the basis of having income solely from the Department of Social Protection or the HSE.  In the nature of a demand-led scheme, the HSE forecasts the overall number of all medical cards it anticipates will be in circulation at the end of the year in order to facilitate its financial planning over the course of the year, but it simply cannot fix in advance the number in any particular category.</p><p>I am aware of recent media reports referring to the alleged plan to reduce the number of discretionary medical cards.  The HSE's figures clearly indicate that the number of medical cards issued where discretion was involved has fallen in recent years, and I am not disputing that.  However, this reduction is not as a result of a change in policy or a deliberate targeting of discretionary cards, which my Opposition colleagues have persistently claimed.  Rather, it is attributable, in the main, to the fact that many people who previously were marginally over the qualifying means thresholds have subsequently been granted medical cards because they comply with those means thresholds.</p><p>Of the discretionary medical cards in circulation in 2011, approximately 6% have subsequently lost their medical card following review<b>.  </b>On any reasonable account, this could not be described as indicative or reflective of a policy to remove discretionary cards over a period of three years.  Of course, whereas the numbers who have lost their discretionary medical cards may be relatively small, let me assure the House that I do not for a moment make light of the difficulties that may arise for people who are found to be ineligible, especially where they may have relied on the medical card for a period, as some Deputies have alluded to during the course of this debate.  It is important the facts are clear for the record, and in the region of 80%, or four fifths, of those who held a discretionary medical card in 2011 held a medical card in 2014 on the basis of either a means assessment or with HSE discretion.  Approximately half of all individuals who held a discretionary card in 2011 went on to retain the card under the basic means assessment, so that they transferred from a card granted on discretion to one granted under the basic means assessment.  Approximately one third continued to hold the card following the exercise of discretion by the HSE.  The balance, approximately one eighth of the 2011 cohort, is mainly made up of people who did not respond to the HSE renewal notice, did not complete the review process or are deceased, or cases where other family members were awarded a card.  I repeat that approximately 6% of those who held a discretionary card in 2011 have lost that card following review.  That is between 5,500 and 6,000 who have lost discretionary medical cards in those three years.</p><p>I have listened very carefully to what the Deputies said and this discussion will continue over the two days of debate.  Far from targeting people who need our support, this Government has provided very substantial funding to meet the increase in the number of medical cards and GP visit cards required by individual citizens.  Of the national population, 42% of people currently have access to GP services without any charges under the General Medical Services scheme.  Of these, 39.2% of people have medical cards and 2.6% of people have GP visit cards.  As the Deputies will be aware, the HSE is responsible for assessing an individual's entitlement to a medical card and a GP visit card.  In this regard, the HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in making reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing each applicant.  These guidelines are available for review on the HSE website.</p><p>The relevant legislation is the Health Act 1970, as amended.  Under the provisions of the Act, persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange a general practitioner service for themselves or their family qualify for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.</p><p>It is a fact that under the health legislation, there is not, nor ever has been, an entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition.  In accordance with the legislation, it is not possible for the HSE, and the HSE has no authority, to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a medical condition.</p><p> I listened carefully to what Deputy O'Brien said.  He made a compelling contribution to the debate.  If I understood him correctly, however, he referred to circumstances in which persons who had applied for a medical card and were outside the income limits ought to, or should have been considered on the basis of his or her illness or medical condition.  It is not possible for the HSE to do that.  All the HSE is expected to do, and does, is take into account the medical expenses, or expenses associated with the medical condition or illness of a person who is above the income threshold and therefore does not qualify under the income limits.  That is where the doctor is involved in the assessment for a medical card.  The doctor does not give a medical report on the severity of the illness.  This may sound harsh but I feel it necessary to state the position clearly.  The doctor and panel are involved in assessing the expenses that are reasonably associated with that illness or condition.  It is not the illness or medical condition that qualifies a person for a medical card.  That is not the position.  People may believe that we should migrate to that system.  There may be a case for allocating medical cards on the basis of an illness or medical condition but that is not how the system has operated since 1970.</p></speech>

Different criteria apply for assessment of eligibility for a medical card for those persons aged 70 years and over.  That assessment is on a gross income basis.  A person over 70 does have the option of choosing the net income assessment, should he or she wish not to be assessed on the gross income basis.</p><p>  The HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  This discretion must be exercised by the HSE in accordance with the legislation.  The fundamental provision in the 1970 Act, however, is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service having regard to his or her means.  In that context, the HSE takes into consideration social and medical issues when determining whether undue hardship exists for the individual in accessing GP or other medical services.  Discretion will be applied automatically during the processing of an application where additional information has been provided by the applicant which can be considered by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate.  Several Deputies have asked about the extent to which a person is told when he or she applies that he or she can or should submit further information in respect of medical expenses.  While an applicant may be denied eligibility for a medical or GP visit card, if the person has referred to a medical condition which is causing undue hardship a medical officer may review his or her eligibility, if the person's GP completes a medical report which is furnished together with a prepaid envelope.</p><p>  Having completed a full assessment of an application or review, a letter issues to the applicant advising of the decision thereon.  If a review is assessed as ineligible or eligible for a GP visit card only, the letter issued informing the applicant of this decision will include an explanation of how the application was assessed and the details of the means assessment calculated on the application.  If this is not happening I want to know about it.  Some people have interpreted what I have said as meaning that the Minister has a role in deciding on the merits of individual applications.  The Minister has no role in this regard.  If I am wrong when I state in this House what happens or should happen in the mechanics of an application, and solemnly say that I am advised by the HSE this or that process is applied, and if somebody can give examples of my being wrong I want it drawn to my attention.  I will then immediately draw it to the attention of the HSE that something we say happens in the mechanics of applications is, in fact, not happening.  I have taken these points up when Deputies have raised them. </p><p>  Applicants will be advised that they can request a review of the HSE decision if they believe their financial or other circumstances have not been correctly assessed.  They will also be requested to provide any additional relevant information or details of any change in circumstances since their original application.  In addition, the letter will notify the applicant of the option to appeal the decision and the contact details of the appeals office.  Where applicants submit an application without any additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded.  At this stage, they are also informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation to support their application.</p><p>  Additional information can be used for consideration on a discretionary basis, following receipt of a letter indicating an unsuccessful application.  Additional information that may be relevant to the exercise of discretion includes illness or medical circumstances which result in financial hardship; the cost of providing general medical and surgical services; the cost associated with the provision of medical, nursing and dental treatment; or the cost of medical aids and appliances.  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the effect of reasonable expenditure related to that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant.</p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level, rather than at a local level as was the case before mid-2011, ensures that all people are assessed in a similar and fair manner when applying for a medical card, irrespective of where an applicant lives.  Concerns have been raised in this House that an individual may or may not, or would be more likely to, get a medical card depending on where he or she lived.  I listened to what Deputy Colreavy said about this and must respectfully disagree with the impression he gave that it was in some way acceptable.  I do not think it is at all acceptable.  We all would share the view that everyone should be treated in the same fair and consistent manner.  I have seen figures relating to early 2013 showing that some counties, such as Cork, Limerick and Tipperary, at one stage had three or four times the proportion of discretionary medical cards per head of population compared to other counties, such as Louth or Meath.  In previous years, there was a local assessment process, which, although it might be seen as desirable from one point of view, actually led to there being real inequities throughout the country.  Bluntly, it meant that a person may have been awarded a discretionary medical card in one part of the country that he or she would not have obtained in another because of the lack of a centralised standardised approach.</p><p>  That said, I acknowledge that the transition to a nationally consistent standard system of assessment has caused difficulty at renewal stage for households with incomes above the HSE threshold, even where an illness or disability is involved.  Shortly after the introduction of the new system the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, requested the HSE to set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where income guidelines have been exceeded, but where difficult personal circumstances exist, such as an illness that would affect a person's financial circumstances.</p><p>  In addition, at the behest of the Minister, the HSE is examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs.  This issue is being addressed in a manner that includes all of the services and supports provided by the HSE, with as much flexibility as possible, and at a local level.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Colreavy said, it is a very real and important opportunity for people to be able to access services in circumstances where they perhaps no longer have the medical card but although in some cases they are above the income limits, even substantially so, they still need access to services for themselves or their child.  We must move the system forward to ensure we provide that and put in place protocols for quick access to services that people need in their communities where they have a medical condition or illness.</p><p> It is intended that improvements will be made, and it has been brought to my attention that they are needed, to the level and extent of information published by the HSE and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing their full range of supports and entitlements from the health services.  I have seen examples of cases where people with a medical card who lost their eligibility were entitled to the long-term illness, LTI, scheme but were not aware of that.  It is not acceptable that a person would be coldly refused continued eligibility to a medical card where it is not drawn to their attention, or there is not some way of their knowing, that they could have access to the LTI scheme, which could cover their medications, equipment, medical devices and other services that they need.  Appropriate notice is also being considered as part of this review for existing medical card holders who may no longer be eligible on renewal but where serious medical conditions or disability continues to exist.  In that way people would have a decent level of notice where eligibility has been found not to exist.  The Government is fully aware of the difficulties that arise for persons who are deemed ineligible, particularly after a period where they have held a medical card.</p><p> As the House will be aware, one of the key goals of the reform of our health system is to ensure that people receive health care according to their particular needs, rather than based on their income.  It is an anachronistic and inappropriate basis for a 21st century health system and it is far from any comparable modern health system in any other European country where we continue to assess people on the basis of their means to determine their eligibility to access health services.  It seems essential that we move towards a health system that is based on universality of access.  The concept of eligibility has been amended by legislation passed by the Oireachtas in 1991 and 2005 and the House did not depart from the principle of means testing in terms of access to health services.  One result has been that the means based legislative framework has produced a very complicated eligibility system, with all of the difficulties, anomalies and contradictions that exist throughout our system.  </p><p> Some members have criticised the bureaucracy involved in the system and Deputy Colreavy referred to the forms required to be completed.  Others have said to forget about the forms, that the humanity of the situation should always win through.  However, as legislators, we must also have regard to the fact that we should have clear entitlements.  People should be clear on what their entitlements are and they should be either entitled or not entitled to a particular service.  It should not be the case that people have to come begging or go to politicians to make a personalised case to be treated as an exemption.  Their entitlements should be clear and they should be consistent across the country.  We do not have that type of system.  The only way we will achieve that is by working together in order to create the kind of reformed health system that we need where we have proper equality of access for all our citizens based on need and not based on their income.</p><p> It has been suggested - though perhaps not in this House - that in the meantime we should consider moving from eligibility based on means to a system where people are eligible on the basis of their having a particular medical condition.  I have thought long and hard about this, as I am aware other Members have.  On the face of it, it is clearly right that if one has an illness one should be able to access the health service.  That is what we want and what I passionately believe - as I think we all do - we need to achieve in terms of the reform of the heath system, but we cannot simply shoehorn the new system into the old one.  We have to continue to manage the existing system fairly and transparently while moving as quickly as we can to introduce a new system.  We are trying to do two things at the one time.  If we were to try to replace in the interim our current inadequate system with an illness based system, that would have very significant unintended consequences that we would need to address.  The first question that comes to mind is which illnesses or conditions should enable a person to access health services and which should not?  Our immediate reaction to that question would be &quot;any and all illnesses&quot;.  Which of us will be the first to stand up and say &quot;we would exclude a particular illness or condition&quot;?  Would eligibility extend for the duration of an illness or condition or once a person had that illness or condition would they retain their medical card permanently?  How would we choose one illness over another?  Would we be acting in an arbitrary manner or excessively impairing the right to equal treatment?  How would we even define an illness?  It has become more difficult in the modern age sometimes to define a disease or an illness.  Would we set clinical criteria in the legislation or leave it open to medical practitioners or the HSE to interpret?  Similarly, who would determine if those criteria or conditions w;ere met?  Would we rely on the opinion of a GP, who would be placed in the invidious position of determining if his or her patient can use the health system while at the same time potentially benefiting financially from that decision?  There are many examples of anomalies that would arise in that situation which I do not believe would bring about the fair and transparent system that we want to have.</p><p> On the issue of constitutional rights covered in the motion, I strongly believe we should have robust constitutional rights but the allocation of resources, particularly to the health area, is a political question and there are political differences as to how best to allocate resources.  We could place rights in the Constitution but we as politicians would still have to argue and resolve in this House how best to allocate resources.  Even the argument between universality and another system is a political issue that requires to be resolved, as does the issue of resources and how much we allocate to health versus other areas of public expenditure.</p><p> I agree that our system is not fit for purpose, as Deputy Ellis said.  We need to work together to reform and change it.  There is much that we could discuss on this issue but I want to hand over to Deputy Barry.</p></speech>

We need to be cognisant of the fact that this discussion is taking place against the background of our health service which is already costing this country approximately &euro;14 billion.  It shows that the Government is committed to health.  However, it does not mean that we have a perfect health service - far from it.  I deal in my offices in Mallow and Fermoy with medical card applications and reviews for people on a weekly basis, as do all of the other Members present.  Dealing with those is not the preserve of any one party; they are an issue and we all deal with them.  Currently, medical cards are given on the basis of financial hardship.  The primary care reimbursement service is tasked with this job.  I must acknowledge their help and engagement because they have a very difficult job to do.  The time has come to properly define what a discretionary medical card is because I am not quite sure that I know what it is.  We need to address the lack of clarity in this area.</p><p>  One million medical cards were to come under review for 2014 but this might be a little too ambitious.  However, I do not disagree with the principle of a review.  We need to review but we need to do it in a manageable fashion.  We need to examine new legislation which would allow a third tier of provision for people with grave illnesses.  This is not the current position.  This is the area where the discussion is developing and I welcome that.  Nobody wants to see people suffer, especially people who have grave illnesses such as people on the transplant lists.  How can one face a person who is on a multiple transplant list and tell them they cannot have a medical card?  I certainly could not do it.  We need to have a discussion on where these guidelines should be drawn.  We have a duty to explore this area.  There will be anomalies but change is always challenging.  Transplant patients should be given the support of a medical card, as should living donors, who have donated organs.  We are trying to encourage organ donation and it is a very sensitive are.  The quality of life enjoyed by people who have received organ transplants is fantastic.</p><p>  We need to expand the long-term illness scheme to cover other conditions.  As the Minister of State said, awareness of this scheme needs to be heightened as many people are not fully aware of it.  We must also recognise that we are approaching a threshold with regard to affordability.  Some 40.8% of the population have medical cards and 8.8% have GP visit cards.  Of the 644,000 reviews last year, 482,000 were dealt with and 96% of those people continue to be eligible.  Very few were not found to be eligible.  However, with regard to the other 161,992, which is a sizeable number, those people either did not respond or some of them passed away during the term of review.</p><p>I disagree with medical cards being tied to other issues such as exemption from exam fees.  They have nothing to do with each other and should not be there to muddy the waters - they could be dealt with in other ways.</p><p> There are issues with dealing with medical cards at a centralised site.  It has removed local knowledge and I am not necessarily a fan of this.  However, taking up to eight months to deal with people's reviews is certainly not good enough and it needs to happen in a proper timeframe.  If they are not dealt with within that timeframe action needs to be taken.  There are also issues with considerable amounts of data being lost and being lost multiple times.  I spoke to a lady last week who told me of her data being lost five times.  This cannot continue.</p><p> With medical cards that were granted recently and are not due to expire for a while, there is no point in reviewing them immediately again, which would be wasting time and delaying the process.  Some of these reviews are counterproductive.  We are in a demand-led scheme and the applications are complicated.  Confusion exists and people need help.  They come to Deputies, but we need a better portal to deal with these people.</p><p> I welcome this discussion.  Health care needs to follow the needs of the patient and the citizens need to feel they are valued and protected especially at vulnerable times when their health is failing.</p></speech>

At the outset of his speech the Minister of State said:<blockquote>It is not the first time it falls to me to put on the record of the House that with regard to medical cards allocated on the basis of discretion, there is no policy to abolish such cards; there is no deliberate &quot;targeting&quot; in order to reduce the number of these cards; there is no targeting of any patient group holding these cards; and nor would this even be possible ...  I accept that some individuals have lost eligibility ... but cards are not being arbitrarily withdrawn or refused.  There has been no change in the rules governing the awarding of medical cards where discretion is involved.</blockquote>We immediately have a difficulty with that.  Even in the HSE service plans up until last year there was in the accounting exercise a targeting of discretionary medical cards.  It was identified and highlighted in the HSE service plans that there would be a reduction in the number of medical cards.  That is an obvious targeting of discretionary medical cards.  For the Minister of State to suggest at the outset of his speech that there was no such policy does not cut ice given that it is stated in the HSE service plans up to last year.  This year the Government decided not to include the word &quot;discretionary&quot; in the HSE service plan because it made a deliberate attempt to erase the word &quot;discretion&quot; from official policy.</p><p>Even in the responses to some of the parliamentary questions I and other Deputies tabled, the Minister of State informed us that there was no such thing as discretion.  There were more than 80,000 entities in terms of-----</p></speech>

Time and again people's discretionary medical cards are being withdrawn and people who are applying for one on a discretionary basis because of an illness are not being granted them.  That is a fact of life and that is what is happening.  My difficulty is that there seems to be this official wall that has decided to brazen this out and I cannot understand why.</p><p>  The former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, stated clearly that while there was not substantial change to the policy, the issue of discretion was being shrunk to the point where medical cards were not being awarded.  I have frequently quoted her report in the House with regard to the discretionary element.</p><p>  What is most bizarre is that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the Minister of State present, the HSE and others have decided to ring-fence &euro;35 million for children aged under six.  Although the Minister of State has not said it, he is ring-fencing &euro;35 million away from people who genuinely need medical cards in terms of the illnesses, or physical or intellectual disabilities they have in order to fund this project.</p><p>  As my party's spokesman I have said repeatedly in this House that of course universality is something to which most of us subscribe.  However, when we have limited finances we must cut our cloth according to measure.  Any measure of a decent society would suggest that we should give a medical card to a person who has an illness, disability or congenital disease before giving a GP-visit card to a child aged under six who may come from an affluent background and does not need it in the first place.  That is a decision the Government has made.  The Minister of State can dress it up whatever way he likes, but until such time as he can come into the House and convince me that the Government is not taking the medical cards that have been awarded on a discretionary basis to fund the GP-only medical cards for children aged under six, then I have a difficulty in supporting the Government's project for universality for GP-only medical cards for children aged under six because it is inherently and deeply unfair.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has told me that he is a republican and that he lives in a republic.  We have seen that word abused many times, but in this context nobody could stand up in this Parliament and say it is right to apply universality to children aged under six when we are taking medical cards away from people while undertaking a review of their medical evidence, people with Down's syndrome, congenital heart disease and people who are 90 years of age and are incontinent and blind.  Where are we going?  Any fair rational assessment of what we stand for as a people would suggest at the very least that we should first look after those people.  If resources are then available, of course we should spread it out to ensure that as many people as possible have access to GP services.  However, it defies belief for the Minister of State to come in here and try to convince me that there is not a problem.</p><p>  If the Minister of State does not want to believe me, he should believe the replies he gave to parliamentary questions which show that the number of medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis has reduced from roughly 90,000 at one stage down to fewer than 50,000, which indicates there must be a targeting and culling of medical cards.</p><p>  People who were previously granted a discretionary medical card based on certain types of illnesses can no longer get them.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to motor neuron disease.  By and large people who contracted motor neuron disease in the past would have been awarded a discretionary medical card regardless of means.  This is a disease for which there is no cure.  They will die from it and yet we drag them through a system that is heartless, bureaucratic and is set up purposely to discourage people from applying for a medical card on a discretionary basis.</p><p>  The word coming back from the PCRS appeals process is that they are outside the income guidelines.  We all know they are outside the income guidelines, but people have genuine illnesses, some of them terminal and some very serious and they still cannot get a discretionary medical card.  The Jack and Jill Children's Foundation has repeatedly stated that some of their clients have reached crisis point with regard to the application of the discretionary card.</p><p>  We have had it with terminal illness, including cancer.  I have highlighted these on numerous occasions.  We have been raising the issue on this side of the House for two years.  I have sent on details to the Taoiseach on numerous occasions.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to be involved in every particular application for a medical card, but I wanted to highlight what is happening in our society.  The Minister of State has told us we will have a universal health system but the difficulty is that those who need it most will have universal access to a GP if they are aged under six.</p><p>However, once they are over six years of age, they will lose the GP card because of age and will not qualify for a discretionary medical card because of their illness.  I cannot reconcile that.  If the Minister of State genuinely thinks he will get plaudits for giving a healthy, wealthy five year old a free GP card while taking a discretionary medical card from a child with Down's syndrome, I think we are living in a banana republic.  It is unfair and unjust.</p><p> When the human papillomavirus vaccine for girls was not brought in one year, the Minister said the former Minister, Mary Harney, was criminally negligent.  I would never go that far but the Government is morally bankrupt if it thinks this is a good idea.  I have no difficulty looking at the broader issue of universality but we should prioritise according to the need of individuals as opposed to a cohort of people who may not need medical cards at all.  I would like to think most people in society with a reasonable income and young children would willingly pay for their GP knowing that if a crisis hit the family, for example, if a child got very sick, contracted a very serious illness or had an accident, the State would support them then.  In the meantime, while resources are limited, would they mind going to the GP the odd time and paying?  I think most people are fair.  The Government has made a decision which is entirely wrong, unjust and should be reversed immediately.  We cannot ask the sickest, the oldest and some people who are dying to fund those under six years of age.</p><p> There has not been an increase in the budgetary allocation.</p></speech>

It is highlighted in the Government's budgetary arithmetic.  It has highlighted the fact it will target &euro;113 million in medical card probity.  That is a stealth word for reducing the number of discretionary medical cards.  The reason discretionary medical cards are being targeted for a cost-saving exercise is that they are being used all the time because they are awarded to people based on their illnesses.  They need these for many reasons.  The Government has decided to take them from those who need them most and give them to those who may not need them at all.  If a person contracts an illness or a disability, the State should support them through the discretionary medical card process, but the Government has opted to go the wrong way by going down the GP universality route prior to having additional funding in place.  Additional funding is the critical issue.</p><p>  I am not the only one saying this.  The advocates of many people in society who are facing very difficult times and huge hardship in terms of illnesses, diseases and disability, both physical or intellectual, are also saying it.  The Jack and Jill Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society, people who advocate for people who contract motor neurone disease, Down Syndrome Ireland and other organisations are saying there has been a change in how one is assessed and granted a medical card on a discretionary basis.</p><p>  Reading through the Minister of State's speech, it is exceptionally disappointing that we are back to square one.  There is no acceptance that it has become more difficult to be granted a medical card on a discretionary basis.  Mr. Hennessy of the HSE said that some of the ways in which medical cards were handled were indefensible.  If they were indefensible, why is the Government defending them?  Is it not time to accept that this move towards culling and reducing the number of discretionary medical cards should be reversed and that the precedents set were set for good reasons?  It is a shameful exercise that we are now quoting the 1970 Act in its entirety and that the Government is now tying the hands of those who would have been able to grant a medical card on a discretionary basis.</p><p>  The Minister set up a clinical panel to assess people seeking a medical card on a discretionary basis.  I do not know the guidelines under which it is operating but I know one thing for sure-----</p></speech>

It is beyond belief that such a person would be asked to furnish new medical information.  If there are clinicians on that clinical panel, they should know full well that the disease is incurable but we have a situation where these people are being dragged through a bureaucratic system.</p><p>  The Minister should accept at this late stage that the discretionary medical card was there for a good and valid reason.  It was there to bring humanity and provide support in a very bureaucratic system, which was the case with medical cards.  It was there for the right reasons and it should be maintained for the right reasons.  The idea the Minister would deny there has been a targeting of discretionary medical cards is indefensible as Mr. Hennessy said himself.</p></speech>

The review has caused considerable distress and anxiety for people when they are being reviewed.  As we know, some of them should never be subject to a review because of the type of illness or condition they have.  That stress is added to by the wait to see if they will be successful in holding on to their medical cards.</p><p>  How much was spent tendering for the private company contracted to carry out the administrative services of the HSE for the review?  There are concerns that some of the people in the particular company who are asking the questions do not have any background in this particular area.  They do not have access to full records and are only getting names and addresses, which is perhaps why people are being reviewed even though they should not be.  They are also getting confidential and sensitive information about people and I wonder if those people have Garda clearance.</p><p>  The Minister of State said there was no deliberate targeting but he must be aware, because he has been told, of the concerns of doctors and pharmacists in regard to cases of hardship and distress among their sick and elderly patients who have had their medical cards removed.  I totally agree with the Minister that they should not have to contact their politicians, but they are doing so.  Like others, I have been contacted by people, in particular in their 70s, who have lost their medical cards and they are not people of means.  The thresholds are a problem because somebody can miss out ever so slightly as a result of a threshold but could not be considered as a person of means.</p><p>  Thalidomide sufferers and those who with symphysiotomy have medical cards, which is correct.  Those who were given contaminated blood products have the HSAA card.  Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that the ladies from the Magdalen laundries would have a health care package similar to the HSAA card but nothing seems to be happening in that regard and I have tabled questions to the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Health.  These are elderly ladies and there are deaths all the time.  They deserve better treatment than they are getting.</p><p>  I refer to complementary medicines and whether they could be considered in terms of medical cards.  I do not understand the rationale behind giving free health care to people who are healthy while depriving people who are ill of vital and necessary health care.</p></speech>

Every Member of this House, on the Opposition side and the Government side, knows what is happening because they deal with it every day.  People who had medical cards for years and whose circumstances have not changed have had their medical cards reviewed and withdrawn.  People are being targeted daily.  Those with chronic illnesses and other serious illnesses are either not being granted medical cards or are having them withdrawn.</p><p>  I will refer briefly to two cases.  Recently, a gentleman came to me whose medical card was withdrawn because he was 8 cent over the limit, even though he was ill.  A 16 year old young man with cerebral palsy who is wheelchair-bound and has serious and frequent epileptic seizures had his medical card withdrawn.  He had a medical card for years.  Such cases are heard hourly in my office and in the office of every Oireachtas Member in this House and in the Seanad.</p><p>  Currently, it takes a minimum of two to three weeks for documentation to be registered on the PCRS system.  It takes months to process applications.  Unless one has a medical certificate that says one has a terminal illness and one is applying on discretionary medical grounds, it can take months to have one&rsquo;s application assessed.  Constituents with diagnoses of cancer have been waiting two, three and four months for a decision.  They are waiting in a queue to be looked at by a doctor.  That is simply unacceptable but it is a fact.  Everything I have said this evening is a fact.  Everything I have heard from other speakers reflects what I hear and see daily in my office.</p></speech>
