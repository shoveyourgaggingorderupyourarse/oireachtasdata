In 1990, while Minister of State, Mary Harney introduced a ban on smoky coal use within the Dublin region.  This decision had a very radical and beneficial impact on public health and the environment.  It saved many lives and improved the quality of health in others, as well as the quality of our lived environment.  It was a decision and not an announcement; substance as opposed to spin; and a concrete action as opposed to a promise never delivered.  Thirty years later, it is incomprehensible that our past two Fine Gael-led Governments have failed to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal despite numerous promises from Ministers to do so.</p><p>Former Ministers, including Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Naughten, promised to bring forward such a ban, but no action or decision followed.</p> <p> A recent report on air quality published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, revealed the degree to which air pollution in towns not covered by the ban exceeded World Health Organization air quality guidelines.  For example, Enniscorthy continually has the highest observed concentrations of air pollutants of all monitoring stations in Ireland, with a 20% higher level of pollutants PM2.5 and PM10 than in Dublin or Cork.  Professor John Sodeau of UCC is particularly critical of the Government's inaction on this issue and raised concerns that the public health and climate change consequences for the areas not covered by the ban on smoky coal were very severe.  This air particulate pollution attacks every cell in the body and carries carcinogens, heavy metals and acids.  Up to 1,500 lives are lost annually as a result of diseases linked with it.  Based on promises made by the Government, some manufacturers invested millions in order to be in a position to produce smokeless coal, but they have been left high and dry.</p> <p> Yesterday the Taoiseach announced a welcome U-turn on his position on fossil fuel exploration, albeit we learned that licence applications would be accepted for the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea on an ongoing basis.  He had previously poured scorn on and refused to back legislation aimed at doing the same thing.  Given that we have never discovered oil, it was, perhaps, easier for him to make that announcement than to ban smoky coal as promised by three Ministers but never delivered on.  The real point is that action speaks louder than words.  Ireland is one of the worst performers in Europe in terms of air pollution and climate change.  The State will miss its 2020 EU targets by a staggering amount.  Why did three former Ministers promise to extend the smoky coal ban but then take no further action?  Was there lobbying by vested interests and, if so, by whom and when?  I ask the Minister to send the details to me if he does not have the information before him.  Does he accept that there is an apartheid approach to clean air in this country, with people living in 20% of it being condemned to breathing in carcinogens, heavy metals and acids?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400004#B00200"><p>I reject entirely the idea that the Government is looking to bring forward or overseeing any form of apartheid in having clean air.  I do so because I agree with the opening points made by the Deputy about the importance of clean air and its significant impact on public health.  I will raise with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, the issue of why commitments regarding a nationwide ban on smoky coal were not followed up.  He is well aware of the importance of clean air.  The climate action plan published by the Government includes many steps which outline how we are looking to make progress in areas that matter in terms of public health.  There are steps additional to those outlined by the Deputy which will help us to make progress in ensuring we will have cleaner air across the country.  I hope we will be able to make progress in that regard in the coming weeks and months.  I will revert to the Deputy at a later point, possibly during the course of this session, with an answer to his specific question as to why the commitments given have not been implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400004#B00300"><p>Obviously, the Minister has a lot on his plate and is probably not up to speed on the wider debate on this issue which I raised in the House in June.  It has also been raised by Deputy James Browne and others.  The reality is that there is apartheid in terms of air quality in this country because the smoky coal ban has not been extended nationwide, in spite of the promises of former Ministers, including Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Naughten.  The EPA's report indicates that there have been approximately 12 breaches of environmental safety limits since last Christmas and that asthma sufferers in Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey, for example, have been warned to stay indoors at these times.  There is apartheid.  In places where the ban is not in effect air quality is far poorer and it damages people's health.  The situation is not equal across the country in that regard.</p><p>However, the promises were made and announced, on foot of which some manufacturers invested in facilities and processes to produce smokeless coal.  They have been left high and dry as a result.  The Minister was warned that certain coal importers were threatening to take legal action.  I am surprised that he was not aware of it.  The smokeless fuel regulations were brought forward in Dublin city and county in 1990.  The figure is now up to 80%.  However, despite all of the promises in the past eight years, the ban has not been extended.  That cuts to the core point.  It is easy to announce and promise things, but it is something altogether different to deliver them on the ground and make them a reality.</p></speech>

It is something on which we must and will make progress.  I have since been informed that it is something the Minister, Deputy Bruton, wishes to make happen.  As the Deputy said, there is the possibility of legal action being taken.  I am that told the Minister is concluding work with the Attorney General on legislation and an approach that we believe will be robust in dealing with the matter.  I agree with the Deputy that clean air is something everyone on this island and in this country should be able to access.  However, as he points out, it is damaging to bring things forward that one cannot operate; therefore, the Minister is taking some time to conclude the work with the Attorney General.  I am sure he will conclude it soon and implement the legislation to ensure everybody will have access to clean air.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400005#C00300"><p>We were all deeply impacted on by the determination and passion of the thousands of young people who took to the streets of Ireland on Friday to demand action on climate change.  When it comes to the greatest threat facing our planet, young people are leading from the front.  Their message is very clear, easily understood and makes sense.  They are five words that will make a difference if listened to by those in power and the Government, namely, "system change, not climate change".  They have asked for action to bring the urgency and radical policies the climate crisis deserves.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has not heard them.  They did not ask the Government to tinker at the edges, for half measures or to pass the buck; however, that is precisely what Government's proposed increase in carbon tax is.  An increase in carbon tax passes the buck to hard pressed low and middle income families who are already fighting to make ends meet, while wealthy corporations are given a pass.  The increase will hit families who are paying the equivalent of a second mortgage in childcare fees, young workers whose incomes are soaked up by extortionate rents, those living in rural Ireland who must use their cars to get around and pensioners who struggle to meet the cost of heating their homes.  It is tinkering because we know from international evidence that carbon taxes do not work.  They do not reduce carbon emissions or change people's behaviour.  It is a half measure because the Government's proposals miss the crucial point.  It has done very little to enable people to transition to a low carbon lifestyle and offset the tax.  It has failed to invest properly to provide viable alternatives in the areas of transport, fuel and heating.  Everyone accepts that we must do more and that we must do better, but we must also agree that climate response policies must be just and fair and, more importantly, that they must work.  I call on the Government to consider a workable alternative, to fund climate action through progressive taxation and then invest in and deliver world-class public transport, to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and retrofitting housing stock.  These are the measure that should be undertaken.  The young people who protested last Friday want genuine investment in climate action.  A carbon tax increase will not deliver on that demand and it is unforgivable to pretend otherwise.  Will the Minster use the budget to map out a real climate action investment plan for which he will put up the cash and indicate that it will not include an increase in carbon tax?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00100"><p>The Deputy made reference to international evidence and the opinions and views of experts.  I will quote our expert in this area, namely, the chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council, Professor John FitzGerald.  He stated:</p><blockquote>A massive body of evidence from across the world shows that carbon taxes are essential.  There are very few carbon tax deniers in the economics community.  A recent statement by a large number of American economists, including 27 Nobel prize winners, identified carbon taxes as essential for the US and the world.</blockquote><p>I am well aware of the impact any change in carbon pricing can have on those who are vulnerable.  I am well aware of the impact it can have on those who are on low incomes and find themselves in a vulnerable position, but I am equally aware of the body of international evidence that states changes in the pricing of carbon are an invaluable way for economies to respond to the existential challenge of climate change.  Sinn F&eacute;in has form in that regard.  It is a party that supports the broadening of the tax base, but it is against the local property tax.  It is a party that supported investment in water infrastructure, but it is against water charges.  It is a party in which inconsistency and hypocrisy are embedded in how it handles policy issues.  What will it state to the young people who are out protesting?  What will it state to those children who left their schools last week, all of whom are looking for significant change?  All of the experts in this area advise that an element of that change needs to be how we can evolve the pricing of carbon in the future.  Let me re-emphasise what I said before and what the Taoiseach said in New York yesterday.  Any move in carbon pricing, if it is agreed to by the Government and supported by the D&aacute;il, is one that will ensure all the revenues will go back to helping those who are in need in the country owing to that change and towards helping the economy to invest in the kind of change that is essential to enable us to deal with climate change.  What will the Deputy say to all of the communities and people who are looking for progress and leadership?  Yet again, Sinn F&eacute;in pretends it can happen without any change or cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00200"><p>The Minister is correct to point out that Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently been against regressive forms of taxation that hit people on lower incomes.  As it happens, I have two climate strikers in my home.  I say to all of the strikers what I have said to them, namely, that tokenism will not cut it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00300"><p>It worked for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I say the same thing to the strikers that I have said to my own two climate strikers, namely, that we will not let the Government get away with it either.  We have had a carbon tax here for ten years and emissions have risen massively.  That is the fact of the matter.  Those who commend carbon tax do so only in the context of alternatives available to citizens to trigger the behavioural change needed.  The Minister knows this, but he is taking the lazy approach.  The easy and lazy thing to do is to have a go at Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody on the left who understands climate justice and a just transition have to be about more than passing the buck and punishing people who are poorer in society.  It has to be about systemic change, but it seems that the Minister does not have the belly for this.  I asked him to drop his hike in carbon tax in favour of investment in a real and radical plan that would make a difference and reduce emissions.  Is he prepared to do this in the budget?</p></speech>

We have a plan.  The climate action plan laid out by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Taoiseach lays out how in the years to come we will invest more in ensuring renewable energy will play a larger part in the economy, we will have more homes retrofitted across the country and that we will have the right transport and planning framework in place to allow the economy and citizens to make the changes needed.</p><p>We are considering the role the pricing of carbon may play in that regard.  Deputy McDonald is calling for additional investment and sustainable and structural change, but she does not have the honesty to explain how it can happen, or how we can pay for the additional investment needed.</p></speech>

The Deputy claims that behaviour has not changed, but she fails to acknowledge that the price of carbon has not changed either.  All we are considering is whether the pricing of carbon can play a role in the change people of all generations want to see happen.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to spell out clearly where it stands on the great pressing issue of climate change.</p></speech>

They have fought bitterly for everything they have, with little or no Government support.  I refer to the plastic factory in Skibbereen and the proposed harvesting of kelp in Bantry, which would have had a devastating effect on the environment and tourism in west Cork.  The Minister could have stepped in on the latter issue but instead stood idly by.  I was called an objector by a Minister for standing against these projects.  The Government's inaction forced the ordinary, honest people of west Cork to dig deep and take legal challenges, which they won and through which they were proved right by the courts of the land.  Following the last round of rural regeneration funding, 48 projects throughout County Cork, particularly those in west Cork, ended up with no funding and shovel-ready projects that could have created much needed employment in west Cork were scrapped.  Only two months ago, during Leader's Questions, I raised with the Taoiseach the proposal for a daily park and ride bus service from Clonakilty to Cork Airport and Cork train station.  It would have taken hundreds of vehicles off the roads weekly and eased pressures on families in west Cork.  While the Taoiseach seemed receptive to the proposal, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport squashed the idea without even researching it.  Seeing as it was Deputy Ross' Department - the man who destroyed rural Ireland - I knew that my proposals were doomed, as rural Ireland and west Cork are not on his satnav.  The Government has a legacy of neglect of west Cork which has stifled major employment opportunities on the three peninsulas, namely, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the Beara Peninsula extending to Bantry and Skibbereen.</p>  <p>  The biggest scandal of this and previous Governments for the people of County Cork is the lack of funding for roads.  In the past few years moneys have only been spent on fire-fighting projects, that is, projects to repair roads that have been destroyed by storms and floodwaters.  However, nothing has been spent on new bypasses or to pass bays since the opening of the Skibbereen bypass in 2003.  A Government must spend on projects in a constituency in order to achieve whatever vision it has, but years of non-investment in major projects and roads in west Cork has left us decades behind the rest of the country.  The Innishannon bypass was proposed almost 20 years ago and although many promises have been made, not one shovel has been turned.  The southern bypass in Bandon is half-finished.  Each year for as many years as I can remember Government politicians have been codding the electorate by announcing that funding will be found to finish the bypass.  Of course, as we are talking about west Cork, why would any Government find the funding to finish this much-needed project?  We are now hearing about a much needed northern relief road for Bandon which would bring cars from Billie's Drive-Thru on the Cork side of Bandon to the Dunmanway road.  We all thought it was a great project, but the people of west Cork should not get too carried away, as it has now emerged that the road will only go half way, as far as Kilbrogan Hill, ruining residential homes and businesses along the way and creating a massive bottleneck in west Cork.  It seems the only vision the Government has for Bandon is two unfinished bypasses.</p>  <p>  We need a vision for west Cork.  The fishing and farming industries are going through disastrous times, but in west Cork we face up to these challenges.  Will the Minister tell me what plans the Government has to invest in roads in west Cork?  I am referring to new major projects which would at least bring us up to speed with the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I am aware, as he is, of the challenges faced by our towns, villages and communities in making progress on issues that are important to them, be that the kind of progress we all want to make in regard to local roads, healthcare facilities or, for example, community employment schemes.  I am well aware of that.  I ask that the Deputy would anchor what he has just said in some acknowledgement of the progress that is being made.  I ask him to acknowledge that this year along the funding we are putting into better infrastructure, better roads, better public transport, better schools, and better hospitals for our citizens is up by 24%.  This is more than &euro;7 billion extra in investment this year in projects that will make a difference to all our citizens, including the Deputy's constituents and the communities he has just outlined.  I am pleased to confirm to him that as part of the negotiations I currently have under way with many colleagues I am confident that we will continue to make progress.  While I acknowledge the areas in which we have to continue to make more progress, I return the point to the Deputy that amidst the litany of failure he has outlined would he not also acknowledge, as I saw at first hand when I visited his constituency earlier this summer, the progress that is being made on roads, schools and in investment that can make a difference to the towns and villages he has just outlined?</p></speech>

I would have taken him to see the roads that are in a scandalous condition and to see the lack of investment throughout west Cork that his Government has continuously overseen.  As Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe has had his hands on the purse strings.  While I respect that he cannot direct specific projects, he can be part of a Government that creates a change in mindset to create funding for major projects in west Cork.  We need moneys that were promised last year to be spent for the much needed repairs of the Ballydehob to Bantry section of the N71.  More than anything else, will the Government approve immediate funding to complete the Bandon southern relief road, the full northern relief road in Bandon, and the Innishannon bypass?  If it does, west Cork will start to catch up with other constituencies.  I ask the Minister to please direct his reply to that and not to everything else that I have not said.</p></speech>

I will give him a concrete example of this.  In 2017, the total investment coming from the then rural and community affairs part of Government was &euro;136 million.  The allocation in 2019 is &euro;291 million.

I am sure the Minister will agree that the best way to turn people against a tax is to mislead them in regard to how it is to be spent.  The reason for the resentment in regard to the local property tax is, I believe, people not knowing where their money is being spent.</p>  <p>  While the conversation surrounding LPT tends to revolve around raising or lowering of the tax by up to 15%, one of the real scandals lies in the detail of how the model underpinning the operation of the tax builds an inherent structural unfairness into the system.  The interdepartmental group report following the review of LPT stated that the work of the baseline review group was completed and that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was considering its findings.  That was last March.  The Government continues to sit on that report.</p>  <p>  We are now at a time when local authorities are considering their budgets for 2020 and making LPT decisions.  Owing to Government inaction, they continue to do so using a model that is grossly unfair.  We know there is an equalisation element to this and that there are 31 councils in the Republic.  Between 2015 and 2019, 21 of these councils received &euro;628 million from the equalisation fund.  The narrative is that the rich councils are transferring funding to the poorer councils but the great irony is that many of the so-called poorer councils have greater staff numbers, more funding and better services.  For example, Wicklow County Council has a baseline of &euro;8.5 million, a point below which it would not be permitted to fall, whereas Mayo, with 12,000 fewer people and a greater income from other sources, has a baseline of over &euro;17 million.  These are artificial baselines based on data from the late 1990s.  Population changes have no bearing in this area.  For example, Fingal County Council must provide for 100,000 additional people, with no recognition that they exist or provision for their needs.  To add to the problem, most of the so-called rich councils must use part of their so-called surplus to self-fund roads and housing from their local property tax.  This replaces Government grants to these councils.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;108 million spent in this way, &euro;86 million came from the four Dublin local authorities.  Counties such as Cork, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are growing areas and they are at the heart of this problem.  The entire system is unfair and the Government knows it.  When will it publish the report on the review of the baseline system, which it received in March last, and does it accept the recommendation of the 2015 Thornhill report that 100% of what is collected locally should be retained locally, if it is to be a local tax?  </p></speech>

What the Deputy has identified is the issue we have in regard to the local equalisation fund, into which receipts from local property tax flow and are then distributed to local authorities, which without those funds, would have a significant deficit in the funding for their local services.  I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy.  It is not a case of any work sitting on a shelf.  As I understand it, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is currently working on a response to the paper I issued in regard to local property tax reform.</p><p>This issue can only be considered in light of future changes we make relating to the structure and breadth of local property tax.  If we are looking to make progress on the operation of the equalisation fund, it needs to happen when change is being made with regard to the local property tax and at a point at which we look again at the valuation dates for that tax.  However, I do not underestimate the complexity and difficulty associated with that change.  This is why the Committee on Budget Oversight has been considering my report on this issue for the past number of months and is due to report back on it very soon and to give me its views on how this issue can be progressed.  </p></speech>

I understand it is complex and have been told there will be winners and losers.  There is a view that we will know who are the winners and losers after the general election.  The decisions being made by local authorities must be made in the context of next year's budget.  Delays in this regard mean that local authorities with rapidly growing populations are stretching limited resources even further.  For example, Meath has half the staff of Kerry.  I am not saying that we can change that overnight but the baseline means that this is counted as a need and resourced so there is no way of catching up in the case of a growing area.  Deferring this until after the general election, which is what is happening, will make people feel very cynical about this.  It undermines the tax.</p></speech>

I also believe that over time, we should look to increase the amount of revenue raised in a particular area and local authority that is spent in the area in which it is raised.  On the cost of doing that, based the work I did on the local property tax report a number of months ago, I can say that the additional cost to the Exchequer would be anywhere between &euro;80 million and &euro;110 million so there is a significant cost involved.  It is not the case that any knowledge regarding winners or losers is being deferred to any point in the future.  I have published all of the potential beneficiaries and those who will lose out from any of the different changes that could be considered by the D&aacute;il.  All that information is in the public domain.  I have provided clarity not only to local authorities but to local property tax bill payers regarding what their liabilities will be for the next year.  We have also provided all the information the local authorities need to be able to conclude their work regarding their budgets.  However, I take the Deputy's point that reform and change in the equalisation fund in the future will be a very important part of ensuring that the local property tax continues to be legitimate and that it can play a more significant role in the future in meeting local needs.</p></speech>

Local ecologist Mr. Collie Ennis, a member of the Irish Herpetological Society and a scientist in Trinity College Dublin who had been instrumental in identifying the rewilding of this area and the degree to which it had become a little gem or miracle in this location, was simply appalled at what transpired.  South Dublin County Council had that very week identified the area in its own documentation and had included the protection of these wetland habitats and reserves as an objective in its Tallaght local area action plan.  Will the Government initiate an inquiry into how this happened?  After a climate action plan has been announced, how can a local authority or a State agency engage in such environmental vandalism, attacking and destroying an area rich in biodiversity?  It defies any logical explanation.  It demands an inquiry because it suggests that all levels of Government are not on board in respect of the most pressing issue of our time.</p></speech>

The number of families falling into homelessness has risen by more than tenfold since 2011.  This means that when Fine Gael came to power, eight families were becoming homeless every month.  Eight years later, that figure has risen to 90 families per month.  It is not new to state the Government has failed to get to grips with the scale of the housing crisis.  It has not delivered solutions for ordinary families who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.  The first thing the Minister must do to solve this crisis is to have the political will to do so.  Does the Minister agree that the rate of family homelessness in this State constitutes a national emergency, and can he outline precisely the measures that will be taken in budget 2020 to address this dire situation?</p></speech>

It is true to say that housing supply has not caught up with demand yet, but it is catching up.  Every month construction is starting on more than 2,000 new homes on sites throughout the country.  We continue to have families in emergency accommodation and that is unacceptable.  We continue to have high levels of presentations of families in emergency accommodation but despite that, there are fewer families in emergency accommodation tonight than there were this time last year.  We continue to make a huge response by providing both emergency accommodation and new homes for families.  The 10,000 new homes added to the stock of social housing are not a small number.  I began my budget engagement with the Minister for Finance some time ago.  We are in the middle of that, and a priority for me in those budget negotiations is ensuring that we have all relevant supports in place.  That includes emergency accommodation, as well as continuing to work through Rebuilding Ireland, which in just two more years will have seen the introduction of 50,000 new homes into the stock of social housing.  We have not seen that in this country for quite some time.</p></speech>

I wish to put on the D&aacute;il record that we have had many more disclosures.  In particular, three women in the housing assistance payment, HAP, sector have contacted me about their situations.</p><p>It is clear that when we have predominantly female, young and vulnerable people seeking scarce accommodation, such as in the HAP sector, the prevalence of exploitation of all kinds, including sexual, will increase.  &quot;Kirsty&quot; spoke out in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  It is particularly sinister that an estate agent, with such power to evict people or give them accommodation, is engaging in sexual harassment.  We have uncovered information from many women concerning their experiences, including receiving comments about their bodies, discouragement of boyfriends, offers of dinner, and getting drunken texts late at night.  The housing crisis is creating a perfect storm for predatory landlords.  That is particularly the case in the HAP sector.  It is the basis for social housing and it is dangerous to give private landlords such control over vulnerable women and children.</p></speech>

It is true that many people are vulnerable and in housing insecurity because not enough homes are yet being built to meet demand.  This year, we introduced significant new protections for tenants.  That is important, as is noting that the majority of people in the rental sector have safety and security in their homes.  I agreed to our meeting later since we last spoke.  I have also been in touch with my counterpart in the UK and I have been told that legislation in this area is dealt with there by the Home Office.  I had discussions with the Minster for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, as well regarding what legislative vehicles exist to protect people.</p>  <p>  Where a person is a tenant, protections exist in the context of the Residential Tenancy Board, RTB, and the new powers we have recently given that body.  Where a person runs into difficulties with letting agents, as described in today's newspapers, he or she can take that issue to the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and I continue to consider this issue to see what further protections might be put in place.  I ask the Deputy to bring any specific information she may have gathered in the past week to our meeting later.  </p>  <p>   As I said to her colleague at the housing committee, however, it is wrong to link this issue to a housing support such as HAP.  Doing so risks putting people in more vulnerable situations because they might refuse to use HAP.  Landlords might also refuse to accept it.  People would, therefore, be at greater risk of going into homelessness.  We are taking this issue seriously and I look forward to our further engagement later.</p></speech>

A woman whom I will call "Chrissie" is a full-time carer for her sister Mary, who has had Wilson's Disease since she was 14 years old.  Mary is now 58.  "Chrissie" is also a half-time carer for her mother who is 84 with deteriorating health.  Mary was recently hospitalised unexpectedly for surgery for a burst appendix.  She spent three weeks in hospital and then got one week of respite in the wonderful Cluain Arainn unit in Tipperary town.</p>  <p>  When "Chrissie" requested home help prior to her sister's discharge, she was told that none might be available.  Mary normally has home help each morning for an hour so that she can be showered, dressed, receive tablets and have a small breakfast.  It was devastating for her to have her sister come home feeling weak, ill-nourished and in need of being built back up and then be told that there might not be any home help.  I have the letter from the HSE.  It states that no home help was available because of maternity leave and sick leave.  This is happening up and down the country.  It is appalling.  It is causing bed blocking in hospitals and a major crisis in emergency departments.  This is totally insensitive but can we expect much more from the Fine Gael party?  It is shocking.</p></speech>

New data revealed to me last weekend showed that the list of those waiting for supports has jumped from 6,238 in March to 7,346 in July.  These figures are enormously disappointing as they show the extent of the unmet need nationwide.  We all know the importance of homecare support.  It is Government policy to support people at home with the correct wrap-around help.  Unfortunately, that has become very difficult given these figures.</p>  <p>  Government policy prior to the recess clearly stated there was no moratorium on new supports for people living at home.  The figures now tell us something much different.  Shockingly, Waterford showed the highest increase from 31 people waiting in March to 124 people waiting at the end of July.  I know we were coming from a low base, but that is a 300% increase.  When will this moratorium be lifted so that people who need homecare supports can avail of them?  </p></speech>

Elderly patients being cared for in hospitals are being sent home with no care whatsoever.  There is deep concern among families about the privatisation of all of these hours and all of this care.

I ask the Minister to seek a report immediately from the HSE and an outline as to how it will deal with this escalating problem.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the effect not being able to access this type of support quickly has on families, patients and those who are ill and vulnerable.  I am well aware of the anxiety and difficulty it can cause.  As the Deputies may be aware, we have &euro;445 million worth of funding in the HSE service plan to ensure we have the right level of support in place for our citizens.  At the end of June, more than 51,000 patients and families were in receipt of homecare packages.  However, I am aware of the issues the Deputies have touched on and I am working with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on them.  I take the point that, particularly in the run-up to the end of the year and the winter period, an issue such as this not only causes further difficulty for families and patients, it can also compound the challenges faced by our emergency departments and hospitals throughout the winter period.  I thank all of the Deputies for raising the issue.</p></speech>

In 2014, planning permission was granted and we all know it takes time to get planning permission.  Not alone has no sod been lifted to prepare for the extension but the HSE had to go back for planning permission this year.  Thankfully, it was granted but it is a disgrace five years later, when the hospital is incredibly busy dealing with a large population, that people are on trolleys, the assessment unit has been closed because of problems with capacity and there is no movement on the new mental health facility.  This is completely wrong.  The new mental health facility and the extension, which will contain an oncology department as well as acute services and an endoscopy department, are in the capital plan for 2019.  When will we see progress on them?</p></speech>

That is an awful joke in my city.  It is turning into an nightmare.  Yesterday, 81 people were lying on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Today, 80 people are packed like sardines into the emergency department.  The INMO has described it as a small hospital being piled into University Hospital Limerick.  Last month, the Minister of Health made a secret dash in and out of the hospital.  He avoided hard questions from public representatives and the media but nothing has happened since his visit.  In fact, circumstances have worsened.  The Government's action to date has been disgracefully inadequate.  When will this overcrowding be properly addressed?</p></speech>

The HSE capital plan, published a number of weeks ago by the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach and I, outlined the plans now funded to increase the number of beds in the health service to just above 11,000.  It is good to hear that at least one of the projects to which Deputy O'Loughlin referred is included in the capital plan.</p><p>We have put funding in place to increase the number of hospital beds.  We have recently made changes to how we pay nurses to ensure we will have staff in place and more beds to deliver better care for patients.  I take on board the points the Deputies have made about the need for this work to be commenced and done quickly.  I am sure the HSE and the Department of Health will ensure the additional funding I have made available to them is spent quickly.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, that framework recognises Waterford as a regional city.  The local authority has asked the Government to properly support the North Quays development which is very important to the economic development of Waterford city and county and the entire south east.  Three years ago the local authorities entered into discussions with a private investor who was willing to put &euro;400 million on the table, contingent on the provision of State funding.  To date, we have received no solid commitment on numbers from the Government to ensure the project will proceed.  There is a concern that it could slip if the Government's commitment is not put on the table.  When will the Government announce the next round of funding from the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund?  I know that the Minister visited Waterford recently and saw the site.

I refer to the case of Hannah Donnelly from Drogheda who was admitted to Temple Street hospital in March 2017 for much needed surgery.  She has Apert syndrome.  Complications arose, as a result of which she has been in hospital for two and a half years.  Medical advice given in March 2018 stated the best place for Hannah was at home.  The family set about fundraising in the community.  They remodelled their home and purchased a wheelchair accessible vehicle.</p><p>A business case for 24-7 home care supports was submitted for approval because Hannah's medical case is complex.  Recently the family was offered four hours a week transitional care.  That is an absolute insult. </p> <p> Hannah is 18 years old.  She is desperate to get home.  She has a ten-year old sister at home.  She deserves as near as possible quality of life at home.  The only thing preventing Hannah going home is the HSE's refusal to fund her home care package.  Will the Minister please step in and instruct the HSE to fund that package so that this 18-year old girl, whose picture I am holding up for the Minister to see, can go home to her family?  There is a massive campaign locally to get Hannah home for Christmas.  Will he please intervene?  This is not right and it is not even humane at this stage.  The Minister has the power to intervene.  I beg him to do it.  It costs more, as he knows, to keep Hannah in hospital than it ever would to fund her home care support package.  I beg the Minister, please. </p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy can understand why given the range of difficulties the health services have to deal with every day.  I am sure, however, that because she has raised it in the way she has the HSE will be aware of it and will do all it can to make sure that Hannah&rsquo;s needs and desire to be at home with her family can be met. </p></speech>

Yesterday we saw the latest development in the crisis in rail capacity, with Irish Rail asking people to stagger their journeys, to talk to their employers and arrange different working hours.  Is this the sum total of Government policy to tackle this crisis?</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, at the end of August about this matter.  One of his staff wrote back stating: "The operation and provision of services on the rail network are matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority."  He is not here today.  While I appreciate that it is a very busy and demanding schedule to try to compete with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, to launch car charging facilities that are not yet in operation in Marlay Park, will the Minister for Finance to clarify what does the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, see as his role if it is not to do with rail capacity and implementing the programme for Government?  What is the Government going to do in the here and now to cater for the commuting misery being suffered by many all over this country not just in commuting to the major cities but also inter-city? </p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that there are few things more frustrating than standing at a bus stop and seeing a bus go by that is full or not being able to board a train that is full.  I know, however, from my engagement with the Minister that the funding going into public transport is growing and that is due to the efforts of him and his Department.  Projects such as the rail centre, the national signal centre that the Minister recently had approved by Cabinet, are needed to increase capacity on public transport and to deal with the needs of commuters that have been highlighted by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I refer to people living in remote areas who need their car.  It will already cost them &euro;4.50 extra to fill their car before the carbon tax is increased at all.  Does the Minister have any idea that such people need their cars to go to work, to take their children to school, and to travel to doctor's appointments and hospitals?  It will affect hauliers throughout the country and farmers who need their tractors.  Does the Minister have any idea how the measure will hurt people and does he realise the price of home heating oil already has increased, before putting it up even further?

I was involved in this debate this time last year and, as we approach budget day again, I am very much aware of the concerns commuters will have, as well as the concerns of people who do not have the kinds of public transport options that people in our larger cities have.  Nevertheless, I am equally aware, as are many of the people the Deputy referred to, of the pressing need to change how our economy and country flow in order that we can play our part in responding to the change to the climate taking place in front of us.  My commitment and what I am looking to do, subject to approval by the House, in respect of any changes we make to carbon taxation, is that those on the lowest incomes will be on the top of our agenda for how we will support them at a time of change.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1278" speakername="Kevin O'Keeffe" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400016#O00800"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>The current position is that section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 permits the District Court, under certain conditions, to grant an occasional licence to the holder of an on-licence on the occasion of a special event being held at a place to which no licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor is attached. </p><p>This can often take the form of a local festival or annual celebration or fundraiser.  However, the subsection provides that an occasional licence in respect of a dance shall not be granted unless it is held elsewhere than in the open air, or in a tent, marquee or other such structure.  To grant a licence, the event must occur within a permanent structure if alcohol is to be sold.  This creates a position where community organisations are limited in the nature and location of events they can hold in a somewhat arbitrary way.  As it stands, this prohibition leads to considerable difficulties for community groups and festival organisers that are not necessary.  Many of the organisations hit by this law rely on a small number of big events to fund their activities for the years ahead.  Local communities are also being unfairly tasked with raising money for more complex solutions and venues than would otherwise be needed.</p> <p> Rural Ireland is running out of suitable structures and locations.  Under the current law, to gain a licence exemption to sell alcohol at a gig or dance, one is obliged to provide a permanent structure from which alcohol can be sold.  During the summer, a number of events were proposed and were lucky enough to be approved because of practical negotiation with garda&iacute; and people from the District Court.  I propose that we amend the law through this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400017#P00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to repeal the following guidelines issued to planning authorities thereafter, namely, Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, March 2018, and Urban Development and Building Heights, December 2018.</blockquote><p>In the dying days of the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and junior Minister, Senator Paudie Coffey, introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2015.  It seemed a technical and uneventful Bill to many people but one of the provisions, an amendment to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, introduced a profound change to the way in which planning law is made in this State.  It essentially gave the power to any Minister with responsibility for the environment, as it was then, and now housing to unilaterally introduce mandatory planning guidelines that would override the democratically agreed decisions of city and county councils.  This would have to be complied with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local authorities and others.</p><p>There was no requirement in this amendment to have such significant powers approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas or any other democratically elected body.  The Minister could undertake public consultation but the unilateral power to set planning policy was to be vested in the hands of an individual.  The power is not only deeply undemocratic but in the two instances in which it has been used, it has led to negative planning outcomes.  The current Minister with responsibility for housing has used it twice, last March and in December 2018, introducing in the first instance new design standards for apartments and in the second instance new mandatory guidelines with respect to building heights.</p><p>The first action has led to a significant deterioration in standards.  For example, developers can now provide smaller apartments and increase the number of studio apartments in a given development, irrespective of whether that is an appropriate use of the development space in that geographical area.  There is less of a requirement for dual aspects, car parking and storage space.  With respect to both build-to-rent developments and the highly controversial co-living proposals, we have seen an even further deterioration of standards.</p><p>Likewise, the Minister often tells the House and the public that an increase in building heights is necessary to increase density when any first-year architecture student can say that the relationship between densities and heights is not that straightforward.  Higher developments can have a lower density because they require more undeveloped space for amenities and car parking.  Some of the most effective use of heights and densities are mid-rise developments, the vast majority of which are permitted under existing city and county development plans.  We know that when permissible heights are increased, the price of land is driven up and accommodation becomes more expensive.  Even if last year's guidelines from the Minister increase output - there is no guarantee of that - they certainly will not increase the affordability of that output.  Just like with apartment sizes, this makes for very bad planning.</p><p>This does two simple things.  It would repeal the bad decision made by the Oireachtas in 2015 and early 2016 and remove the power I have described from the Minister.  If the Minister wants power to set planning guidelines, he should be forced to bring forward the proposal to the Oireachtas for its approval in the same way the Government would with any other legislation.  That is not what the current power does.  The Bill would also seek to repeal the two ministerial guidelines that have been introduced so we can return to the regime that existed before 2016.  It worked perfectly fine, particularly in the context of the democratically agreed provisions of the local authorities.</p><p>The Bill is very straightforward and although I know the Government will probably oppose it when we bring it to Second Stage, I hope it will not oppose it on First Stage so we can at least allow the Oireachtas to have that debate and come to a democratic decision on these crucial matters.</p></speech>

In light of the particular challenges faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of examination and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the PDF, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance of by the PDF representative associations.  Any suggestion that these measures are only worth 96 cent per day is disingenuous and a soundbite that has been used to misinform people.</p>  <p>  The report also contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service.</p><p>The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out timelines and objectives, which indicates its commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the pay commission.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force and identifies further retention measures within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.  Work on implementing the plan is under way and, under my direction, being prioritised by civil and military management.</p> <p> I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations of the public service pay commission, in tandem with pay benefits being delivered under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 with the most recent being a 1.5% increase on 1 September, will help to ameliorate the recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force.</p></speech>

The pay commission report indicates that 57.8% of Permanent Defence Force members stated that they will leave in the next two years and, of those, 84.5% pointed to pay as a primary consideration.  The Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, stated today at the conference of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, that the situation will get worse before it gets better.  The proof of the Government's plan involving the pay commission will be whether the Minister of State can end the exodus of personnel and bring the complement back towards the target of 9,500.  Based on the current rate of attrition and turnover, it appears that the number of personnel is still falling.  Structures in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are collapsing.  When does the Minister of State expect to turn the corner in terms of personnel numbers?  Not even the best recruitment campaign could bridge the gap created by the current exodus and retention difficulties.  I am not sure whether the report of the pay commission has thus far achieved what the Minister of State set out in his statement.</p></speech>

As I stated, we are competing in a very strong and buoyant jobs market in which there is almost full employment.  I asked the two Defence Forces representative associations to consider very carefully the report of the pay commission published in July.  I am delighted that the recommendations of the public service pay commission were accepted yesterday at the biannual RACO conference.  Immediate and tangible benefits will accrue to RACO members from that acceptance.  We have increased the military service allowance and restored allowances cut under the Haddington Road agreement, as well as bringing back the pilot retention scheme.  An implementation plan to strengthen the Defence Forces is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach and we are into phase 1 of the plan.  There are specific timelines set down for its implementation and it is being led by a civil and military team.</p></speech>

He humiliated the tenure of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence by showing leadership on the issue.  RACO stated that there is much frustration and disappointment at the meagre increases set out in the Government's proposals, which is hardly an endorsement of the plan.  Of course, when one has a gun to one's head, one will accept a meagre increase.  Far more must be done to address the recruitment and retention crisis.  When does the Minister of State expect the gap between current and desired staffing levels to close?  That will be the key metric by which to judge the report.</p></speech>

The Deputy does not have the responsibility of dealing with public sector pay.  Of course, his party previously had that responsibility and got us into a big mess.  I want to get back to a strength level of 9,500 personnel and that is achievable with the assistance of military management, the Department of Defence, RACO and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  All of those parties want to reach that figure.  There is funding for a complement of 9,500 personnel.  I have acknowledged that public sector pay is a significant challenge for me as Minister of State with responsibility for defence and for the Government as a whole because public servants are keeping a watchful eye on what is happening in other areas of the public service.  I am not sure whether the Deputy will acknowledge that.  I want to be able to get the staffing level back up to 9,500.  It will be difficult to do so because we are competing in a buoyant economy with almost full employment.  There is significant appetite among the private sector for members of the Defence Forces because of their training and the way they are equipped.  I acknowledge that we are losing some very good people.  People should also consider the numerous benefits of being a member of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

The buoyant labour market and increased competition across sectors to attract personnel are key factors.  The level of the departure of personnel can fluctuate, as can the timing of departures.  As such, it is very difficult to predict accurately future departure rates.  The current departure rates are presenting difficulties for the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In light of the particular issues faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the public service pay commission with undertaking a comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations, some of which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements.  Immediate measures include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.  The report also contains a broad range of recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service.  The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out timelines and objectives, which indicates its commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the pay commission.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force and the identification of other retention measures.  These will be progressed within the framework of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.  Under my direction, this work is being prioritised.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over its lifetime.  The increases due to date under the agreement have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2020.  I am satisfied that the range of measures being progressed is an appropriate response to the current difficulties.</p></speech>

However, the view on this side of the House is that he is not dealing with reality.  He referred to changes within the system but we know that personnel are leaving and that recruitment and retention have become almost impossible due to poor pay and repeated cuts to allowances, as well as poor working conditions.  There are also challenges relating to accommodation for personnel.</p><p>There is a big problem with morale and while the Minister of State may be addressing the conferences, he is saying nothing that will bolster that.  I would argue that the Government has created this crisis itself.</p> <p> Radical and urgent solutions are needed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform assessed the long-term turnover rate in the Defence Forces to be 6.4%.  Even using the Government's own optimistic predictions, it will not reach establishment strength of 9,500 until 2026.  According to RACO, however, the real turnover rate is 10.3%.  Is RACO wrong?  What the Minister of State is saying here does not add up.  He is giving a glossy message that everything will be sorted but the reality on the ground and coming from the conferences is quite different.  </p></speech>

I addressed the conference this morning and I totally disagree with the Deputy's assertion.  While Deputy Crowe mentioned allowances, the Public Service Pay Commission report has restored the allowances to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels and the Deputy fails to acknowledge that.  Any officer of the Defence Forces, having accepted the pay commission's report in full, will receive the immediate benefits.  It is worth an additional &euro;10 million annually over the position last year for enlisted personnel and officers.  If PDFORRA accepts the recommendations, all its members will also receive immediate benefits.  Allowances, including the weekend and 24-hour duty allowances, comprised one of the biggest issues raised with me in recent years.  I wanted to ensure the allowances were restored and the independent pay commission recommended that they be restored to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels.  If the representative associations vote for it, their members will feel the benefits.</p></speech>

One can tinker around the sides in respect of allowances and so on but the issue of core pay must be addressed.  That is one reason the representative associations want to move on and have representation at the table to argue for their case.  They perceive a weakness in that the Minster of State is not championing or pushing that forward, which is a big problem.  There is a great problem with morale.  The figures show that people are leaving day after day.  The Minister of State needs to do something different.  Pay is clearly one of the issues, as are working conditions.  Any efforts regarding retention are not working at present. The Minister of State has stated he understands the challenges but there is concern that lack of pay and low morale are not being addressed.  People respond every day by leaving the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

That is very easy to say.  I assure the Deputy that were I to state that we would increase core pay for the Defence Forces but for nobody else, he would be in here the next morning hopping off the ceiling saying that if the Government was going to do it for the Defence Forces then it would have to do it for everyone else.  The public service stability agreement provides for increases for the Defence Forces year on year.  The Deputy should look at the tangible increases in core pay each year, which will continue until 2020 when talks on the next public service pay agreement will commence.</p></speech>

This represented an increase of &euro;51 million, or 7%, over the corresponding 2018 allocation and includes funding for pay and allowances for over 10,400 public service employees, ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs and the ongoing renewal and upgrading of defence equipment and barracks infrastructure, as well as funding in respect of Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society.  It allows the Defence Forces to deliver on all of their assigned roles, both at home and overseas, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. </p>  <p>Overall expenditure on the Defence Vote at the end of August was &euro;418 million, representing 55% of the total budget provision.  This is broadly in line with expenditure trends in recent years.  At the end of August, capital expenditure was &euro;28 million below the profile set out at the beginning of the year, mainly due to later capital project delivery timelines.  Non-pay expenditure was broadly in line with profile and pay expenditure was &euro;24 million below profile, mainly due to payroll numbers being below approved strength levels.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor expenditure across the defence Vote very closely, and it is intended that any savings arising within the defence Vote at year-end would, in consultation and agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, be used to address spending requirements elsewhere in the defence Vote group, including Army pensions.</p></reply>

The pay budget is &euro;24 million below what was budgeted for so far this year.  That is because of the mass exodus under the watch of the Minister of State.  They are not being paid the appropriate allowances and they are on the poverty line.  The Minister of State is yet to outline where he will find the &euro;10 million.  He was at the RACO conference, speaking of how he had found &euro;10 million and how he fought for the personnel and the Defence Forces.  Will he seek an extra &euro;10 million from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or will he take the &euro;10 million from the unspent &euro;24 million on some of the retention issues?  Despite the &euro;10 million in the pay commission report, once again there will be a surplus in the pay budget.  It is shocking that once again under the Minister of State's tenure, he will have a surplus in the pay allocation when there is such a crisis in retention and so many members of the Defence Forces are on the poverty line.  It is very worrying that spending is &euro;24 million under profile.</p></speech>

I assure him that any savings from pay is redirected to the organisation with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy and I have attended meetings of the defence committee where we discussed Estimates.  It goes into Army pensions or is redirected into the organisation to buy ships or otherwise improving infrastructure, such as armoured personnel carriers and aircraft platforms.  The purchase of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft is at an advanced stage and they are due for delivery in early 2020.  The Deputy will also be aware that we are also replacing the CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p><p>Pay savings are redirected into the organisation.

Has he listened to himself?  We are talking about a recruitment and retention crisis and he has record levels of pay savings, the very matter that is causing the recruitment and retention crisis and putting people on the bread line in the Defence Forces.  He is telling us that he is buying a few aeroplanes and that a few ships will be docked.  On what planet is he living when it comes to managing the pay difficulties that are causing the crisis?  He has confirmed ongoing pay savings for the House.  A sum of &euro;24 million has been save this year and there will be record levels of pay savings this year based on the Minister of State's projections today.  He has confirmed savings of &euro;24 million up to the end of August or early September.  That nearly exceeds the maximum amount in the gross pay savings in Vote 36 in previous years.  That demonstrates the difficulties which have caused the exodus of staff.  The Minister of State should not tell us about the ships and the aeroplanes that will be purchased or the money that will be reallocated for capital spending.  We need people in the organisation.  That is what the Defence Forces are proud to have.  People are the core of the organisation, not empty aeroplanes or vessels.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400020#S01700"><p>I am aware of the long-standing desire of PDFORRA to associate with the ICTU.  Section 2(3) of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 prohibits the Defence Forces representative associations from being associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body without the consent of the Minister.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force also cannot become members of a trade union.  To compensate for these limitations, there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces ombudsman and a conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, upheld the prohibition on the right of military personnel to strike but did conclude that Ireland was in violation of the charter in respect of the right to organise, that is, to affiliate to certain organisations, and the right to negotiate collective agreements.  These findings were considered as part of an independent review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force which was completed last year.  One of the recommendations from the review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the ICTU to explore the practicalities of a Permanent Defence Force representative association forming an association or affiliation with the ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.  Association with the ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  I asked my officials to examine the matter further and, in that regard, defence management, civil and military, has engaged in discussions with the ICTU.  Defence management has also met the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to discuss the matter.  I have also recently discussed the matter of ICTU affiliation or association with both RACO and PDFORRA.  The feasibility of association is the subject of ongoing discussion and engagement with the ICTU.  The implications of possible association or affiliation are being carefully considered.</p></speech>

He is aware that a motion was passed by the D&aacute;il on 13 June which called for Defence Forces representative organisations to be able to take up associate membership of the ICTU.  The Government should accept this position which is the position of the D&aacute;il.  The ICTU's national council has since approved, in principle, an application from PDFORRA to become an associate member of congress.</p>  <p>  While members of the Defence Forces recognise the unique nature of their service to the State, they should not be disadvantaged as a result.  Defence Forces members are the lowest paid of all public servants.  When it comes to public sector talks, members of the Defence Forces representative organisations do not have a seat at the negotiating table.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  Members of the Defence Forces have also been forced to take their case to the European Committee of Social Rights, as the Minister of State pointed out, to have their right to collective bargaining recognised.  The committee ruled that the Government was in breach of the European Social Charter in respect of the right to organise, the right to affiliate to a certain organisation and the right to enter into negotiation and collective bargaining.</p>  <p>  To allay fears about a military strike, PDFORRA has clearly indicated that it is not interested in securing a right to strike.  Its moves to become part of a trade union will not in any way jeopardise national security.  Trade union membership is not incompatible with military service.  We know this from what happens in other countries.  Will the Minister of State confirm that he will not veto PDFORRA's affiliation to the ICTU as an associate member?</p></speech>

As I have stated, my officials are engaging with the ICTU.  I will await the outcome of that engagement.  The Deputy is right that a motion was passed in the D&aacute;il.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion, in which Fianna F&aacute;il, with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party, called for PDFORRA to be given the right to have representation through the ICTU.  The motion was supported by the Opposition and tabled by Deputy Jack Chambers.</p>  <p>  When Mr. Gerard Barry was looking at the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, as part of the terms of reference, I included the question about the ICTU that had come from the European Committee of Social Rights to ascertain how the Defence Forces representation arrangements and pay determination system compared in an international context.  I asked him to look at that matter.  The recommendation was that there be engagement with the ICTU, the Department of Defence and military management.  That engagement has been ongoing and I am waiting for the report to come back to me.  I will consider it.  I will also consider and take into account all of the concerns of any association or individual when I am making the decision.</p></speech>

There is no legitimate reason it does not deserve to have its voice heard, just like any other public service representative body.  The Minister of State mentioned the motion that was passed in the D&aacute;il, but, again, he says he will wait and see.  How long are workers to wait?  The rights of those working in the Defence Forces should not be less than those of any other worker.  Again, we have a situation where more cases are being dragged through the courts.  The Government needs to act.  This is one area that could be addressed to raise morale in the Defence Forces.  The motion passed by the D&aacute;il called on the Government to bring forward legislation to provide for implementation of the working time directive within a six-month period.  Will the Minister of State abide by that timeline?  Will the working time directive be adhered to within a six-month period?  That was also included in the motion passed by the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

PDFORRA has requested on a number of occasions to either become affiliated with or to take up associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  These requests raise significant challenges from both a Government point of view and a societal perspective.  We also have to take into account the risks of impinging on the military chain of command, which requires detailed consideration.  The request for associate membership of ICTU requires us to consider the potential for conflicts and divided loyalties that may well arise when the Government decides to deploy the Defence Forces for the maintenance of essential services.  The ability of the Defence Forces to perform all their duties as assigned by the Government cannot be impeded by affiliation with any organisation.  My officials are currently engaging with ICTU on this issue and I am awaiting a full and comprehensive report, which I am not going to rush.  I want a comprehensive report in order that I can consider the findings and make a recommendation to the Government, whatever that may be.  We have to carefully consider this because this is a broad move away from what we have had in the past.</p></speech>

The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales.  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and all other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  The increases due under the agreement have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement. </p>  <p>  In light of the particular challenges faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. </p>  <p>  The Government has prepared a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the Public Service Pay Commission's report.  The measures are aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment, retention and conditions of service.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations, and the completion and implementation of actions related to a review of technical pay arrangements for grades 2 to 6.  The plan also outlines timelines and objectives, indicating the commitment to deliver on the pay commission&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the pay and conditions of all members of the public service are commensurate with their skill levels and the work undertaken.</p></speech>

I have brought this issue up multiple times and will continue to do so until members of the Defence Forces are given the respect they deserve, which is indicated by how they are paid and their conditions of employment.</p>  <p>  The findings of the study undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission a few months ago conclude that the Defence Forces are at a critical juncture.  It is stated that the findings presented intimate that without immediate and substantial intervention, particularly in respect of pay, allowances and pension entitlements, the organisation may, within a short time, face major difficulties in maintaining its personnel establishment and in carrying out its mandate.  Due to its terms of reference, the commission was precluded from dealing with aspects of core pay but it would have been interesting to hear its thoughts on that subject.  I am sure it would have had something to say.</p></speech>

Nobody wanted to do it.  As our public finances are improving, the public service stability agreement is now in place, in which there are real financial benefits for all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The independent pay commission examined issues of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  It reported back in July and made a number of recommendations, including a package of &euro;10 million per annum.  In addition, I was able to personally negotiate some outstanding payments for members of the Defence Forces with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at a cost of &euro;1.7 million.</p>  <p>  I was delighted that RACO, which is the representative group for officers of the Defence Forces, accepted the recommendations of the pay commission yesterday.  There are real tangible benefits for officers of the Defence Forces in doing so and I understand that PDFORRA will also consider the recommendations shortly.  I hope it also accepts the recommendations because that would be of real benefit to members of the Defence Forces.  I acknowledge the challenges and the concerns the Deputy has around recruitment and retention and on the latter in particular.  However, an implementation body has been put in place for phase one of the strengthening of the Defence Forces, which I am confident will make a real difference and put more money into the pockets of Defence Forces personnel.</p></speech>

At its annual conference today, RACO delegates called for a pay review body for the Defence Forces, which I and my party would support.  The rate of turnover in the Defence Forces is currently 10%, which is happening without adequate retention measures or a pay review.  The organisation will never reach its establishment of 9,500 personnel, despite the current high level of recruitment, because it is like constantly pouring water into a bucket with a hole at the bottom.  RACO has also passed motions on allowances and has called for improved conditions, such as improved living quarters for married and single members.  That would act as a very real retention tool, as it would provide a stable, secure and modern living environment for the families of Defence Forces personnel.  Members of the Defence Forces are using their own voice and are calling for dignity.  They are calling for the right to live a normal life in Ireland, to be able to afford the basics and to provide for themselves and their families.  They need a future worth believing in, not the fear of long-term homelessness once their service is complete.  I do not think that is too much to ask of a body as august as the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

He is correct that RACO has called for its own independent pay review group.  The UK Government has a similar group in place, but the UK Government also has a different method of determining rates of public sector pay.</p><p>They have independent pay review bodies for individual sectors; one each for the army, police, teachers and nurses.  It would be difficult to take out one public sector group here and have a separate pay determination for it.  That is, however, not within my gift; it is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The British armed forces do not have representative associations to negotiate on their behalf.  They do not have group associations such as the PDFORRA and RACO to interact with Government or with the Departments of Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The overarching public service pay policy, as I said earlier, is a matter for the Minister for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> I acknowledge RACO's leadership in accepting the independent commission's recommendations.</p></speech>

Cybersecurity is a standing item on the agenda of the Government task force on emergency planning, which I chair.  The response to cyberthreats remains a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment taking the lead role, with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.</p><p>The first national cybersecurity strategy, agreed by Government in 2015, set out a series of measures that would be taken to build the capability of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, and to achieve a high level of security for computer networks and critical infrastructure in the State.  The NCSC, which is located in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provides a range of cybersecurity services to owners of Government ICT infrastructure and critical national infrastructure.  The centre is focused on developing capacity to protect Government information and communications networks, and on engaging with stakeholders on sharing information, securing systems and responding to incidents.</p><p>The NCSC is also home to the national computer security incident response team, CSIRT, which acts as a national point of contact involving entities within Ireland and as the point of contact for international discussions and collaboration on issues of cybersecurity.  A revised national cybersecurity strategy is to be published by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, in the coming weeks that will address issues raised by the Deputy such as resourcing and preparedness.  Officials from my Department and members of the Defence Forces have been actively involved in the development of this revised strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area.</p><p>In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a service level agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide support in the area of national cybersecurity.  The overall aim of this agreement is to improve the cybersecurity of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised.</p><p>As the Deputies will no doubt be aware, cybersecurity is a multifaceted challenge that is constantly evolving.  The nature of the threat and the potential impact also varies considerably depending on the approach and objective of those with malicious intent.  In that context, my Department implements a programme of continuous review in relation to ICT security to keep up to date with current threat levels.  Details of measures taken are not publicised for security reasons. </p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>While it would also be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons, the priority for the Defence Forces communications and information services, CIS, corps is the protection of the Defence Forces communications network.  Other activities undertaken by the CIS corps include the monitoring and handling of cyber incidents, the enhancement of Defence Forces cyber situational awareness, and the provision of cyber awareness training.  </p></speech>

Cyberattacks signify a grave threat to countries across Europe, yet we are not doing enough to protect ourselves.  One example was in 2017 when Ireland's power grid was the subject of a suspected nation-state attack, which was discovered two months after the initial attack.  It was not detected by Ireland; it was instead notified to the Irish authorities by the UK's national cyber security centre.  This is an example of how cyber attacks represent a threat to our State infrastructure and to the broader foreign direct investment here.  It should not take a serious attack to properly resource and plan a significant, modern defence matter, which is being reflected across many countries in the EU.  We need to resource it.</p>  <p>  It was reported during the summer that the Defence Forces stood down an internal cybersecurity team because of the lack of personnel and qualified staff and a further exodus of specialised personnel.  That team was responsible for monitoring the security of military IT networks to safeguard them from hostile state attacks.  Not only do we have an issue with the unit within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, due to the exodus of personnel, there are question marks over monitoring our own internal networks in the Defence Forces.  That is also a concern.</p></speech>

The Government task force on emergency planning also maintains cybersecurity as a standing item on the agenda where regular updates are provided and where issues of common interest may be raised and addressed.  The Deputy is correct that cyber attacks present a new threat and it has to be taken seriously by Government.  This is why we have a dedicated team in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As I said, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, retains overall responsibility for this area.  The Defence Forces have their own cybersecurity team to look after their own networks.  It is important that we are able to maintain security on our own networks, that we do not depend on any outsourcing of any capabilities to come in to assist in that, and that we can handle our own cybersecurity.  This is a matter of concern.  Given the number of multinational companies operating in Ireland, we have to be prepared for any cyberattack.  As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, I assure the Deputy that we get regular updates.  I have met people who work in the cybersecurity centre and they are top class.  We would want to be very careful not to rubbish their capability and what they are able to do.</p></speech>

I did not realise the questions were being grouped.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister of State's words of confidence towards the end of his contribution.  Having spoken with some people in the industry at a recent conference, they highlighted the various insecurities in our system.  I wonder, specifically, where is this co-ordinated within government? The Minister, Deputy Bruton's, Department, has the key role, as the host for the NCSC.  I am interested in how the Department of Defence fits in with that.  Where is the primary point of defence for cybersecurity?  Where would we best deploy extra resources if we were able to get them?  This should be a priority for Government because we live in an increasingly insecure cybersecurity world.  As the Minister of State said, given that we are the host for some 30% of all EU data, there could be reputational damage to that industry if the State's security systems cannot protect our networks, and to the defence system of the country.  Where is the co-ordination and who is the lead Minister when it comes to cybersecurity?</p></speech>

If business people have come to the Deputy and they are concerned, I ask him to bring those concerns to the attention of the Minister as soon as possible.</p><p>If there are Members of this House who are concerned about the inadequacies of Government in this area, there is no point raising them here in the House.  They should raise them with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, who, with the team working in the departmental cybersecurity centre, has overall responsibility for this area.  I have full confidence in this team, led by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p> <p> The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a service level agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide support in the area of national cybersecurity.  The overall aim of this agreement is to improve the cybersecurity of the State through various types of assistance, while at the same time ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised.  As I said, there is a service legal agreement in place under which personnel of the Defence Forces are seconded to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but, as of now, no Defence Forces personnel are on secondment.</p></speech>

If there is an attack here, the Defence Forces will have to be involved.  We know that the Defence Forces are unable to monitor their own internal networks on a 24-7 basis.  Coupled with the fact that owing to a shortage of personnel in the Defence Forces, it is not possible to second Defence Forces personnel to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the same way as has been done up to now, this represents a serious threat to Ireland that we need to address.  It is a threat to our foreign direct investment and State infrastructure and is a threat that exists in many other democracies across the world.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State's suggestion that we are criticising the staff is unfair.  The strategic role of the cybersecurity unit in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was heavily criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who said it lacked a strategic approach.  We know that owing to the decline in Defence Forces personnel, there are no staff available for secondment to that unit.  Deputy Kehoe, as Minister of State with responsibility for defence, has a responsibility to respond to this 21st century threat.  It is not politics; it is a reality.  The response needs to be greater than a deflection to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment because this represents a serious threat to us all if it comes to pass.</p></speech>

We know from the Edward Snowden revelations and others that all digital information leaving Ireland is accessible from Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ.  While in the past we have had a co-operative arrangement with the UK, which I hope will continue, there must be a real risk for us in the UK not being a fellow European Union member, in that it may restrict our access to co-ordination with what is happening in the UK in that regard.  One has a different working relationship with a country that is not a member of the European Union.  What, if any, preparations have been made by the Department of Defence, alone or with the Department of Communications, Climate Action or Environment, in terms of enhancing our security, taking account of the new cybersecurity environment that will exist when, and if, the UK exits the European Union?</p></speech>

I am not trying to deflect from or make politics of this issue.  I have stated on numerous occasions that cyberattacks are a 21st century threat.  There are many international IT companies located in Ireland, including Google, Facebook and Amazon.  In regard to what Government has done already, budget 2018 provided increased funding for additional capacity in the national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, in terms of personnel and technology.  The resources for the NCSC have been considerably expanded in recent years to meet its new responsibilities under the EU directives.  A new cybersecurity strategy is being prepared, which takes into account the latest assessment of risks and international experience.  Ongoing resourcing requirements will be reviewed in the context of the next cybersecurity strategy, which will be published in the coming weeks by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  The Minister provided an update in this regard at the most recent meeting of the Government task force on emergency planning, which is led by Mr. Richard Browne and meets every six or eight weeks.  The national cybersecurity centre does fantastic work.  Its work, on a daily basis, to protect our IT systems should not be diminished.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Jack Chambers, the priority of the Defence Forces is to protect its own networks.  If there are Defence Forces personnel surplus to requirements, under the service legal agreement, they will be seconded to the NCSC.  Unfortunately, there are no surplus staff.  These people are highly sought after by the private sector.  This is one the issues considered by the pay commission.</p></speech>

The role of the mission is to ensure security, stabilisation and protection of civilians; supporting national political dialogue and reconciliation; assisting in the re-establishment of State authority; the rebuilding of the security sector and the promotion and protection of human rights in Mali. </p>  <p>  Two officers deployed on 7 September to Bamako, where the MINUSMA force headquarters is located.  They have since completed some initial training and have taken up their respective roles in the force headquarters.  An additional 11 personnel drawn from the Army Ranger Wing, ARW, deployed with the German armed forces to Camp Castor in Gao, Mali, on 12 September 2019.</p>  <p>  All deployed personnel are currently embedding with the larger German company and are carrying out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission mandate.</p>  <p>  The ARW will deploy as a team to carry out surveillance and intelligence gathering operations.  They will deploy as part of a larger intelligence surveillance reconnaissance company and, therefore, would not be deployed in isolation.  The task force utilises technology via unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, and human sources, that is, personnel on the ground engaging with local people, to gather intelligence for the UN mission.  The ARW will support this effort by providing personnel to undertake these tasks.  While the Army Ranger Wing team will engage on a day-to-day basis with the individuals in the local population as part of their intelligence and information gathering remit, they will benefit from the security effort that is in place to protect the full company.</p>  <p>  This MINUSMA deployment is for a period of 24 months from September 2019 to September 2021.</p></speech>

We voted against it in this House, as did others.  We did so because we were being asked to endorse and become part of the UN's response to a coup in that state and to train Malian military to fight a civil war.  This is a security peace enforcement mission that involves taking sides and Sinn F&eacute;in believes this undermines our neutrality.  The mission in which the Army rangers are involved has a security-only focus.  It does not involve any roadmap to peace.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, the Defence Forces should be seen as mediators, continuing Ireland's proud role in supporting peace efforts in the region or anywhere else in the world, and not as one-sided enforcers.  The deployment of personnel to act as enforcers rather than mediators changes the nature of Irish engagement with international politics.  </p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State receive regular updates on the mission and the security measures to protect Irish troops?</p></speech>

Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the military authorities and I receive military advice on the security situation in Mali at the time of deployment.  As stated by Deputy Crowe, this is a UN mission but Ireland is partaking in the international community response to the shooting of innocent people on a daily basis in Mali.  Peacekeeping is a core element of Ireland's foreign policy, derived from our commitment with the UN member states to building and strengthening global peace and protecting human rights and the rule of law.</p><p>That is exactly what members of the ARW are doing with MINUSMA in Mali.  MINUSMA is the United Nations' response and provides support for the Malian Government in reasserting its authority in northern Mali.  As I stated, MINUSMA was established in 2013 and has made a real difference on the ground in Mali.  I had the opportunity earlier this year to sit down with the force commander to discuss the mission and Ireland's participation in it.</p></speech>

There was a coup in the country.  It is a high risk mission which has involved over 200 fatalities to date.  As it is considered to be one of the United Nations' most dangerous missions, we need to talk about it in the House.  Large-scale deployments such as this, with a full combat role, should not be allowed to become the norm.  It is a form of conflict management by the United Nations.  We should be leading the opposition to it, rather than supporting it.  I also have concerns about the intelligence roles played by the troops.  Intelligence is gathered with others, but we have no control over how it is used.  Again, this might have negative consequences.  </p>  <p>  As a malaria zone, the mission in Mali poses a significant risk to Irish troops.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether soldiers serving there are taking Lariam?  I do not need to remind him about the motion passed by the D&aacute;il on the issue.  Are our troops in Mali taking Lariam?</p></speech>

In the past six decades Ireland has participated in Chapter VI and Chapter VII missions and played a vital role in promoting peace, stability and the protection of civilians.  I have confidence in every member of the ARW who has deployed to Mali.  I have seen them in action and met them individually.  I know their capabilities.

The Defence Forces built infrastructure programme is compiled on a priority needs basis by my Department in conjunction with the military authorities.  This year some &euro;28 million was allocated towards the maintenance and development of new building projects for the Defence Forces.  This represents an increase of over &euro;10 million compared to the figure allocated in 2018.  I can confirm for the Deputy that it is intended that the budget allocation will be matched in the coming years to ensure the level of building activity will be in line with Defence Forces requirements.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on defence has identified the need to develop a rolling five-year capital plan to provide for future Defence Forces built infrastructure requirements, taking account of the capability priority needs of the Defence Forces.  The plan is expected to be finalised shortly.  The list of works identified as part of the project will be prioritised for delivery based on military needs and updated annually to form the basis for the selection of capital projects under the programme into the future. </p>  <p>  I will set out some of the key ongoing projects under way in improving Defence Forces accommodation and living standards across military installations.  The refurbishment of the apprentice hostel accommodation block at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel is well advanced.  It will provide classrooms, an auditorium, recreational facilities and improved living accommodation for 75 personnel.  The project will be completed shortly at a cost of &euro;3 million.  The refurbishment of the dining hall in Custume Barracks in Athlone started in 2018.  The scope of the works includes the refurbishment and upgrade of the existing dining hall and cook house.  The upgrade and refurbishment of the building currently in place will provide a modern dining facility and ensure the long-term viability of the complex at the barracks.  The works will be completed by year end at a cost of &euro;3.6 million.  The upgrading and refurbishment of Plunkett Block 7 at the Curragh Camp, Defence Forces Training Centre involve the refurbishment of the existing accommodation for 58 personnel to modern standards.  The works will commence shortly.  Upgrading and refurbishment of the existing accommodation for 80 personnel in blocks 1 and 2 in Cathal Brugha Barracks will also commence before year end.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the increased level of building construction will continue in 2020 and onwards.  Next year I expect construction to commence of new gymnasia in Kilkenny and Limerick at a cost in the region of &euro;5 million.  I should also mention two significant projects that have recently been approved to proceed.  The refurbishment and upgrading of the accommodation block at the naval base at Haulbowline will deliver additional living capacity on top of the existing provision of 210 beds spaces provided at the naval base.  It is intended that work will commence on block 8 on site in 2020.  Another project involves the upgrade of the former USAC complex in Galway.  This building has been designed to accommodate 120 persons living in single rooms.  The rooms are fitted out to a basic standard and ablution facilities are provided communally.  The building is nearly 50 years old and does not meet current standards with respect to building construction methodology, fire prevention measures and energy efficiency.  While both projects are at an early stage of design development, it is expected that construction works will commence in late 2020.</p>  <p>  Taken together, the projects which are all being prioritised represent a combined value of &euro;30 million in planned capital investment.  This level of investment illustrates the importance I attach to ensuring the quality of the Defence Forces built infrastructure meets the expectations of serving personnel.</p></speech>

I welcome the investment in Defence Forces accommodation, particularly the upgrade and refurbishment of Plunkett Block 7 at the Curragh, Defence Forces Training Centre which is in my constituency of Kildare South.  It is an ageing military camp that was originally developed by the British.  The need for investment in a large-scale development is significant.  There is also a need for redevelopment and ongoing maintenance to ensure members will not be expected to work in substandard accommodation at any stage.  It is critical that the level of investment referred to by the Minister of State be maintained and increased in the future.  Other areas at which I would like the Minister of State to look include investment at the Curragh but not from his budget.  The Department of Education and Skills holds the key.  The Minister for Education and Skills outlined the potential to redevelop the post-primary school at the Curragh.  I want the site to be located at the Curragh because it is the right place for it to be located.  It is a great school with a fantastic community spirit.  I have written to the Minister of State about a site that would be suitable for it.  I ask him to encourage his officials in the Department of Defence to deal directly with officials in the Department of Education and Skills to tease out the potential concerns of military management and the potential for synergies.  There is a great opportunity in that regard.  This is a key investment of over &euro;10 million that would provide a significant boost at the Curragh.</p></speech>

Slowly but surely, we are refurbishing some of the older blocks and building some new ones.</p><p>The Deputy has mentioned a new school to me on several occasions and led a delegation to my Department some time ago seeking a site.  While that can be considered, serious consideration must be given to the military and its needs in the Curragh Camp, the property that is available and the views of the Department of Defence.  I am willing to assist the Deputy and his community in accommodating a new school but we have to take account of the concerns and considerations of the military and the Department of Defence and their plans for the future of the Curragh site. </p></speech>

The fact that they are being left there because of the accommodation difficulties is truly shocking.  I visited Newbridge with my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin, and Ms Sara Walsh of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces organisation.  The previous Deputy mentioned the shocking conditions in the Curragh Camp.  When one speaks to PDFORRA and the families affected, one hears of more announcements but a lack of delivery where accommodation difficulties are concerned.  We have seen pictures released on social media showing the really poor conditions in which people must live.  One of the triggers causing people to leave referenced in the Public Service Pay Commission's report is that the threshold of accommodation, certainty and security is not what it was many decades ago.  We need more than just announcements of capital investment.  We need to hear a plan of delivery that will address the accommodation difficulties and the important education issues for the families of those affected.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke specifically about the Curragh Camp.  Over the period from 2016 to 2018, some &euro;17 million was spent on various capital projects and the ongoing maintenance of buildings and facilities at the Defence Forces training centre.  Most notably, this included the refurbishment of blocks B and D in Pearse Barracks, as well as the provision of newly constructed ammunition storage facilities.  As Deputy Heydon will agree, there was a huge lack of investment in the Curragh Camp for many years.  Even though there was an absolutely buoyant economy when Deputy Jack Chambers' party was in government, significant investment was not made in the Curragh Camp.  We are now paying for that.  Between 2016 and 2018, some &euro;17 million has been invested there.</p>  <p>  I note the upgrade to blocks 8 and 9 at the Haulbowline facilities and the construction of a new block in Collins Barracks, which is costing &euro;4.3 million.  As I stated in my original reply, approval to commence a design solution for the new accommodation blocks at Haulbowline is at an advanced stage.</p></speech>

In regard to the post-primary school for the Curragh area, I absolutely accept it must work for the Defence Forces and senior management.  I have spoken to the Curragh Camp's general officer commanding about it.  I believe both can work in harmony.  Another key project that would see huge investment and development at the Curragh is the peace and leadership institute referred to in the White Paper.  It is a key development.  It would highlight and develop all the Defence Forces' key capabilities concerning peacekeeping around the world.  It could be a key centre and bring a huge benefit to the Curragh community, the greater Newbridge community and Kildare because of the activity and visitors it would bring to the area.  This is a key investment in the Curragh area with which we need to proceed.</p>  <p>  I have consistently been in contact with the Minister of State in regard to the Curragh Plains.  We need to get his officials together with those of Kildare County Council.  This has dragged on for too long.  I have written to the Minister of State on this previously.  I ask that he and I arrange a meeting together to examine how we can advance those plans.  Kildare County Council is very open to a partnership approach.  We need to see this happen. </p></speech>

However the cost of rent has risen considerably, as the Minister of State is aware.  Moreover, PDFORRA has said it is sceptical of the Minister of State's announcement.  People would like to see a timeline of construction and delivery to accompany the Minister of State's announcements of new accommodation proposals.  Similarly with the Curragh Camp, we hear a lot about the overall capital sums which the Minister of State and the Department are setting out to spend.  Where is the delivery around education and the broader accommodation remit?  We still do not know exactly what the Minister of State is planning and what he is going to do to address the Victorian conditions there.  When is the delivery planned?  Every few months the Minister seems to announce the same plans over and over, without any follow-through.  We cannot see our Defence Forces personnel left in these Victorian conditions, which act as a trigger in causing personnel to leave year after year.  We need to know when the construction projects the Minister of State has listed will be completed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400025#X00600"><p>I am not really interested in announcements.  I want to get to work on the ground.  That is why between 2016 and 2018, &euro;17 million has been spent on various projects within the Defence Forces training college in the Curragh.  Regarding the Naval Service accommodation, I note that approval to commence design solutions for the refurbishment and upgrade of the accommodation block and the naval base at Haulbowline was issued on 10 July 2019.  The procurement process for the appointment of a design team to develop this project is ongoing.  This project will deliver additional living capacity, on top of the 210 bed spaces already provided at the naval base.  It is intended that works on-site at block 8 will be commenced in 2020.  However, as this is a listed building, planning consent is likely to have a significant impact on costs and delivery.  There is no doubt that renovating old Victorian buildings costs twice as much money.  Is it value for money?  I often ask that question myself.  Renovating a very old building does not provide the same quality as a new build.</p>  <p>  I have penned a tentative date for a meeting between myself, Deputy Heydon and Kildare County Council into my diary.  I acknowledge this is of huge concern to the Deputy, who has raised it with me on numerous occasions.  The Department of Defence has responded to a lot of the Deputy's requests.  We have dedicated people working on the Curragh Plains.  This is a great amenity for the people of Newbridge and the greater Kildare area.  I will come back to the Deputy with a specific date for that meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400025#X01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.</p>  <p>  Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising national finances during the financial crisis, as Deputy Aylward will be very much aware.  Improvements in the economy have provided an opportunity for the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, which imposed pay cuts across the public service during the financial crisis.  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The increases due to date under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay scales of all public servants earning less than &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>Pay rates for newly qualified members of the Defence Forces are competitive compared to other areas in the public service and private sector.  For instance, a newly qualified three star private can expect to earn &euro;28,205 gross per annum.  A newly qualified school leaver-entry officer can expect to earn &euro;36,154 gross per annum, inclusive of the military service allowance.  After initial training, a graduate-entry officer can expect to earn &euro;41,193 gross per annum, inclusive of the military service allowance, after initial training.  These are just starting pay rates.  There are additional opportunities to increase pay through annual increments and promotional opportunities.  Basic pay and the military service allowance are just elements of the overall remuneration package available for members of the PDF.  A range of duties attract additional allowances while certain positions in the Defence Forces also attract technical pay.  The overseas peace support allowance is paid tax free to members of the Permanent Defence Force participating in overseas military operations on the direction of the Government. <br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The Defence Forces are experiencing recruitment and retention difficulties particularly in some areas of specialism.  This is reflective of the economic growth experienced under the current Government and the associated buoyant labour market.  We are not unique in this regard.  It is being experienced internationally by armed forces.  At my direction, the Department of Defence brought the particular difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission.  Arising from the first report of the commission in 2017 and the subsequent public service stability agreement, the Government tasked the commission with undertaking a comprehensive examination and analysis of recruitment and retention in the Defence Force.  <br/><br/>There are regular meetings between the Taoiseach, and other Ministers and I have discussed a range of Defence matters with the Taoiseach and Government colleagues.  The report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces was accepted by Government on 4 July 2019.  The report contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the PDF, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in the military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of their acceptance by the PDF representative associations. <br/><br/>The Government has prepared a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the commission.  The measures are aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment, retention and conditions of service.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the PDF within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations and the completion of a review of technical pay arrangements, concerning grades 2 to 6.  The plan sets out timelines with the objectives to deliver on the commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  This work is, under my direction, being prioritised by civil and military management.</p></speech>

The reality, however, is different.  We all know there is a dearth of recruits; it is impossible to get them.  Ships are tied up, as has been stated.  The Minister of State well knows that what he has set out is spiel and untrue.  Since the recession, almost ten years ago, the Government has fallen behind in looking after the Defence Forces.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State are responsible.  It is time to wake up now and smell the reality.  The Government is hiding behind the pay commission report.  People in the Defence Forces are being left behind.  They have not got fair play and they do not have a union to represent them.</p>  <p>  I come from Kilkenny where there is a military barracks.  Some of the personnel there are receiving the family income supplement, FIS.  Why is that the case if the two minutes of rhetoric the Minster of State just read out is true?  I ask him to be honest and own up to what is happening.  The members of the Defence Forces are not being properly paid and new recruits are not being attracted.  Some 57% of members of the Permanent Defence Force have stated they will leave in the next two years.  For more than 80% of those personnel, pay is the primary consideration in reaching the decision to leave.</p></speech>

I will also repeat myself then.  The reality is that we have to ask why ships are tied up and not at sea.  Why are we not able to fulfil our obligations?  Why are we so far away from our target of 9,500 people in the Defence Forces?  The Minster of State spoke about what happened when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  He is falling back on that.  The turnover in Defence Forces staff at that time was 10%.  That is now up to 85%.  People have been interviewed and stated that they are going to leave within the next couple of years.  That is the reality and that is what he should be talking about, instead of giving us rhetoric about what happened back in 2008.  That is the continual refrain.</p>  <p>  It is his job to oversee the recruitment of people.  I asked him previously about the provision of accommodation.  There was always a tradition in towns with military barracks, such as Kilkenny, that people got housing.  Could that type of provision be considered again?  It might attract some recruits, especially those with families, into the Permanent Defence Force, given the housing crisis.  The Minster of State can give us all the rhetoric he wants and list all of the things he did.  The reality, however, comes back to the fact that there are ships tied up because of a lack of recruits to staff them.</p></speech>

Accommodation is one of the projects included.  We are, however, competing with a strong economy and an economy that recovered under the Fine Gael-led Government from 2011.  We now have almost full employment.  Unemployment stood at almost 15% when the Deputy's party was last in government.  We cannot compare like with like.  We are now competing against a strong jobs market.  There are great opportunities in the private sector for many people.  When I was appointed to this position in 2016, a three-star private was on &euro;21,000.  Under my leadership of the Department that private is now &euro;28,205, which is an increase of &euro;7,000.  There will also be further increases under the public service stability agreement.  The Deputy should take a careful look and consider the scale of those increases.</p></speech>

While the headline percentage price increase appears high, this translates into a modest increase in total expenditure on Lariam in 2018 of &euro;1,399 over the 2017 figure.  Prior to 2017, Lariam was purchased by the Defence Forces under a four-year framework agreement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the HSE.  As the product is no longer covered by the terms of the IPHA-HSE framework agreement, however, there has been a resulting knock-on effect on cost.  This accounts for the increased spend on Lariam in 2018 and to date in 2019. </p><p>As I have outlined to the House on many occasions, the use of anti-malarial drugs is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals.  In the Defence Forces, these are matters for highly qualified medical officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the organisation.  The Deputy will be aware that ongoing litigation regarding this matter is being handled by the State Claims Agency, SCA.  It has advised that it has received 225 claims alleging personal injury as a result of the consumption of Lariam by current and former members of the Defence Forces.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>He will appreciate, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  I assure the House that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me, my Department and the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

I am concerned, however, that the Defence Forces still use Lariam.  That is what baffles me.  Other countries have stopped prescribing this drug and have apologised to the members of their respective defence forces for prescribing it to them in the first place.  Why is Ireland not following suit?  There are concerns regarding Lariam.  I have spoken to personnel who have taken the drug.  I have also spoken to people who have taken the drug and experienced no side effects, but that is no reason its use should fail to be stopped.  My concern is that clear evidence is building up that this drug has caused problems for some personnel.  Lariam should not be used if there is any possibility that it is going to have the adverse effects that it has had on many members of the Defence Forces.  Those have included suicidal tendencies and breakdowns.</p><p>The Minister of State says he is acting on the 2013 recommendation of the working group on the issue but I have never seen those reports so I cannot make a call on them.  Will the Minister of State agree to release those reports at some stage so we can understand why he is adopting the position he is?</p></speech>

The Defence Forces continue to use three antimalarial drugs.  These are Lariam, Malarone and Doxycycline.  The selection by a medical officer of the most appropriate drug for use is complex and dependent on a number of factors.  All of these antimalarial drugs have contraindications and side-effects.  Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces' medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the antimalarial medication.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces to screen personnel individually for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.  Fundamentally, the choice of malarial chemoprophylaxis for use in the Defence Forces is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals.  In the Defence Forces these are decisions for highly qualified medical officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00400"><p>I want to raise again the issue of access to primary school places in Rathcoole, County Dublin.  This is an issue Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin and I raised in the House prior to the summer recess.  Unfortunately, our concerns have come to pass, in that children in Rathcoole have been unable to secure primary school places there.  To put things into context, in February last year the principal of one of the local primary schools wrote to the Department.  He stated:</p><blockquote>Our school is the only English medium school in the village.  There is also a Gaelscoil situated here.  The Department of Education has signalled that there will be a school open in the Rathcoole/Newcastle/Saggart area in 2020.  However, this seems highly unlikely to occur in such a short time-frame.<br /><br />Most of our classes are full at 31 pupils per class.  We have waiting lists for most streams.  There is an increasing number of housing developments under construction and planned for construction.  This will bring much increased demand for places.<br /><br />Families have moved into houses in our village only to discover that our school cannot accommodate them.  Some families are travelling significant distances to other schools as a result.  We also have a situation whereby some families have one or more child enrolled with us and another child enrolled elsewhere, as there is no space available for the other child.<br /><br />Our Board of Management has had to engage with the Section 29 process of the Education Act on many occasions, where an appeal was taken by families as a result of our refusal to enrol.  At a recent Section 29 Hearing in the Department of Education, Marlborough St., the chairperson of the Section 29 Hearing Committee requested that we inform you of the existing pressure and further expected pressure for school places in Rathcoole.<br /><br />We are currently processing next year's Junior Infant classes.  [That was for September of this year.]  There have been 117 applications from the local community alone this year: 93 places will be offered.</blockquote><p>We highlighted all of this earlier in the year.  When places were offered, a number of parents were on a waiting list and they came to us.  We brought it to the floor of the D&aacute;il and debated it.  The summer has come and gone and children have gone back to school.  A significant number of them have been unable to gain access to one of the two local schools in Rathcoole, namely, the Gaelscoil and the national school.  Some of those children have gone elsewhere but some of them have gone back to preschool.  It is not in their best interests from a developmental point of view that they are not going to primary school when they are of an appropriate age to do so.  It is not happening.</p><p>The Minister has previously issued a reply stating that in 2020 there will be a new school.  I have said it before, and I want to emphasise it now, that the new school proposed is not in Rathcoole.  It is in Fortunestown.  The Minister identified it in a previous reply.  It will not address the need that exists today.  Little has happened from the Department's point of view to reassess the demand for primary school places in Rathcoole, where new houses are being built and planned and there is a shortage of places today.  The children of today, and not the future, have failed to access one of their own local primary schools.  I appeal to the Minister to reassess the school capacity issue in the Rathcoole area for this year and next year and in the longer term as the housing development continues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the Department's position on primary school places in the Rathcoole area.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, providing a new school or schools, or a combination of these.</p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018, is important legislation that will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, including a new eight-classroom school to be established in September 2020 to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area.  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  I recently announced that five of the new primary schools being established between 2020 and 2022 are being designated for Irish-medium education, including the new eight-classroom primary school to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area.  The new school will be located in the Saggart and Citywest area.  It is adjacent to the Tallaght school planning area in which there is no Gaelscoil.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious that Rathcoole is an area of growing demographic demand and additional residential development, and the Department is actively reviewing the potential need to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole.</p>  <p>  In respect of meeting current demand for primary school places, the Department approved additional temporary accommodation for Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in primary school in 2018 and 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00600"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  This is not sarcastic but I had received most of the reply previously and I was aware of it.  To take the final paragraph first, the Minister said that in respect of meeting current demand for primary school places, the Department approved additional temporary accommodation.  I acknowledge this.  I am saying that despite this a significant number of people are failing to get a school place in Rathcoole.  I acknowledge the steps taken by the Minister but having taken those steps children in Rathcoole are failing to get a school place.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said what he said previously, that there would be a new school in the Saggart and Citywest area, which will be in Fortunestown.  I acknowledge this but it will be of little benefit to people living in Rathcoole.  By the time it is built housing developments in the Citywest area will, by and large, fill it.  These are not solutions.</p><p>This is a problem not of the future but of today.  Children and parents in Rathcoole are not accessing them.  If families living in Rathcoole want to have their children educated in Rathcoole, they should not have to bring them to adjacent towns or villages; there should be a place for them.  It is not just from the point of view of the parents, but the friends those children will make and go through life with and the various sporting bodies they will join.  It is part of their community.  They should be able to access a place in their own community.</p> <p> The Minister gave a bit of hope when he said, "My Department is conscious that Rathcoole is an area of growing demographic demand and additional residential development and my Department is actively reviewing the potential need to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole."  He has missed the boat; it is already needed.  It is not for the future that it is needed.  The Minister listened when I read the letter from the principal into the record.  When families move into the Rathcoole area, they are not just trying to access junior infants classes; they are coming with children of different ages.  It is virtually impossible to get a child of any age into the school.  I urge the Minister and his officials to review the capacity in Rathcoole and not to come back and say the Fortunestown school in the Saggart and City West area is the solution because it is not.  There is a deficit today and the Minister's plan for the future does not address the deficit it needs to address. </p></speech>

I also appreciate the intensity of development in different parts of the country and obviously in the Newcastle, Saggart and Rathcoole area.  That is a school planning area.  I deliberately separated out Rathcoole in my second last paragraph.</p></speech>

We are reviewing the potential to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole.  That means collecting as much data as possible from planning permissions for future developments as well as for ongoing developments.  I know he is not talking about the future but about the here and now.  He is saying there is a need today with children travelling to different places.  The data from the principals of the two existing schools on the parents who tried unsuccessfully to get children into school in September will be very helpful.  Those data will be collated.  We will look at planning permissions.  We will look at existing demographics.  It is a very young population, as the Deputy outlined previously.  When I said we are reviewing it, I do not mean we are looking at it as a way of letting him that things will be grand and we will get on with what is in place.  We are serious about areas like this.  If there is demand in a particular area, we will give it serious consideration.</p>  <p>  This is the second time I have discussed this issue in the House.  I know I may have put on the record information I have given previously.  It is important to disseminate that information publicly.  A unit in the Department proactively examines future population projection and we will give it serious consideration.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for his attendance to discuss the delay in delivering the Holy Family national school in Mullingar.  This is the third time I have raised this issue in the House.  I have tabled dozens of parliamentary questions and attended numerous meetings going as far back as 2008.  This week we were given a revised completion date for the ninth time.  That school remains 82% complete on a site that is under-resourced.  Subcontractors are walking off the site and windows are being removed.  We have all this uncertainty and we are no further along.  It is infuriating for staff, parents and everyone involved in the school.</p>  <p>  There are 30 staff and 332 pupils from 276 families in a building constructed as a two-teacher school in 1942 with no ancillary services.  That is what we are presiding over now in the 21st century.  The staff are operating over three campuses: St. Loman's; the 1942 school; and St. Etchen's in Kinnegad.  The 42 children just enrolled are spread over those three sites.  Some of the most vulnerable children need early intervention and need a social setting that is secure and certain.  We need clarity and certainty as to when the school can be delivered and whether the current contractor has the capacity to deliver the school.  This cannot continue any longer.</p>  <p>  We have had nine completion dates.  The parish will carry out its 2020 enrolment for new students in January.  The principal and staff will be asked to take on more students despite the situation that currently pertains.</p>  <p>  There is one common denominator.  I have seen replies to parliamentary questions about schools elsewhere in the country involving this contractor.  There are persistent issues and he is consistently late.  Many people have criticised the local authority.  The local authority is not involved in the service delivery or project management of those other sites.  There is a common denominator here.</p>  <p>  The Minister needs to do everything he can.  I acknowledge he has been exceptionally helpful.  He visited the site and is trying to do everything in his power.  We need to get a certain date that will be adhered to.  If capacity is not there or for some other reason that date cannot be met, action needs to be taken.  I know there is criticism in the community that this action should have been taken given that we have received nine different completion dates.  The staff and principal in the school are unsung heroes and deserve a medal.  The parents are experiencing manifest frustration.  They have no certainty over the completion date, just a site that is 82% complete.</p></speech>

The House will recall that there have been significant delays in the delivery of this project.  These delays arose initially because of unforeseen ground conditions and other similar issues that can arise on any building project.  However, in recent months, I have been disappointed that progress on site has been extremely slow and we are still not entirely clear as to why this has been the case.  The most recent programme provided by the contractor for this project indicated a completion date of late October.  There was an initial acceleration of activity on site at the time this programme was provided.  However, I regret having to report to the House that neither the Department nor Westmeath County Council, to which the project has been devolved for delivery, is satisfied with how these works have progressed in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The House will be aware that a number of matters have been raised through the dispute resolution mechanisms of the public works contract in respect of this project, as would normally happen in major building projects.  The resolution of these issues is now at a critical juncture.  A meeting will take place later this week in that respect.  This meeting will be attended by officials from Westmeath County Council, supported by its design team.  Officials from my Department will also be in attendance.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the proactivity of Westmeath County Council and the design team in trying to move this forward.</p>  <p>  Given this, I cannot get into detail on the matters that are the subject of this conciliation process except to say, in broad terms, that they are technical issues and the issue of delays.  A revised programme is also being sought in that context and we also expect to get greater clarity on why the project has been so significantly delayed.  I hope that these and all outstanding matters can be addressed through this process.  I also hope that it will provide an outcome that we can be satisfied with.  Such an outcome will be confidential.  However, I hope that in finding a resolution to all these matters, there can then be no reason for the project not to move forward at pace.</p><p>It is of the greatest concern to me that the pupils, staff and school community of Holy Family national school are not yet <i>in situ</i>in a school which was initially scheduled for completion in September 2018.  However, I am thankful to the patron and school management of both Holy Family national school and St. Etchen's in Kinnegad who have gone out of their way to arrange for the provision of temporary school accommodation for the special needs pupils impacted on by the delays.  We are also thankful to St. Loman's GAA Club for its assistance in providing extra classroom space for the pupils of Holy Family national school.  It is hugely disappointing that it has been necessary to activate these contingency arrangements, but we remain hopeful they will only be needed for a short while.<br/><br/>Until then Westmeath County Council will continue to keep the school authority and patron body fully informed of progress on site.  At the same time, officials from my Department will continue to liaise with the patron of Holy Family national school on contingency arrangements should the project be delayed further.  I sincerely hope we will be in a position in the coming days to provide the Holy Family school authority with some further clarification on progress on site.  More particularly, we hope progress from now on will be to everyone's satisfaction.  I do enter a caveat because I have already stood in front of the Deputy when he raised this issue and outlined a timeframe.  I understand the intensity of feeling in his community is palpable and has moved beyond frustration.  I appeal to the contractor to meet the challenge head on.  There are contractual obligations that I am not going to get into.  I appeal at a human level to the people delivering the project to for one second feel the frustration and anger felt at so many false dawns in its delivery.  <br/><br/>I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  Not a week goes without him being on to me about it.</p></speech>

I note that a meeting is due to take place on Friday.  We need absolute clarity at that meeting.  This project cannot endure a further revised programme of works that the contractor will be unable to meet.  Perhaps a hard decision has to be taken, but it has to be taken on Friday if we do not have certainty.  I have read the long list of dates by which the school was to have been completed.  They include September 2015, 2016 and 2018, October 2018, December 2018, and April, June and July 2019.  This week we were told it would be signed off on in October and that in November students would move in.  It is galling to drive by the site in the 21st century and see it being under-resourced.  I drive by it every day and know that since the contractor signed the contract that it has been under-resourced.  Even when blocks were being laid, there were not enough people available.  There would not have been enough to build a 2,000 ft2 building on the site.  That is why we are more than two and half years down the road since the contractor moved onto the site.  It was to be a one-year, template-build model.  My top political priority is to have the school delivered.  I appeal to the Minister and his office to use every power available to them.  Perhaps there is a global issue with procurement law that we need to consider.  If a contractor is consistently behind and not meeting specified targets in the contract, he or she should not in any way be allowed to apply for other public contracts.  We saw this happen recently when the HSE hired a contractor who had run into difficulties in delivering other contracts.  We need a traffic light system ingrained in procurement law such that contractors can be excluded based on past performance and that if a procurement team excludes them, it will not lead to a court case.</p></speech>

There should be a degree of honesty and cards put on the table because the community deserves nothing less than to find out whether it is happening.  I will not say anything more about what may happen after the meeting.  So many good groups and people are working on the project.  I met them on site when the Deputy invited me to visit it.  They all want the project to happen, but we live in the real world too and perhaps there are reasons it is not happening.  However, honesty is required.  I am making a personal appeal to the contractor to meet the community head-on for the first time and be as honest as possible.  There have been too many false dawns and expectations have been heightened.  It is an issue for the entire constituency and other Deputies have raised the issue here.  I thank Deputy Peter Burke for keeping it alive.  Let us see what happens on Friday and I hope that, with a degree of honesty, we will make progress.</p></speech>

They concern Cobh Community Hospital and Castlemartyr Health Centre.  On 27 August members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, contacted me to inform me that the hospital was in dire need of additional funding and that its budget would run out in five weeks.  That was six weeks ago today.  I have been in contact with the office of the Minister for Health, but the only update I have received since is that the hospital is financially viable.  However, there are no guarantees about this.  The INMO has contacted me again because it is very worried.  We have spoken here many times about primary care services and investing in local services.  We are talking about a 44-bed residential unit.  If it were to close, it would be devastating for service users, their families and everyone else, including the staff.  There are an additional 15 staff employed.</p>  <p>  The hospital is community owned by a trust.  I have been told that the HSE has been chipping away at it and reducing funding year in, year out and that it is starting to struggle.  Only a few weeks ago Liverpool Football Club and Cobh Ramblers played a game in Cobh.  All of the moneys raised went to the community hospital.  We have often said investing in the community and taking ownership is the best model of care.  What is the position at Cobh Community Hospital?  If it does close, where will all of the residents go?  </p>  <p>  We were told some weeks ago that Castlemartyr Health Centre would also close.  Youghal is on the edge of the Cork East constituency.  The centre covers Youghal, Killeagh, Castlemartyr, Midleton and Carrigtwohill.  I was told two weeks ago that it would be relocated to Midleton, which is six miles away.  I have now been informed that it will be relocated to Carrigtwohill.  A centre that is working well will be closed and everything moved.  It will involve a 30 km round trip.  Most of the people affected are elderly and disabled and do not drive.  I have tabled several parliamentary questions to a number of Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because there is also a problem with public transport services on the Waterford-Cork route.  A person would be very lucky to get on the service in Killeagh.  Patients who need to attend the health centre in Castlemartyr may not get on the bus in Youghal.</p>  <p>  There was a &euro;300,000 fund and planning permission was granted for an extension to the centre and other associated works such as the provision of wheelchair ramps.</p><p>Now we have learned that somebody within the HSE has made the decision not to do it.  I also asked whether more public health nurses will be assigned to cover the area, which is a large one.  In Youghal, one cannot reach a doctor after 6 p.m.  If one needs<b></b>to access SouthDoc, one needs to travel to Fermoy or Midleton, and the primary care centres will soon be closed.  All of east Cork, from Youghal to Castlemartyr, will be left with nothing.  Why does the HSE not invest in primary care and care for those who need it most?</p></speech>

There are patients in genuine need of residential care, whether on a long-stay or short-stay basis, and their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  </p>  <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, provides financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants in the scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  The budget for the NHSS in 2019 is &euro;985 million and more than 23,000 clients on average at any one time will access long-term residential care through the scheme. </p>  <p>  Cobh Community Hospital is an independent facility providing residential care services for older people in Cobh and the surrounding area.  The majority of the funding for Cobh Community Hospital comes under the NHSS for long-term residential care.  The hospital also provides other services to older people in Cobh and the surrounding communities, including short-stay and respite care.  Some 44 beds in Cobh Community Hospital provide long-term residential care for up to 41 people and short-stay respite care to a further three people.  The HSE, through Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, provides funding for the short-stay beds, as well as funding for some of the long-term residential care beds.  </p>  <p>  The voluntary and not-for-profit sector has a long tradition of providing care to older people in Ireland through nursing homes such as Cobh Community Hospital.  This provision of care complements that delivered directly by the HSE and ensures that older people in our communities have a greater choice of long-term residential care, allowing them to stay closer to their communities, should they so choose.  The HSE has engaged with the hospital board in respect of funding and the future provision of care in the hospital, and is continuing to provide support to the board on the issue.  Based on its engagement with the Cobh Community Hospital board, the HSE is confident the facility is financially viable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has engaged with the senior management of the HSE on the matter and is confident a resolution can be found.  He acknowledges the significant role of private and voluntary providers in residential care provision and hopes the engagement between the HSE and the Cobh Community Hospital board will ensure the continued financial viability of the hospital. </p>  <p>  I do not have a response to the question on the Castlemartyr community health centre but I will follow up on the matter.  I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and revert to the Deputy with details.</p></speech>

If he was to cut the sentence that followed and insert his own, he might say: "There is a possibility we will close a 44-bed unit in Cobh and remove a community care service from the community in Castlemartyr that services Ballycotton, Cloyne, Castlemartyr, Ladysbridge, Garryvoe, Killeagh, Inch and Youghal."  One could go on and on because it is a large demographic area.  The response was a pure contradiction.  I do not mean that as an attack on the Minister of State but rather wish to put it on the record.  If the decision is supposed to promote "confidence, security and dignity" in communities, it is a farce.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the NHSS and stated: "Participants in the scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost."  It is great that the State pays the balance of the cost but it is not State money; it is taxpayers' money.  The Minister of State described it as Government funding but it is taxpayers' money.  The people pay for their own care.  Let us try to keep the discussion clean and factual.</p>  <p>  I welcome the engagement with the HSE and the hospital board, and I hope it grows.  I heard that the hospital was financially viable but my worry is that is like saying one can cash the thanks inside in the bank; but what bank does one use to cash the thanks?  If there is not a good guarantee, there will be serious consequences.</p>  <p>  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on 12 September.  While I understand the position of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, I am disappointed with the HSE and whoever is responsible for having kept the matter quiet and closing the vital service in Castlemartyr, east County Cork.  It affects everybody all the way to Cobh.  We have spoken about primary care and community care but we should invest in a primary care centre in Youghal while keeping those in Castlemartyr, Midleton, Cobh and Carrigtwohill.</p></speech>

I accept they provide a range of services for older people in the community and the surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  I return to the core issue of the debate.  The Government's core stated objective is to promote care in the community in order that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their homes and communities for as long as possible, which is what older people and all Deputies want.  There are patients in genuine need of residential care, whether on a long-stay or short-stay basis, and their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  The HSE fully acknowledges, as do I, that the community hospital provides and will continue to provide important services to the people of Cobh and the surrounding communities.  Furthermore, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has engaged with the senior management of the HSE on the matter and is confident a resolution can be found.  I am optimistic about him doing so.</p>  <p>  I trust that the Deputy will agree we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided for residents in a safe and secure environment, while providing high quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.  I accept all the Deputy's concerns about Castlemartyr and will convey them to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.</p>  <p>  On a lighter note, I commend what the Deputy stated about Cobh Ramblers, an excellent club of which I am well aware, for its contribution to the hospital following a game.  On what was probably a sadder note for the Deputy, my local club, Shelbourne FC, recently signed two players from Cobh Ramblers and thanks to them, managed to win the first division league.</p></speech>

In general, much needed new homes are very welcome but, astonishingly, in this case 1,130 of the proposed apartments are intended to be build-to-rent.  In the housing area in question, up to 9,000 individuals and families are waiting for accommodation on Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council housing lists.  A remarkable feature of the application is that approximately one quarter of it has been sent to Dublin City Council, with the rest sent directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  The applications are the latest in a litany of such applications for the north-south fringe over the past 20 years.  It was more than 20 years ago that high density proposals for the north fringe were first mooted and a few days before Christmas of 1999, in true developer style, a plan for a massive development of the north fringe district was lodged with Dublin City Council. </p><p>Eventually, the Dublin City Council planning department managed to produce a north fringe framework development plan in 2000 for an initial major new urban district of up to 8,000 homes stretching across Belmayne and Clongriffin in Dublin city to the coast and the south Portmarnock district of Fingal.  Development of the region has been stop-start and highly erratic, with the failure of the two planning authorities, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, to work closely and developers like Gannon Homes, Stanley Holdings and Helsingor to deliver sustainably much-heralded infrastructure, including public transport, schools, health centres, childcare facilities, community and amenity spaces, shops and a Garda station.  It took nearly ten years to build and open Clongriffin DART station and even longer for the first two primary schools for the burgeoning population of the area.  Clongriffin town centre is still waiting for a supermarket and other much-needed commercial and professional services.  At the western end of the new main street of the district in 2006, Stanley Holdings pulled out of a section 183 agreement with Dublin City Council for the long-promised Belmayne and Clare Hall town centre.<br/><br/>As the Minister remembers, the north and south fringe was also bedevilled with problems of pyrite contamination and insulation difficulties and it took years for the successful remediation of affected structures to be effected down to 2015.  The taxpayer and Dublin City Council ended up bearing the &euro;40 million net cost of totally rebuilding Priory Hall, which straddles the central section of the main boulevard of the north fringe.  Since the crash, the north and south fringe has seen large tracts of derelict lands being hoarded by developers and constituents fear it could take another ten years to build out the region and provide the critical services we desperately need.<br/><br/>Given the above history, I would like the support of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to call on the planning regulator to carry out a review of all aspects of the planning of the north and south fringe and examine the history of this development and other urban regions in Ireland and exemplars abroad.  We have seen exemplars in countries like Sweden of similar size but built with all essential services each step of the way.  Unfortunately, that has not happened with the north and south fringe.  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, which passed through the House not too long ago, the new Office of the Planning Regulator can review the performance of the functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities such as Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  The regulator is also tasked by the same section in the Act to oversee the delivery of effective planning services to the public by planning authorities and to conduct research for the Minister.  The north and south fringe is a very striking example of why developer-led planning is really bad for our new urban districts.  As the distinguished journalist, Mr. Gene Kerrigan, of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>stated, it is why &quot;housing is too important to be left to developers.&quot;.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the final report of the Mahon tribunal recommended the establishment of an independent planning regulator and legislation for such a regulator was in train for a number of years.  The Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, was established in April 2019 under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  The OPR is responsible for the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly forward planning, including development plans, local area plans, regional spatial and economic strategies etc.  It will provide statutory observations during the drafting of statutory plans.  In cases where the OPR finds that a local authority's plans are ultimately not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, including the provisions of the national planning framework, the OPR will recommend the use of ministerial powers to bring plans back in line with statutory requirements and best practice.</p>  <p>  The OPR is also empowered to review the organisation, systems and procedures used by any planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of any of the planning functions under the planning Acts, including assessing risks of maladministration or corruption.  The OPR can initiate such reviews at its own behest, at the request of the Minister or on foot of complaints or submissions from members of the public.  In performing its functions, the OPR will take into account the objective of contributing to proper planning and sustainable development and the optimal function of planning under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has outlined, the north Dublin and south Fingal fringe straddles two local authorities, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly has adopted a regional spatial and economic strategy, which will be implemented by way of a review, or variation, by local authorities of all relevant development plans.  Given the timing of the county development plans in Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, I understand they are proposing to vary their development plans to take account of the regional strategy.  In this regard, they have up to 26 weeks from the date of adoption of the strategy to initiate such a variation, which is up to early January 2020.  Any variation of county development plans will be considered by the OPR in line with its functions under the planning Acts.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is the function of a planning authority to plan for its own administrative area in accordance with national planning policies and guidance.  In this regard, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council have adopted particular plans for this general location, and some were mentioned by the Deputy.  These plans were adopted by the elected members of the relevant local authorities in accordance with the requirements set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Moreover, development plans are statutorily reviewed every six years.  I cannot prejudge the contents of a future development plan but in view of the strategic nature of these lands to the orderly development of Dublin, I expect that the relevant development plans would consider the appropriate future development of this area.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, many times over the past two decades I asked successive Ministers responsible for environmental matters and taoisigh to make an order to declare the north and south fringe a strategic development zone to ensure some basic level of consultation with residents and citizens of Dublin Bay North.  I specifically remember doing so with a former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, and a former Minister, Mr. John Gormley.  On my own proposal as a Dublin city councillor in 2005, then city manager Mr. John Fitzgerald finally established the north fringe forum, which has generally met quarterly since.  It lacks the statutory powers of a strategic development zone to enforce stakeholder and developer engagement.  I believe that as part of his review of planning in the north and south fringe, the planning regulator should also examine why the north and south fringe never received strategic development zone status.  What was the reason for it?</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my earlier speech, homes are desperately needed in Dublin Bay North, where approximately 7,000 households are waiting to be rehoused on the Dublin City Council side and up to 2,000 are waiting across the DART line in the Howth and Malahide housing area of Fingal County Council.  In the Part V documents for the major plan that has now gone in, fewer than 200 apartments are to be allocated for social housing.  Astonishingly, no fewer than 678 units of 1,030 apartments in the strategic housing development section 1 are build-to-rent units, and 1,130 apartments in the whole development are build-to-rent units.  What is the plan in this regard?</p>  <p>  The Downey planning reports for Gannon Properties list 26 major planning applications and a remarkable 126 applications, mostly made from Gannon companies, for the Clongriffin district of the north fringe since the turn of the century.  Many of these applications were never followed through to construction, of course, and there is still extant planning permission for several areas of the current planning applications.  That is why even a decade ago I called on Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to establish a clear five-to-seven year planning and construction timetable so that the urgently required infrastructure could be built.  The blizzard of unbuilt projects with planning permission, the history of land hoarding and the failure to provide essential social and commercial services for a district that is expected to have an ultimate population of more than 50,000 should now be examined in what might be the first major and urgent review by the new planning regulator.</p></speech>

We are into new territory now as the Office of the Planning Regulator has just been established, having been spoken about for years.  One of the key points at the centre of its establishment was its independence from the Department and politics.  It is the result of the planning tribunal report.</p></speech>

I will speak to the Minister and, as the Deputy noted in his opening comments, there is a balance to be struck.  We want the office to be completely independent but it does allow for research.  I looked at a map of the area in question and it is large.  The Deputy has represented it for years and it has the potential to change utterly the landscape out there.  It could provide sustainable homes and communities for thousands of people.</p><p>I will discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I reiterate that it is open to individual local authorities, members of the public or community groups to request that the Office of the Planning Regulator carry out the work to which the Deputy refers.  The regulator was famously independent in his previous role in the Custom House.  I am sure that he and those working with him will ensure that legitimate issues raised by individuals or communities will be thoroughly examined without fear or favour.  We wish to ensure that the office is completely removed from the world of politics.  I will discuss the issue of research with the Minister.  I encourage the Deputy and the community representatives to apply directly to the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400032#EE00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Bill has three Parts, the first of which relates to the Short Title, commencement and definitions sections.  The second Part provides amendments to the legislation governing the Tax Appeals Commission, primarily to implement recommendations of an independent review carried out in 2018.  The third Part relates to the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations via an amendment to Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  On Part 2, I will provide Deputies with some background information on the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, and the independent review of 2018.  The commission was established on 21 March 2016 under the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 and took over from the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  It was established as an independent body having its own Vote and Accounting Officer with a view to providing increased transparency and an enhanced appeals mechanism for taxpayers.  Since its establishment, staffing at the commission has increased from two commissioners and four administrative staff to five commissioners and 22 administrative staff at various grades as of the end of September 2019.  However, a number of factors have contributed to the development of a backlog of appeals, including the facts that the commission inherited a substantial number of legacy appeals and that the process for appeals changed on the establishment of the commission, resulting in appeals now being notified to the commission in the first instance rather than to Revenue.</p>  <p>  On foot of the growing backlog and requests for significant additional resources, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the TAC in 2018.  The review, which examined the governance structures, workload and operations of the commission, was conducted by Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, a former Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The resulting report was published on budget day in October 2018.  The Minister has expressed his full support for the recommendations and work on implementation is ongoing within the Department and the commission.</p>  <p>  There has been a near doubling of the commission's budget to accommodate the recommended staff increases and improvements to computer systems and equipment.  Following a competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service, the Minister authorised the appointment of three additional temporary appeal commissioners, two of whom will take up their appointments this month.  The recommended additional administrative and technical posts were sanctioned and recruitment by the commission for these posts is nearing completion.  There is enhanced regular contact between the commission and the Department on governance matters and corporate supports.  An administrative working group meets regularly to address issues arising between the commissioners and Revenue in the administration of appeals.</p>  <p>  The Bill will enable the progression of another key recommendation of the review carried out by Ms O'Donoghue, namely, the appointment of a chairperson of the TAC.  Amendments to the legislation governing the commission are required to establish the role and responsibilities of the chairperson and thus allow for his or her recruitment.  Section 5 provides for the appointment of a chairperson and specifies his or her functions.  The Bill provides that the chairperson, who will also be an appeal commissioner, will be responsible for ensuring the efficient operation of the commission and accountable to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  It is envisaged that the establishment of a commission chairperson will strengthen the body's governance and accountability while bringing its structure in line with those of similar bodies.  This section also provides for the resignation or removal from office of the chairperson.</p>  <p>  Section 8 provides that a commissioner's term of appointment shall not exceed 14 years.</p>  <p>  Section 11 provides for the allocation of responsibility for the issuing of reports under section 21 of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 to the chairperson.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also clarify some aspects of the existing appeals legislation to facilitate the appeals process.  Section 12 amends provisions relating to appeals against determinations alleged to be erroneous on a point of law.  The amendment clarifies that a party dissatisfied with a determination must clearly state the respect in which the determination is alleged to be erroneous on a point of law, in addition to stating dissatisfaction with the determination.</p>  <p>  Section 13 provides for amendments to requirements in respect of the presentation of documents for inclusion in a case stated to the High Court.  This amendment clarifies the requirements for appellants and commissioners with regard to the case stated process under which an appellant may appeal a decision of the commission to the High Court.  It is anticipated that this amendment will increase case management efficiency.</p>  <p>  Section 4 will remove any ambiguity as to the ability of the commission to enter into contract, thereby guaranteeing its independence.</p>  <p>  The third Part of the legislation will amend Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014 as part of the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations directive.  Ireland's prospectus framework is implemented into domestic legislation through statutory instrument and Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.  The Bill provides for amendments to Part 23, which are necessary to complete the transposition into Irish law of EU Regulation No. 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market.  The regulation entered into force on 21 July 2019 and repealed the 2003 prospectus directive.  Although the majority of the regulation is directly effective, certain provisions had to be transposed into Irish law through the European Union (Prospectus) Regulations 2019, contained in Sl 380/2019, which were enacted on 19 July 2019.</p>  <p>  The EU regulation harmonises the requirements for the drawing up, approval and distribution of the prospectus that must be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market.  It aims to help companies, particularly small and medium enterprises, SMEs, access more diverse sources of finance by simplifying the rules applying to prospectus documents while maintaining appropriate investor protections.  The regulation aims to reduce the overall cost and administrative burden for companies that are required to issue a prospectus, while enabling investors to make informed investment decisions on the basis of the information provided being accurate, comprehensible, concise and easy to analyse.  It was originally intended that the required changes to Ireland's prospectus framework would be made through a consolidated secondary instrument.  However, on the basis of legal advice it was deemed necessary to make some amendments through primary legislation.</p></speech>
