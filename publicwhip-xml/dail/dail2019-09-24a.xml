In 1990, while Minister of State, Mary Harney introduced a ban on smoky coal use within the Dublin region.  This decision had a very radical and beneficial impact on public health and the environment.  It saved many lives and improved the quality of health in others, as well as the quality of our lived environment.  It was a decision and not an announcement; substance as opposed to spin; and a concrete action as opposed to a promise never delivered.  Thirty years later, it is incomprehensible that our past two Fine Gael-led Governments have failed to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal despite numerous promises from Ministers to do so.</p><p>Former Ministers, including Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Naughten, promised to bring forward such a ban, but no action or decision followed.</p> <p> A recent report on air quality published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, revealed the degree to which air pollution in towns not covered by the ban exceeded World Health Organization air quality guidelines.  For example, Enniscorthy continually has the highest observed concentrations of air pollutants of all monitoring stations in Ireland, with a 20% higher level of pollutants PM2.5 and PM10 than in Dublin or Cork.  Professor John Sodeau of UCC is particularly critical of the Government's inaction on this issue and raised concerns that the public health and climate change consequences for the areas not covered by the ban on smoky coal were very severe.  This air particulate pollution attacks every cell in the body and carries carcinogens, heavy metals and acids.  Up to 1,500 lives are lost annually as a result of diseases linked with it.  Based on promises made by the Government, some manufacturers invested millions in order to be in a position to produce smokeless coal, but they have been left high and dry.</p> <p> Yesterday the Taoiseach announced a welcome U-turn on his position on fossil fuel exploration, albeit we learned that licence applications would be accepted for the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea on an ongoing basis.  He had previously poured scorn on and refused to back legislation aimed at doing the same thing.  Given that we have never discovered oil, it was, perhaps, easier for him to make that announcement than to ban smoky coal as promised by three Ministers but never delivered on.  The real point is that action speaks louder than words.  Ireland is one of the worst performers in Europe in terms of air pollution and climate change.  The State will miss its 2020 EU targets by a staggering amount.  Why did three former Ministers promise to extend the smoky coal ban but then take no further action?  Was there lobbying by vested interests and, if so, by whom and when?  I ask the Minister to send the details to me if he does not have the information before him.  Does he accept that there is an apartheid approach to clean air in this country, with people living in 20% of it being condemned to breathing in carcinogens, heavy metals and acids?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400004#B00200"><p>I reject entirely the idea that the Government is looking to bring forward or overseeing any form of apartheid in having clean air.  I do so because I agree with the opening points made by the Deputy about the importance of clean air and its significant impact on public health.  I will raise with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, the issue of why commitments regarding a nationwide ban on smoky coal were not followed up.  He is well aware of the importance of clean air.  The climate action plan published by the Government includes many steps which outline how we are looking to make progress in areas that matter in terms of public health.  There are steps additional to those outlined by the Deputy which will help us to make progress in ensuring we will have cleaner air across the country.  I hope we will be able to make progress in that regard in the coming weeks and months.  I will revert to the Deputy at a later point, possibly during the course of this session, with an answer to his specific question as to why the commitments given have not been implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400004#B00300"><p>Obviously, the Minister has a lot on his plate and is probably not up to speed on the wider debate on this issue which I raised in the House in June.  It has also been raised by Deputy James Browne and others.  The reality is that there is apartheid in terms of air quality in this country because the smoky coal ban has not been extended nationwide, in spite of the promises of former Ministers, including Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Naughten.  The EPA's report indicates that there have been approximately 12 breaches of environmental safety limits since last Christmas and that asthma sufferers in Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey, for example, have been warned to stay indoors at these times.  There is apartheid.  In places where the ban is not in effect air quality is far poorer and it damages people's health.  The situation is not equal across the country in that regard.</p><p>However, the promises were made and announced, on foot of which some manufacturers invested in facilities and processes to produce smokeless coal.  They have been left high and dry as a result.  The Minister was warned that certain coal importers were threatening to take legal action.  I am surprised that he was not aware of it.  The smokeless fuel regulations were brought forward in Dublin city and county in 1990.  The figure is now up to 80%.  However, despite all of the promises in the past eight years, the ban has not been extended.  That cuts to the core point.  It is easy to announce and promise things, but it is something altogether different to deliver them on the ground and make them a reality.</p></speech>

It is something on which we must and will make progress.  I have since been informed that it is something the Minister, Deputy Bruton, wishes to make happen.  As the Deputy said, there is the possibility of legal action being taken.  I am that told the Minister is concluding work with the Attorney General on legislation and an approach that we believe will be robust in dealing with the matter.  I agree with the Deputy that clean air is something everyone on this island and in this country should be able to access.  However, as he points out, it is damaging to bring things forward that one cannot operate; therefore, the Minister is taking some time to conclude the work with the Attorney General.  I am sure he will conclude it soon and implement the legislation to ensure everybody will have access to clean air.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400005#C00300"><p>We were all deeply impacted on by the determination and passion of the thousands of young people who took to the streets of Ireland on Friday to demand action on climate change.  When it comes to the greatest threat facing our planet, young people are leading from the front.  Their message is very clear, easily understood and makes sense.  They are five words that will make a difference if listened to by those in power and the Government, namely, "system change, not climate change".  They have asked for action to bring the urgency and radical policies the climate crisis deserves.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has not heard them.  They did not ask the Government to tinker at the edges, for half measures or to pass the buck; however, that is precisely what Government's proposed increase in carbon tax is.  An increase in carbon tax passes the buck to hard pressed low and middle income families who are already fighting to make ends meet, while wealthy corporations are given a pass.  The increase will hit families who are paying the equivalent of a second mortgage in childcare fees, young workers whose incomes are soaked up by extortionate rents, those living in rural Ireland who must use their cars to get around and pensioners who struggle to meet the cost of heating their homes.  It is tinkering because we know from international evidence that carbon taxes do not work.  They do not reduce carbon emissions or change people's behaviour.  It is a half measure because the Government's proposals miss the crucial point.  It has done very little to enable people to transition to a low carbon lifestyle and offset the tax.  It has failed to invest properly to provide viable alternatives in the areas of transport, fuel and heating.  Everyone accepts that we must do more and that we must do better, but we must also agree that climate response policies must be just and fair and, more importantly, that they must work.  I call on the Government to consider a workable alternative, to fund climate action through progressive taxation and then invest in and deliver world-class public transport, to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and retrofitting housing stock.  These are the measure that should be undertaken.  The young people who protested last Friday want genuine investment in climate action.  A carbon tax increase will not deliver on that demand and it is unforgivable to pretend otherwise.  Will the Minster use the budget to map out a real climate action investment plan for which he will put up the cash and indicate that it will not include an increase in carbon tax?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00100"><p>The Deputy made reference to international evidence and the opinions and views of experts.  I will quote our expert in this area, namely, the chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council, Professor John FitzGerald.  He stated:</p><blockquote>A massive body of evidence from across the world shows that carbon taxes are essential.  There are very few carbon tax deniers in the economics community.  A recent statement by a large number of American economists, including 27 Nobel prize winners, identified carbon taxes as essential for the US and the world.</blockquote><p>I am well aware of the impact any change in carbon pricing can have on those who are vulnerable.  I am well aware of the impact it can have on those who are on low incomes and find themselves in a vulnerable position, but I am equally aware of the body of international evidence that states changes in the pricing of carbon are an invaluable way for economies to respond to the existential challenge of climate change.  Sinn F&eacute;in has form in that regard.  It is a party that supports the broadening of the tax base, but it is against the local property tax.  It is a party that supported investment in water infrastructure, but it is against water charges.  It is a party in which inconsistency and hypocrisy are embedded in how it handles policy issues.  What will it state to the young people who are out protesting?  What will it state to those children who left their schools last week, all of whom are looking for significant change?  All of the experts in this area advise that an element of that change needs to be how we can evolve the pricing of carbon in the future.  Let me re-emphasise what I said before and what the Taoiseach said in New York yesterday.  Any move in carbon pricing, if it is agreed to by the Government and supported by the D&aacute;il, is one that will ensure all the revenues will go back to helping those who are in need in the country owing to that change and towards helping the economy to invest in the kind of change that is essential to enable us to deal with climate change.  What will the Deputy say to all of the communities and people who are looking for progress and leadership?  Yet again, Sinn F&eacute;in pretends it can happen without any change or cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00200"><p>The Minister is correct to point out that Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently been against regressive forms of taxation that hit people on lower incomes.  As it happens, I have two climate strikers in my home.  I say to all of the strikers what I have said to them, namely, that tokenism will not cut it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400006#D00300"><p>It worked for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I say the same thing to the strikers that I have said to my own two climate strikers, namely, that we will not let the Government get away with it either.  We have had a carbon tax here for ten years and emissions have risen massively.  That is the fact of the matter.  Those who commend carbon tax do so only in the context of alternatives available to citizens to trigger the behavioural change needed.  The Minister knows this, but he is taking the lazy approach.  The easy and lazy thing to do is to have a go at Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody on the left who understands climate justice and a just transition have to be about more than passing the buck and punishing people who are poorer in society.  It has to be about systemic change, but it seems that the Minister does not have the belly for this.  I asked him to drop his hike in carbon tax in favour of investment in a real and radical plan that would make a difference and reduce emissions.  Is he prepared to do this in the budget?</p></speech>

We have a plan.  The climate action plan laid out by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Taoiseach lays out how in the years to come we will invest more in ensuring renewable energy will play a larger part in the economy, we will have more homes retrofitted across the country and that we will have the right transport and planning framework in place to allow the economy and citizens to make the changes needed.</p><p>We are considering the role the pricing of carbon may play in that regard.  Deputy McDonald is calling for additional investment and sustainable and structural change, but she does not have the honesty to explain how it can happen, or how we can pay for the additional investment needed.</p></speech>

The Deputy claims that behaviour has not changed, but she fails to acknowledge that the price of carbon has not changed either.  All we are considering is whether the pricing of carbon can play a role in the change people of all generations want to see happen.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to spell out clearly where it stands on the great pressing issue of climate change.</p></speech>

They have fought bitterly for everything they have, with little or no Government support.  I refer to the plastic factory in Skibbereen and the proposed harvesting of kelp in Bantry, which would have had a devastating effect on the environment and tourism in west Cork.  The Minister could have stepped in on the latter issue but instead stood idly by.  I was called an objector by a Minister for standing against these projects.  The Government's inaction forced the ordinary, honest people of west Cork to dig deep and take legal challenges, which they won and through which they were proved right by the courts of the land.  Following the last round of rural regeneration funding, 48 projects throughout County Cork, particularly those in west Cork, ended up with no funding and shovel-ready projects that could have created much needed employment in west Cork were scrapped.  Only two months ago, during Leader's Questions, I raised with the Taoiseach the proposal for a daily park and ride bus service from Clonakilty to Cork Airport and Cork train station.  It would have taken hundreds of vehicles off the roads weekly and eased pressures on families in west Cork.  While the Taoiseach seemed receptive to the proposal, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport squashed the idea without even researching it.  Seeing as it was Deputy Ross' Department - the man who destroyed rural Ireland - I knew that my proposals were doomed, as rural Ireland and west Cork are not on his satnav.  The Government has a legacy of neglect of west Cork which has stifled major employment opportunities on the three peninsulas, namely, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the Beara Peninsula extending to Bantry and Skibbereen.</p>  <p>  The biggest scandal of this and previous Governments for the people of County Cork is the lack of funding for roads.  In the past few years moneys have only been spent on fire-fighting projects, that is, projects to repair roads that have been destroyed by storms and floodwaters.  However, nothing has been spent on new bypasses or to pass bays since the opening of the Skibbereen bypass in 2003.  A Government must spend on projects in a constituency in order to achieve whatever vision it has, but years of non-investment in major projects and roads in west Cork has left us decades behind the rest of the country.  The Innishannon bypass was proposed almost 20 years ago and although many promises have been made, not one shovel has been turned.  The southern bypass in Bandon is half-finished.  Each year for as many years as I can remember Government politicians have been codding the electorate by announcing that funding will be found to finish the bypass.  Of course, as we are talking about west Cork, why would any Government find the funding to finish this much-needed project?  We are now hearing about a much needed northern relief road for Bandon which would bring cars from Billie's Drive-Thru on the Cork side of Bandon to the Dunmanway road.  We all thought it was a great project, but the people of west Cork should not get too carried away, as it has now emerged that the road will only go half way, as far as Kilbrogan Hill, ruining residential homes and businesses along the way and creating a massive bottleneck in west Cork.  It seems the only vision the Government has for Bandon is two unfinished bypasses.</p>  <p>  We need a vision for west Cork.  The fishing and farming industries are going through disastrous times, but in west Cork we face up to these challenges.  Will the Minister tell me what plans the Government has to invest in roads in west Cork?  I am referring to new major projects which would at least bring us up to speed with the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I am aware, as he is, of the challenges faced by our towns, villages and communities in making progress on issues that are important to them, be that the kind of progress we all want to make in regard to local roads, healthcare facilities or, for example, community employment schemes.  I am well aware of that.  I ask that the Deputy would anchor what he has just said in some acknowledgement of the progress that is being made.  I ask him to acknowledge that this year alone the funding we are putting into better infrastructure, better roads, better public transport, better schools, and better hospitals for our citizens is up by 24%.  This is more than &euro;7 billion extra in investment this year in projects that will make a difference to all our citizens, including the Deputy's constituents and the communities he has just outlined.  I am pleased to confirm to him that as part of the negotiations I currently have under way with many colleagues I am confident that we will continue to make progress.  While I acknowledge the areas in which we have to continue to make more progress, I return the point to the Deputy that amidst the litany of failure he has outlined would he not also acknowledge, as I saw at first hand when I visited his constituency earlier this summer, the progress that is being made on roads, schools and in investment that can make a difference to the towns and villages he has just outlined?</p></speech>

I would have taken him to see the roads that are in a scandalous condition and to see the lack of investment throughout west Cork that his Government has continuously overseen.  As Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe has had his hands on the purse strings.  While I respect that he cannot direct specific projects, he can be part of a Government that creates a change in mindset to create funding for major projects in west Cork.  We need moneys that were promised last year to be spent for the much needed repairs of the Ballydehob to Bantry section of the N71.  More than anything else, will the Government approve immediate funding to complete the Bandon southern relief road, the full northern relief road in Bandon, and the Innishannon bypass?  If it does, west Cork will start to catch up with other constituencies.  I ask the Minister to please direct his reply to that and not to everything else that I have not said.</p></speech>

I will give him a concrete example of this.  In 2017, the total investment coming from the then rural and community affairs part of Government was &euro;136 million.  The allocation in 2019 is &euro;291 million.

I am sure the Minister will agree that the best way to turn people against a tax is to mislead them in regard to how it is to be spent.  The reason for the resentment in regard to the local property tax is, I believe, people not knowing where their money is being spent.</p>  <p>  While the conversation surrounding LPT tends to revolve around raising or lowering of the tax by up to 15%, one of the real scandals lies in the detail of how the model underpinning the operation of the tax builds an inherent structural unfairness into the system.  The interdepartmental group report following the review of LPT stated that the work of the baseline review group was completed and that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was considering its findings.  That was last March.  The Government continues to sit on that report.</p>  <p>  We are now at a time when local authorities are considering their budgets for 2020 and making LPT decisions.  Owing to Government inaction, they continue to do so using a model that is grossly unfair.  We know there is an equalisation element to this and that there are 31 councils in the Republic.  Between 2015 and 2019, 21 of these councils received &euro;628 million from the equalisation fund.  The narrative is that the rich councils are transferring funding to the poorer councils but the great irony is that many of the so-called poorer councils have greater staff numbers, more funding and better services.  For example, Wicklow County Council has a baseline of &euro;8.5 million, a point below which it would not be permitted to fall, whereas Mayo, with 12,000 fewer people and a greater income from other sources, has a baseline of over &euro;17 million.  These are artificial baselines based on data from the late 1990s.  Population changes have no bearing in this area.  For example, Fingal County Council must provide for 100,000 additional people, with no recognition that they exist or provision for their needs.  To add to the problem, most of the so-called rich councils must use part of their so-called surplus to self-fund roads and housing from their local property tax.  This replaces Government grants to these councils.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;108 million spent in this way, &euro;86 million came from the four Dublin local authorities.  Counties such as Cork, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are growing areas and they are at the heart of this problem.  The entire system is unfair and the Government knows it.  When will it publish the report on the review of the baseline system, which it received in March last, and does it accept the recommendation of the 2015 Thornhill report that 100% of what is collected locally should be retained locally, if it is to be a local tax?  </p></speech>

What the Deputy has identified is the issue we have in regard to the local equalisation fund, into which receipts from local property tax flow and are then distributed to local authorities, which without those funds, would have a significant deficit in the funding for their local services.  I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy.  It is not a case of any work sitting on a shelf.  As I understand it, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is currently working on a response to the paper I issued in regard to local property tax reform.</p><p>This issue can only be considered in light of future changes we make relating to the structure and breadth of local property tax.  If we are looking to make progress on the operation of the equalisation fund, it needs to happen when change is being made with regard to the local property tax and at a point at which we look again at the valuation dates for that tax.  However, I do not underestimate the complexity and difficulty associated with that change.  This is why the Committee on Budget Oversight has been considering my report on this issue for the past number of months and is due to report back on it very soon and to give me its views on how this issue can be progressed.  </p></speech>

I understand it is complex and have been told there will be winners and losers.  There is a view that we will know who are the winners and losers after the general election.  The decisions being made by local authorities must be made in the context of next year's budget.  Delays in this regard mean that local authorities with rapidly growing populations are stretching limited resources even further.  For example, Meath has half the staff of Kerry.  I am not saying that we can change that overnight but the baseline means that this is counted as a need and resourced so there is no way of catching up in the case of a growing area.  Deferring this until after the general election, which is what is happening, will make people feel very cynical about this.  It undermines the tax.</p></speech>

I also believe that over time, we should look to increase the amount of revenue raised in a particular area and local authority that is spent in the area in which it is raised.  On the cost of doing that, based the work I did on the local property tax report a number of months ago, I can say that the additional cost to the Exchequer would be anywhere between &euro;80 million and &euro;110 million so there is a significant cost involved.  It is not the case that any knowledge regarding winners or losers is being deferred to any point in the future.  I have published all of the potential beneficiaries and those who will lose out from any of the different changes that could be considered by the D&aacute;il.  All that information is in the public domain.  I have provided clarity not only to local authorities but to local property tax bill payers regarding what their liabilities will be for the next year.  We have also provided all the information the local authorities need to be able to conclude their work regarding their budgets.  However, I take the Deputy's point that reform and change in the equalisation fund in the future will be a very important part of ensuring that the local property tax continues to be legitimate and that it can play a more significant role in the future in meeting local needs.</p></speech>

Local ecologist Mr. Collie Ennis, a member of the Irish Herpetological Society and a scientist in Trinity College Dublin who had been instrumental in identifying the rewilding of this area and the degree to which it had become a little gem or miracle in this location, was simply appalled at what transpired.  South Dublin County Council had that very week identified the area in its own documentation and had included the protection of these wetland habitats and reserves as an objective in its Tallaght local area action plan.  Will the Government initiate an inquiry into how this happened?  After a climate action plan has been announced, how can a local authority or a State agency engage in such environmental vandalism, attacking and destroying an area rich in biodiversity?  It defies any logical explanation.  It demands an inquiry because it suggests that all levels of Government are not on board in respect of the most pressing issue of our time.</p></speech>

The number of families falling into homelessness has risen by more than tenfold since 2011.  This means that when Fine Gael came to power, eight families were becoming homeless every month.  Eight years later, that figure has risen to 90 families per month.  It is not new to state the Government has failed to get to grips with the scale of the housing crisis.  It has not delivered solutions for ordinary families who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.  The first thing the Minister must do to solve this crisis is to have the political will to do so.  Does the Minister agree that the rate of family homelessness in this State constitutes a national emergency, and can he outline precisely the measures that will be taken in budget 2020 to address this dire situation?</p></speech>

It is true to say that housing supply has not caught up with demand yet, but it is catching up.  Every month construction is starting on more than 2,000 new homes on sites throughout the country.  We continue to have families in emergency accommodation and that is unacceptable.  We continue to have high levels of presentations of families in emergency accommodation but despite that, there are fewer families in emergency accommodation tonight than there were this time last year.  We continue to make a huge response by providing both emergency accommodation and new homes for families.  The 10,000 new homes added to the stock of social housing are not a small number.  I began my budget engagement with the Minister for Finance some time ago.  We are in the middle of that, and a priority for me in those budget negotiations is ensuring that we have all relevant supports in place.  That includes emergency accommodation, as well as continuing to work through Rebuilding Ireland, which in just two more years will have seen the introduction of 50,000 new homes into the stock of social housing.  We have not seen that in this country for quite some time.</p></speech>

I wish to put on the D&aacute;il record that we have had many more disclosures.  In particular, three women in the housing assistance payment, HAP, sector have contacted me about their situations.</p><p>It is clear that when we have predominantly female, young and vulnerable people seeking scarce accommodation, such as in the HAP sector, the prevalence of exploitation of all kinds, including sexual, will increase.  &quot;Kirsty&quot; spoke out in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  It is particularly sinister that an estate agent, with such power to evict people or give them accommodation, is engaging in sexual harassment.  We have uncovered information from many women concerning their experiences, including receiving comments about their bodies, discouragement of boyfriends, offers of dinner, and getting drunken texts late at night.  The housing crisis is creating a perfect storm for predatory landlords.  That is particularly the case in the HAP sector.  It is the basis for social housing and it is dangerous to give private landlords such control over vulnerable women and children.</p></speech>

It is true that many people are vulnerable and in housing insecurity because not enough homes are yet being built to meet demand.  This year, we introduced significant new protections for tenants.  That is important, as is noting that the majority of people in the rental sector have safety and security in their homes.  I agreed to our meeting later since we last spoke.  I have also been in touch with my counterpart in the UK and I have been told that legislation in this area is dealt with there by the Home Office.  I had discussions with the Minster for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, as well regarding what legislative vehicles exist to protect people.</p>  <p>  Where a person is a tenant, protections exist in the context of the Residential Tenancy Board, RTB, and the new powers we have recently given that body.  Where a person runs into difficulties with letting agents, as described in today's newspapers, he or she can take that issue to the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and I continue to consider this issue to see what further protections might be put in place.  I ask the Deputy to bring any specific information she may have gathered in the past week to our meeting later.  </p>  <p>   As I said to her colleague at the housing committee, however, it is wrong to link this issue to a housing support such as HAP.  Doing so risks putting people in more vulnerable situations because they might refuse to use HAP.  Landlords might also refuse to accept it.  People would, therefore, be at greater risk of going into homelessness.  We are taking this issue seriously and I look forward to our further engagement later.</p></speech>

A woman whom I will call "Chrissie" is a full-time carer for her sister Mary, who has had Wilson's Disease since she was 14 years old.  Mary is now 58.  "Chrissie" is also a half-time carer for her mother who is 84 with deteriorating health.  Mary was recently hospitalised unexpectedly for surgery for a burst appendix.  She spent three weeks in hospital and then got one week of respite in the wonderful Cluain Arainn unit in Tipperary town.</p>  <p>  When "Chrissie" requested home help prior to her sister's discharge, she was told that none might be available.  Mary normally has home help each morning for an hour so that she can be showered, dressed, receive tablets and have a small breakfast.  It was devastating for her to have her sister come home feeling weak, ill-nourished and in need of being built back up and then be told that there might not be any home help.  I have the letter from the HSE.  It states that no home help was available because of maternity leave and sick leave.  This is happening up and down the country.  It is appalling.  It is causing bed blocking in hospitals and a major crisis in emergency departments.  This is totally insensitive but can we expect much more from the Fine Gael party?  It is shocking.</p></speech>

New data revealed to me last weekend showed that the list of those waiting for supports has jumped from 6,238 in March to 7,346 in July.  These figures are enormously disappointing as they show the extent of the unmet need nationwide.  We all know the importance of homecare support.  It is Government policy to support people at home with the correct wrap-around help.  Unfortunately, that has become very difficult given these figures.</p>  <p>  Government policy prior to the recess clearly stated there was no moratorium on new supports for people living at home.  The figures now tell us something much different.  Shockingly, Waterford showed the highest increase from 31 people waiting in March to 124 people waiting at the end of July.  I know we were coming from a low base, but that is a 300% increase.  When will this moratorium be lifted so that people who need homecare supports can avail of them?  </p></speech>

Elderly patients being cared for in hospitals are being sent home with no care whatsoever.  There is deep concern among families about the privatisation of all of these hours and all of this care.

I ask the Minister to seek a report immediately from the HSE and an outline as to how it will deal with this escalating problem.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the effect not being able to access this type of support quickly has on families, patients and those who are ill and vulnerable.  I am well aware of the anxiety and difficulty it can cause.  As the Deputies may be aware, we have &euro;445 million worth of funding in the HSE service plan to ensure we have the right level of support in place for our citizens.  At the end of June, more than 51,000 patients and families were in receipt of homecare packages.  However, I am aware of the issues the Deputies have touched on and I am working with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on them.  I take the point that, particularly in the run-up to the end of the year and the winter period, an issue such as this not only causes further difficulty for families and patients, it can also compound the challenges faced by our emergency departments and hospitals throughout the winter period.  I thank all of the Deputies for raising the issue.</p></speech>

In 2014, planning permission was granted and we all know it takes time to get planning permission.  Not alone has no sod been lifted to prepare for the extension but the HSE had to go back for planning permission this year.  Thankfully, it was granted but it is a disgrace five years later, when the hospital is incredibly busy dealing with a large population, that people are on trolleys, the assessment unit has been closed because of problems with capacity and there is no movement on the new mental health facility.  This is completely wrong.  The new mental health facility and the extension, which will contain an oncology department as well as acute services and an endoscopy department, are in the capital plan for 2019.  When will we see progress on them?</p></speech>

That is an awful joke in my city.  It is turning into an nightmare.  Yesterday, 81 people were lying on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Today, 80 people are packed like sardines into the emergency department.  The INMO has described it as a small hospital being piled into University Hospital Limerick.  Last month, the Minister of Health made a secret dash in and out of the hospital.  He avoided hard questions from public representatives and the media but nothing has happened since his visit.  In fact, circumstances have worsened.  The Government's action to date has been disgracefully inadequate.  When will this overcrowding be properly addressed?</p></speech>

The HSE capital plan, published a number of weeks ago by the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach and I, outlined the plans now funded to increase the number of beds in the health service to just above 11,000.  It is good to hear that at least one of the projects to which Deputy O'Loughlin referred is included in the capital plan.</p><p>We have put funding in place to increase the number of hospital beds.  We have recently made changes to how we pay nurses to ensure we will have staff in place and more beds to deliver better care for patients.  I take on board the points the Deputies have made about the need for this work to be commenced and done quickly.  I am sure the HSE and the Department of Health will ensure the additional funding I have made available to them is spent quickly.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, that framework recognises Waterford as a regional city.  The local authority has asked the Government to properly support the North Quays development which is very important to the economic development of Waterford city and county and the entire south east.  Three years ago the local authorities entered into discussions with a private investor who was willing to put &euro;400 million on the table, contingent on the provision of State funding.  To date, we have received no solid commitment on numbers from the Government to ensure the project will proceed.  There is a concern that it could slip if the Government's commitment is not put on the table.  When will the Government announce the next round of funding from the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund?  I know that the Minister visited Waterford recently and saw the site.

I refer to the case of Hannah Donnelly from Drogheda who was admitted to Temple Street hospital in March 2017 for much needed surgery.  She has Apert syndrome.  Complications arose, as a result of which she has been in hospital for two and a half years.  Medical advice given in March 2018 stated the best place for Hannah was at home.  The family set about fundraising in the community.  They remodelled their home and purchased a wheelchair accessible vehicle.</p><p>A business case for 24-7 home care supports was submitted for approval because Hannah's medical case is complex.  Recently the family was offered four hours a week transitional care.  That is an absolute insult. </p> <p> Hannah is 18 years old.  She is desperate to get home.  She has a ten-year old sister at home.  She deserves as near as possible quality of life at home.  The only thing preventing Hannah going home is the HSE's refusal to fund her home care package.  Will the Minister please step in and instruct the HSE to fund that package so that this 18-year old girl, whose picture I am holding up for the Minister to see, can go home to her family?  There is a massive campaign locally to get Hannah home for Christmas.  Will he please intervene?  This is not right and it is not even humane at this stage.  The Minister has the power to intervene.  I beg him to do it.  It costs more, as he knows, to keep Hannah in hospital than it ever would to fund her home care support package.  I beg the Minister, please. </p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy can understand why given the range of difficulties the health services have to deal with every day.  I am sure, however, that because she has raised it in the way she has the HSE will be aware of it and will do all it can to make sure that Hannah&rsquo;s needs and desire to be at home with her family can be met. </p></speech>

Yesterday we saw the latest development in the crisis in rail capacity, with Irish Rail asking people to stagger their journeys, to talk to their employers and arrange different working hours.  Is this the sum total of Government policy to tackle this crisis?</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, at the end of August about this matter.  One of his staff wrote back stating: "The operation and provision of services on the rail network are matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority."  He is not here today.  While I appreciate that it is a very busy and demanding schedule to try to compete with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, to launch car charging facilities that are not yet in operation in Marlay Park, will the Minister for Finance to clarify what does the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, see as his role if it is not to do with rail capacity and implementing the programme for Government?  What is the Government going to do in the here and now to cater for the commuting misery being suffered by many all over this country not just in commuting to the major cities but also inter-city? </p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that there are few things more frustrating than standing at a bus stop and seeing a bus go by that is full or not being able to board a train that is full.  I know, however, from my engagement with the Minister that the funding going into public transport is growing and that is due to the efforts of him and his Department.  Projects such as the rail centre, the national signal centre that the Minister recently had approved by Cabinet, are needed to increase capacity on public transport and to deal with the needs of commuters that have been highlighted by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I refer to people living in remote areas who need their car.  It will already cost them &euro;4.50 extra to fill their car before the carbon tax is increased at all.  Does the Minister have any idea that such people need their cars to go to work, to take their children to school, and to travel to doctor's appointments and hospitals?  It will affect hauliers throughout the country and farmers who need their tractors.  Does the Minister have any idea how the measure will hurt people and does he realise the price of home heating oil already has increased, before putting it up even further?

I was involved in this debate this time last year and, as we approach budget day again, I am very much aware of the concerns commuters will have, as well as the concerns of people who do not have the kinds of public transport options that people in our larger cities have.  Nevertheless, I am equally aware, as are many of the people the Deputy referred to, of the pressing need to change how our economy and country flow in order that we can play our part in responding to the change to the climate taking place in front of us.  My commitment and what I am looking to do, subject to approval by the House, in respect of any changes we make to carbon taxation, is that those on the lowest incomes will be on the top of our agenda for how we will support them at a time of change.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1278" speakername="Kevin O'Keeffe" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400016#O00800"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>The current position is that section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 permits the District Court, under certain conditions, to grant an occasional licence to the holder of an on-licence on the occasion of a special event being held at a place to which no licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor is attached. </p><p>This can often take the form of a local festival or annual celebration or fundraiser.  However, the subsection provides that an occasional licence in respect of a dance shall not be granted unless it is held elsewhere than in the open air, or in a tent, marquee or other such structure.  To grant a licence, the event must occur within a permanent structure if alcohol is to be sold.  This creates a position where community organisations are limited in the nature and location of events they can hold in a somewhat arbitrary way.  As it stands, this prohibition leads to considerable difficulties for community groups and festival organisers that are not necessary.  Many of the organisations hit by this law rely on a small number of big events to fund their activities for the years ahead.  Local communities are also being unfairly tasked with raising money for more complex solutions and venues than would otherwise be needed.</p> <p> Rural Ireland is running out of suitable structures and locations.  Under the current law, to gain a licence exemption to sell alcohol at a gig or dance, one is obliged to provide a permanent structure from which alcohol can be sold.  During the summer, a number of events were proposed and were lucky enough to be approved because of practical negotiation with garda&iacute; and people from the District Court.  I propose that we amend the law through this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400017#P00900"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to repeal the following guidelines issued to planning authorities thereafter, namely, Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, March 2018, and Urban Development and Building Heights, December 2018.</blockquote><p>In the dying days of the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and junior Minister, Senator Paudie Coffey, introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2015.  It seemed a technical and uneventful Bill to many people but one of the provisions, an amendment to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, introduced a profound change to the way in which planning law is made in this State.  It essentially gave the power to any Minister with responsibility for the environment, as it was then, and now housing to unilaterally introduce mandatory planning guidelines that would override the democratically agreed decisions of city and county councils.  This would have to be complied with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local authorities and others.</p><p>There was no requirement in this amendment to have such significant powers approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas or any other democratically elected body.  The Minister could undertake public consultation but the unilateral power to set planning policy was to be vested in the hands of an individual.  The power is not only deeply undemocratic but in the two instances in which it has been used, it has led to negative planning outcomes.  The current Minister with responsibility for housing has used it twice, last March and in December 2018, introducing in the first instance new design standards for apartments and in the second instance new mandatory guidelines with respect to building heights.</p><p>The first action has led to a significant deterioration in standards.  For example, developers can now provide smaller apartments and increase the number of studio apartments in a given development, irrespective of whether that is an appropriate use of the development space in that geographical area.  There is less of a requirement for dual aspects, car parking and storage space.  With respect to both build-to-rent developments and the highly controversial co-living proposals, we have seen an even further deterioration of standards.</p><p>Likewise, the Minister often tells the House and the public that an increase in building heights is necessary to increase density when any first-year architecture student can say that the relationship between densities and heights is not that straightforward.  Higher developments can have a lower density because they require more undeveloped space for amenities and car parking.  Some of the most effective use of heights and densities are mid-rise developments, the vast majority of which are permitted under existing city and county development plans.  We know that when permissible heights are increased, the price of land is driven up and accommodation becomes more expensive.  Even if last year's guidelines from the Minister increase output - there is no guarantee of that - they certainly will not increase the affordability of that output.  Just like with apartment sizes, this makes for very bad planning.</p><p>This does two simple things.  It would repeal the bad decision made by the Oireachtas in 2015 and early 2016 and remove the power I have described from the Minister.  If the Minister wants power to set planning guidelines, he should be forced to bring forward the proposal to the Oireachtas for its approval in the same way the Government would with any other legislation.  That is not what the current power does.  The Bill would also seek to repeal the two ministerial guidelines that have been introduced so we can return to the regime that existed before 2016.  It worked perfectly fine, particularly in the context of the democratically agreed provisions of the local authorities.</p><p>The Bill is very straightforward and although I know the Government will probably oppose it when we bring it to Second Stage, I hope it will not oppose it on First Stage so we can at least allow the Oireachtas to have that debate and come to a democratic decision on these crucial matters.</p></speech>

In light of the particular challenges faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of examination and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the PDF, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance of by the PDF representative associations.  Any suggestion that these measures are only worth 96 cent per day is disingenuous and a soundbite that has been used to misinform people.</p>  <p>  The report also contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service.</p><p>The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out timelines and objectives, which indicates its commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the pay commission.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force and identifies further retention measures within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.  Work on implementing the plan is under way and, under my direction, being prioritised by civil and military management.</p> <p> I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations of the public service pay commission, in tandem with pay benefits being delivered under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 with the most recent being a 1.5% increase on 1 September, will help to ameliorate the recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force.</p></speech>

The pay commission report indicates that 57.8% of Permanent Defence Force members stated that they will leave in the next two years and, of those, 84.5% pointed to pay as a primary consideration.  The Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, stated today at the conference of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, that the situation will get worse before it gets better.  The proof of the Government's plan involving the pay commission will be whether the Minister of State can end the exodus of personnel and bring the complement back towards the target of 9,500.  Based on the current rate of attrition and turnover, it appears that the number of personnel is still falling.  Structures in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are collapsing.  When does the Minister of State expect to turn the corner in terms of personnel numbers?  Not even the best recruitment campaign could bridge the gap created by the current exodus and retention difficulties.  I am not sure whether the report of the pay commission has thus far achieved what the Minister of State set out in his statement.</p></speech>

As I stated, we are competing in a very strong and buoyant jobs market in which there is almost full employment.  I asked the two Defence Forces representative associations to consider very carefully the report of the pay commission published in July.  I am delighted that the recommendations of the public service pay commission were accepted yesterday at the biannual RACO conference.  Immediate and tangible benefits will accrue to RACO members from that acceptance.  We have increased the military service allowance and restored allowances cut under the Haddington Road agreement, as well as bringing back the pilot retention scheme.  An implementation plan to strengthen the Defence Forces is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach and we are into phase 1 of the plan.  There are specific timelines set down for its implementation and it is being led by a civil and military team.</p></speech>

He humiliated the tenure of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence by showing leadership on the issue.  RACO stated that there is much frustration and disappointment at the meagre increases set out in the Government's proposals, which is hardly an endorsement of the plan.  Of course, when one has a gun to one's head, one will accept a meagre increase.  Far more must be done to address the recruitment and retention crisis.  When does the Minister of State expect the gap between current and desired staffing levels to close?  That will be the key metric by which to judge the report.</p></speech>

The Deputy does not have the responsibility of dealing with public sector pay.  Of course, his party previously had that responsibility and got us into a big mess.  I want to get back to a strength level of 9,500 personnel and that is achievable with the assistance of military management, the Department of Defence, RACO and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  All of those parties want to reach that figure.  There is funding for a complement of 9,500 personnel.  I have acknowledged that public sector pay is a significant challenge for me as Minister of State with responsibility for defence and for the Government as a whole because public servants are keeping a watchful eye on what is happening in other areas of the public service.  I am not sure whether the Deputy will acknowledge that.  I want to be able to get the staffing level back up to 9,500.  It will be difficult to do so because we are competing in a buoyant economy with almost full employment.  There is significant appetite among the private sector for members of the Defence Forces because of their training and the way they are equipped.  I acknowledge that we are losing some very good people.  People should also consider the numerous benefits of being a member of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

The buoyant labour market and increased competition across sectors to attract personnel are key factors.  The level of the departure of personnel can fluctuate, as can the timing of departures.  As such, it is very difficult to predict accurately future departure rates.  The current departure rates are presenting difficulties for the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In light of the particular issues faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the public service pay commission with undertaking a comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations, some of which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements.  Immediate measures include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.  The report also contains a broad range of recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service.  The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out timelines and objectives, which indicates its commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the pay commission.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force and the identification of other retention measures.  These will be progressed within the framework of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.  Under my direction, this work is being prioritised.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over its lifetime.  The increases due to date under the agreement have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2020.  I am satisfied that the range of measures being progressed is an appropriate response to the current difficulties.</p></speech>

However, the view on this side of the House is that he is not dealing with reality.  He referred to changes within the system but we know that personnel are leaving and that recruitment and retention have become almost impossible due to poor pay and repeated cuts to allowances, as well as poor working conditions.  There are also challenges relating to accommodation for personnel.</p><p>There is a big problem with morale and while the Minister of State may be addressing the conferences, he is saying nothing that will bolster that.  I would argue that the Government has created this crisis itself.</p> <p> Radical and urgent solutions are needed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform assessed the long-term turnover rate in the Defence Forces to be 6.4%.  Even using the Government's own optimistic predictions, it will not reach establishment strength of 9,500 until 2026.  According to RACO, however, the real turnover rate is 10.3%.  Is RACO wrong?  What the Minister of State is saying here does not add up.  He is giving a glossy message that everything will be sorted but the reality on the ground and coming from the conferences is quite different.  </p></speech>

I addressed the conference this morning and I totally disagree with the Deputy's assertion.  While Deputy Crowe mentioned allowances, the Public Service Pay Commission report has restored the allowances to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels and the Deputy fails to acknowledge that.  Any officer of the Defence Forces, having accepted the pay commission's report in full, will receive the immediate benefits.  It is worth an additional &euro;10 million annually over the position last year for enlisted personnel and officers.  If PDFORRA accepts the recommendations, all its members will also receive immediate benefits.  Allowances, including the weekend and 24-hour duty allowances, comprised one of the biggest issues raised with me in recent years.  I wanted to ensure the allowances were restored and the independent pay commission recommended that they be restored to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels.  If the representative associations vote for it, their members will feel the benefits.</p></speech>

One can tinker around the sides in respect of allowances and so on but the issue of core pay must be addressed.  That is one reason the representative associations want to move on and have representation at the table to argue for their case.  They perceive a weakness in that the Minster of State is not championing or pushing that forward, which is a big problem.  There is a great problem with morale.  The figures show that people are leaving day after day.  The Minister of State needs to do something different.  Pay is clearly one of the issues, as are working conditions.  Any efforts regarding retention are not working at present. The Minister of State has stated he understands the challenges but there is concern that lack of pay and low morale are not being addressed.  People respond every day by leaving the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

That is very easy to say.  I assure the Deputy that were I to state that we would increase core pay for the Defence Forces but for nobody else, he would be in here the next morning hopping off the ceiling saying that if the Government was going to do it for the Defence Forces then it would have to do it for everyone else.  The public service stability agreement provides for increases for the Defence Forces year on year.  The Deputy should look at the tangible increases in core pay each year, which will continue until 2020 when talks on the next public service pay agreement will commence.</p></speech>

This represented an increase of &euro;51 million, or 7%, over the corresponding 2018 allocation and includes funding for pay and allowances for over 10,400 public service employees, ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs and the ongoing renewal and upgrading of defence equipment and barracks infrastructure, as well as funding in respect of Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society.  It allows the Defence Forces to deliver on all of their assigned roles, both at home and overseas, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. </p>  <p>Overall expenditure on the Defence Vote at the end of August was &euro;418 million, representing 55% of the total budget provision.  This is broadly in line with expenditure trends in recent years.  At the end of August, capital expenditure was &euro;28 million below the profile set out at the beginning of the year, mainly due to later capital project delivery timelines.  Non-pay expenditure was broadly in line with profile and pay expenditure was &euro;24 million below profile, mainly due to payroll numbers being below approved strength levels.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor expenditure across the defence Vote very closely, and it is intended that any savings arising within the defence Vote at year-end would, in consultation and agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, be used to address spending requirements elsewhere in the defence Vote group, including Army pensions.</p></reply>

The pay budget is &euro;24 million below what was budgeted for so far this year.  That is because of the mass exodus under the watch of the Minister of State.  They are not being paid the appropriate allowances and they are on the poverty line.  The Minister of State is yet to outline where he will find the &euro;10 million.  He was at the RACO conference, speaking of how he had found &euro;10 million and how he fought for the personnel and the Defence Forces.  Will he seek an extra &euro;10 million from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or will he take the &euro;10 million from the unspent &euro;24 million on some of the retention issues?  Despite the &euro;10 million in the pay commission report, once again there will be a surplus in the pay budget.  It is shocking that once again under the Minister of State's tenure, he will have a surplus in the pay allocation when there is such a crisis in retention and so many members of the Defence Forces are on the poverty line.  It is very worrying that spending is &euro;24 million under profile.</p></speech>

I assure him that any savings from pay is redirected to the organisation with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy and I have attended meetings of the defence committee where we discussed Estimates.  It goes into Army pensions or is redirected into the organisation to buy ships or otherwise improving infrastructure, such as armoured personnel carriers and aircraft platforms.  The purchase of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft is at an advanced stage and they are due for delivery in early 2020.  The Deputy will also be aware that we are also replacing the CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p><p>Pay savings are redirected into the organisation.

Has he listened to himself?  We are talking about a recruitment and retention crisis and he has record levels of pay savings, the very matter that is causing the recruitment and retention crisis and putting people on the bread line in the Defence Forces.  He is telling us that he is buying a few aeroplanes and that a few ships will be docked.  On what planet is he living when it comes to managing the pay difficulties that are causing the crisis?  He has confirmed ongoing pay savings for the House.  A sum of &euro;24 million has been save this year and there will be record levels of pay savings this year based on the Minister of State's projections today.  He has confirmed savings of &euro;24 million up to the end of August or early September.  That nearly exceeds the maximum amount in the gross pay savings in Vote 36 in previous years.  That demonstrates the difficulties which have caused the exodus of staff.  The Minister of State should not tell us about the ships and the aeroplanes that will be purchased or the money that will be reallocated for capital spending.  We need people in the organisation.  That is what the Defence Forces are proud to have.  People are the core of the organisation, not empty aeroplanes or vessels.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400020#S01700"><p>I am aware of the long-standing desire of PDFORRA to associate with the ICTU.  Section 2(3) of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 prohibits the Defence Forces representative associations from being associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body without the consent of the Minister.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force also cannot become members of a trade union.  To compensate for these limitations, there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces ombudsman and a conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, upheld the prohibition on the right of military personnel to strike but did conclude that Ireland was in violation of the charter in respect of the right to organise, that is, to affiliate to certain organisations, and the right to negotiate collective agreements.  These findings were considered as part of an independent review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force which was completed last year.  One of the recommendations from the review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the ICTU to explore the practicalities of a Permanent Defence Force representative association forming an association or affiliation with the ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.  Association with the ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  I asked my officials to examine the matter further and, in that regard, defence management, civil and military, has engaged in discussions with the ICTU.  Defence management has also met the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to discuss the matter.  I have also recently discussed the matter of ICTU affiliation or association with both RACO and PDFORRA.  The feasibility of association is the subject of ongoing discussion and engagement with the ICTU.  The implications of possible association or affiliation are being carefully considered.</p></speech>

He is aware that a motion was passed by the D&aacute;il on 13 June which called for Defence Forces representative organisations to be able to take up associate membership of the ICTU.  The Government should accept this position which is the position of the D&aacute;il.  The ICTU's national council has since approved, in principle, an application from PDFORRA to become an associate member of congress.</p>  <p>  While members of the Defence Forces recognise the unique nature of their service to the State, they should not be disadvantaged as a result.  Defence Forces members are the lowest paid of all public servants.  When it comes to public sector talks, members of the Defence Forces representative organisations do not have a seat at the negotiating table.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  Members of the Defence Forces have also been forced to take their case to the European Committee of Social Rights, as the Minister of State pointed out, to have their right to collective bargaining recognised.  The committee ruled that the Government was in breach of the European Social Charter in respect of the right to organise, the right to affiliate to a certain organisation and the right to enter into negotiation and collective bargaining.</p>  <p>  To allay fears about a military strike, PDFORRA has clearly indicated that it is not interested in securing a right to strike.  Its moves to become part of a trade union will not in any way jeopardise national security.  Trade union membership is not incompatible with military service.  We know this from what happens in other countries.  Will the Minister of State confirm that he will not veto PDFORRA's affiliation to the ICTU as an associate member?</p></speech>

As I have stated, my officials are engaging with the ICTU.  I will await the outcome of that engagement.  The Deputy is right that a motion was passed in the D&aacute;il.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion, in which Fianna F&aacute;il, with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party, called for PDFORRA to be given the right to have representation through the ICTU.  The motion was supported by the Opposition and tabled by Deputy Jack Chambers.</p>  <p>  When Mr. Gerard Barry was looking at the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, as part of the terms of reference, I included the question about the ICTU that had come from the European Committee of Social Rights to ascertain how the Defence Forces representation arrangements and pay determination system compared in an international context.  I asked him to look at that matter.  The recommendation was that there be engagement with the ICTU, the Department of Defence and military management.  That engagement has been ongoing and I am waiting for the report to come back to me.  I will consider it.  I will also consider and take into account all of the concerns of any association or individual when I am making the decision.</p></speech>

There is no legitimate reason it does not deserve to have its voice heard, just like any other public service representative body.  The Minister of State mentioned the motion that was passed in the D&aacute;il, but, again, he says he will wait and see.  How long are workers to wait?  The rights of those working in the Defence Forces should not be less than those of any other worker.  Again, we have a situation where more cases are being dragged through the courts.  The Government needs to act.  This is one area that could be addressed to raise morale in the Defence Forces.  The motion passed by the D&aacute;il called on the Government to bring forward legislation to provide for implementation of the working time directive within a six-month period.  Will the Minister of State abide by that timeline?  Will the working time directive be adhered to within a six-month period?  That was also included in the motion passed by the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

PDFORRA has requested on a number of occasions to either become affiliated with or to take up associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  These requests raise significant challenges from both a Government point of view and a societal perspective.  We also have to take into account the risks of impinging on the military chain of command, which requires detailed consideration.  The request for associate membership of ICTU requires us to consider the potential for conflicts and divided loyalties that may well arise when the Government decides to deploy the Defence Forces for the maintenance of essential services.  The ability of the Defence Forces to perform all their duties as assigned by the Government cannot be impeded by affiliation with any organisation.  My officials are currently engaging with ICTU on this issue and I am awaiting a full and comprehensive report, which I am not going to rush.  I want a comprehensive report in order that I can consider the findings and make a recommendation to the Government, whatever that may be.  We have to carefully consider this because this is a broad move away from what we have had in the past.</p></speech>

The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales.  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and all other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  The increases due under the agreement have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement. </p>  <p>  In light of the particular challenges faced by the defence sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  The commission&rsquo;s report, which has been accepted by the Government, contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. </p>  <p>  The Government has prepared a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the Public Service Pay Commission's report.  The measures are aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment, retention and conditions of service.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the Permanent Defence Force within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations, and the completion and implementation of actions related to a review of technical pay arrangements for grades 2 to 6.  The plan also outlines timelines and objectives, indicating the commitment to deliver on the pay commission&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the pay and conditions of all members of the public service are commensurate with their skill levels and the work undertaken.</p></speech>

I have brought this issue up multiple times and will continue to do so until members of the Defence Forces are given the respect they deserve, which is indicated by how they are paid and their conditions of employment.</p>  <p>  The findings of the study undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission a few months ago conclude that the Defence Forces are at a critical juncture.  It is stated that the findings presented intimate that without immediate and substantial intervention, particularly in respect of pay, allowances and pension entitlements, the organisation may, within a short time, face major difficulties in maintaining its personnel establishment and in carrying out its mandate.  Due to its terms of reference, the commission was precluded from dealing with aspects of core pay but it would have been interesting to hear its thoughts on that subject.  I am sure it would have had something to say.</p></speech>

Nobody wanted to do it.  As our public finances are improving, the public service stability agreement is now in place, in which there are real financial benefits for all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The independent pay commission examined issues of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  It reported back in July and made a number of recommendations, including a package of &euro;10 million per annum.  In addition, I was able to personally negotiate some outstanding payments for members of the Defence Forces with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at a cost of &euro;1.7 million.</p>  <p>  I was delighted that RACO, which is the representative group for officers of the Defence Forces, accepted the recommendations of the pay commission yesterday.  There are real tangible benefits for officers of the Defence Forces in doing so and I understand that PDFORRA will also consider the recommendations shortly.  I hope it also accepts the recommendations because that would be of real benefit to members of the Defence Forces.  I acknowledge the challenges and the concerns the Deputy has around recruitment and retention and on the latter in particular.  However, an implementation body has been put in place for phase one of the strengthening of the Defence Forces, which I am confident will make a real difference and put more money into the pockets of Defence Forces personnel.</p></speech>

At its annual conference today, RACO delegates called for a pay review body for the Defence Forces, which I and my party would support.  The rate of turnover in the Defence Forces is currently 10%, which is happening without adequate retention measures or a pay review.  The organisation will never reach its establishment of 9,500 personnel, despite the current high level of recruitment, because it is like constantly pouring water into a bucket with a hole at the bottom.  RACO has also passed motions on allowances and has called for improved conditions, such as improved living quarters for married and single members.  That would act as a very real retention tool, as it would provide a stable, secure and modern living environment for the families of Defence Forces personnel.  Members of the Defence Forces are using their own voice and are calling for dignity.  They are calling for the right to live a normal life in Ireland, to be able to afford the basics and to provide for themselves and their families.  They need a future worth believing in, not the fear of long-term homelessness once their service is complete.  I do not think that is too much to ask of a body as august as the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

He is correct that RACO has called for its own independent pay review group.  The UK Government has a similar group in place, but the UK Government also has a different method of determining rates of public sector pay.</p><p>They have independent pay review bodies for individual sectors; one each for the army, police, teachers and nurses.  It would be difficult to take out one public sector group here and have a separate pay determination for it.  That is, however, not within my gift; it is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The British armed forces do not have representative associations to negotiate on their behalf.  They do not have group associations such as the PDFORRA and RACO to interact with Government or with the Departments of Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The overarching public service pay policy, as I said earlier, is a matter for the Minister for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> I acknowledge RACO's leadership in accepting the independent commission's recommendations.</p></speech>

Cybersecurity is a standing item on the agenda of the Government task force on emergency planning, which I chair.  The response to cyberthreats remains a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment taking the lead role, with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.</p><p>The first national cybersecurity strategy, agreed by Government in 2015, set out a series of measures that would be taken to build the capability of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, and to achieve a high level of security for computer networks and critical infrastructure in the State.  The NCSC, which is located in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provides a range of cybersecurity services to owners of Government ICT infrastructure and critical national infrastructure.  The centre is focused on developing capacity to protect Government information and communications networks, and on engaging with stakeholders on sharing information, securing systems and responding to incidents.</p><p>The NCSC is also home to the national computer security incident response team, CSIRT, which acts as a national point of contact involving entities within Ireland and as the point of contact for international discussions and collaboration on issues of cybersecurity.  A revised national cybersecurity strategy is to be published by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, in the coming weeks that will address issues raised by the Deputy such as resourcing and preparedness.  Officials from my Department and members of the Defence Forces have been actively involved in the development of this revised strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area.</p><p>In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a service level agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide support in the area of national cybersecurity.  The overall aim of this agreement is to improve the cybersecurity of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised.</p><p>As the Deputies will no doubt be aware, cybersecurity is a multifaceted challenge that is constantly evolving.  The nature of the threat and the potential impact also varies considerably depending on the approach and objective of those with malicious intent.  In that context, my Department implements a programme of continuous review in relation to ICT security to keep up to date with current threat levels.  Details of measures taken are not publicised for security reasons. </p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>While it would also be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons, the priority for the Defence Forces communications and information services, CIS, corps is the protection of the Defence Forces communications network.  Other activities undertaken by the CIS corps include the monitoring and handling of cyber incidents, the enhancement of Defence Forces cyber situational awareness, and the provision of cyber awareness training.  </p></speech>

Cyberattacks signify a grave threat to countries across Europe, yet we are not doing enough to protect ourselves.  One example was in 2017 when Ireland's power grid was the subject of a suspected nation-state attack, which was discovered two months after the initial attack.  It was not detected by Ireland; it was instead notified to the Irish authorities by the UK's national cyber security centre.  This is an example of how cyber attacks represent a threat to our State infrastructure and to the broader foreign direct investment here.  It should not take a serious attack to properly resource and plan a significant, modern defence matter, which is being reflected across many countries in the EU.  We need to resource it.</p>  <p>  It was reported during the summer that the Defence Forces stood down an internal cybersecurity team because of the lack of personnel and qualified staff and a further exodus of specialised personnel.  That team was responsible for monitoring the security of military IT networks to safeguard them from hostile state attacks.  Not only do we have an issue with the unit within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, due to the exodus of personnel, there are question marks over monitoring our own internal networks in the Defence Forces.  That is also a concern.</p></speech>

The Government task force on emergency planning also maintains cybersecurity as a standing item on the agenda where regular updates are provided and where issues of common interest may be raised and addressed.  The Deputy is correct that cyber attacks present a new threat and it has to be taken seriously by Government.  This is why we have a dedicated team in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As I said, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, retains overall responsibility for this area.  The Defence Forces have their own cybersecurity team to look after their own networks.  It is important that we are able to maintain security on our own networks, that we do not depend on any outsourcing of any capabilities to come in to assist in that, and that we can handle our own cybersecurity.  This is a matter of concern.  Given the number of multinational companies operating in Ireland, we have to be prepared for any cyberattack.  As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, I assure the Deputy that we get regular updates.  I have met people who work in the cybersecurity centre and they are top class.  We would want to be very careful not to rubbish their capability and what they are able to do.</p></speech>

I did not realise the questions were being grouped.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister of State's words of confidence towards the end of his contribution.  Having spoken with some people in the industry at a recent conference, they highlighted the various insecurities in our system.  I wonder, specifically, where is this co-ordinated within government? The Minister, Deputy Bruton's, Department, has the key role, as the host for the NCSC.  I am interested in how the Department of Defence fits in with that.  Where is the primary point of defence for cybersecurity?  Where would we best deploy extra resources if we were able to get them?  This should be a priority for Government because we live in an increasingly insecure cybersecurity world.  As the Minister of State said, given that we are the host for some 30% of all EU data, there could be reputational damage to that industry if the State's security systems cannot protect our networks, and to the defence system of the country.  Where is the co-ordination and who is the lead Minister when it comes to cybersecurity?</p></speech>

If business people have come to the Deputy and they are concerned, I ask him to bring those concerns to the attention of the Minister as soon as possible.</p><p>If there are Members of this House who are concerned about the inadequacies of Government in this area, there is no point raising them here in the House.  They should raise them with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, who, with the team working in the departmental cybersecurity centre, has overall responsibility for this area.  I have full confidence in this team, led by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p> <p> The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a service level agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide support in the area of national cybersecurity.  The overall aim of this agreement is to improve the cybersecurity of the State through various types of assistance, while at the same time ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised.  As I said, there is a service legal agreement in place under which personnel of the Defence Forces are seconded to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but, as of now, no Defence Forces personnel are on secondment.</p></speech>

If there is an attack here, the Defence Forces will have to be involved.  We know that the Defence Forces are unable to monitor their own internal networks on a 24-7 basis.  Coupled with the fact that owing to a shortage of personnel in the Defence Forces, it is not possible to second Defence Forces personnel to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the same way as has been done up to now, this represents a serious threat to Ireland that we need to address.  It is a threat to our foreign direct investment and State infrastructure and is a threat that exists in many other democracies across the world.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State's suggestion that we are criticising the staff is unfair.  The strategic role of the cybersecurity unit in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was heavily criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who said it lacked a strategic approach.  We know that owing to the decline in Defence Forces personnel, there are no staff available for secondment to that unit.  Deputy Kehoe, as Minister of State with responsibility for defence, has a responsibility to respond to this 21st century threat.  It is not politics; it is a reality.  The response needs to be greater than a deflection to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment because this represents a serious threat to us all if it comes to pass.</p></speech>

We know from the Edward Snowden revelations and others that all digital information leaving Ireland is accessible from Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ.  While in the past we have had a co-operative arrangement with the UK, which I hope will continue, there must be a real risk for us in the UK not being a fellow European Union member, in that it may restrict our access to co-ordination with what is happening in the UK in that regard.  One has a different working relationship with a country that is not a member of the European Union.  What, if any, preparations have been made by the Department of Defence, alone or with the Department of Communications, Climate Action or Environment, in terms of enhancing our security, taking account of the new cybersecurity environment that will exist when, and if, the UK exits the European Union?</p></speech>

I am not trying to deflect from or make politics of this issue.  I have stated on numerous occasions that cyberattacks are a 21st century threat.  There are many international IT companies located in Ireland, including Google, Facebook and Amazon.  In regard to what Government has done already, budget 2018 provided increased funding for additional capacity in the national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, in terms of personnel and technology.  The resources for the NCSC have been considerably expanded in recent years to meet its new responsibilities under the EU directives.  A new cybersecurity strategy is being prepared, which takes into account the latest assessment of risks and international experience.  Ongoing resourcing requirements will be reviewed in the context of the next cybersecurity strategy, which will be published in the coming weeks by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  The Minister provided an update in this regard at the most recent meeting of the Government task force on emergency planning, which is led by Mr. Richard Browne and meets every six or eight weeks.  The national cybersecurity centre does fantastic work.  Its work, on a daily basis, to protect our IT systems should not be diminished.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Jack Chambers, the priority of the Defence Forces is to protect its own networks.  If there are Defence Forces personnel surplus to requirements, under the service legal agreement, they will be seconded to the NCSC.  Unfortunately, there are no surplus staff.  These people are highly sought after by the private sector.  This is one the issues considered by the pay commission.</p></speech>

The role of the mission is to ensure security, stabilisation and protection of civilians; supporting national political dialogue and reconciliation; assisting in the re-establishment of State authority; the rebuilding of the security sector and the promotion and protection of human rights in Mali. </p>  <p>  Two officers deployed on 7 September to Bamako, where the MINUSMA force headquarters is located.  They have since completed some initial training and have taken up their respective roles in the force headquarters.  An additional 11 personnel drawn from the Army Ranger Wing, ARW, deployed with the German armed forces to Camp Castor in Gao, Mali, on 12 September 2019.</p>  <p>  All deployed personnel are currently embedding with the larger German company and are carrying out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission mandate.</p>  <p>  The ARW will deploy as a team to carry out surveillance and intelligence gathering operations.  They will deploy as part of a larger intelligence surveillance reconnaissance company and, therefore, would not be deployed in isolation.  The task force utilises technology via unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, and human sources, that is, personnel on the ground engaging with local people, to gather intelligence for the UN mission.  The ARW will support this effort by providing personnel to undertake these tasks.  While the Army Ranger Wing team will engage on a day-to-day basis with the individuals in the local population as part of their intelligence and information gathering remit, they will benefit from the security effort that is in place to protect the full company.</p>  <p>  This MINUSMA deployment is for a period of 24 months from September 2019 to September 2021.</p></speech>

We voted against it in this House, as did others.  We did so because we were being asked to endorse and become part of the UN's response to a coup in that state and to train Malian military to fight a civil war.  This is a security peace enforcement mission that involves taking sides and Sinn F&eacute;in believes this undermines our neutrality.  The mission in which the Army rangers are involved has a security-only focus.  It does not involve any roadmap to peace.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, the Defence Forces should be seen as mediators, continuing Ireland's proud role in supporting peace efforts in the region or anywhere else in the world, and not as one-sided enforcers.  The deployment of personnel to act as enforcers rather than mediators changes the nature of Irish engagement with international politics.  </p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State receive regular updates on the mission and the security measures to protect Irish troops?</p></speech>

Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the military authorities and I receive military advice on the security situation in Mali at the time of deployment.  As stated by Deputy Crowe, this is a UN mission but Ireland is partaking in the international community response to the shooting of innocent people on a daily basis in Mali.  Peacekeeping is a core element of Ireland's foreign policy, derived from our commitment with the UN member states to building and strengthening global peace and protecting human rights and the rule of law.</p><p>That is exactly what members of the ARW are doing with MINUSMA in Mali.  MINUSMA is the United Nations' response and provides support for the Malian Government in reasserting its authority in northern Mali.  As I stated, MINUSMA was established in 2013 and has made a real difference on the ground in Mali.  I had the opportunity earlier this year to sit down with the force commander to discuss the mission and Ireland's participation in it.</p></speech>

There was a coup in the country.  It is a high risk mission which has involved over 200 fatalities to date.  As it is considered to be one of the United Nations' most dangerous missions, we need to talk about it in the House.  Large-scale deployments such as this, with a full combat role, should not be allowed to become the norm.  It is a form of conflict management by the United Nations.  We should be leading the opposition to it, rather than supporting it.  I also have concerns about the intelligence roles played by the troops.  Intelligence is gathered with others, but we have no control over how it is used.  Again, this might have negative consequences.  </p>  <p>  As a malaria zone, the mission in Mali poses a significant risk to Irish troops.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether soldiers serving there are taking Lariam?  I do not need to remind him about the motion passed by the D&aacute;il on the issue.  Are our troops in Mali taking Lariam?</p></speech>

In the past six decades Ireland has participated in Chapter VI and Chapter VII missions and played a vital role in promoting peace, stability and the protection of civilians.  I have confidence in every member of the ARW who has deployed to Mali.  I have seen them in action and met them individually.  I know their capabilities.

The Defence Forces built infrastructure programme is compiled on a priority needs basis by my Department in conjunction with the military authorities.  This year some &euro;28 million was allocated towards the maintenance and development of new building projects for the Defence Forces.  This represents an increase of over &euro;10 million compared to the figure allocated in 2018.  I can confirm for the Deputy that it is intended that the budget allocation will be matched in the coming years to ensure the level of building activity will be in line with Defence Forces requirements.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on defence has identified the need to develop a rolling five-year capital plan to provide for future Defence Forces built infrastructure requirements, taking account of the capability priority needs of the Defence Forces.  The plan is expected to be finalised shortly.  The list of works identified as part of the project will be prioritised for delivery based on military needs and updated annually to form the basis for the selection of capital projects under the programme into the future. </p>  <p>  I will set out some of the key ongoing projects under way in improving Defence Forces accommodation and living standards across military installations.  The refurbishment of the apprentice hostel accommodation block at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel is well advanced.  It will provide classrooms, an auditorium, recreational facilities and improved living accommodation for 75 personnel.  The project will be completed shortly at a cost of &euro;3 million.  The refurbishment of the dining hall in Custume Barracks in Athlone started in 2018.  The scope of the works includes the refurbishment and upgrade of the existing dining hall and cook house.  The upgrade and refurbishment of the building currently in place will provide a modern dining facility and ensure the long-term viability of the complex at the barracks.  The works will be completed by year end at a cost of &euro;3.6 million.  The upgrading and refurbishment of Plunkett Block 7 at the Curragh Camp, Defence Forces Training Centre involve the refurbishment of the existing accommodation for 58 personnel to modern standards.  The works will commence shortly.  Upgrading and refurbishment of the existing accommodation for 80 personnel in blocks 1 and 2 in Cathal Brugha Barracks will also commence before year end.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the increased level of building construction will continue in 2020 and onwards.  Next year I expect construction to commence of new gymnasia in Kilkenny and Limerick at a cost in the region of &euro;5 million.  I should also mention two significant projects that have recently been approved to proceed.  The refurbishment and upgrading of the accommodation block at the naval base at Haulbowline will deliver additional living capacity on top of the existing provision of 210 beds spaces provided at the naval base.  It is intended that work will commence on block 8 on site in 2020.  Another project involves the upgrade of the former USAC complex in Galway.  This building has been designed to accommodate 120 persons living in single rooms.  The rooms are fitted out to a basic standard and ablution facilities are provided communally.  The building is nearly 50 years old and does not meet current standards with respect to building construction methodology, fire prevention measures and energy efficiency.  While both projects are at an early stage of design development, it is expected that construction works will commence in late 2020.</p>  <p>  Taken together, the projects which are all being prioritised represent a combined value of &euro;30 million in planned capital investment.  This level of investment illustrates the importance I attach to ensuring the quality of the Defence Forces built infrastructure meets the expectations of serving personnel.</p></speech>

I welcome the investment in Defence Forces accommodation, particularly the upgrade and refurbishment of Plunkett Block 7 at the Curragh, Defence Forces Training Centre which is in my constituency of Kildare South.  It is an ageing military camp that was originally developed by the British.  The need for investment in a large-scale development is significant.  There is also a need for redevelopment and ongoing maintenance to ensure members will not be expected to work in substandard accommodation at any stage.  It is critical that the level of investment referred to by the Minister of State be maintained and increased in the future.  Other areas at which I would like the Minister of State to look include investment at the Curragh but not from his budget.  The Department of Education and Skills holds the key.  The Minister for Education and Skills outlined the potential to redevelop the post-primary school at the Curragh.  I want the site to be located at the Curragh because it is the right place for it to be located.  It is a great school with a fantastic community spirit.  I have written to the Minister of State about a site that would be suitable for it.  I ask him to encourage his officials in the Department of Defence to deal directly with officials in the Department of Education and Skills to tease out the potential concerns of military management and the potential for synergies.  There is a great opportunity in that regard.  This is a key investment of over &euro;10 million that would provide a significant boost at the Curragh.</p></speech>

Slowly but surely, we are refurbishing some of the older blocks and building some new ones.</p><p>The Deputy has mentioned a new school to me on several occasions and led a delegation to my Department some time ago seeking a site.  While that can be considered, serious consideration must be given to the military and its needs in the Curragh Camp, the property that is available and the views of the Department of Defence.  I am willing to assist the Deputy and his community in accommodating a new school but we have to take account of the concerns and considerations of the military and the Department of Defence and their plans for the future of the Curragh site. </p></speech>

The fact that they are being left there because of the accommodation difficulties is truly shocking.  I visited Newbridge with my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin, and Ms Sara Walsh of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces organisation.  The previous Deputy mentioned the shocking conditions in the Curragh Camp.  When one speaks to PDFORRA and the families affected, one hears of more announcements but a lack of delivery where accommodation difficulties are concerned.  We have seen pictures released on social media showing the really poor conditions in which people must live.  One of the triggers causing people to leave referenced in the Public Service Pay Commission's report is that the threshold of accommodation, certainty and security is not what it was many decades ago.  We need more than just announcements of capital investment.  We need to hear a plan of delivery that will address the accommodation difficulties and the important education issues for the families of those affected.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke specifically about the Curragh Camp.  Over the period from 2016 to 2018, some &euro;17 million was spent on various capital projects and the ongoing maintenance of buildings and facilities at the Defence Forces training centre.  Most notably, this included the refurbishment of blocks B and D in Pearse Barracks, as well as the provision of newly constructed ammunition storage facilities.  As Deputy Heydon will agree, there was a huge lack of investment in the Curragh Camp for many years.  Even though there was an absolutely buoyant economy when Deputy Jack Chambers' party was in government, significant investment was not made in the Curragh Camp.  We are now paying for that.  Between 2016 and 2018, some &euro;17 million has been invested there.</p>  <p>  I note the upgrade to blocks 8 and 9 at the Haulbowline facilities and the construction of a new block in Collins Barracks, which is costing &euro;4.3 million.  As I stated in my original reply, approval to commence a design solution for the new accommodation blocks at Haulbowline is at an advanced stage.</p></speech>

In regard to the post-primary school for the Curragh area, I absolutely accept it must work for the Defence Forces and senior management.  I have spoken to the Curragh Camp's general officer commanding about it.  I believe both can work in harmony.  Another key project that would see huge investment and development at the Curragh is the peace and leadership institute referred to in the White Paper.  It is a key development.  It would highlight and develop all the Defence Forces' key capabilities concerning peacekeeping around the world.  It could be a key centre and bring a huge benefit to the Curragh community, the greater Newbridge community and Kildare because of the activity and visitors it would bring to the area.  This is a key investment in the Curragh area with which we need to proceed.</p>  <p>  I have consistently been in contact with the Minister of State in regard to the Curragh Plains.  We need to get his officials together with those of Kildare County Council.  This has dragged on for too long.  I have written to the Minister of State on this previously.  I ask that he and I arrange a meeting together to examine how we can advance those plans.  Kildare County Council is very open to a partnership approach.  We need to see this happen. </p></speech>

However the cost of rent has risen considerably, as the Minister of State is aware.  Moreover, PDFORRA has said it is sceptical of the Minister of State's announcement.  People would like to see a timeline of construction and delivery to accompany the Minister of State's announcements of new accommodation proposals.  Similarly with the Curragh Camp, we hear a lot about the overall capital sums which the Minister of State and the Department are setting out to spend.  Where is the delivery around education and the broader accommodation remit?  We still do not know exactly what the Minister of State is planning and what he is going to do to address the Victorian conditions there.  When is the delivery planned?  Every few months the Minister seems to announce the same plans over and over, without any follow-through.  We cannot see our Defence Forces personnel left in these Victorian conditions, which act as a trigger in causing personnel to leave year after year.  We need to know when the construction projects the Minister of State has listed will be completed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400025#X00600"><p>I am not really interested in announcements.  I want to get to work on the ground.  That is why between 2016 and 2018, &euro;17 million has been spent on various projects within the Defence Forces training college in the Curragh.  Regarding the Naval Service accommodation, I note that approval to commence design solutions for the refurbishment and upgrade of the accommodation block and the naval base at Haulbowline was issued on 10 July 2019.  The procurement process for the appointment of a design team to develop this project is ongoing.  This project will deliver additional living capacity, on top of the 210 bed spaces already provided at the naval base.  It is intended that works on-site at block 8 will be commenced in 2020.  However, as this is a listed building, planning consent is likely to have a significant impact on costs and delivery.  There is no doubt that renovating old Victorian buildings costs twice as much money.  Is it value for money?  I often ask that question myself.  Renovating a very old building does not provide the same quality as a new build.</p>  <p>  I have penned a tentative date for a meeting between myself, Deputy Heydon and Kildare County Council into my diary.  I acknowledge this is of huge concern to the Deputy, who has raised it with me on numerous occasions.  The Department of Defence has responded to a lot of the Deputy's requests.  We have dedicated people working on the Curragh Plains.  This is a great amenity for the people of Newbridge and the greater Kildare area.  I will come back to the Deputy with a specific date for that meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400025#X01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.</p>  <p>  Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising national finances during the financial crisis, as Deputy Aylward will be very much aware.  Improvements in the economy have provided an opportunity for the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, which imposed pay cuts across the public service during the financial crisis.  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The increases due to date under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1 September 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay scales of all public servants earning less than &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>Pay rates for newly qualified members of the Defence Forces are competitive compared to other areas in the public service and private sector.  For instance, a newly qualified three star private can expect to earn &euro;28,205 gross per annum.  A newly qualified school leaver-entry officer can expect to earn &euro;36,154 gross per annum, inclusive of the military service allowance.  After initial training, a graduate-entry officer can expect to earn &euro;41,193 gross per annum, inclusive of the military service allowance, after initial training.  These are just starting pay rates.  There are additional opportunities to increase pay through annual increments and promotional opportunities.  Basic pay and the military service allowance are just elements of the overall remuneration package available for members of the PDF.  A range of duties attract additional allowances while certain positions in the Defence Forces also attract technical pay.  The overseas peace support allowance is paid tax free to members of the Permanent Defence Force participating in overseas military operations on the direction of the Government. <br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The Defence Forces are experiencing recruitment and retention difficulties particularly in some areas of specialism.  This is reflective of the economic growth experienced under the current Government and the associated buoyant labour market.  We are not unique in this regard.  It is being experienced internationally by armed forces.  At my direction, the Department of Defence brought the particular difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission.  Arising from the first report of the commission in 2017 and the subsequent public service stability agreement, the Government tasked the commission with undertaking a comprehensive examination and analysis of recruitment and retention in the Defence Force.  <br/><br/>There are regular meetings between the Taoiseach, and other Ministers and I have discussed a range of Defence matters with the Taoiseach and Government colleagues.  The report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces was accepted by Government on 4 July 2019.  The report contains a broad range of recommendations that will provide immediate benefits to members of the PDF, as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.  These include a 10% increase in the military service allowance, the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances and the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.  These measures will be implemented swiftly on confirmation of their acceptance by the PDF representative associations. <br/><br/>The Government has prepared a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the commission.  The measures are aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment, retention and conditions of service.  The plan also provides for an examination of core pay in the PDF within the context of the public service stability agreement and future public sector pay negotiations and the completion of a review of technical pay arrangements, concerning grades 2 to 6.  The plan sets out timelines with the objectives to deliver on the commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  This work is, under my direction, being prioritised by civil and military management.</p></speech>

The reality, however, is different.  We all know there is a dearth of recruits; it is impossible to get them.  Ships are tied up, as has been stated.  The Minister of State well knows that what he has set out is spiel and untrue.  Since the recession, almost ten years ago, the Government has fallen behind in looking after the Defence Forces.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State are responsible.  It is time to wake up now and smell the reality.  The Government is hiding behind the pay commission report.  People in the Defence Forces are being left behind.  They have not got fair play and they do not have a union to represent them.</p>  <p>  I come from Kilkenny where there is a military barracks.  Some of the personnel there are receiving the family income supplement, FIS.  Why is that the case if the two minutes of rhetoric the Minster of State just read out is true?  I ask him to be honest and own up to what is happening.  The members of the Defence Forces are not being properly paid and new recruits are not being attracted.  Some 57% of members of the Permanent Defence Force have stated they will leave in the next two years.  For more than 80% of those personnel, pay is the primary consideration in reaching the decision to leave.</p></speech>

I will also repeat myself then.  The reality is that we have to ask why ships are tied up and not at sea.  Why are we not able to fulfil our obligations?  Why are we so far away from our target of 9,500 people in the Defence Forces?  The Minster of State spoke about what happened when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  He is falling back on that.  The turnover in Defence Forces staff at that time was 10%.  That is now up to 85%.  People have been interviewed and stated that they are going to leave within the next couple of years.  That is the reality and that is what he should be talking about, instead of giving us rhetoric about what happened back in 2008.  That is the continual refrain.</p>  <p>  It is his job to oversee the recruitment of people.  I asked him previously about the provision of accommodation.  There was always a tradition in towns with military barracks, such as Kilkenny, that people got housing.  Could that type of provision be considered again?  It might attract some recruits, especially those with families, into the Permanent Defence Force, given the housing crisis.  The Minster of State can give us all the rhetoric he wants and list all of the things he did.  The reality, however, comes back to the fact that there are ships tied up because of a lack of recruits to staff them.</p></speech>

Accommodation is one of the projects included.  We are, however, competing with a strong economy and an economy that recovered under the Fine Gael-led Government from 2011.  We now have almost full employment.  Unemployment stood at almost 15% when the Deputy's party was last in government.  We cannot compare like with like.  We are now competing against a strong jobs market.  There are great opportunities in the private sector for many people.  When I was appointed to this position in 2016, a three-star private was on &euro;21,000.  Under my leadership of the Department that private is now &euro;28,205, which is an increase of &euro;7,000.  There will also be further increases under the public service stability agreement.  The Deputy should take a careful look and consider the scale of those increases.</p></speech>

While the headline percentage price increase appears high, this translates into a modest increase in total expenditure on Lariam in 2018 of &euro;1,399 over the 2017 figure.  Prior to 2017, Lariam was purchased by the Defence Forces under a four-year framework agreement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the HSE.  As the product is no longer covered by the terms of the IPHA-HSE framework agreement, however, there has been a resulting knock-on effect on cost.  This accounts for the increased spend on Lariam in 2018 and to date in 2019. </p><p>As I have outlined to the House on many occasions, the use of anti-malarial drugs is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals.  In the Defence Forces, these are matters for highly qualified medical officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the organisation.  The Deputy will be aware that ongoing litigation regarding this matter is being handled by the State Claims Agency, SCA.  It has advised that it has received 225 claims alleging personal injury as a result of the consumption of Lariam by current and former members of the Defence Forces.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>He will appreciate, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  I assure the House that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me, my Department and the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

I am concerned, however, that the Defence Forces still use Lariam.  That is what baffles me.  Other countries have stopped prescribing this drug and have apologised to the members of their respective defence forces for prescribing it to them in the first place.  Why is Ireland not following suit?  There are concerns regarding Lariam.  I have spoken to personnel who have taken the drug.  I have also spoken to people who have taken the drug and experienced no side effects, but that is no reason its use should fail to be stopped.  My concern is that clear evidence is building up that this drug has caused problems for some personnel.  Lariam should not be used if there is any possibility that it is going to have the adverse effects that it has had on many members of the Defence Forces.  Those have included suicidal tendencies and breakdowns.</p><p>The Minister of State says he is acting on the 2013 recommendation of the working group on the issue but I have never seen those reports so I cannot make a call on them.  Will the Minister of State agree to release those reports at some stage so we can understand why he is adopting the position he is?</p></speech>

The Defence Forces continue to use three antimalarial drugs.  These are Lariam, Malarone and Doxycycline.  The selection by a medical officer of the most appropriate drug for use is complex and dependent on a number of factors.  All of these antimalarial drugs have contraindications and side-effects.  Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces' medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the antimalarial medication.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces to screen personnel individually for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.  Fundamentally, the choice of malarial chemoprophylaxis for use in the Defence Forces is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals.  In the Defence Forces these are decisions for highly qualified medical officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00400"><p>I want to raise again the issue of access to primary school places in Rathcoole, County Dublin.  This is an issue Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin and I raised in the House prior to the summer recess.  Unfortunately, our concerns have come to pass, in that children in Rathcoole have been unable to secure primary school places there.  To put things into context, in February last year the principal of one of the local primary schools wrote to the Department.  He stated:</p><blockquote>Our school is the only English medium school in the village.  There is also a Gaelscoil situated here.  The Department of Education has signalled that there will be a school open in the Rathcoole/Newcastle/Saggart area in 2020.  However, this seems highly unlikely to occur in such a short time-frame.<br /><br />Most of our classes are full at 31 pupils per class.  We have waiting lists for most streams.  There is an increasing number of housing developments under construction and planned for construction.  This will bring much increased demand for places.<br /><br />Families have moved into houses in our village only to discover that our school cannot accommodate them.  Some families are travelling significant distances to other schools as a result.  We also have a situation whereby some families have one or more child enrolled with us and another child enrolled elsewhere, as there is no space available for the other child.<br /><br />Our Board of Management has had to engage with the Section 29 process of the Education Act on many occasions, where an appeal was taken by families as a result of our refusal to enrol.  At a recent Section 29 Hearing in the Department of Education, Marlborough St., the chairperson of the Section 29 Hearing Committee requested that we inform you of the existing pressure and further expected pressure for school places in Rathcoole.<br /><br />We are currently processing next year's Junior Infant classes.  [That was for September of this year.]  There have been 117 applications from the local community alone this year: 93 places will be offered.</blockquote><p>We highlighted all of this earlier in the year.  When places were offered, a number of parents were on a waiting list and they came to us.  We brought it to the floor of the D&aacute;il and debated it.  The summer has come and gone and children have gone back to school.  A significant number of them have been unable to gain access to one of the two local schools in Rathcoole, namely, the Gaelscoil and the national school.  Some of those children have gone elsewhere but some of them have gone back to preschool.  It is not in their best interests from a developmental point of view that they are not going to primary school when they are of an appropriate age to do so.  It is not happening.</p><p>The Minister has previously issued a reply stating that in 2020 there will be a new school.  I have said it before, and I want to emphasise it now, that the new school proposed is not in Rathcoole.  It is in Fortunestown.  The Minister identified it in a previous reply.  It will not address the need that exists today.  Little has happened from the Department's point of view to reassess the demand for primary school places in Rathcoole, where new houses are being built and planned and there is a shortage of places today.  The children of today, and not the future, have failed to access one of their own local primary schools.  I appeal to the Minister to reassess the school capacity issue in the Rathcoole area for this year and next year and in the longer term as the housing development continues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the Department's position on primary school places in the Rathcoole area.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, providing a new school or schools, or a combination of these.</p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018, is important legislation that will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, including a new eight-classroom school to be established in September 2020 to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area.  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  I recently announced that five of the new primary schools being established between 2020 and 2022 are being designated for Irish-medium education, including the new eight-classroom primary school to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area.  The new school will be located in the Saggart and Citywest area.  It is adjacent to the Tallaght school planning area in which there is no Gaelscoil.</p>  <p>  The Department is conscious that Rathcoole is an area of growing demographic demand and additional residential development, and the Department is actively reviewing the potential need to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole.</p>  <p>  In respect of meeting current demand for primary school places, the Department approved additional temporary accommodation for Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in primary school in 2018 and 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400027#Z00600"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  This is not sarcastic but I had received most of the reply previously and I was aware of it.  To take the final paragraph first, the Minister said that in respect of meeting current demand for primary school places, the Department approved additional temporary accommodation.  I acknowledge this.  I am saying that despite this a significant number of people are failing to get a school place in Rathcoole.  I acknowledge the steps taken by the Minister but having taken those steps children in Rathcoole are failing to get a school place.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said what he said previously, that there would be a new school in the Saggart and Citywest area, which will be in Fortunestown.  I acknowledge this but it will be of little benefit to people living in Rathcoole.  By the time it is built housing developments in the Citywest area will, by and large, fill it.  These are not solutions.</p><p>This is a problem not of the future but of today.  Children and parents in Rathcoole are not accessing them.  If families living in Rathcoole want to have their children educated in Rathcoole, they should not have to bring them to adjacent towns or villages; there should be a place for them.  It is not just from the point of view of the parents, but the friends those children will make and go through life with and the various sporting bodies they will join.  It is part of their community.  They should be able to access a place in their own community.</p> <p> The Minister gave a bit of hope when he said, "My Department is conscious that Rathcoole is an area of growing demographic demand and additional residential development and my Department is actively reviewing the potential need to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole."  He has missed the boat; it is already needed.  It is not for the future that it is needed.  The Minister listened when I read the letter from the principal into the record.  When families move into the Rathcoole area, they are not just trying to access junior infants classes; they are coming with children of different ages.  It is virtually impossible to get a child of any age into the school.  I urge the Minister and his officials to review the capacity in Rathcoole and not to come back and say the Fortunestown school in the Saggart and City West area is the solution because it is not.  There is a deficit today and the Minister's plan for the future does not address the deficit it needs to address. </p></speech>

I also appreciate the intensity of development in different parts of the country and obviously in the Newcastle, Saggart and Rathcoole area.  That is a school planning area.  I deliberately separated out Rathcoole in my second last paragraph.</p></speech>

We are reviewing the potential to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole.  That means collecting as much data as possible from planning permissions for future developments as well as for ongoing developments.  I know he is not talking about the future but about the here and now.  He is saying there is a need today with children travelling to different places.  The data from the principals of the two existing schools on the parents who tried unsuccessfully to get children into school in September will be very helpful.  Those data will be collated.  We will look at planning permissions.  We will look at existing demographics.  It is a very young population, as the Deputy outlined previously.  When I said we are reviewing it, I do not mean we are looking at it as a way of letting him that things will be grand and we will get on with what is in place.  We are serious about areas like this.  If there is demand in a particular area, we will give it serious consideration.</p>  <p>  This is the second time I have discussed this issue in the House.  I know I may have put on the record information I have given previously.  It is important to disseminate that information publicly.  A unit in the Department proactively examines future population projection and we will give it serious consideration.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for his attendance to discuss the delay in delivering the Holy Family national school in Mullingar.  This is the third time I have raised this issue in the House.  I have tabled dozens of parliamentary questions and attended numerous meetings going as far back as 2008.  This week we were given a revised completion date for the ninth time.  That school remains 82% complete on a site that is under-resourced.  Subcontractors are walking off the site and windows are being removed.  We have all this uncertainty and we are no further along.  It is infuriating for staff, parents and everyone involved in the school.</p>  <p>  There are 30 staff and 332 pupils from 276 families in a building constructed as a two-teacher school in 1942 with no ancillary services.  That is what we are presiding over now in the 21st century.  The staff are operating over three campuses: St. Loman's; the 1942 school; and St. Etchen's in Kinnegad.  The 42 children just enrolled are spread over those three sites.  Some of the most vulnerable children need early intervention and need a social setting that is secure and certain.  We need clarity and certainty as to when the school can be delivered and whether the current contractor has the capacity to deliver the school.  This cannot continue any longer.</p>  <p>  We have had nine completion dates.  The parish will carry out its 2020 enrolment for new students in January.  The principal and staff will be asked to take on more students despite the situation that currently pertains.</p>  <p>  There is one common denominator.  I have seen replies to parliamentary questions about schools elsewhere in the country involving this contractor.  There are persistent issues and he is consistently late.  Many people have criticised the local authority.  The local authority is not involved in the service delivery or project management of those other sites.  There is a common denominator here.</p>  <p>  The Minister needs to do everything he can.  I acknowledge he has been exceptionally helpful.  He visited the site and is trying to do everything in his power.  We need to get a certain date that will be adhered to.  If capacity is not there or for some other reason that date cannot be met, action needs to be taken.  I know there is criticism in the community that this action should have been taken given that we have received nine different completion dates.  The staff and principal in the school are unsung heroes and deserve a medal.  The parents are experiencing manifest frustration.  They have no certainty over the completion date, just a site that is 82% complete.</p></speech>

The House will recall that there have been significant delays in the delivery of this project.  These delays arose initially because of unforeseen ground conditions and other similar issues that can arise on any building project.  However, in recent months, I have been disappointed that progress on site has been extremely slow and we are still not entirely clear as to why this has been the case.  The most recent programme provided by the contractor for this project indicated a completion date of late October.  There was an initial acceleration of activity on site at the time this programme was provided.  However, I regret having to report to the House that neither the Department nor Westmeath County Council, to which the project has been devolved for delivery, is satisfied with how these works have progressed in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The House will be aware that a number of matters have been raised through the dispute resolution mechanisms of the public works contract in respect of this project, as would normally happen in major building projects.  The resolution of these issues is now at a critical juncture.  A meeting will take place later this week in that respect.  This meeting will be attended by officials from Westmeath County Council, supported by its design team.  Officials from my Department will also be in attendance.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the proactivity of Westmeath County Council and the design team in trying to move this forward.</p>  <p>  Given this, I cannot get into detail on the matters that are the subject of this conciliation process except to say, in broad terms, that they are technical issues and the issue of delays.  A revised programme is also being sought in that context and we also expect to get greater clarity on why the project has been so significantly delayed.  I hope that these and all outstanding matters can be addressed through this process.  I also hope that it will provide an outcome that we can be satisfied with.  Such an outcome will be confidential.  However, I hope that in finding a resolution to all these matters, there can then be no reason for the project not to move forward at pace.</p><p>It is of the greatest concern to me that the pupils, staff and school community of Holy Family national school are not yet <i>in situ</i>in a school which was initially scheduled for completion in September 2018.  However, I am thankful to the patron and school management of both Holy Family national school and St. Etchen's in Kinnegad who have gone out of their way to arrange for the provision of temporary school accommodation for the special needs pupils impacted on by the delays.  We are also thankful to St. Loman's GAA Club for its assistance in providing extra classroom space for the pupils of Holy Family national school.  It is hugely disappointing that it has been necessary to activate these contingency arrangements, but we remain hopeful they will only be needed for a short while.<br/><br/>Until then Westmeath County Council will continue to keep the school authority and patron body fully informed of progress on site.  At the same time, officials from my Department will continue to liaise with the patron of Holy Family national school on contingency arrangements should the project be delayed further.  I sincerely hope we will be in a position in the coming days to provide the Holy Family school authority with some further clarification on progress on site.  More particularly, we hope progress from now on will be to everyone's satisfaction.  I do enter a caveat because I have already stood in front of the Deputy when he raised this issue and outlined a timeframe.  I understand the intensity of feeling in his community is palpable and has moved beyond frustration.  I appeal to the contractor to meet the challenge head on.  There are contractual obligations that I am not going to get into.  I appeal at a human level to the people delivering the project to for one second feel the frustration and anger felt at so many false dawns in its delivery.  <br/><br/>I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  Not a week goes without him being on to me about it.</p></speech>

I note that a meeting is due to take place on Friday.  We need absolute clarity at that meeting.  This project cannot endure a further revised programme of works that the contractor will be unable to meet.  Perhaps a hard decision has to be taken, but it has to be taken on Friday if we do not have certainty.  I have read the long list of dates by which the school was to have been completed.  They include September 2015, 2016 and 2018, October 2018, December 2018, and April, June and July 2019.  This week we were told it would be signed off on in October and that in November students would move in.  It is galling to drive by the site in the 21st century and see it being under-resourced.  I drive by it every day and know that since the contractor signed the contract that it has been under-resourced.  Even when blocks were being laid, there were not enough people available.  There would not have been enough to build a 2,000 ft2 building on the site.  That is why we are more than two and half years down the road since the contractor moved onto the site.  It was to be a one-year, template-build model.  My top political priority is to have the school delivered.  I appeal to the Minister and his office to use every power available to them.  Perhaps there is a global issue with procurement law that we need to consider.  If a contractor is consistently behind and not meeting specified targets in the contract, he or she should not in any way be allowed to apply for other public contracts.  We saw this happen recently when the HSE hired a contractor who had run into difficulties in delivering other contracts.  We need a traffic light system ingrained in procurement law such that contractors can be excluded based on past performance and that if a procurement team excludes them, it will not lead to a court case.</p></speech>

There should be a degree of honesty and cards put on the table because the community deserves nothing less than to find out whether it is happening.  I will not say anything more about what may happen after the meeting.  So many good groups and people are working on the project.  I met them on site when the Deputy invited me to visit it.  They all want the project to happen, but we live in the real world too and perhaps there are reasons it is not happening.  However, honesty is required.  I am making a personal appeal to the contractor to meet the community head-on for the first time and be as honest as possible.  There have been too many false dawns and expectations have been heightened.  It is an issue for the entire constituency and other Deputies have raised the issue here.  I thank Deputy Peter Burke for keeping it alive.  Let us see what happens on Friday and I hope that, with a degree of honesty, we will make progress.</p></speech>

They concern Cobh Community Hospital and Castlemartyr Health Centre.  On 27 August members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, contacted me to inform me that the hospital was in dire need of additional funding and that its budget would run out in five weeks.  That was six weeks ago today.  I have been in contact with the office of the Minister for Health, but the only update I have received since is that the hospital is financially viable.  However, there are no guarantees about this.  The INMO has contacted me again because it is very worried.  We have spoken here many times about primary care services and investing in local services.  We are talking about a 44-bed residential unit.  If it were to close, it would be devastating for service users, their families and everyone else, including the staff.  There are an additional 15 staff employed.</p>  <p>  The hospital is community owned by a trust.  I have been told that the HSE has been chipping away at it and reducing funding year in, year out and that it is starting to struggle.  Only a few weeks ago Liverpool Football Club and Cobh Ramblers played a game in Cobh.  All of the moneys raised went to the community hospital.  We have often said investing in the community and taking ownership is the best model of care.  What is the position at Cobh Community Hospital?  If it does close, where will all of the residents go?  </p>  <p>  We were told some weeks ago that Castlemartyr Health Centre would also close.  Youghal is on the edge of the Cork East constituency.  The centre covers Youghal, Killeagh, Castlemartyr, Midleton and Carrigtwohill.  I was told two weeks ago that it would be relocated to Midleton, which is six miles away.  I have now been informed that it will be relocated to Carrigtwohill.  A centre that is working well will be closed and everything moved.  It will involve a 30 km round trip.  Most of the people affected are elderly and disabled and do not drive.  I have tabled several parliamentary questions to a number of Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because there is also a problem with public transport services on the Waterford-Cork route.  A person would be very lucky to get on the service in Killeagh.  Patients who need to attend the health centre in Castlemartyr may not get on the bus in Youghal.</p>  <p>  There was a &euro;300,000 fund and planning permission was granted for an extension to the centre and other associated works such as the provision of wheelchair ramps.</p><p>Now we have learned that somebody within the HSE has made the decision not to do it.  I also asked whether more public health nurses will be assigned to cover the area, which is a large one.  In Youghal, one cannot reach a doctor after 6 p.m.  If one needs<b></b>to access SouthDoc, one needs to travel to Fermoy or Midleton, and the primary care centres will soon be closed.  All of east Cork, from Youghal to Castlemartyr, will be left with nothing.  Why does the HSE not invest in primary care and care for those who need it most?</p></speech>

There are patients in genuine need of residential care, whether on a long-stay or short-stay basis, and their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  </p>  <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, provides financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants in the scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  The budget for the NHSS in 2019 is &euro;985 million and more than 23,000 clients on average at any one time will access long-term residential care through the scheme. </p>  <p>  Cobh Community Hospital is an independent facility providing residential care services for older people in Cobh and the surrounding area.  The majority of the funding for Cobh Community Hospital comes under the NHSS for long-term residential care.  The hospital also provides other services to older people in Cobh and the surrounding communities, including short-stay and respite care.  Some 44 beds in Cobh Community Hospital provide long-term residential care for up to 41 people and short-stay respite care to a further three people.  The HSE, through Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, provides funding for the short-stay beds, as well as funding for some of the long-term residential care beds.  </p>  <p>  The voluntary and not-for-profit sector has a long tradition of providing care to older people in Ireland through nursing homes such as Cobh Community Hospital.  This provision of care complements that delivered directly by the HSE and ensures that older people in our communities have a greater choice of long-term residential care, allowing them to stay closer to their communities, should they so choose.  The HSE has engaged with the hospital board in respect of funding and the future provision of care in the hospital, and is continuing to provide support to the board on the issue.  Based on its engagement with the Cobh Community Hospital board, the HSE is confident the facility is financially viable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has engaged with the senior management of the HSE on the matter and is confident a resolution can be found.  He acknowledges the significant role of private and voluntary providers in residential care provision and hopes the engagement between the HSE and the Cobh Community Hospital board will ensure the continued financial viability of the hospital. </p>  <p>  I do not have a response to the question on the Castlemartyr community health centre but I will follow up on the matter.  I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and revert to the Deputy with details.</p></speech>

If he was to cut the sentence that followed and insert his own, he might say: "There is a possibility we will close a 44-bed unit in Cobh and remove a community care service from the community in Castlemartyr that services Ballycotton, Cloyne, Castlemartyr, Ladysbridge, Garryvoe, Killeagh, Inch and Youghal."  One could go on and on because it is a large demographic area.  The response was a pure contradiction.  I do not mean that as an attack on the Minister of State but rather wish to put it on the record.  If the decision is supposed to promote "confidence, security and dignity" in communities, it is a farce.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the NHSS and stated: "Participants in the scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost."  It is great that the State pays the balance of the cost but it is not State money; it is taxpayers' money.  The Minister of State described it as Government funding but it is taxpayers' money.  The people pay for their own care.  Let us try to keep the discussion clean and factual.</p>  <p>  I welcome the engagement with the HSE and the hospital board, and I hope it grows.  I heard that the hospital was financially viable but my worry is that is like saying one can cash the thanks inside in the bank; but what bank does one use to cash the thanks?  If there is not a good guarantee, there will be serious consequences.</p>  <p>  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on 12 September.  While I understand the position of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, I am disappointed with the HSE and whoever is responsible for having kept the matter quiet and closing the vital service in Castlemartyr, east County Cork.  It affects everybody all the way to Cobh.  We have spoken about primary care and community care but we should invest in a primary care centre in Youghal while keeping those in Castlemartyr, Midleton, Cobh and Carrigtwohill.</p></speech>

I accept they provide a range of services for older people in the community and the surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  I return to the core issue of the debate.  The Government's core stated objective is to promote care in the community in order that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their homes and communities for as long as possible, which is what older people and all Deputies want.  There are patients in genuine need of residential care, whether on a long-stay or short-stay basis, and their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  The HSE fully acknowledges, as do I, that the community hospital provides and will continue to provide important services to the people of Cobh and the surrounding communities.  Furthermore, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has engaged with the senior management of the HSE on the matter and is confident a resolution can be found.  I am optimistic about him doing so.</p>  <p>  I trust that the Deputy will agree we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided for residents in a safe and secure environment, while providing high quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.  I accept all the Deputy's concerns about Castlemartyr and will convey them to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.</p>  <p>  On a lighter note, I commend what the Deputy stated about Cobh Ramblers, an excellent club of which I am well aware, for its contribution to the hospital following a game.  On what was probably a sadder note for the Deputy, my local club, Shelbourne FC, recently signed two players from Cobh Ramblers and thanks to them, managed to win the first division league.</p></speech>

In general, much needed new homes are very welcome but, astonishingly, in this case 1,130 of the proposed apartments are intended to be build-to-rent.  In the housing area in question, up to 9,000 individuals and families are waiting for accommodation on Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council housing lists.  A remarkable feature of the application is that approximately one quarter of it has been sent to Dublin City Council, with the rest sent directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  The applications are the latest in a litany of such applications for the north-south fringe over the past 20 years.  It was more than 20 years ago that high density proposals for the north fringe were first mooted and a few days before Christmas of 1999, in true developer style, a plan for a massive development of the north fringe district was lodged with Dublin City Council. </p><p>Eventually, the Dublin City Council planning department managed to produce a north fringe framework development plan in 2000 for an initial major new urban district of up to 8,000 homes stretching across Belmayne and Clongriffin in Dublin city to the coast and the south Portmarnock district of Fingal.  Development of the region has been stop-start and highly erratic, with the failure of the two planning authorities, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, to work closely and developers like Gannon Homes, Stanley Holdings and Helsingor to deliver sustainably much-heralded infrastructure, including public transport, schools, health centres, childcare facilities, community and amenity spaces, shops and a Garda station.  It took nearly ten years to build and open Clongriffin DART station and even longer for the first two primary schools for the burgeoning population of the area.  Clongriffin town centre is still waiting for a supermarket and other much-needed commercial and professional services.  At the western end of the new main street of the district in 2006, Stanley Holdings pulled out of a section 183 agreement with Dublin City Council for the long-promised Belmayne and Clare Hall town centre.<br/><br/>As the Minister remembers, the north and south fringe was also bedevilled with problems of pyrite contamination and insulation difficulties and it took years for the successful remediation of affected structures to be effected down to 2015.  The taxpayer and Dublin City Council ended up bearing the &euro;40 million net cost of totally rebuilding Priory Hall, which straddles the central section of the main boulevard of the north fringe.  Since the crash, the north and south fringe has seen large tracts of derelict lands being hoarded by developers and constituents fear it could take another ten years to build out the region and provide the critical services we desperately need.<br/><br/>Given the above history, I would like the support of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to call on the planning regulator to carry out a review of all aspects of the planning of the north and south fringe and examine the history of this development and other urban regions in Ireland and exemplars abroad.  We have seen exemplars in countries like Sweden of similar size but built with all essential services each step of the way.  Unfortunately, that has not happened with the north and south fringe.  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, which passed through the House not too long ago, the new Office of the Planning Regulator can review the performance of the functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities such as Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  The regulator is also tasked by the same section in the Act to oversee the delivery of effective planning services to the public by planning authorities and to conduct research for the Minister.  The north and south fringe is a very striking example of why developer-led planning is really bad for our new urban districts.  As the distinguished journalist, Mr. Gene Kerrigan, of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>stated, it is why &quot;housing is too important to be left to developers.&quot;.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the final report of the Mahon tribunal recommended the establishment of an independent planning regulator and legislation for such a regulator was in train for a number of years.  The Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, was established in April 2019 under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  The OPR is responsible for the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly forward planning, including development plans, local area plans, regional spatial and economic strategies etc.  It will provide statutory observations during the drafting of statutory plans.  In cases where the OPR finds that a local authority's plans are ultimately not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, including the provisions of the national planning framework, the OPR will recommend the use of ministerial powers to bring plans back in line with statutory requirements and best practice.</p>  <p>  The OPR is also empowered to review the organisation, systems and procedures used by any planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of any of the planning functions under the planning Acts, including assessing risks of maladministration or corruption.  The OPR can initiate such reviews at its own behest, at the request of the Minister or on foot of complaints or submissions from members of the public.  In performing its functions, the OPR will take into account the objective of contributing to proper planning and sustainable development and the optimal function of planning under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has outlined, the north Dublin and south Fingal fringe straddles two local authorities, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly has adopted a regional spatial and economic strategy, which will be implemented by way of a review, or variation, by local authorities of all relevant development plans.  Given the timing of the county development plans in Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, I understand they are proposing to vary their development plans to take account of the regional strategy.  In this regard, they have up to 26 weeks from the date of adoption of the strategy to initiate such a variation, which is up to early January 2020.  Any variation of county development plans will be considered by the OPR in line with its functions under the planning Acts.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is the function of a planning authority to plan for its own administrative area in accordance with national planning policies and guidance.  In this regard, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council have adopted particular plans for this general location, and some were mentioned by the Deputy.  These plans were adopted by the elected members of the relevant local authorities in accordance with the requirements set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Moreover, development plans are statutorily reviewed every six years.  I cannot prejudge the contents of a future development plan but in view of the strategic nature of these lands to the orderly development of Dublin, I expect that the relevant development plans would consider the appropriate future development of this area.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, many times over the past two decades I asked successive Ministers responsible for environmental matters and taoisigh to make an order to declare the north and south fringe a strategic development zone to ensure some basic level of consultation with residents and citizens of Dublin Bay North.  I specifically remember doing so with a former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, and a former Minister, Mr. John Gormley.  On my own proposal as a Dublin city councillor in 2005, then city manager Mr. John Fitzgerald finally established the north fringe forum, which has generally met quarterly since.  It lacks the statutory powers of a strategic development zone to enforce stakeholder and developer engagement.  I believe that as part of his review of planning in the north and south fringe, the planning regulator should also examine why the north and south fringe never received strategic development zone status.  What was the reason for it?</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my earlier speech, homes are desperately needed in Dublin Bay North, where approximately 7,000 households are waiting to be rehoused on the Dublin City Council side and up to 2,000 are waiting across the DART line in the Howth and Malahide housing area of Fingal County Council.  In the Part V documents for the major plan that has now gone in, fewer than 200 apartments are to be allocated for social housing.  Astonishingly, no fewer than 678 units of 1,030 apartments in the strategic housing development section 1 are build-to-rent units, and 1,130 apartments in the whole development are build-to-rent units.  What is the plan in this regard?</p>  <p>  The Downey planning reports for Gannon Properties list 26 major planning applications and a remarkable 126 applications, mostly made from Gannon companies, for the Clongriffin district of the north fringe since the turn of the century.  Many of these applications were never followed through to construction, of course, and there is still extant planning permission for several areas of the current planning applications.  That is why even a decade ago I called on Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to establish a clear five-to-seven year planning and construction timetable so that the urgently required infrastructure could be built.  The blizzard of unbuilt projects with planning permission, the history of land hoarding and the failure to provide essential social and commercial services for a district that is expected to have an ultimate population of more than 50,000 should now be examined in what might be the first major and urgent review by the new planning regulator.</p></speech>

One of the key points at the centre of its establishment was its independence from the Department and politics.  It is the result of the planning tribunal report.</p></speech>

I will speak to the Minister and, as the Deputy noted in his opening comments, there is a balance to be struck.  We want the office to be completely independent but it does allow for research.  I looked at a map of the area in question and it is large.  The Deputy has represented it for years and it has the potential to change utterly the landscape out there.  It could provide sustainable homes and communities for thousands of people.</p><p>I will discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I reiterate that it is open to individual local authorities, members of the public or community groups to request that the Office of the Planning Regulator carry out the work to which the Deputy refers.  The regulator was famously independent in his previous role in the Custom House.  I am sure that he and those working with him will ensure that legitimate issues raised by individuals or communities will be thoroughly examined without fear or favour.  We wish to ensure that the office is completely removed from the world of politics.  I will discuss the issue of research with the Minister.  I encourage the Deputy and the community representatives to apply directly to the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p></speech>

The second Part provides amendments to the legislation governing the Tax Appeals Commission, primarily to implement recommendations of an independent review carried out in 2018.  The third Part relates to the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations via an amendment to Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  On Part 2, I will provide Deputies with some background information on the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, and the independent review of 2018.  The commission was established on 21 March 2016 under the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 and took over from the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  It was established as an independent body having its own Vote and Accounting Officer with a view to providing increased transparency and an enhanced appeals mechanism for taxpayers.  Since its establishment, staffing at the commission has increased from two commissioners and four administrative staff to five commissioners and 22 administrative staff at various grades as of the end of September 2019.  However, a number of factors have contributed to the development of a backlog of appeals, including the facts that the commission inherited a substantial number of legacy appeals and that the process for appeals changed on the establishment of the commission, resulting in appeals now being notified to the commission in the first instance rather than to Revenue.</p>  <p>  On foot of the growing backlog and requests for significant additional resources, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the TAC in 2018.  The review, which examined the governance structures, workload and operations of the commission, was conducted by Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, a former Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The resulting report was published on budget day in October 2018.  The Minister has expressed his full support for the recommendations and work on implementation is ongoing within the Department and the commission.</p>  <p>  There has been a near doubling of the commission's budget to accommodate the recommended staff increases and improvements to computer systems and equipment.  Following a competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service, the Minister authorised the appointment of three additional temporary appeal commissioners, two of whom will take up their appointments this month.  The recommended additional administrative and technical posts were sanctioned and recruitment by the commission for these posts is nearing completion.  There is enhanced regular contact between the commission and the Department on governance matters and corporate supports.  An administrative working group meets regularly to address issues arising between the commissioners and Revenue in the administration of appeals.</p>  <p>  The Bill will enable the progression of another key recommendation of the review carried out by Ms O'Donoghue, namely, the appointment of a chairperson of the TAC.  Amendments to the legislation governing the commission are required to establish the role and responsibilities of the chairperson and thus allow for his or her recruitment.  Section 5 provides for the appointment of a chairperson and specifies his or her functions.  The Bill provides that the chairperson, who will also be an appeal commissioner, will be responsible for ensuring the efficient operation of the commission and accountable to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  It is envisaged that the establishment of a commission chairperson will strengthen the body's governance and accountability while bringing its structure in line with those of similar bodies.  This section also provides for the resignation or removal from office of the chairperson.</p>  <p>  Section 8 provides that a commissioner's term of appointment shall not exceed 14 years.</p>  <p>  Section 11 provides for the allocation of responsibility for the issuing of reports under section 21 of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 to the chairperson.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also clarify some aspects of the existing appeals legislation to facilitate the appeals process.  Section 12 amends provisions relating to appeals against determinations alleged to be erroneous on a point of law.  The amendment clarifies that a party dissatisfied with a determination must clearly state the respect in which the determination is alleged to be erroneous on a point of law, in addition to stating dissatisfaction with the determination.</p>  <p>  Section 13 provides for amendments to requirements in respect of the presentation of documents for inclusion in a case stated to the High Court.  This amendment clarifies the requirements for appellants and commissioners with regard to the case stated process under which an appellant may appeal a decision of the commission to the High Court.  It is anticipated that this amendment will increase case management efficiency.</p>  <p>  Section 4 will remove any ambiguity as to the ability of the commission to enter into contract, thereby guaranteeing its independence.</p>  <p>  The third Part of the legislation will amend Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014 as part of the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations directive.  Ireland's prospectus framework is implemented into domestic legislation through statutory instrument and Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.  The Bill provides for amendments to Part 23, which are necessary to complete the transposition into Irish law of EU Regulation No. 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market.  The regulation entered into force on 21 July 2019 and repealed the 2003 prospectus directive.  Although the majority of the regulation is directly effective, certain provisions had to be transposed into Irish law through the European Union (Prospectus) Regulations 2019, contained in Sl 380/2019, which were enacted on 19 July 2019.</p>  <p>  The EU regulation harmonises the requirements for the drawing up, approval and distribution of the prospectus that must be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market.  It aims to help companies, particularly small and medium enterprises, SMEs, access more diverse sources of finance by simplifying the rules applying to prospectus documents while maintaining appropriate investor protections.  The regulation aims to reduce the overall cost and administrative burden for companies that are required to issue a prospectus, while enabling investors to make informed investment decisions on the basis of the information provided being accurate, comprehensible, concise and easy to analyse.  It was originally intended that the required changes to Ireland's prospectus framework would be made through a consolidated secondary instrument.  However, on the basis of legal advice it was deemed necessary to make some amendments through primary legislation.</p><p>The amendments to Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014 provided for in the Bill are mainly technical in nature.</p> <p> Section 15 updates the relevant legal references to refer to the 2017 EU regulation and its associated delegated Acts, and to update the definition of "local offer" to reflect the increase in threshold to &euro;8 million.  The threshold exempting securities offerings from the requirement to issue a prospectus is being increased from the current &euro;5 million limit to &euro;8 million, as provided for in the 2017 EU regulation.  Once this change is made, SMEs making securities offerings up to &euro;8 million can submit a local offer filing to the Companies Registration Office instead of having to issue a full prospectus.  This allows SMEs to more easily access capital market funding as an alternative to relying on bank financing.</p> <p> Section 17 transposes the provisions contained in Article 11 of the EU regulation restricting the civil liability of certain persons involved in issue of the prospectus unless the prospectus is deemed to be deliberately misleading, inaccurate or omits key information.</p> <p> Given the increased local offer threshold, and following consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, section 21 provides for additional disclosure requirements to be inserted into the local offer regime to improve the investor protections currently in place in section 1361 of the Act.  These requirements are related to the filing that must be made with the Companies Registration Office and serve to enhance the protection of investors that wish to participate in local offers.</p> <p> Section 25 provides for transitional measures from the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations 2005 to the European Union (Prospectus) Regulations 2019.</p> <p> I wish to indicate to the House that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, may need to bring forward a technical amendment on Committee Stage.  The Department is consulting with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this point and I look forward to discussing this important legislation further with the committee.</p></speech>

On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I welcome the Bill.  For some time, we have highlighted the very significant issues arising in the Tax Appeals Commission, not least the lengthy backlog in the number of cases before it.  The commission has only been in existence since 2016, having replaced an earlier entity, and it inherited a significant number of cases.  From responses to parliamentary questions that we submitted, I understand that as of the end of June 2019, the commission has under its remit approximately 3,543 active appeals.  I do not know if that figure has changed much since June but it is a very large number.  The problem has been growing in recent times.  I sincerely hope that the measures that have been implemented and which are about to be implemented will make a positive difference as having an efficient appeals system is an integral part of any tax system.  Our system has not been efficient to date.  This has caused reputational damage and has resulted in certain cases languishing within the system for a long number of years.  This is not good enough.</p>  <p>  The figures we have been provided through parliamentary answers and in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service briefing note on the Bill show that in 2016, more that 2,300 appeals were received and 200 were closed.  In 2017, more than 1,700 appeals were received and fewer than 700 were closed, while in 2018, almost 1,700 were received and more 1,400 were closed.  Although that was an improvement, the number which came in was still larger than the number which were closed.  In 2019, the figures up to the end of June show that 672 were received and 580 files were closed.  The gap is narrowing and the number of files being closed is approaching the number coming in but the backlog has not been addressed.  That is why we welcomed the independent review, the O'Donoghue report to which the Minister of State referred, which made important recommendations on governance, independence, corporate supports, IT services, additional resources including at commissioner level - and I welcome the progress on that - as well as the recruitment of staff and the recommendation that the Public Appointments Service should be engaged with by the Tax Appeals Commission.  It made proposals for dealing with backlogs and on process improvements, as well as recommendations about legislation to help the appeal commissioners, the staff working at the Tax Appeals Commission, to address the backlog.  The last budget provided just under &euro;3 million to implement the recommendations in the O'Donoghue report.  We sought that and welcomed it and now the issue is about delivery.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State provided an update on some of those key recommendations in his opening remarks.  The Minister has authorised the appointment of three additional temporary appeal commissioners, two of whom will take up their appointments this month.  That is a very welcome development.  Additional administrative and technical posts were sanctioned and recruitment is nearing completion.  Hopefully, within a short time, we will see the lack of resources in staffing being addressed.  There was a shortage of resources compared with the volume of cases that came before the appeals commission, as well as the complexity of the cases.  We welcome this.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support any measure that helps to further address the backlog and make the appeals commission even more efficient.  </p>  <p>  As the Minister of State noted, the appointment of a chairperson on a statutory basis was an important recommendation.  That is now being given effect in this legislation, which lays out the role of the chairperson.  That is an important and necessary reform.  I also welcome the administration working group meeting regularly on the issues arising between the commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners on the administration of appeals.  If we are being honest about it, issues have arisen between the Revenue Commissioners and the appeals commissioners on the process, where issues should be dealt with, whether the Revenue Commissioners were dealing in an open and transparent way, upfront, with matters that were brought to their attention or complaints that were brought to them and which might not have had to go as far as the appeals process.  It is important that this is dealt with and that there is now regular contact between the commission and the Department of Fiance on governance and corporate supports.  There had been a communications deficit between the appeal commission and the Department of Finance, so I welcome progress on that front.  </p>  <p>  I wish to raise a related issue, namely, the number of amended assessments which have been issued by the Revenue Commissioners recently.  It has led to some concern about certainty and consistency.  I am sure that in each case, Revenue could outline new information that came to its attention, changing interpretation of facts and perhaps of tax law.  However I will outline the numbers.  Revenue issued 337 amended assessments in 2015.  It increased in the next year to 458 and in 2017 it was 664 and in 2018, it increased to 915.  The number of reassessments made by Revenue has been growing significantly, resulting in a substantial increase in the liability from amending the assessment.  There was one case in particular that accounts for a substantial chunk of that but there is a trend.  I do not know what the explanation for that is but it is important that the reason the number of reassessments issued by Revenue has almost trebled over four years be examined. </p><p>I accept that can happen for a variety of reasons, including because of additional disclosures by the taxpayers concerned, because of the outcome of a Revenue audit, because of another compliance intervention or because of a previous expression of doubt in a tax return.  These matters are laid out in a reply I received in the summer to a parliamentary question, but it is worth highlighting the issue on the floor of the House because it has been a marked trend that has emerged in recent times.</p> <p> I turn to the other key aspect of the Bill which is completely unrelated, namely, the transposition of the prospectus regulation.  As a party, we have no issue with it and support it.  It will amend section 23 of the Companies Act 2014 as part of the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations directive.  It is an important step.  The key issue that is worth noting is that there is an updating of the definition of a local offer to reflect the increase in the threshold to &euro;8 million from &euro;5 million.  That will mean that some small and medium enterprises, SMEs, making securities offerings up to the &euro;8 million can submit a local offer filing to the Companies Registration Office, instead of having to issue a full prospectus.  The Minister of State has made the point that it may mean that these SMEs will be able to access capital market funding in the future more easily as an alternative to relying on bank financing.  That will be welcome if it broadens the potential sources of funding they can access without having to adhere to the strict requirements of a formal prospectus offering which, rightly, is heavily regulated.  The regulation is being updated as a result of the transposition of these EU regulations.</p> <p> We look forward to examining the Bill in a detailed manner on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State has made reference to the Minister bringing forward what he says is a technical amendment which we will examine when it is brought forward.  </p> <p> I am happy to hand over to my colleague, Deputy Fleming.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400034#GG00200"><p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for agreeing to share time with me.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is important legislation.  It deals with an issue that has been discussed at length at both the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and the Committee of Public Accounts in the past year or two.  We support the Bill, with which the Committee of Public Accounts will be happy as we have discussed the lack of adequate resources and commissioners to deal with the cases which lead to a build up and a backlog, both in monetary terms and in the number of appeals.  We are happy to see progress being made in dealing with the issue.  I want to start on a positive note by saying we acknowledge this.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight the following in order that people will understand it.  The commission was set up in 2016 and given a budget allocation of &euro;1.5 million.  In year one over one third of the budget was returned unspent.  In 2017 it received an allocation of &euro;1.7 million and again about one third was returned unspent to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  I am pleased that from a budget of &euro;1.7 million last year, the Estimate for the Tax Appeals Commission, there has been a fantastic increase in 2019 to in excess of &euro;3 million, which represents almost a 100% increase.  That is great and we want to see the money being properly spent and utilised and I hope not being returned to the Exchequer, as happened previously.</p>  <p>  From that point of view, we appreciate the strides that have been made, but the Minister will have to accept that we are playing catch-up.  This issue should have been dealt with in 2016 when the legislation was being established, rather than setting up an office, seeing how it went and coming back after a couple of years only to realise it was not working efficiently.  These issues were foreseeable.  The Committee of Public Accounts was clear in its recommendation when it stated: "Prior to the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission in March 2016 there was a failure by the Department of Finance to fully establish the nature and level of resources it would require to carry out its statutory functions".  I accept that was a valid and an objective criticism by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I also accept that there is a good response at this point to deal with the issue because the lack of resources was a key issue.</p>  <p>  We had detailed discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts, as the Minister of State's officials will know.  The failure in the Department of Finance - it is a cross-government issue - arises from the fact that when a new body is set up, the amount of money spent will increase.  It will attract more appeals, but that fact was not fully factored in in considering the workload of the Tax Appeals Commission.  However, at this stage we are happy to see additional resources being provided.  There was criticism and extra commissioners have been sanctioned.  The commission stated it was not given the back-up and technical staff required to do its work.  I hope that issue has been addressed and that the Minister of State will say staffing levels have been increased.  I again say the approved number of employees last year was 18 and that the approved number this year is 33.  I do not know what the current figure is, but that is an indication that we are beginning to get it right, which is important.  It is good to report progress where it is seen.</p>  <p>  That leads me to the question of the backlog and the arrears of tax in dispute.  That is on what I want to concentrate in the few minutes available to me.  It was made clear to us that the amount in dispute at the end of 2017 was about &euro;1.6 billion.  We were concerned that excessive delays in finalising appeals caused by inadequate resources might - I do not know what the definite position is - result in the imposition of additional interest charges on unsuccessful appellants.  That would potentially be a factor if they were to be unsuccessful and delayed excessively.  As I cannot say this definitively, perhaps it might be clarified on Committee Stage whether extra interest was charged during the appeals process or if the clock was stopped.  I would be equally worried if the clock was stopped on extra interest in cases under appeal if somebody felt it was possible to lodge an appeal to stop the clock on extra interest for a couple of years.  I am not expressing a view, but on Committee Stage I would like the Minister of State to set out the position for the information of the public, the House, practitioners and taxpayers in general.</p>  <p>  We move on to the situation where the Tax Appeals Commission had to move to new offices during the process.  There was some argy-bargy between the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the commission at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will not go there, but I will just say it was unseemly at the time.  Perhaps it is good that we got under the bonnet to see what happens when the OPW moves people.  It moved people from the Department of Health and the lesson is that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform do not do everything as well as everybody seems to think they do.  That is all I will say about the matter.  When one looks at any example where it moves a big office from one location to another, there are a lot of problems left in its wake that should have been foreseeable.  Let us hope that is all history at this stage.  We want to move on in a positive way and see the new chairperson appointed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  When the commission took over legacy appeals from the Revenue Commissioners, we were told at the Committee of Public Accounts that approximately 2,000 cases were already in the system.  A significant number had come through from Revenue and they were not being dealt with.  We were told at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2018 that there were 5,622 appeals related to 2,505 appellants in process.  The Minister of State might clarify the number for information before Committee Stage.  I ask him to separate the number of appeals from appellants when he is discussing the matter because there could be an appellant with multiple appeals.  People are not clear on what we are talking about when it comes to the numbers of appeals and appellants.  There can be an overlap.  I am reading from what was said at the Committee of Public Accounts, to which it would have responded in due course.  I just wanted to clarify the matter.</p>  <p>  Another issue that I am at pains to point out - it is probably in the interests of the Department of Finance that it be pointed out - is that at that stage the tax arrears in dispute were approximately &euro;1.8 billion, but the outstanding liabilities were approximately &euro;1.3 billion.  Therefore, the point is that some companies made their payments in advance, but the matter of whether they should have paid it was in dispute.  It was really an issue of overpaid tax being in dispute.  The value of the cases amounted to &euro;1.8 billion, but that was not the estimated amount of tax outstanding.  Some of the appeals, if successful, would result in refunds because of previous overpayments.  They are not quite the same.</p>  <p>  I move to what I call some of the high value cases.  This issue is not dealt with in the legislation.</p><p>I ask the Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality to work on the number of high value appeals going to court.  While those cases are on the Tax Appeals Commission's books, in a way its hands are tied.</p> <p> The Committee of Public Accounts wants to ensure we are collecting the tax due to the State in order that we can pay for public services because it is taxpayers' money.  The committee was told by the Tax Appeals Commission that in 2018 three cases involving over &euro;100 million were in dispute, as were 14 cases involving a sum in excess of &euro;10 million.  I want to outline the information we received at the committee, which was correct as of 11 July.  We asked for information on the ten largest cases, because that is where the big money is.  We never asked about the category of industry or the types of taxpayer involved.  We only asked about the category of taxation.  Of the ten largest cases, nine relate to corporation tax, while one is in respect of an environmental levy.  The Tax Appeals Commission gave us that information during the summer recess.  There are three cases in which the outstanding amount in dispute is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million, which combined could be up to &euro;150 million.  In four cases the amount in dispute is between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million, which potentially could add up to &euro;400 million.  There are a further three cases where the amount in dispute is in excess of &euro;100 million.  The estimated value of these three cases, based on the information presented to the Committee of Public Accounts, is &euro;2 billion.  There are ten cases where the estimated amount in dispute is &euro;2.5 billion.  We have asked for a progress report on these cases.  I again stress that we do not identify the companies or the category of industry as it could help to identify them.</p> <p> In two of the biggest cases the appeal is not sufficiently advanced to give us a timeline for when the cases might be dealt with.  In one case the High Court has imposed a stay on progressing the appeal, pending the outcome of judicial review proceedings.  I do not know which three cases they are, but we have seen a pattern of cases going to court.  I am worried that we will see billions of euro being tied up in the courts and that the Tax Appeals Commission will not be able to deal with them because they have been referred to court.  These are cases in which there have been no payments to date.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to his colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality in the interests of taxpayers.  If cases involving a sum of over &euro;100 million, or even much lower figures, are being held up in the courts, we need a mechanism to deal with them speedily.  If money is due, it should be paid.  The courts system must expedite these cases in order that we can have early conclusions one way or the other and provide certainty for taxpayers and the public.  The large amount of money has crept up from &euro;1.5 billion to over &euro;3 billion and I do not want to see it escalating further.  </p> <p> All in all, we welcome the legislation, which is good and important.  However, we have to watch the big cases that are building up.</p></speech>

It deals with two issues, one being tax appeals and the other the prospectus regulation.  I will deal with each of them in turn.</p>  <p>  Section 5, as outlined in the Bill, amends section 4 of the Tax Appeals Act 2015.  That Act established the Tax Appeals Commission which replaced the Office of the Appeals Commissioners.  The Tax Appeals Commission was established as an independent body to settle tax-related disputes between Revenue and taxpayers.  It covers a wide range of issues as diverse as the refusal of tax allowances or credits, the valuation of assets for the purposes of capital gains tax, the valuation of imported vehicles for the purposes of VRT and much more.  When it was first established, it had two commissioners, each of whom was appointed directly by the Minister for Finance.  It was then necessary to increase the commission's budget from &euro;1.6 million to &euro;3.2 million, partly owing to the increased number of appeals being made to the commission.  It is worth noting that in 2018 the commission closed 1,400 tax appeal cases, with the combined amounts of tax involved exceeding &euro;560 million.  The commission does not deal in small change and is dealing with a huge amount of work.  It is also worth noting that the work involved and the appeals process can often be very slow, legalistic and increasingly bureaucratic.</p>  <p>  The legislation proposes to amend section 4 of the Tax Appeals Act to allow the Minister to appoint a chairperson to the commission on foot of a recommendation from the review of the workload and operation of the Tax Appeals Commission.  It will create a mechanism to establish, monitor and enforce standards in the performance of functions of individual commissioners.  </p>  <p>  Section 5 provides for the general functions of the chairperson who will generally control the overall administration and business of the commission.  Importantly, it provides that the chairperson will have specific responsibility to ensure the integrity of the commission's accounting and financial reporting system.  Additionally, the chairperson must ensure compliance with freedom of information and data protection laws, which is very important.</p>  <p>  Section 12 amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and provides that an appellant to the High Court must state his or her disagreement with the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission prior to the hearing.  Section 13 amends the same Act, but requires the appellant to present all relevant exhibits to a case stated to the High Court rather than to the Tax Appeals Commission.  While I understand the rationale for these two amendments, it is important that the provisions do not excessively impede the ability of the taxpayer to appeal a determination by the Tax Appeals Commission.  It is crucial that there be no impediment to an appeal made to the High Court in good faith and with justification.  It needs to be finely balanced.  We will examine that issue on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Without making a premature judgment, there are issues and these provisions are worthy of due scrutiny when the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  The ultimate purpose of the provisions is to streamline and hasten the tax appeals process, offering a speedy resolution at minimum cost and optimum outcome for the parties involved.  It is a worthy and noble cause, but while it does not concern the immediate provisions of the Bill, it is worth remembering that the Government, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, has lodged its own tax appeal with the European Court of Justice.  However, in this case, it is trying to ensure it will not receive &euro;14 billion in tax due to the taxpayer.</p><p>Moreover, so far the appeal is costing the taxpayer more than &euro;7 million.  This appeal does not offer a speedy resolution, does not offer minimum cost and certainly does not provide an optimal outcome for the people.  It lies in stark contrast to the aspirations of the legislation the Minister of State has brought before the House.  It is not much to assume that the Government's Apple tax appeal is one that the future chairperson of the TAC would find difficult to understand.</p> <p> On a different issue, sections 15 to 25 deal with the second issue on the legislation, which is the prospectus regulations.  These are quite separate from the issue of tax appeals in their entirety.  To this end, the Bill will amend Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014, in part to transpose EU regulations, which had a deadline of 21 July this year.  A prospectus is a document that issuers have to publish when making a public offer of securities or seeking securities admission to trading on the European market.  For this reason, the provisions in the Bill are technical in nature and are mostly concerned with protecting investors in these markets.</p> <p> Section 15 increases the current offer of securities that can be made without a prospectus from the current sum of &euro;5 million to &euro;8 million.  Securities below &euro;8 million, therefore, will no longer be subject to this prospectus framework.  While I understand that this provision in the section and the other sections that also deal with it was made to make it easier for small businesses to raise money instead of relying exclusively on the banking sector, it is important that a balance is reached between capital market access for smaller companies and the necessary safeguards and oversight.  That needs to be teased out in detail on Committee Stage.  A similar prospectus threshold in Germany, Austria and Sweden is set at &euro;5 million, which is the current level in Ireland, and they have not seen fit or identified the need at this point to increase it to the &euro;8 million figure that is suggested here.</p> <p> In conclusion, tuigim go bhfuil an Bille seo iontach teicni&uacute;il, agus caithfear &eacute; a scr&uacute;d&uacute; go mion nuair a th&eacute;ann s&eacute; go dt&iacute; an choiste.

It is complicated and technical, and we will get into it in more detail.  I will touch upon as many of the issues that I can.  The figure of 3,600 cases or thereabouts was referred to earlier.  The current figure - as of this week - is 3,479 cases with an overall quantum of &euro;2.6 billion.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath referred to the amended tax assessments.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue has independence in the administration of the tax system and the Minister cannot and will not, nor would he wish to, interfere with Revenue on this matter.  I note the Deputy's concerns and will actively bring those to the Minister and his officials to engage with Revenue to try to understand any emerging trends such as those the Deputy McGrath mentioned.  The chairperson will also be an appeals commissioner, which is important.  We hope that this, together with the three additional temporary commissioners, will enable significant inroads to be made in the appeals backlog.  Nobody benefits from having too long an appeal on the matter.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty referred to section 13.  This was discussed at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  Some concerns were voiced regarding proposed changes due to the procedures for the case stated.  In the report of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, requested further consideration of whether the TAC should be able to request either party to an appeal to provide documentation in the case stated so that all required and appropriate documentation is available to the High Court.  That has been taken on board and the change was made when drafting section 13, which reflects this suggestion.  The amendment will allow the commission to request documentation of either party regarding the case stated.</p>  <p>  Other points were made in the pre-legislative scrutiny with regard to the prospectus.  Deputy Doherty highlighted the prospectus threshold in other countries.  They are retaining their prospectus at &euro;5 million but a number of other EU member states such as the UK - for however much longer - and France, Denmark, Finland and Italy are to increase their prospectus threshold to &euro;8 million.  We want to try to give companies the opportunity to source funding beyond bank lending.  Beyond banks, our jurisdiction has few sources of moneys to companies.  For the vast majority in this jurisdiction, it is how companies bring in funding.  In other jurisdictions, it is much less.  In the US, for example, it is approximately 30%.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank will also serve to enhance the protections.  I am sure we will go through these in much more detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400037#KK00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity today to present the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019 to the House.  This is a balanced and proportionate Bill, which provides for the regulation of approved housing bodies, AHBs, for the purposes of supporting stronger governance and the financial viability of that sector, with a particular focus on safeguarding the significant public investment being made in the delivery of social housing by AHBs.  Similarly, the Bill will provide stronger assurance to tenants, the public and potential investors that the sector is well regulated.</p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, AHBs provide and manage social housing.  They are independent, private, not-for-profit organisations, formed for the purpose of relieving housing need.  AHBs provide housing in response to a range of different needs, including families on low incomes and households with special needs, older persons, people with disabilities and homeless persons.  Under existing legislation, housing bodies are granted approved status by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purpose of being able to receive funding from local authorities to provide social housing.  This arrangement has been in place since 1992 and although operating well it is acknowledged that a more modern regulatory system needs to be put in place to oversee a sector which has developed significantly since then.  </p>  <p>  Ahead of the establishment of a statutory regulator, which is the aim of this Bill, an interim regulatory office for AHBs has been in place, based in the Housing Agency, since 2013.  The interim regulation committee, supported by the regulation office, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code for AHBs.  This existing framework will ensure that the statutory regulator, once established, can become fully operational much quicker than would otherwise be the case.  Regulation is currently conducted through the voluntary regulation code, entitled Building for the Future: A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, and is underpinned by a financial, governance and performance standard.  At present, 275 AHBs, including the larger tier three AHBs, have signed up to the voluntary code.  My Department&rsquo;s register indicates that there are currently 552 AHBs in existence.  However, many of these are inactive and an exercise will be carried out to de-list inactive AHBs from the register.  Preliminary work has already commenced in this regard.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness recognises the key contribution that approved housing bodies make to the delivery of social housing.  They are committed to delivering one third of the 50,000 new social housing units that are to be provided over the period of the plan through a blended delivery of build, acquisition and leasing.  In 2018, the AHB sector was responsible for 38% of the delivery of social homes.  The overall target for delivery of housing solutions in 2019 is up 7% on 2018.  The target for delivery through build, acquisition and lease is up more than 20%, from 7,869 to 10,000.  The target for new build homes has almost tripled from 2,260 in 2016 to 6,545 in 2019.  Delivery has exceeded its targets in each year of Rebuilding Ireland to date and we remain on target for this year in terms of our social housing supports.  Last week, I provided an update on Rebuilding Ireland and published the social housing construction status report, which demonstrates positive progress made in advancing national local authority and approved housing body new build construction projects. </p>  <p>  It is misleading to suggest, as some in this House and commentators outside do, that AHB housing is not social housing.  Some say it does not count and so exclude it when reporting on social housing delivery.  That is wrong.  Housing bodies have a proud history in the country, with bodies such as the lveagh Trust involved in providing social housing since before the foundation of the State.  Housing bodies receive finance from the taxpayer and support people from our housing lists.  They build on local authority land.  As part of our new and more sustainable approach to social housing, delivery is not dependent on one single stream as it was in the past.  Social housing is now delivered in a number of ways, protecting would-be tenants from any adverse shocks to the economy or the sector.  These not-for-profit bodies complement but do not replace social housing delivery by local authorities, which are once again, thanks to decisions made by the Government, delivering the majority of new social homes.  In particular areas, for example, housing for people with disabilities, housing bodies have the required experience and expertise in providing the most appropriate housing.  I have big ambitions for the sector and I want it to continue to grow and to continue to provide the quality homes that it has for those most in need.  I want to compliment the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, and the Housing Alliance and all involved in what was a record year in 2018 for the delivery of new social homes.  The AHB sector is playing a central role in contributing to the delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland and I am committed to using all mechanisms and schemes to ensure that momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the action plan is maintained.  This Bill will support and strengthen that ambition by demonstrating to all that the sector is well regulated.</p>  <p>  I will now move to the detail of the Bill, which contains 70 sections in nine Parts, together with one Schedule, and will outline the purpose of each Part and some of the key provisions.</p>  <p>  Part 1, sections 1 to 6, contains standard legislative provisions in regard to matters such as construction, commencement, collective citation and interpretation and other technical matters.</p>  <p>  Section 4 places a duty on the Minister to review the operation and effectiveness of the Act not later than five years after the establishment of the regulator.</p>  <p>  Part 2, sections 7 to 25, provides for the establishment of the approved housing body regulatory authority - the regulator - and sets out the functions and organisational structure of the regulator; the appointment of a chief executive, staff, preparation of a strategy statement and other related matters.  The functions of the regulator, as set out in section 9, are to establish and maintain a register of AHBs, to register persons as AHBs; to prepare draft standards for approval by the Minister under section 38 and publish the approved standards.  They also are to monitor and assess compliance by AHBs with this Act, in particular the approved standards, to carry out investigations under Part 5; to cancel the registration of AHBs under Part 6; to encourage and facilitate the better governance, administration and management, including corporate governance and financial management, of AHBs by the provision of such information and advice, in such form and manner, as the regulator considers appropriate and with a view to promoting awareness and understanding of this Act, make available such information as appears to the regulator to be expedient to give to the public about the operation of this Act, in such form and manner, as the regulator considers appropriate; to collect such information concerning AHBs as the regulator considers necessary and appropriate for the purposes of the performance of the regulator&rsquo;s functions, and; to publish such information, including statistical information, concerning AHBs as the regulator considers appropriate.</p>  <p> Section 15 is an important oversight provision, which provides that the chief executive shall appear before relevant Oireachtas committees when requested to do so.  </p>  <p>  Part 3, sections 26 to 38 provides for the regulation of approved housing bodies and includes sections on the registration procedures for AHBs and their entry onto the register, as well as the drafting and approval of standards.  To be eligible to register as an AHB, the persons or bodies must be a company with at least five directors; a registered society, a friendly society or a charitable trust with at least five trustees.  The persons or bodies must include in their constitution the provision or management in the State of housing for the purpose of alleviating housing need, as well as provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members or directors or other persons and requiring that its assets and profits be applied solely towards its primary object.</p>  <p>  Sections 27 and 28 provide that the regulator will establish and maintain a register of AHBs and set out where and when the register may be inspected, along with setting out procedures for those persons or bodies who wish to apply for registration and what should be included within the application.</p>  <p>  Section 35 enables existing AHBs approved under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to be deemed registered.  A body deemed registered under this section must apply for registration within a statutory period as set out.</p>  <p>  Section 37 gives the regulator the powers, where it is necessary for the purpose of performing its functions, to require an AHB to provide the regulator with information, records or other documents in such form and manner as the regulator may reasonably require.</p>  <p> Section 38 provides for the drafting and adoption of standards for registered AHBs.  Draft standards will be prepared and may make different provisions for different categories of registered AHBs taking into account a number of factors, including the nature, scale and complexity of activities of each category of AHB.  Prior to submitting the standards to the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government for approval, the regulator will publish and allow for a period of representations to be made regarding the proposed standards.</p>  <p>  Part 4 provides the regulator with the powers to monitor compliance by AHBs with the standards.  Arising from the assessment, if the regulator deems that the AHB is not complying with the standards, it may require the body to draw up and submit a compliance plan.</p>  <p>  Part 5 provides the regulator with powers to appoint inspectors and undertake investigations into the affairs and performance of AHBs.  This Part also sets out the powers of the inspectors and the mechanism for the production of inspectors' reports.</p>  <p>  Part 6 allows for intervention powers to be afforded to the regulator in respect of assets of an AHB where an offence has been committed, an AHB has failed or is failing to comply with any provision of the Bill, there has been misconduct by a director, officer or member of staff or the financial viability of an AHB is threatened.  This Part provides, if a deemed AHB refuses to apply for registration after the relevant time period has elapsed or if registration is refused or if any AHB's registration is in the process of being cancelled or is cancelled and the regulator considers it necessary for the protection of tenants of dwellings, the regulator may, by notice, require the AHB to transfer such dwellings to another AHB.</p>  <p>  Section 55 empowers the regulator to seek a High Court order if he or she suspects that an AHB has committed an offence under the Bill; an AHB is failing to comply with provisions under the Bill; an AHB is misusing or mismanaging property in such a way that endangers the property; there has been misconduct or mismanagement by a director or employee of an AHB in relation to its affairs; there has been unlawful or improper use of funds; there is a serious risk to the financial viability of the body; it is necessary for the purpose of the protection of the tenants of dwellings provided or managed by an AHB; or there is information indicating any of the above.  In such circumstances, the court may issue an interim or permanent order.</p>  <p>  Part 7 provides for an AHB to submit appeals to an appeals panel where the regulator exercises its powers in relation to registration, compliance plans or cancellation of registration.  This Part also provides that the Minister shall establish an appeals panel to determine appeals under the Bill.  It sets out the qualifications and number of members, terms of office, grounds for removal of members and disqualification for appointment and the provision of resources to support the work of the panel.</p>  <p>  Part 8 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.</p>  <p>  Part 9 provides for the consequential amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, and the construction of certain references in other Acts or instruments made under other Acts.  </p>  <p>  I intend to bring forward a limited number of amendments as the Bill makes its way through the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These amendments will be broadly technical in nature and relate to the substance of the Bill.  For example, two of the proposed amendments will relate to the application for registration process.  Currently, there are no specific provisions in the Bill for either the withdrawal of an application by an AHB, before the regulator makes a decision on the application, or for incomplete applications submitted.</p>  <p>  This Bill, if enacted, will support stronger governance and financial viability of the very important AHB sector.  It will safeguard the significant public investment being made in the delivery of social housing by AHBs and it will provide stronger assurance to tenants, the public and potential investors that the sector is well regulated.</p>  <p>  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that approved housing bodies have an essential role to play in providing new housing units.</p><p>However, they are constrained by the EUROSTAT decision that limits their borrowing capacity.  The Government has also failed to set out a path to get off balance sheet, as is usual in most EU countries, and has failed to set up a special purpose vehicle to allow credit unions to invest in approved housing bodies, AHBs.</p> <p> We support the Bill and AHBs.  Last October, this issue was under scrutiny by me and other members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In his special chapter, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out that by mid-2018, just 246 AHBs, or some 45%, out of 547 that were in operation at the time had registered with the Department so regulation is welcome because the management and oversight of the funding provided to AHBs is complex as it is provided under a number of schemes.  Because of the scale of the operation of some AHBs, they are in receipt of more than one type of funding from more than one local authority.  As was pointed out during that session with members of the Department who were present on the day, the funding is significant.  I know that when we examined the 2017 accounts at the Committee of Public Accounts, funding of &euro;180 million was flowing through from the Department to AHBs on schemes available exclusively to them.  The examination by the Local Government Audit Service in 2015 identified a number of areas where oversight of AHBs by local authorities could be improved.  When we examined it, we found that between 2013 and 2017, &euro;648 million was provided to AHBs with no review of operations during that period so the pressing need for regulation and a regulator was evident, particularly when one considers that in his report, the Comptroller and Auditor pointed out that when he tried to match the scheme expenditure with output data, he found that the Department did not report output on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  He also found that the Department did not report the size of the social housing stock.  It had figures for local authority stock but not for social housing held by approved AHBs.  It was also very evident that a large number of AHBs were inactive but retained approved status.  I welcome the work of the Department in tidying up the register prior to this legislation coming forward, as was recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General and sought at that time.</p> <p> We are supportive of the Bill.  The need for it is clear given the significant sums of money involved in an area that is so important.  I return to my opening comments, which are that this is a small measure in a sector that has been neglected and that housing policy in this country has been characterised by falling home ownership levels and missed targets on social housing.  In 1991, the average age at which a person bought his or her first home was 26.  I was that age in 2005 when I bought my home.  In 2016, the average age was 35.  House prices have risen by 90% since 2012 while incomes have risen by 7% during that same period.  Home ownership levels have slipped to record lows of 67% across the country, down from a high of 82% in 2004.  The Government's strategy has mired social housing projects in red tape and ignored the issue of credit union funding.  We say that AHBs must play a central role in resolving the housing crisis but the Government has also failed to address the EUROSTAT ruling that limits AHBs future growth.  We must move away from relying on the private sector and remove red tape for local authorities and AHBs to allow them to get to grips with the housing crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400038#LL00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  While it is technical in nature, we will be supporting it.  I very much welcome anything we can do that facilitates and speeds up the delivery of social housing so I welcome this Bill.</p>  <p>  However, I wish to raise a very serious concern.  From speaking to AHBs and the developers with which they work to deliver turnkey housing developments, I have heard of issues they are having with Irish Water.  Those issues have mainly arisen since April since the introduction of new legislation.  One example highlights many of the issues developers and AHBs are facing.  It concerns a development in Fortfield in Tralee consisting of 15 houses.  I worked with the Minister at the time to get it approved and was very grateful for his input.  The development started, the developer agreed with Irish Water that as it was a social housing project and there would be no development contributions.  The fee for providing a water connection was &euro;8,900.  The developer sent on the cheque and his agent sent on the necessary paperwork.  Construction of the houses proceeded.  In July, the developer became concerned that the water connection had not been provided so he contacted Irish Water to be told that it had no record of his cheque or paperwork, the original agreement had lapsed after 90 days and Irish Water was now looking for &euro;90,000 which, as one can imagine, came as quite a shock to the developer as he had not budgeted for it in his original price.  Irish Water basically said that after April, it was now charging voluntary housing bodies development levies and that if the developer had a difficulty with this decision, he could go to the regulator, which has happened.  To add insult to injury, Irish Water came out on site a couple of weeks ago, found that the original connection was not where it wanted it to be, had to carry out some further infrastructural works and is now looking for a further &euro;120,000 to bring the water main farther up the road to a new point of connection.  In January 2018, the infrastructure charge was &euro;8,900 but it has risen to somewhere in the region of &euro;200,000.  This will make this project completely unviable.  I fear that if it is not resolved in the coming weeks, we will be left with 15 houses that are ready to be occupied but have no water connection so it needs to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I have spoken with two other developers who have told me that the single biggest blockage they face in delivering housing, both private and social, is Irish Water and the ability to get quotations and reasonable prices and to get the work done.  I want to use this opportunity to bring this issue to the Minister's attention.  I have spoken to Irish Water about the case I raised.  It is not acceptable for a public utility to behave in a manner that jeopardises private and public housing developments.  I am sure the Minister will take what I have said very seriously.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether or not the next issue applies to AHBs but where infrastructure has been provided by the developer, Irish Water is not obliged to take that development in charge or take responsibility for it.  If a developer provided the wastewater infrastructure for a completed development, it can never be taken in charge.  I foresee significant problems down the road with this.</p><p>They want to be treated like every other development but because the developer provided the sewage infrastructure Irish Water does not want to know about it.  It is something we have to deal with.  I appreciate it is not part of this legislation but I wanted to take the opportunity to bring it to the Minister of State's attention. </p></speech>

We have long argued for a regulator for social housing.  While this is a technical Bill, it is a very important one with a lot of significant detail.  The principles on which such regulation needs to be based are important.  They need to be robust so that there is a strong regulatory regime and they need to be fair to all of the participants in that regime, including landlords, tenants and the taxpayer.  Crucially, this regulation is about assisting the AHB sector to grow, thrive and to do what it is meant to do.  It is important legislation and like many similar Bills, given its technical nature, it will probably not be subject to the level of scrutiny it deserves in light of what it has the potential to do if we get it right.</p>  <p>  I want to put on record our concern that once again the local authority sector is being exempted from these regulations.  I have argued for a long time that it makes no sense to have two different types of social housing provider.  Both the providers and the tenants are subject to completely different regulatory regimes.  In fact, because of the significant advances represented by the Residential Tenancies Acts, the RTB, and now some of the provisions of this Bill, the situation for AHB landlords and their tenants is far better than in for the local authority sector, particularly for tenants, where regulation, protection, accountability and transparency are concerned.  We know why that is.  If local authority tenants were given access to the RTB tomorrow, the queue of tenants looking for substantial improvements to the poor quality of their accommodation caused by lack of investment in the stock would be simply unsustainable for Government.  However, at some point we have to have a conversation about ensuring that all social landlords and all social housing tenants are captured under one Bill. </p>  <p>  We have a slight technical difficulty with the current Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government because the heads of this Bill were introduced during the previous D&aacute;il.  None of the members of the current committee, therefore, was present for the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  That is nobody's fault, but it is unfortunately the way things have gone.  Given the importance of the legislation, it is important for the committee members to hear from AHBs, the County and City Management Association and the interim regulator.  We on the committee are exploring ways to facilitate a presentation by these stakeholders without delaying the Bill.  We are not looking to delay it, but in private session later this week I will argue that we should find a mechanism to allow the committee to be brought up to speed with what our predecessors in the previous D&aacute;il had the advantage of doing.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that the context is very different from 2015.  We have a completely different housing policy and regardless of one's support or criticism of that, it is a completely different policy context.  The funding context is also different.  Crucially, the reclassification of AHBs so that their funding is on the Government's balance sheet is a fundamental change to the configuration, the work and the regulation.  One of the fundamental concerns of both EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, is the level of Government control of the sector, concerning not just financing but also governance and policy.  Although pre-legislative scrutiny happened in 2015, there is a value to updating that in the current context.  It is relevant to the sections of the Bill I will address shortly.  </p>  <p>  That is specifically the case with reclassification.  Officials from the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Finance will appear before the committee on Thursday to discuss this.  There is a genuine concern, which is directly relevant to the provisions of this Bill and whether they are worthy of support.  Many of us have the impression that there is not enough urgency in the Government's response to that issue and its efforts to get the AHB sector back off-balance sheet in a way that maintains the voluntary not-for-profit ethos.</p>  <p>  This is not some technical concern.  The additional fiscal space that any Government would have if that sector was brought back off-balance sheet is in the order of several hundred million euro.  The total current and capital expenditure on AHBs may be in the region of &euro;600 million.  When the fiscal rules are applied, it could be &euro;100 million, &euro;200 million or &euro;250 million.  Given that the Government has only &euro;700 million of fiscal space for additional spending next year, an extra &euro;200 million would be significant for any Government.  We need to examine that</p>  <p>  Central to the relevance of reclassification to this Bill is the issue of control and independence.  Is the Government increasing its power and control over the sector or creating truly independent mechanisms to ensure good quality regulation in the interest of all?  </p>  <p>  The comments I am going to make are friendly.  They are made in the context of wanting to support this Bill.  I have some observations on some sections that I would like Mr. Paul Lemass and his team to consider.  Some questions need to be addressed and may even require amendments, preferably from the Government on Report Stage if it is willing to work with us.  I am keen to hear both the Minister of State's response and any subsequent response from the officials.  </p>  <p>  I will go through the sections and the key issues of concern.  The first is the appointment of the regulator itself, which is provided for in the Schedule.  The idea that the regulator and a board of five to eleven people would simply be appointed by the Minister is a mistake.  Irrespective of whether the board's membership is determined by competence or some representative function, using the public appointments process would be a much better way of doing it.  The Minister's approval would still be needed.  It makes no sense that the chief executive would be appointed through the public appointments process but the board itself would not.  I urge the Minister of State to look at that. </p>  <p>  There is also the issue of whether the board should be competency-based or representative.  My preference is for it to be competency-based.  That would mean we would need some people on the board with intimate knowledge of the AHB sector, who preferably would not be currently working in the sector but would know its mechanics and its details.  That should be considered. </p>  <p>  I am genuinely concerned by the definitions of standards and the outline of strategy contained in sections 38 and 21.  The Bill gives the board the power to develop the strategy and standards but it ultimately comes back to the Minister for approval.  It is almost like the argument we had over the planning regulator; ultimately the key decisions have to be referred back to the Minister for his or her consent.  That is a bad way to establish independent regulators.  I am also concerned that it may fall foul of the CSO and EUROSTAT when it comes to the redesignation.  That has to be looked at very clearly. </p>  <p>  I refer to the provisions on standards in section 38.  In some respects this does to the heart of the regulator.  These are the key rules to which the regulator will be trying to ensure the AHB sector adheres.  When there are investigations or interventions, as we will discuss shortly, in many cases they will arise from the regulator's view that a body may not be compliant with them.  The standards deal with governance, financial management and property management, which is fine.  There are no queries or quibbles with this.  However, the section also refers to tenancy management.  Later in the section, nominations and allocations are mentioned.  Those are not governance or financial management issues.  They are issues of policy, which is ultimately set by the Department and the local government sector.  I was very surprised to see those within the standards and functions of the regulator.  There is an issue in respect of how this will relate to the policymaking function of the Department and the implementation and current regulatory function of the local authorities or the RTB.  I urge the Minister of State and his team to examine that. </p>  <p>  On a slightly less significant point, the idea of a strategy, as referred to in section 21, is probably a little too grandiose.  This is an operational plan for how to implement the work.  The term "strategy" makes it sound like a much bigger organisation with a policy vision and a mission, and that is not my view of what a regulator should do.  That is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department in the first instance, as well as the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  Section 11 concerns fees.  The Minister of State will know that I took the Government's side against pretty much everybody else in the Opposition on levying fees on the AHB sector at reduced rates for registration of tenancies with the RTB.  I did that because approved housing bodies will access the RTB for services such as mediation and adjudication and it is right and proper for them to make a contribution towards those.  I am not against the charging of fees where it is appropriate.</p><p>I do not see the rationale for charging fees under this legislation.  The Charities Regulator, for example, does not charge fees because it does not provide charities with the service RTB, provides for landlords and tenants in mediation or adjudication.  It is also not clear how the fees will be set.  They may be set so low as to make a minimal contribution to the financing of the regulator.  In that case, why bother?  The other possibility is that the fees will be set so high, in an effort to recover costs, that they could be prohibitively excessive.  The approved housing body sector already has significant cash flow issues on development projects, as the Department knows well.  In that context, this section should simply be removed.  That is not my position because I do not want AHBs to have to pay.  I just do not see for what the Minster is asking them to pay.  This is a function of the Government, not the AHBs. </p> <p> I make the same point about section 46 which deals with inspectors.  Would it not be better if the Public Appointments Service was involved in this process?  If I understand the section correctly, the regulator can simply appoint the inspectors.  As we have a good Public Appointments Service, let us use it.  There could be a shortlisting of candidates and the regulator could then make the final decisions.  If we want to make sure inspectors have the greatest possible experience and competence, a more rigorous process is needed.</p> <p> Section 47 is very important.  We need good quality, robust investigations.  That is the core of any strong regulatory regime.  We have to strike a balance between the powers given and due process.  However, the balance in a couple of areas might be tipping towards strong powers to the detriment of due process.  The Minister should look at this issue.  Some of the language used is also vague.  For example, there is mention of "if the regulator considers it necessary", "considers it appropriate" and "for the purposes of the performance of its functions".  These are either vague or have low thresholds for what could be significant interventions.  Having looked briefly at other regulatory regimes, a regulator should need to have a reasonable suspicion that something is not being done right in order to intervene.  There should be a suspicion that something is not being done about standards.  Not adhering to or not implementing standards should clearly be grounds for action.  The Minister needs to look at that issue again. </p> <p> One of the areas with the greatest weaknesses is the transfer of stocks which is covered in section 54.  I understand this well.  There may a case to have an AHB, perhaps a smaller body, overseeing a small number of units, with older trustees who are no longer in a position to be involved.  There might be a maintenance or standards issue.  I accept that an application to the High Court is the right way to deal with that issue.  However, who decides where the stock is going to go?  All the Bill states is that it will be up to the regulator.  Who will cover the costs if, for example, the buildings are in poor condition and there is no sinking fund?  The regulator might want them to go to another approved housing body or a local authority.  Will the approved housing body or local authority accept the transfer if they are not being compensated for having to deal with the associated issues?  When we were regulating the credit union sector, there was a comparable issue about credit unions in difficulty.  That legislation included a resolution process.  There was a clear mechanism whereby a transparent process would be put in place in a case where an entity failed or was perceived to be failing.  It would also have a fund available to ensure stock could be transferred where an approved housing body was no longer able to do its job properly or was not doing its job properly.  In the case of credit unions, mergers can be negotiated and a fund is available.  </p> <p> There is also an issue with private property rights.  The mortgages might almost be paid on some of the stock.  We are not talking about approved housing bodies such as Cl&uacute;id or Clanmil but about small, local approved housing bodies that were sometimes set up in the 1960s.  If those bodies now own properties outright, is the Minister guaranteeing that the Attorney General has stated there are no constitutional issues?  I am referring to a High Court order for the transfer to another entity of what is now private property, on which the State no longer has a charge.  I am not objecting to stock being transferred, if there is a reason for it.  However, if we are going to insert this type of mechanism, it has to be really watertight and able to fulfil its function.  </p> <p> Co-operation with other operators, as dealt with in section 24, is very sensible.  I do not understand, however, why Tusla and the Property Services Regulatory Authority are not listed.  They seem to be two of the most obvious bodies to include.  I know that the section states "and other regulators", but given that some of the other obvious bodies are named such as the Residential Tenancies Board, these two should be included also.  That is particularly the case because there is going to be potential for a regulatory conflict.  I mentioned my concerns about having tenancy management included in the standards.  Strictly speaking, tenancy management is something with which the RTB deals for tenants who state tenancy management is not being carried out properly by a landlord.  Who should have responsibility for what in such cases?  A little thought is needed on how co-operation is mediated and who decides the outcome if there is a conflict over whose piece of regulatory turf encompasses an incident and how it is to be dealt with.  </p> <p> I will mention some small issues before I conclude.  They are more for discussion on Committee Stage.  I refer to notifiable events which are included in a later part of the Bill.  It is a sensible inclusion.  Every order from the RTB pertaining to an AHB is to be a notifiable event.  That will be a major bureaucratic difficulty for the approved housing body.  Somebody will also be needed in the regulator's office to do nothing other than read RTB determinations from AHBs when it might not necessarily need to be the case.  I would have thought, in fact, that in the section dealing with co-operation with other regulators a mechanism would be found to agree to a protocol for such cases.  If the RTB finds that approved housing body "X" has a repeated history of not maintaining its stock properly, it could red flag it and consider whether it might be a regulatory or a financial management issue and if it might be time for notification to be given to the regulator of the approved housing bodies.  There could be a more effective way that would save time for the approved housing body and the regulator and also have more utility.  </p> <p> It is the same point in the case of the appeals panel.  The Minister should look at involving the Public Appointments Service.  These appeals are important and significant.  They are often technical issues which involve financial management, property management or appropriate governance.  For all of the reasons I outlined previously, the public appointments process is the right one.  </p> <p> On the publication of interim reports, I am all for transparency and full publication.  If I understand the section correctly, however, the Minister is talking about publishing interim reports before the approved housing body will have had an opportunity to read and respond to them.  That seems to involve a lack of due process.  I am not arguing against publication, but the approved housing bodies should have the right to read and respond to reports.  That would ordinarily be the case in other circumstances.  </p> <p> I will conclude by restating our sympathetic approach to the Bill.  We want to see good quality, robust regulation of the sector.  Notwithstanding the significant work Mr. Paul Lemass and his team have put into the Bill, we need to see some Government or Opposition amendments accepted on Committee and Report Stages.  The key issue is what is the Government's vision for the approved housing body sector?  How does this legislation assist us in delivering on that vision?  How will the capacity of the sector be assisted to meet these standards, particularly in the case of those bodies which are smaller and more local?  </p> <p> I have some key questions for the Minister.  He might respond in making his concluding remarks or perhaps at the housing committee.  In his view and that of the Department, what will be the impact of the Bill on the attempt to get the AHBs off the Government's balance sheet in the context of reclassification?  Have the CSO and the Department of Finance been consulted?  They are key bodies and their views are of major importance.  I understand a regulatory impact assessment was made back in 2014 or 2015 before I was a Member of the Oireachtas.  Has an updated regulatory impact assessment been made at a previous stage?  If not, is it something that could be done, even after the passage of the Bill?  There is a fair lead-in time in the enactment of the legislation.  It could be very helpful in making sure it is implemented properly.  </p> <p> Why is the regulator not being given more independence?  Why is every key decision being referred back to the Minister for consent?  The Government should set policy.  That is the job of the Government and the Oireachtas.  The job of a regulator is to make sure the agents of the State tasked with implementing Government policy do what the law states they are meant to do.  The regulator should not need to come back as often to the Government or the Minister.  The regulator's role should be to ensure the policies and decisions made in this House are implemented.  </p> <p> My final point concerns a conversation about applying the same rights, entitlements, regulations and transparency and accountability to local authorities and their tenants as we do to the approved housing body sector.  I knew that it would not be included in the Bill.  I would like to hear from the Government if it is on the horizon, being discussed or something to which we can return at a later stage?  I ask because if we want a strong, robust social housing sector that will meet the needs of the 20% to 25% of the population who should be in it, everybody providing that accommodation and living in it should be subject to the same rules and regulations and have the same rights and protections.  It is a missed opportunity that there has not been a move in that direction in the Bill.  If the Minister wishes to move in that direction in the future, we will work co-operatively with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400041#OO00100"><p>We also support the Bill and its principle, although I have questions.  My first response is to ask why it has taken so long.  I was in the Department when we did the early work on the voluntary code.  From my experience at that time, I know there was a strong request from the voluntary housing sector that they should have a Government structure and should be regulated, mainly because it would give the public an assurance their housing associations were properly run and managed and, as importantly, it would give them a status to raise funds such that they would find it much easier to raise finance to build social housing along with the funding they received from the State.  They wanted to do this, particularly the larger voluntary housing associations.  We did the earlier work on setting up the interim voluntary code established in the Housing Agency.  The larger ones mainly signed up to the code at the time.  I very much welcome the fact we have reached the point of introducing the legislation to establish a regulator.  The way in which it is being done is the right way to do it.</p>  <p>  My experience is that the contribution of the voluntary housing sector was strong, particularly at a time the country did not have an awful lot of money.  There was very much a willingness to play their part in providing housing for people when there was not as much public funding as I hope there is now.  We should also acknowledge this.</p>  <p>  There clearly are different types of voluntary housing associations or AHBs and this is where the three tiers come from.  The history of many smaller bodies is that villages or towns decided to build houses for their older citizens in order that they could retire to a safe environment  The voluntary housing associations largely just managed those homes rather than build new ones.  There are probably still many of these around the country.  The much larger bodies had more ambition.  Some of those bodies in the middle tier perhaps sometimes focused on supplying housing for a particular category of the community.  We have a mix in the sector and I hope we can treat them all fairly in the system that is being set up.  Some of this will need to be teased out as the legislation progresses.  In his opening contribution, the Minister indicated there would be Government amendments but they would be largely technical.  We all want to ensure we have the opportunity to table amendments where appropriate.</p>  <p>  One of the significant problems is the issue of funding.  I support what has been said regarding credit unions.  This is something we have debated in the context of other housing and finance Bills and legislation.  Credit unions need a special purpose vehicle, SPV.  When I have tabled parliamentary questions, the response every time has been that the Government will facilitate them by setting up an SPV.  They need the Government, the financial regulators and the Central Bank to work with them on establishing such a vehicle they can feed into because they have money.  They are in all of our communities and they can make a contribution.  We have all been lobbied by them because they feel they have not been assisted appropriately by the Government through the establishment of such a vehicle.  The willingness is there.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government probably does not need to do this but we need the credit union movement and the Government to come together to address this.</p>  <p>  The other significant issue is the Government balance sheet.  Approximately a year ago, I attended a presentation at a hotel in Dublin at which the Minister of State was speaking where stakeholders in the sector came together.  I forget who organised the meeting but it was on what we could do to address this issue of the voluntary housing sector being on the Government balance sheet.  I do not know what progress has been made and perhaps the Minister of State will address this in his response.  Strictly speaking, it is not the business of the Bill but it is a major factor in the scale of the contribution the sector can make to the housing crisis and providing homes for people.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has made progress in this regard but I would like to an update.</p>  <p>  With regard to the various sizes and types of voluntary housing associations, I support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's comments on fees, which are referred to in sections 11 and 35.  The fees are not outlined in the Bill.  I presume they will be set at a later stage.  They should not be an obstacle.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point that if the fees are to cover costs, they may be too high for the sector, but if they are not to cover costs, what will they achieve?  Perhaps the Minister of State will give his views on this.</p>  <p>  An issue in the lead-up to the legislation was the number of voluntary housing associations and the opportunity to merge or deregister them.  I do not know what the up-to-date position is.  Have some of them been deregistered or merged?  I happened to be on the board of a voluntary housing association that put itself out of existence and transferred assets because there were too many associations and our perception as a board was that we did not need to exist any more.  We transferred some elements of what we were doing to one of the larger voluntary housing associations and at least one property to Dublin City Council.  This was a long time ago.  Perhaps we have too many.  I do not know how much discussion has taken place in the sector in this regard, particularly on whether some of the smaller bodies need to continue what they are doing or whether the local authorities can take over some of their functions.  It is onerous for somebody to be on the board of any organisation because of the governance responsibilities.  Some of them have difficulty in getting people to take on the responsibility.  This is important for the sector.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on the issue of investigations under section 47.  The wording is quite loose.  If there were to be an investigation, it should be based on concern about the way in which a particular voluntary housing association is operating and it should not just be based on the opinion of the regulator.  There should be concrete reasons an investigation would be instigated.  This would be only fair to the associations concerned.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill because the sector has wanted it for some time.  When will local authorities be brought under its umbrella?  I realise it would involve a lot of work and commitment on the part of the State to support local authorities to achieve the standard required.  Tenants in local authority homes should not be at a disadvantage in comparison to tenants in the voluntary housing sector or the private sector.  I would be interested to in an update on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400041#OO00200"><p>I have mixed feelings about the Bill and the role the Government seems to see for the AHB sector in the delivery of social housing.</p><p>On the one hand, I do not doubt the contribution many AHBs make in the provision of social housing.  Having met representatives of the AHBs at various committee meetings, I do not doubt the goodwill and bona fides of many, if not most, of those involved in the AHB sector in trying to provide for a social need, which, as we are all aware, is of great importance, given the scale and severity of the housing crisis.  I do not want to be critical of the AHBs, nor do I oppose the principle that insofar as there is an approved housing body sector, it should be regulated.  We should have streamlining, with consistency in standards, processes of registration, proper governance, oversight of the financial behaviour of these entities and so on.  I see the logic in all that.  However, I cannot help but feel that in the same way social housing generally is a response to the failure of the private market to provide affordable housing for many people on low and middle incomes, the AHB sector is a response to the failure of the State to provide public housing.  It has to fill a gap left by the State's failure.  I worry when I hear the Minister say he has great ambition for the approved housing body sector.  That ambition seems to be growing at the expense of that for local authority housing - the direct provision of public housing by the Government and specifically the local authorities.</p> <p> I have heard some of the approved housing bodies indicate that they think the burden placed on them by the Government because of its failure to deliver public housing on the scale necessary is one that is very difficult for them to shoulder.  They do not really have the resources, scale and so on to deal with what the Government is trying to unload on them because of the failure of successive Governments to deliver public housing on the scale necessary via the local authorities.  It is a form of outsourcing.</p> <p> I am concerned that the Government hopes to deliver one third of the social housing units it hopes to deliver by 2021 via AHBs.  I do not know how that compares historically with the proportions they have delivered in the history of the State and perhaps the Minister might enlighten me.  Proportionately, it seems to be growing.  There is a correlation between the Government's ambition for the sector and the State's retreat from providing the public housing on the scale needed to address the housing crisis.</p> <p> With that comes the need for a new body which will cost a significant amount of money.  Given that we are where we are, to use that horrible phrase, I can see that we need the regulator.  However, it is another body to be set up to manage a fragmented and inconsistent social housing sector.  There are different tiers of AHBs and then we have the local authorities, none of which is quite the same.  The lines of accountability are different for different types of social housing.  The standards are different.  The rents are different.  In many cases the differential rents are different as between approved housing body housing and local authority housing.</p> <p> I will give a simple example I have come across.  I am more familiar with local authority housing.  If there are problems, for example, in the quality or maintenance of local authority housing, as there often is, it is possible to go directly to the local authority and say there is a problem.  If no response is forthcoming, a motion can be brought to the council.  The elected representatives can have motions passed to do something about certain things.  However, with AHBs it is not possible to do this.  Much of the money is provided by the State to the point where the ambition to get approved housing bodies off balance sheet has not been successful because the level of State support is such that they would not exist without public funding.  However, we do not have the same lines of accountability in being able to do something on behalf of the tenants if there is a problem. </p> <p> I am dealing with a case - it will be interesting to see how it unfolds - where a number of tenants in an approved housing body building have informed me of very bad sound insulation between units.  It does not affect just one or two tenants.  About half a dozen tenants have said they are absolutely tortured by the poor sound insulation between units.  By the way, they have said the standard of the units in which they have to live is different from the standard of units in the very same block which are not AHB units but which were built as private units, although they are being leased back under the HAP scheme.  That is the bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.  There is a group of AHB tenants and another group of HAP scheme tenants living in different standard accommodation according to the tenants.  This has been disputed by the AHB which claims there is no difference between them.  I am trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  However, it is made all the more difficult because we are dealing with all of these different situations.  There are local authority tenants, HAP scheme tenants and AHB tenants.</p> <p> In addition, I have discovered in the case of the AHB that there is also a private property management company.  With whom does one deal?  Is it the private property management company,which apparently looks after the common areas or the AHB?  As an elected representative, I cannot go to the local authority.  What is the role of the local authority in this instance?  It not the same.  Social housing tenants are in a totally different situation, depending on whether they are in an AHB unit, a local authority house or a HAP scheme tenancy.  It is different again if they are in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It could be different again, depending on whether it is tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 of the approved housing body.  To me, that is a problem.</p> <p> I do not blame the AHBs for this problem because, as I said, they often arose as voluntary charity organisations that were trying to fill a gap that the State had failed to fill.  While their intentions are good, it seems that the Government is taking advantage of the situation in a way that ultimately is problematic from the point of view of ensuring consistency in the quality and standard of social housing and the rights of tenants in social housing.  There is no consistency in rents.  There is no consistency in whom one approaches if one has a problem.  There is no consistency in the role elected public representatives have in being able to intervene on behalf of tenants.  The Government seems to be making the situation worse overall because of its ambition to unload it all on the approved housing body sector, instead of doing it in the more traditional way through providing local authority housing.  I have a problem in that regard.</p><p>I do not know what to say about it because on the one hand I genuinely recognise that the people in these AHBs are trying to do a good thing but on the other hand I have a problem with that inconsistency from the point of view of tenants and all sorts of anomalies are thrown up about it.  A person in a council house can transfer much more easily than a person in an approved housing body, AHB.  If the family grows and goes from a two-bedroom need to a three or four-bedroom need and much of the AHB stock is one or two bedrooms, the family cannot transfer back to the local authority.  Even if it is nominated from the local authority list to go into an AHB house, which it might be very glad of at the time, if its need changes it cannot be transferred back.  It seems to me the family should be able to transfer.</p> <p> The same resources are not available to approved housing bodies to deal with maintenance or anti-social issues.  There is very little consistency in all of this.  Many of the AHBs simply do not have the resources to deal with these situations.  There is a big problem.  Having a regulator may streamline it a bit more but is there not a problem in the lack of consistency of standards and rights for tenants, rents and so on in different types of social housing?  A person in social housing should have the same rights and standards regardless of the type of social housing they are in.  None of this is an attack on the AHBs but it is a significant concern I have about just how fragmented and inconsistent the situation is and consequently how tenants in different types of social housing or different AHBs are in different situations.  Even I, as an elected representative who is reasonably knowledgeable about these things, often find myself very confused as to who to go to and what power I have to intervene on behalf of tenants depending what type of social housing or what type of AHB we are talking about, whether it is council housing, HAP, rental accommodation supplement, RAS, or whatever.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in response to this and how the Bill progresses over the next few Stages. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400043#QQ00200"><p>On the surface this Bill sounds pleasant enough citing increased regulation for the AHB sector and the establishment of an independent regulator with functions to include establishing and maintaining a register of AHBs and also preparing draft standards, monitoring and assessing compliance by AHBs, including undertaking investigations.  However, once we dig deep we unearth what seems to be a cover for both the Government's failings in the provision of housing for its citizens as well as an open invitation to bring in more private investors into the property market.</p>  <p>  The Bill as presented will mean that regulation and monitoring within the AHB sector will be duplicated.  The stated rationale of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for introducing statutory regulation is ensuring the governance and the financial viability of the sector, safeguarding the State's contribution towards AHBs in respect of housing assets and providing assurance to tenants, the public and investors.  All this is proposed, despite the fact that the Housing Agency already exists to do much of what the Bill proposes.  Standards have already been drafted for AHBs and a voluntary code of conduct enacted.  Monitoring and assessing compliance is going through the Housing Agency while the agency has a registry of AHBs in the country.  Why the duplication and the establishment of another quango with powers the Housing Agency already has?  Why not statutorily enhance the powers of the Housing Agency, increase the number of staff within it, which is being proposed for the establishment of a regulator anyway, and widen the remit of the RTB to protect tenants under AHBs and increase tenant rights under the agency?  It can mean only one thing which is that the Government is attempting to attract private finance into the country from private investors.  This way the Government can keep social housing off the Exchequer books and hand over even more of the responsibility to the sector, thereby reducing the burden of its provision of social housing for people in the country.  Fine Gael really has not learned anything from the past decade or two whereby private entities speculated over the housing market causing a catastrophic recession leading us to where we are now, which is an over-speculated market, increased financialisation of home ownership and the private market finding its feet again while the number of homeless families has increased by 178% since June 2015 and where more than one in three people in emergency accommodation is a child.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael has learned to be cunning in the way it increases the role of private finance in Ireland and this Bill is clearly a smokescreen to do just that while covering themselves by saying it is to protect tenants' rights.  Traditional grant funding of AHBs by the Exchequer has been replaced with increased use of loan finance, that is a fact and, yes, as a result there are new challenges for the sector in terms of attracting funding to increase the number of units growing, however loan finance is not the answer to the ongoing housing crisis.  Now more than ever we need a national social housing programme because the greater the role loan finance has the less of a role the Government will play in its duty to provide housing to its citizens.  Furthermore, recent changes by the CSO and EUROSTAT to reclassify tier 3 AHBs, the largest ones in terms of housing units, as general Government sector means their expenditure will go on the Government's balance sheet.  Loans taken by AHBs are expected to be &euro;1,683 million by 2019, which is an increase of 469% from 2016.  Relying solely on AHBs and loan finance to make up the housing numbers is not sustainable.  I believe AHBs were only ever meant to dominate the market as the private sector has.  They are there to provide a supporting role to the social housing sector and to cater for niche housing needs.  It is clear that Fine Gael is angling for AHBs and the private sector to dominate and eventually sideline social housing initiatives.  Just look at the scale: the Department estimates that AHBs have the capacity to deliver one third of the 47,000 new social housing units that are targeted up to 2021.  That is quite a sizeable chunk and will no doubt increase in line with the availability of loan finance in this country.</p>  <p>  While I agree with proper and effective regulation I believe it must be done for the right reasons by the appropriate authorities and with the resources necessary to monitor implementation.  Many Bills come through this House and once passed are never implemented due to resource constraints.  That is why I do not understand why the existing powers of the Housing Agency and the interim regulator within the Housing Agency cannot be expanded to do what this Bill attempts to do.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the right entities must be regulated and I find it interesting that local authorities have been largely left out of the question of increased regulation altogether.  The Government, while forcing duplicate regulation in other sectors, continues to fail to regulate its own stock.  The RTB still has no authority over local authority housing or the ability to protect local authority housing tenants.  If the Government is so concerned about tenant rights in this Bill why not go back to the RTB and enhance protections there?  AHBs are required to adhere to the compliance framework, which is regulated under the voluntary regulation code managed by the regulation office in the Housing Agency.  AHBs must also go through rigorous reporting with insurance companies but when it comes to local authorities, they can just walk in and do what they like.  What standards do they have to comply with and who is regulating them?  Constituents come to our offices with concerns about the standard of their local authority housing, with local authorities not responding to the individual's housing needs or not responding on time to repair what needs fixing.  AHBs are required to have a sinking fund, a fund which allows them to continue to manage their housing stock if it happens to go bust.  It is three times the amount that local authorities are required to have.</p><p> I disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett about AHBs.  There is more input from tenants to have problems resolved, given that AHBs are the resource to do that whereas the local authorities are not.  That is the Government's responsibility but it does not provide the local authorities with resources to hire people to deal with the tenants under their responsibility.  One of the selling points the Government uses for AHBs is that they are great because they interact with tenants and have a proactive way of dealing with them.  It is simply because local authorities are not given the funding to do the same, which is the problem.  While it is true that it may be different in Dublin because there are different regimes among all the local authorities, which is a problem, in County Donegal at least, AHBs have a more proactive role in tenant management than the local authority, although that is because the latter is not funded to do it and is not required to do it, which is the real problem.  Local authority housing would be managed a lot better if the local authorities had the same responsibilities as AHBs.</p> <p> The crux of the issue lies in the Bill's main goal, namely, to have AHBs subsidise the private sector by buying private units to turn them into social housing.  If AHBs are subsidising the private market, the private market profits off the State.  Meanwhile, the State fails to build on its own stock and increases the role of loan finance to address people's housing needs.  Appropriate regulation where it is needed, regulating what should be regulated by the appropriate body, should be central to any legislation.  The Bill, however, fails to regulate appropriately where regulation is needed, which is at the existing bodies that already manage various aspects of the housing sector.  Given that it has been done in the case of AHBs, why are we bringing in new legislation?  It does not make sense.  The House's time would be better spent dealing with matters on which we can make a difference rather than bringing in such legislation.  It is less about reassuring the public or tenants in AHB units than reassuring private investors they hold a special place in the Government's heart.</p></speech>

I am a former board member of Caisle&aacute;n Nua Voluntary Housing Association and one of the instigators of a voluntary group of laypeople who set up a wonderful organisation because of an horrendous attack on a vulnerable person.  We held a community alert meeting in a full hall.  As ever, until there is trouble and everything is fine, nobody attends.  A wonderful vision emerged from the meeting.  A board was set up and delivered 14 social housing units.  It might not have been hundreds or even dozens but there were 14 in the small village of Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Siuire, Tiobraid &Aacute;rann theas.  I salute the board members and volunteers, many of whom were, and remain, much older than I am.  Some of them are now in their 80s.  They did a gallant job, without professionals on the board.  I thank the housing officer on the county council at the time, Mr. John O'Mahony, who has since retired, and Mr. Donal McManus from the Irish Council of Social Housing, ICSH, for the advice and support we received.</p>  <p>  The matter is a patchwork, like a quilt.  Does the Minister of State know the song, "Forty Shades of Green", which referred to a blanket one's mother might make?  He is trying to introduce catch-all legislation.  Small bodies do an excellent job, while some of the larger ones also do a good job.  The issue has changed so much.  I spent many years on the board of the ICSH and I met people such as the chairman, a lovely man whose name eludes me.  The ICSH did much work in Dublin, while many small groups did work throughout the country.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  The approach should be of the people, by the people, for the people.  We built 14 houses on the site in question and went on to build a further three special needs ones afterwards.  We built them in a field we procured from the county council.  There was not a step in the entire complex.  It was all level access.  The county council built houses in the same field, on the other side of it, with 11 or 12 bad steps up to the houses.  Some of the steps are nearly as bad as those in the Chamber.  The houses took five or six years to be built and were left unfinished for three winters.  We built ours in 14 months, from start to finish, without a professional on the board.  We hired in expertise, including an engineer and architect, Liam Long.  We received great support from the council at the time.  My point is that it can be done with a sense of meitheal and doing something for ourselves.   Completing the project was one of my proudest moments in public life.  I have been involved since 1986 in the community alert group, the second to be set up in the country, and it was one of the most satisfactory outcomes.  The next conference will be held in County Wexford in two weeks and I hope to attend.</p>  <p>  After a while, larger groups started to become involved, with more muscle power, and the dynamic of the board of the ICSH changed.  The larger groups, with many different names, came in from abroad and so on, and were welcomed.  Nevertheless, I saw an imbalance when they joined the sector.  One of the groups was set up by famous brothers.  There were Respond, Cl&uacute;id, Foscadh and - you name it - there is a plethora of them now.  They need regulations, as do all groups, including our community alert group, but regulation has gone bananas.  Two more schemes would have been built by our group, Caisle&aacute;n Nua, were it not for the regulation.  We now spend more time on compliance than we do talking about the needs of the people and further projects.  It overburdens people.  It is like everything else in this country: an overarching reach of Departments and regulations.  While some of the regulation is necessary, and accountability rightly ensures that every penny has to be accounted for, we were accounting and there was no waste.</p>  <p>  I outlined earlier the time it took us to build the project and that it took the council six years to build its dog's dinner of a project, in comparison with ours, in the same field.  We had no architects or anyone else on board.  We were only laypeople but we hired others in.  We received the capital assistance scheme funding and were delighted to do so.  We kept within budget because we had no choice.  There is too much regulation, with a catch-all effect, and we will have to go back to the drawing board and ease up in that regard.  The process was streamlined around the time we completed the project, in 1996, and approximately seven sections of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government were dealing with the issue throughout the country.  Approximately three or four years later, following much lobbying from the ICSH and others, the number of offices and various other places one had to contact was cut to two.  Gradually, however, during the recession and so on, mandarins put their hands on the matter again and there are now four or five places one must contact.  There is no need for it.  Such places do not help, much of the time, but make the process more difficult.  We must support and salute the vision of the late Canon Hayes, who said it was better to light a candle than curse the dark, and his spirit of helping one another, through the ESB, rural electrification and everything else.  We must support groups and not smother them with regulation and so on.  We must be sure they are supported and helped, and lift the cloak of regulation that has come down on top of them.</p>  <p>  I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We have no problems on our estate, where there is a caretaker who looks after any problems that arise.  Nobody has any bother approaching our board, of which I am now vice-chairman, while Mr. Tom Lonergan is chairperson.  I salute the board members.  The Minister of State mentioned the growth in the sector, which is phenomenal.  The sector can resolve the issue.  I do not refer to launches, Rebuilding Ireland and all the other measures he outlined such as big reports with nothing happening and nothing having been built.  There is not even a hen house in Toomevara or a dog's kennel in Carrick-on-Suir.  Tipperary County Council has an appalling record of building houses in recent years.  The voluntary sector can do it and will do it.  It is willing, fit and able to do it but needs to be allowed, without being stifled by unnecessary, overarching regulations and rules.</p>  <p>  The matter was one of my passions when I was involved in it.  There is energy in the sector to do more but it is utterly over-regulated, which is disappointing, as the Minister of State must know.  It is not a criticism of the officials accompanying the Minister of State but there are too many units in the Department that one must go through.  That is too much and we are killing the initiative of ordinary people.  It happens in the case of all clubs and communities because there is regulation after regulation but they do not give us a better society.  The Government should let the people who want to do it, that is, the leaders and visionaries who want to put the houses in place, build for themselves and not stifle them.</p></speech>

I, too, am unhappy with the appointment of another regulator and another group of people who will be appointed by the Minister of the day.</p><p>There is enough officialdom as it is if those people woke up and gave funding to local authorities to build the houses.  What difference will it make to have another regulator appointed by the Government?  The regulator will have to revert to the Government for approval to release funding in any case.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government demands a four-stage process when a project goes over &euro;2 million and one would not build even eight houses for that now with all the new regulations.  I do not approve of this.</p> <p> For almost two years I have spoken about how the Government is blocking the tenant purchase scheme, which allows people to buy their houses after living for 30 or 40 years in them.  Pensioners who have come into money are not allowed to purchase their houses despite giving 30 or 40 years to renting and maintaining a house to a high standard.  They are blocked from buying those houses, which is very wrong.  The money used to, in turn, go back to the local authority to refurbish voids and bring them back into circulation.  We now have a problem with the number of voids in Kerry and it is taking too long to turn them around.  I believe the authorities when they say they do not have the required funding.  What is wrong with the Government?  We were told in 2015 we would get &euro;65 million.  There was much hullabaloo from the Government at the time that Kerry was getting &euro;65 million for housing but I can tell the House we have nowhere near even a quarter of that drawn down four years later because we are being stifled by the Department and its four-stage process.  There is no order in what is going on.</p> <p> There is much comment about landlords blackguarding tenants or charging too much rent.  Most landlords are paying 52% of the money they receive in rent to the Government's coffers again.  If the Government wants to do something about the amount of rent charged, it will have to do something about the amount of tax being taken from landlords.  There are many good landlords and only a small minority does not comply with anything.  Landlords are getting out of the game because the system is so much against them.</p> <p> In Kerry, there are approximately 55 applicants on the local authority list for rural cottages and we will be lucky if 12 will be built between 2016 and 2021.  That is equivalent to 12 houses in five years in all County Kerry, which is not good enough.  The sites are provided and all we are asking for is the funding to build the houses.  We are not getting it and I believe the local authority when it says it is not getting that funding.  One rural cottage that has been built has no chimney, which is ridiculous, as it is in an area with turf all around it.  The people will not be able to burn one sod of turf because there is no chimney in the house.</p></speech>

Since this Government entered its second term, it has had different chances to solve the housing crisis and the problems we have in that area but all it seems to do is bring out reports.  I will relate what I have heard in County Kerry and around the rest of the country.  The people have heard about reports, consultative groups and changes in regulatory bodies or new legislation.  Meanwhile, people talk about criminalising people who rent properties.  It seems to be a regular occurrence for people here to criminalise the people who help in providing accommodation, which is not a good way of encouraging people to be involved in that side of things.  The day all people are knocked out of providing accommodation is the day the Government will perish on a rock; these people are taking up the slack when the Government is absent.</p>  <p>  As my brother correctly said, we should remember that if a person collects &euro;800 per month in rent, he or she will give the Government 52% of that before that person can do even one other thing.  That portion goes to the State.  These people must pay a mortgage and register with the RTB before they can do the painting, etc.  They do this with 48% of the turnover, so the Government should not forget it.  I am not referring to the Members present but some colleagues are talking about criminalising landlords.  Those people should remember that landlords act as tax collectors with 52% of the rent.  It is not that such people are looking for a medal but they do not want to be blackguarded either.  Our job is to have balance and to be fair.</p>  <p>  In my role as an elected representative, I deal with housing issues every day of the week.  I know people desperately want what is a basic and common right.  It is about having the security of a home instead of wondering if their time will be up next week, in three weeks or in six months.  If people have children and are in a house while in receipt of HAP, they should be able to know they can stay as long as they need or they wish, or until they get a local authority house.  I would dearly like to see people getting houses that they could eventually purchase.  I stood up week after week speaking about this to a previous Taoiseach.  I did everything bar get down on my hands and knees to beg him to introduce a tenant purchase scheme.  After years when it was not provided, the Government eventually initiated a scheme that few people can avail of.  They cannot qualify.  If it is a retired person or somebody who has saved money through hard work, even if these people have enough money, they are not allowed to purchase the property if they are not in full-time employment.  It is absolutely ridiculous and an insult to people.  Perhaps these people can get assistance from family members and wish to buy their family home, in which they have lived for 20, 30 or 40 years.  They are not allowed to buy it because they are not in full-time employment.  It is crazy.  The people who drafted the tenant purchase scheme should hang their heads in shame.</p></speech>

I asked people to introduce a scheme and when that was announced to much fanfare, it was a disgrace.  It was like selling people a pig in a poke.  On the one hand, people think the scheme is working but it is like a three card trick.  Now you see it and now you do not.  When a person wants to use it, that is not possible, but it still exists.  It is a complete joke.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath's comments on voluntary housing agencies.  I also recognise the work done by non-voluntary housing agencies in providing housing.  The long and the short of it is that we welcome any avenue from which we get housing.  We do not want layers of bureaucracy.</p><p>The best option would be to go back to what used to happen where local authorities would build a scheme of houses and give them to people who would live in them and then have the opportunity to purchase them when their finances improved and they got their legs under them.</p></speech>

The practical outcome of the beef price crisis agreement is that beef farmers, who continue to feel isolated, helpless and desperate, go back to the <i>status quo</i>.  They have been given a promise on price without any guarantee or commitment that a realistic base price will be paid for their premium product.  The base price can still be manipulated with little or no transparency.  This is not a good outcome for the farmer.  Even if beef farmers hit all the quality criteria, they will not get a price which comes near to the cost of production.</p><p>Farmers are the ticking heart of rural Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who is present, knows as well as I do that they are the core of rural Ireland.  They are not being protected from predatory meat processors.  Farmers are under serious financial and mental strain and feel badly let down by the Minister, Deputy Creed, the Government, the meat industry and Bord Bia.  Meat processors continue to make a handsome profit while paying the minimum possible price.  A profit can be made by all parties in the meat industry - producers, processors and retailers - if there is respect between the three components.  Unfortunately, that respect does not exist and was not engendered by the agreement hammered out last week.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that processors use their dominant position to maximize their profits at the expense of beef farmers, a situation that has not changed one iota as a result of the talks.  The essential recalibration of profit and loss in the beef industry has not taken place and the farmer still loses while everyone else wins.  There is enough of a margin in the industry to allow all involved to make a reasonable income.</p><p>Meat processors recognise the value of offal, the fifth quarter, yet the farmer gets nothing for that component of the animal.  It is an additional bonus for meat processors and generates additional profit for them at the expense of the farmer who is powerless to object.  Surely, farm organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must act on this type of sharp practice.</p><p>Bord Bia continues to promote Irish beef as an excellent product without referring to the fact that farmers are being exploited by being forced to sell beef cattle at a loss in order that all others can make a profit.  Bord Bia's welcome for the most recent agreement in order that normal business can resume does it little credit.  It will continue to promote Irish beef as a premium product while the beef farmer is being exploited.  That is not fair trade and it is not acceptable internationally.</p><p>Farmers were threatened with court action by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and pressurised by Meat Industry Ireland which played one farmer off against another and laid off factory workers rather than enter into face-to-face negotiations and pay a sustainable price.  Such behaviour is completely unacceptable.</p><p>The most important result of the dispute is the establishment of producer organisations which will be able to represent farmer in price negotiations.  It is a very positive development.  These organisations will convert farmers from price takers to price makers.  However, meat processors will try every trick in the book to undermine the establishment of producer organisations, which they regard as a threat to their profitability.  The Beef Plan Movement was approved as the first producer organisation and will be able to legally and collectively negotiate price on behalf of its members.  However, there needs to be several more such organisations for them to be fully effective.</p><p>Unfortunately, power has been consolidated in the hands of a small number of meat processors and that grip on power will not be easily loosened.  ABP Food Group, Dawn Meats and Kepak account for 65% of the total beef processing market.  SuperValu, Dunnes Stores and Tesco have 67% of retail sales between them, while Aldi and Lidl have 21%.</p><p>On the broader question of rural sustainability, if beef farming continues to be unviable, the economic sustainability of communities in counties Clare, Cork, Kerry and Tipperary will be put at risk.  All such rural communities will be put at risk.  Even in light of the agreement, the future for the traditional beef farmer looks bleak.  Unless the current economic model is re-calibrated, soon only industrial-style farms and feedlots will survive, with the loss of farm families from rural communities and the resultant knock-on effect of continued rural depopulation.  The cards are stacked against the family farm as a viable entity by greed and profit.  However, it does not have to be this way.  A fully independent investigation of the meat processing industry needs to be carried out and include an examination of pricing, trading and employment practices and compliance with taxation in order to ensure that it is not only farmers who are being exploited.  Fair trade is the only viable future for beef farming as anything less will spell the continued decline of rural Ireland.  The principles of the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas need to be revisited in order to re-establish a vision for rural sustainability.  Rural sustainability is built on the farming community.  I ask that the Government does not let it wither on its watch.</p></speech>

As my colleagues and I understand it, rural Ireland depends on suckler farmers and hillside sheep farmers.  In recent times, particularly the past two or three years, things have been getting worse for suckler farmers to the extent that they are not making ends meet.  They are losing money.  Suckler farmers have stated that they will cut down the number in their herds in spite of all the effort they have put in through the years because they cannot carry on.  They meet all environmental standards and abide by every rule and regulation, but they are not being paid a fair price.  The factories are nailing them to the cross while the retailers get away scot-free.  In the past three months there was little discussion of the role of retailers as most attention was rightly focused on the factories.</p><p>We will also have to focus on the retailers.  The farmers are the only ones who are still not being paid properly.  We are all glad that the strike has been stood down as this is the time of year when most beef cattle go into the factories; they are fat at this time of year and have reached the 13 months.  Many farmers were held up so it is good that it has been stood down for the time being but nothing has happened to the base price and I am worried that nothing will.  I believe the farmers will be back at the factory gates in the not too distant future.  I hope that I am wrong but I cannot see what will change.  They are not even answering to the producer organisations, and if they are not doing it now after the pressure that was put on them, they will not in time.</p> <p> Farmers must take all the risks, from breeding the proper calf to staying out all night to pull calves out until the calving season is over.  One can see that farmers are physically in poorer condition after the calving season given the time and effort they put in.  There is the cost of fertilisers and paying contractors for silage.  So many people in rural communities depend on farmers, from the shopkeeper, the person with the filling station and the fellows who deliver the oil.  They all live off the farmer and if the farmer goes bad, they will go bad shortly after.  That is how it is now.  Many farmers are under severe financial pressure.  We met so many at the gates who are in trouble paying college fees for their children who had returned to college some weeks earlier.  Back in 2004, when I was not long in Kerry County Council, it tabled a motion to watch the monopoly which was being created by the great supermarket bodies.  The motion said they were dictating what the farmer would be paid and that they would dictate what the customer would pay.  They have ensured they have a monopoly.  I heard at the gates where the protests were held that Aldi and Lidl have exacerbated the price issue.  The prices to the farmers are reduced all the time but we never see the price of meat on the shelves reduce.  I hope that the Minister of State is listening.  Regardless of what happens, when the farmer gets a bad price that is not reflected in a low price on the shelves in the Lidls or Aldis.</p> <p> The farmers were looking for the abolition of the four movement rule.  If a carcase is hanging, no human could say how many times that carcass had moved.  That rule is wrong and should be removed.  The 70-day retention period should be reduced to 21 days.  That was not acceded to.  The 30-month rule makes no sense at all.  The farmers were asking that this would be increased to 36 months.  That has not happened.  They are getting nothing at all for the fifth quarter and the factories are being paid handsomely for that.  They are getting at least &euro;200 per head for the fifth quarter while the farmer gets nothing.  However, it is the base price which is what the farmers are asking for.  The factories must give a base price and if they do not we will be back at the gates in a very short time.</p></speech>

Over the past eight years since Fine Gael came into government, beef farmers have experienced huge price volatility.  It is our belief that the Government stood idly by and did nothing to assist the struggling family farms.  Despite many pledges and promises by Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine during that time and commitments set down programme for Government, farmers have received no assistance in their pursuit for processor price transparency.</p>  <p>  Another example of the Government&rsquo;s contempt for beef farmers is the fact that myself and colleagues in the Rural Independent Group called on the Government to reconvene and have an emergency sitting as soon as farmers began to stand outside the gates of processing factories across the country.  That call was ignored and it was seven weeks before we, as Deputies, had an opportunity to address this crisis in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  That is shameful.</p>  <p>  I stood with farmers and their families at factories gates.  Their message is simple.  All they want is a fair price for their hard work and produce.  These are decent hard working people, many of whom have never been on the picket line in their life.  They did not want to be there but they felt they had no other choice as no one was listening.</p>  <p>  Without immediate intervention and action by the Government, rural development will continue to be under threat due to an avoidable destabilisation of the beef sector export market caused by the delay in realising commitments provided for in the programme for a partnership Government.  We in the Rural Independent Group call on the Government to lay out a clear pathway toward avoiding the deepening of threats to rural development by honouring the commitments in the programme for a partnership Government with respect to introducing a framework for producer organisations and the development of producer organisations.</p>  <p>  We demand that the Government renew its promises in the charter for rural Ireland.  This charter outlined a vision of a &ldquo;dynamic, adaptable and outward looking multi-sectoral economy supporting vibrant, resilient and diverse communities&rdquo;.  That is what we all want to see in rural Ireland.  We also believe that the Government must explore the merits of introducing a system of fixed-price contracts for beef producers in order to diminish the price volatility experienced by farmers.</p>  <p>  It would not cost the Government a great deal to resolve the crisis but it would have to tackle the large retailers, which it does not want to do, and it would have to tackle the factories, which it does not want to touch.  We, the farmers of Ireland, and I have a conflict of interest in that I am a farmer, and the citizens of this country need an independent investigation into the goings on inside our factories and it needs to be done quickly.  A full report must be published and criminal proceedings must be brought against any wrong-doers whoever they may be if wrong-doing is going on.  It might sound strong but the farmers of this country deserve it.  For far too long the farmers were silent.  They assumed they should get the meat weight of the animal but how wrong they were.  For the first 40 minutes, when an average weight animal is slaughtered, 45 people work on that animal.  Imagine 45 people working on a slaughtered average sized animal.  What could be so valuable that there would be 45 people working on it in 40 minutes.  That animal is hugely valuable; every part of it is sold.  The blood has a value for making red and white protein powder in Craigavon.  It is alleged that every farmer's details are on computers in factories.  What about GDPR?  Are all our details freely available?  This  is very controlling.  Does the House know that there is a value of the cow's udder or that there is 20 kg of meat on the cow's head?  When cutting the carcass, fat is used for soap and shaving foam.  Does the Minister of State know exactly what goes on in the bone halls of these factories?  Does he know what really happens?  I would like to know what really happens to poor quality animals.  There is a market for the tongue, for the throat, and I could go on forever.  Nobody wants to know about this.  The farmer gets &euro;700 or &euro;800 for the animal but the man inside the factory is making hundreds on hundreds of euro, perhaps running into thousands of euro, on the animal and yet there is nobody willing to stand up for the farmer.  These farmers have wised up strongly.</p>  <p>  One thing the farmers were strong about last week was that they wanted a base price.</p><p>The factories, the Minister, the State, and all the powers that be were telling everybody to leave the gates, but nobody was willing to tackle the issue that the farmer could not get an improvement on the base price.  I stood with the farmers in Bandon mainly - I was in Cahir as well - nearly every day of the protest.  Sometimes I gave them ten minutes and sometimes I gave them two or three hours.  The one cry from these genuine men and women, and young children who had an interest in the future of their farms, was that they were being terribly wronged and they were going out of business.  These are honest to God people.  They are not the type of people who would usually go protesting but they knew this was the only channel left to them.  They will be back because nothing will happen.  The power of the factories and the large retailers has taken over this country.  Statements that were being continually made through this protest by Minister after Minister were totally in line with the statements the factories were making, so who is talking on behalf of the farmer?  That is what we need to know.  We need to know that soon and we need action on the ground.  In the next few weeks we will be watching every movement that goes on in this Government on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400048#VV00200"><p>I am glad to speak on this issue again, notwithstanding the fact we had lengthy discussions on it last week.  I am always happy to talk about farming and all matters related to farming.  I share the serious concerns about the ongoing difficulties facing the beef sector and I understand the frustration that has driven some farmers to engage in prolonged picketing of beef factories.</p>  <p>  The weekend before last, the Minister, Deputy Creed, facilitated lengthy negotiations involving beef stakeholders to try to find a resolution to the current dispute.  These were only the latest talks in a series of formal discussions between beef stakeholders that have been facilitated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These commenced with a meeting on 12 August and continued over the past month.  In addition, both the Minister, Deputy Creed, and I have had ongoing bilateral discussions and meetings with farm organisations, representatives and individual farmers.  The common thread in discussions was that all parties agreed it was critical to find a means of getting the sector fully operational and protecting the livelihoods involved, including both beef farmers and factory workers, whose jobs were at risk.  The talks of the weekend of 14 and 15 September culminated in an agreement between the meat industry and seven farming organisations and representatives, all of whom undertook to support the agreement and recommend that those on the protests step back in response to this negotiated agreement.  The agreement is a two-strand approach aimed at providing immediate benefits direct to beef farmers as well as addressing long-term structural issues.  A means to implement and measure progress on these measures was also set out and agreed.</p>  <p>  As part of the deal, beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses.  These include an increase of 66% in the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12 cent per kilogram to 20 cent per kilogram; the introduction of a new bonus of 8 cent per kilogram for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months that meet all the non-age related existing in-spec criteria and that up to now have not received any bonus; and the introduction of a new in-spec bonus of 12 cent per kilogram for steers and heifers under 30 months in the categories of grade O- and fat score 4+ that currently do not qualify for any bonus.  The in-spec 70-day residency requirement will be reduced to 60 days on the last farm.  These measures offer an immediate financial benefit.  They both increase the level of bonus being paid and increase significantly the number of animals that are eligible for a bonus.  The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steers and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus payment on top of the base price to be paid.</p>  <p>  A beef market task force is being established immediately to provide leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in economic, environmental and social sustainability.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will appoint an independent chair to lead the task force.  Its membership will comprise members from the Department, relevant State agencies, and nominees from farm organisations and the meat industry.  The task force will provide for a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  It will also offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.</p>  <p>  Other key immediate actions include the development by Bord Bia of a beef market price index model, and a scientific review of the quality payment grid.  The second strand of the agreement sets out strategic measures that seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.  These measures will provide clear information and bring greater transparency to the sector with a view to ensuring sustainability of the sector into the future.  A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain were agreed upon.  The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.  The agreement includes commitments on an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector, and an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain.  The results will inform further actions as necessary.</p>  <p>  The beef industry will co-operate in providing data and initiatives on improving information on carcass classification.  It is imperative that we have the hard facts about third-country and customer requirements to inform discussions on market specifications.  The independent review will provide clarity around those requirements.  A country exporting the vast majority of its products is dependent on a range of market requirements.  The agreement also includes commitments on more detailed price reporting, more reporting on carcass classification, and the transposition of the EU directive on unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied the agreement contains the best balance of immediate benefits for beef farmers and a series of more medium-term strategic actions.  The entry into force of the agreement is contingent on the cessation of all protests and blockades.  All parties to the agreement took responsibility for ensuring this would happen by recommending the agreement to those they represent.  The situation was doing immeasurable damage to the sector and its reputation in overseas markets, which account for 90% of all the beef we produce.  With the future of the beef sector in the balance, I welcome that the protests have been stood down.  We must now focus on the implementation of the agreement and look to the future of the sector.</p>  <p>  Direct payments and payments from the rural development programme, RDP, represent significant EU and national Exchequer support for the beef sector.  The Department estimates that at least half of the &euro;1.8 billion in annual supports to farmers goes to beef farmers.  Within that, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is the main support specifically targeted at the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period.  The Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  In addition to the BDGP, other supports that are available for suckler farmers under Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, include the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the areas of natural constraints schemes, ANCs, and knowledge transfer groups.  Suckler farmers also benefit from the basic payment scheme, BPS, and greening payments under CAP Pillar 1.  In addition, this year a provision of up to &euro;120 million was made available in targeted support for beef farmers through the beef exceptional aid measure, which is being provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty arising out of Brexit and the beef environmental efficiency programme, BEEP.  The Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector, in preparation for the next iteration of CAP.  My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, announced last week recognition for the first time of a beef producer organisation in Ireland.  I firmly believe that producer organisations are an important part of the toolkit in building resilience in the sector by strengthening the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.</p><p>Funding provided for the establishment of beef producer organisations is available under the current rural development programme.  This funding is available to support the engagement of Department approved facilitators to assist with the application process for recognition of producer organisations.  Funding is available for each group of up to a total of &euro;3,000.  Department officials have engaged extensively with potential groups since the inception of the measure in 2016 and one of the commitments from the Backweston agreement in August was that officials would engage to the fullest extent possible to assist with the establishment of beef producer organisations.  This commitment was clearly demonstrated through the engagement with the newly established group, which has publicly acknowledged the level of support it has received from Department officials in this regard.  Furthermore, the establishment of the first producer organisation in the beef sector is an important and timely signal to farmers that they can collectively do business in a way that enables them to have increased bargaining power as well as helping them to increase their economic and environmental efficiency through collaboration, with the potential for enhanced knowledge sharing and economies of scale.  My Department is currently exploring the role producer organisations should play under the next CAP and how best to facilitate this.  Producer organisations not only have the potential to improve the position of farmers in the supply chain but also to provide strong relationships between the elements of the supply chain to the benefit of all.</p> <p> Developing new markets and growing existing markets on the basis of market insights is one of the five themes of Food Wise 2025.  Market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the agrifood sector, particularly for beef producers.</p></speech>

That is only right considering the very difficult position farmers find themselves in, the unacceptable incomes they receive and the low prices they are taking for their beef.  I commend the Rural Independent Group on tabling this motion, which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports.  Given the stand farmers have taken for the past eight weeks, out of pure desperation and frustration at the way they have been treated in the beef and food supply chain in recent years, it is essential that the agreement that was signed and which led to the removal of protests and pickets across the country is acted upon urgently and immediately.  A key aspect of that is the beef task force, which must be established promptly and a chairman appointed in order that it can carry out its work and deliver results.  It is essential that transparency, which has previously been lacking, is brought into the Irish beef sector because farmers cannot see what level of fair play they are or are not getting.  They have not been getting fair play and have been repeatedly forced to take price drops while all other players in the sector have been able to maintain their margins.  It is also essential that specifications such as the 30-month rule, the four-movement rule and the 60-day residency are thoroughly examined.  Those issues have been clouding the sector and the task force must address them.  The Government's contribution must include a new support scheme to follow on from the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme.  Issues with the BEAM scheme also need to be addressed, but we need a support scheme to support farmers in response to the losses they have suffered since May.  That is something the Government needs to act upon and deliver.</p></speech>

I also commend the Rural Independent Group on introducing the motion.  Our family farm structure is under threat like never before.  I wonder if the processors have been listening to the farmers in recent weeks.  The 30-month rule, which has been a major bone of contention, is a leftover from the BSE crisis of a generation ago.  The differential in price remains even after seven or eight weeks of pickets.  Bord Bia has come in for much criticism in the last few weeks and the recognition of the job it does has been lost in the crossfire.  Farmers have lost confidence in Bord Bia.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure a certain level of the agency's funding is ring-fenced for supporting live exports because there is a belief that no effort is being made to secure outlets for live exports or move live cattle out of the country.  Live exports were always the safety valve that kept competition in the trade.  Hopefully, when the producer groups are established, they will allow family farmers to have the same clout as feedlots in securing a reasonable price.  Feedlots have clearly been getting preferential prices over the small operators with five or ten cattle, and that has to end.  The crisis fund must also be extended and a commitment made to farmers on that.  Unfortunately, farmers' losses have increased since the 12 May deadline for the crisis fund passed.  It is essential that the Government shows its commitment to farmers by extending the crisis fund to offset some of the losses incurred during the summer months.</p></speech>

We are well aware that farmers, who are the primary producers, are losing money while the processors are making millions and retailers are also doing very well out of beef.  Is there any way to get retailers to the table to help resolve the problem that one party, the primary producer, is not making any profit from beef?  While some progress has been made on issues around age of slaughter and cattle movements, we have not yet had any input from retailers as to what price they are willing to accept or at what price they would be willing to sell to the public.  While progress has been made and I welcome the lifting of the blockades, progress would not have been made had it not been for the actions in which the farmers reluctantly engaged.  That is what finally got people around the table and got talks under way.  I hope it does not require similar action to get retailers around the table to negotiate what we all want, which is a fair price for primary producers for their quality product.</p></speech>

If we are to be serious about ensuring we have a profitable beef industry, we have to take radical steps.  I come to this debate as a suckler farmer.  The beef task force being set up must take a clinical look at processors.  An industrial engineer should look at the factories, including their costs, outputs and work processes.  Financial accountants should also advise the task force on the factories' assets, depreciation and overheads.  We all know factories have to run a profit because nobody will survive without a profit but, as we go forward in these negotiations, we and the farming community need to clearly understand what margin the factories are achieving.  Over the summer, the critical issue was that the factories were making millions of euro, as the previous speaker said, and the farmers were making nothing.  We have to take a radical approach.  We should get an industrial engineer to look at the factories and financial accountants to look at the costs involved in order that farmers can make a legitimate claim to have a viable income.  Agriculture is clearly the biggest indigenous industry on the island of Ireland.  Given the various incomes streams it generates, it is vital that we protect the sector.  If the Government is serious about doing so, the legitimate expectations debated here both last week and today, and the advice from the farming community, have to be listened to like never before because we are in a serious crisis.</p></speech>

Right across Europe dairy prices are strengthening, but what is happening in Ireland and in west Cork?  The prices are weakening.  Beef farmers in west Cork are on their knees.  Beef farming is no longer sustainable.  The farmers in west Cork cannot make a living from farming any longer.  They had no option but to picket a meat factory in Bandon, which had the knock-on effect of temporary job losses and, in essence, had a very detrimental effect on the economy of my home town of Bandon.  I call on the Minister of State to please look after my farmers in Cork South-West.</p></speech>

It outlines how the beef sector has been failed repeatedly by the Government in the lack of price transparency and the way the commitment to producer groups, made in the programme for Government, has not been delivered for so long.</p>  <p>  I have raised the beef farming issue previously in the Chamber and how the farmers are in such a distressed situation due to falling incomes and increased costs.  The 140,000 farming families throughout the State are the engines of the rural economy. They are the people who spend locally in the co-op or the shop.  They drive their local economies and they support the rural communities through clubs, schools and community organisations.</p>  <p>  Even though so much money is generated in the agrifood sector, it is not there for the farmer to any extent, and especially not for the beef sector farmers, who are averaging &euro;8,000 income per annum, or sheep farmers, who average &euro;14,000 per annum income.  They are under phenomenal pressure.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that farmers really feel treated unfairly and unjustly in that they are not getting value for the huge amount of work they are putting in and for the high-quality product they produce.  The beef market task force must meet its timelines and deliver.  Farmers should be able to get a share out of the fifth quarter.  There must be a CAP market disturbance aid for price losses since the summer.</p></speech>

A viable agrifood industry, be it dairy, beef, suckler, sheep or crops, is the backbone of rural Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Rural Independent Group motion.  The past two years especially have been very difficult for farm families and rural areas.  A thriving agriculture business means strong rural communities that support each other through thick and thin, through the good times and the bad.  Last year farmers went through a fodder crisis and a drought, and this year it is the beef crisis.  The farming sector is lurching from crisis to crisis with a reactive approach by Government instead of a proactive approach.</p>  <p>  A compromise was reached last week that has enabled farmers to return to their farms and workers in meat processing factories to return to work.  It is important now that space is given to farm organisations to advocate all aspects of the deal to their members and that Meat lndustry Ireland, MII, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine ensure that all agreed actions are implemented promptly.</p>  <p>  Irish farmers are being crippled by low prices, market volatility, labour shortages, bad weather, and a lack of competition in some sectors.  Combined with these, stark challenges remain on the international front such as the EU-Mercosur trade deal with South America, the UK exit from the EU, and meeting our climate change responsibilities.  These challenges will not be easy.  A just transition is required, with Government supports, to ensure that farm families and rural areas can continue to live, thrive and work, support their communities, raise their families and make a fair living.</p></speech>

The family farm model of agriculture in this country is really struggling at the moment.  It means that our local rural communities and rural way of life are struggling also.  When farmers have money, they spend it in their local communities and in their shops.  When no money is being spent in our local communities, the local shops are not doing well.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes in this model of family farm agriculture and supports it.  The agrifood sector employs more than 250,000 people in rural communities and is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland, with food and drink exports reaching &euro;13.9 billion in 2018.  That does not mean that the farmer as the primary producer is getting that - not at all.  The average farm family income in 2018 was just over &euro;23,000, which lags far behind the average industrial wage.  More than 40% of farms are actually earning an income of less than &euro;10,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Members have spoken over recent years about the beef crisis, and we all welcome that the strike is now over.  Part of the reason farmers had to go out and strike was the complete lack of trust.  This led to the strike.  Commitments have been made and they must be adhered to.  Trust has to be built with the farmers and in the rural communities.  We need fair prices, trust and transparency.</p>  <p>  Irish farmers are being crippled by low prices, market volatility, bad weather, and stark challenges on the international stage such as Mercosur on the horizon and Brexit.  We need to support our farm families and our rural communities.  Supporting our farmers is one of the first steps towards doing that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="21:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400050#XX00500"><p>I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak, and I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing this motion before the House.  Anybody from a rural community will thoroughly understand that the past eight weeks have been very difficult, not just for the farmers on the picket lines but also for the staff inside the gates and for the farming families at home who let the farmers out to go to the picket lines.  It was also difficult for the rural communities that did not have the investment from the sale of the stock, because that sale did not take place.</p>  <p>  I have a number of requests to ensure we have sustainability of rural farming families and that this business continues.  First is that the Minister of State's Department would encourage MII to engage with the new producer organisation, also known as the PO.  There is no point in us having the licence for a PO if Meat Industry Ireland and its plants do not engage with it.  It would be completely useless.  We need to encourage it and explain the value of having it.  If a producer organisation can quote for a price, and price was the main issue that could not be discussed at any of the talks the last time, then this vehicle could be a lifeline for small farmers throughout the country.  We openly acknowledge, and I personally acknowledge, the work done by the Department in ensuring that the PO was formed and that it is now on the table.  It is worthless, however, unless we encourage, educate and inform the farming community of the value of it.  We see the value of such a measure across Europe but we should now see its value here on our Irish soil.  We should work to ensure that farmers can have value in their produce and value through the price chain, because this is what they want and it is the area in which they feel they have not had fairness.</p>  <p>  My second request is around transparency, an issue that my good colleague Deputy Michael Moynihan, addressed earlier.  I refer to transparency within the factory, with the grid and around the calibration of the weighing scales.  Farmers do not trust that system.  Trust has left that arena for farmers with the industry.  This is very unfortunate and it needs to be re-established.  The trust needs to be brought back.  We need to centre trust, loyalty and respect.  It is a two-way street.  For far too long the factories have taken away that trust.  It has been lost.  No matter how much can be done at this time, we have to help rebuild that trust.  The best way to do this is through the task force sitting regularly, perhaps a minimum of every two weeks.  If the Minister of State does nothing else this week within the Department he could give us a start date for the first task force review.  Let us set out the agenda and see who is the independent chairman.  Let us bring in the farming organisations and all the other people and companies who are involved.</p><p>For the last number of weeks, Bord Bia has taken an incredibly hard battering.  We need to re-establish confidence in it, taking into account the worldwide interest in our primary product, namely, Irish beef.  We export 90% of our beef.  Confidence in that market needs to be re-established.  In terms of new markets and the possible onslaught of Brexit, we need to restore that confidence.  This can only be done through transparency within the sector.  We need transparency throughout the system, from the arrival of cattle in the back of lorries at the factories, the weighing process and so on.  Transparency was one of the issues discussed at the first round of talks which took place within the farming organisations.  We need to refocus our efforts in this area.</p> <p> Family farms and local communities depend on this business.  I come from a county which has the largest suckler herd in the country.  My county is totally and utterly dependent on it.  Galway needs the suckler farmer and the beef farmer.  We need to ensure there is longevity in those areas.  People who stood on the picket line did so because they wanted to ensure a future for their children and grandchildren, that they would have the values of growing up with what their predecessors had.  They do not want to see everybody moving to the cities or emigrating.  They want to retain an ethos and a value within rural Ireland.  They want to ensure that their local post offices, Garda stations, schools and communities will survive.  As stated by those on the picket line in Athleague and at Liffey Meats in Ballinasloe, they do not want to see the gate going up at the Shannon or for the west of Ireland to become the playground for the east.  They feel very strongly about that.  We want those on the benches opposite to come forward with a date for the review task force.</p></speech>

For decades now, rural Ireland has been damaged and neglected by successive Government policies.  The evidence of this can be seen in the closure of banks, health centres, marts and many other important facilities across the country.  Broadband remains unavailable and in many parts of the country public transport is almost non-existent.  Parts of the midlands region is in danger of becoming a rust belt owing to a lack of investment or serious job creation projects.  God knows how much longer rural Ireland will have to wait for broadband.  Provision in this regard has been a total mess owing to the privatisation by this Government and its predecessors of Eir and the current botched procurement process.  This matter needs to be addressed now.</p><p>We are in the midst of a severe crisis within the beef sector as family farms across rural Ireland face the threat of closure.  Fine Gael has been in government for eight years now and rural Ireland has never felt so isolated and under pressure.  I thank the Rural Independent Group for proposing this motion, which fairly accurately reflects what is happening.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to the motion, which I hope the Rural Independent Group and others in this House will consider supporting.  It is about transparency in pricing.  There has been much talk here over the past 20 minutes about transparency.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment provides parties across the House with an opportunity to support it.</p><p>A major issue now in the beef sector is the lack of trust between the processors and the farmers.  We need to deal with that issue and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is a serious attempt to do that.</p><p>There are issues such as the base price for which we cannot legislate.  The factories have a role to play in setting a fair beef price.  The deal that was agreed, while not perfect, represents progress but it needs to be built on.  Much is dependent on the setting of a fair base price.  We need to underpin transparency with legislation.  The Bill put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in provides for transparency between the processor and the primary producer.  </p><p>Currently, a small group of powerful cartel-like processors are taking advantage of a system in which farmers are denied basic information.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment calls on the Government to establish a beef market observatory which would require processors to publish daily price reports.  I raised this issue last week with the Minister, Deputy Creed, and Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, when they assured me that would give serious consideration to the proposed legislation.  I hope that they will reiterate that on the record today.  We understand the legislation is not a silver bullet and it certainly does not meet all the farmers' demands but it would go some way towards ending the manipulation of prices and rebuilding the vital trust that is needed.  It would also address a lot of the key issues in the sector.</p><p>I support the call in the motion for a commitment to introduce a framework for producer organisations in the beef sector.  Time will tell whether these producer organisations are the answer.  Farmers are divided on the issue.  Some farmers have told me that they will not work but we must give them a chance.  I have never seen a situation where a combination has been bad.  There is always strength in numbers, whether workers, farmers or any other group.  Currently, we have an Independent Farmers of Ireland producer organisation and we are soon to have a beef farmers of Ireland producer organisation.  It is very important that we find a way to allow farmers to negotiate on a level playing field with processors and the producer organisation provides an opportunity for small and medium sized farmers to come together to fight as a collective.</p><p>What we need now from the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the putting in place of the relevant technical support and legislation to ensure that these farmers are given the best opportunity possible to make the system work and to build on the deal that has been negotiated.</p><p>I want now to touch on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Previously, we had a system of farm payments which was based on historical entitlements, which served only to preserve inequality as some farmers received more per hectare than others.  There are huge variations in terms of what farmers receive in payments.  We need to address this issue.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long supported an upper limit of &euro;60,000 per annum for basic payments, with farmers having the option of topping up their payments through participation in environmental schemes.  This would allow for front-loaded payments for the development of small and medium sized farms.  It would offer additional supports proportionally for those small and medium sized farms and it would also reward farmers for good environmental practices and build on some of the existing schemes.  It is disappointing that the Government continues to advocate for direct payments to be capped at &euro;100,000, with loopholes that will allow payments above this limit.  Some of the beef processing factories are claiming these benefits.  This is deeply unjust.</p><p>We need to be focus our attention on new income streams for farmers and rural Ireland.  Renewable energy development, in particular biomass and biogas, present us with a huge opportunity in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is interested in forestry.  There is a huge opportunity that we need to grab with both hands.  Bord na M&oacute;na imports biomass from South America.  There is land around the power stations in west Offaly, Edenderry and Lanesborough that could be used to grow biomass.  There is a surplus of straw this year.  Straw is the second best fuel for use in biomass.  There are huge opportunities in the forestry sector.  I would like the Government to give serious consideration to the opportunities in solar, small-scale wind and, in some case, hydro energy.  We accept that Bord na M&oacute;na has to move away from peat production but this has to happen in a sustainable and fair way.  We need to have a fair and just transition.</p><p>The biomass supply chains have the potential to replace peat production and to fuel the three midlands power stations.  Hundreds of new jobs can be created in the midlands with renewable energy development.  We need to give this serious consideration.  I have brought forward several policy papers and Bills in this area.  We also have a very large agricultural sector which creates an abundance of slurry, animal and crop waste.  This waste can be used to produce biogas which is a renewable source of energy.  Germany has over 6,000 biogas plants.  England has 600 and Ireland has only one feeding in the grid, which is the Billy Costello facility in Nurney.  We need the Government to start thinking about the future of rural Ireland and to begin the process of developing other income streams for farmers.  As we move away from the current situation, farmers and all of us, Opposition and Government, must start thinking about the creation of new income streams.  It is not sustainable into the future for us to compete with other countries where farmers are not dependent on beef or dairy and have supplementary incomes from energy and other sources.</p><p>We do not want the Government to be commentators and we should not be commentators.  We must all be active around this and create new jobs and new sources of energy.  In the short term, I urge the Government to play its part to make sure the deal agreed between the beef processors and the farmers is built on and implemented in full so we can ensure the future of beef farming in this country.</p></speech>

One of the key elements of the beef crisis, which is one of the things that has led to the focus on this, is the suckler farmer.  Suckler farmers in the west of Ireland are under significant stress.  When one looks at the economics of it, one can see that they do not work very well.  I commend the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the committee's report on this.  The suckler cow is kept every year and costs more than the calf is worth as a weanling when it is sold.  That is the only thing that cow is producing.  This is the stark reality concerning where the problem lies with regard to the suckler farmer.  It costs more to keep the incubator farmers use to produce the animal than the animal itself so suckler farmers are totally dependent on the money they get in the post through direct farm payments, the GLAS scheme and other schemes.  That is why it is vital to ensure that these farmers have access to these schemes and that they get the money on time when that money is due.</p>  <p>  One of the things we need to think about is how that can be sustained as we move forward because suckler farming in the west of Ireland is in crisis.  Unless the price rises for the beef farmer, it will not be possible to increase it for the suckler farmer.  Key to that is looking at how that model works and we need work on this.  The agreement reached between the farmers and the factories on foot of the crisis in the past few weeks is a basis on which to build but it is a long way from where we need to get to.  The reality is that farmers are at their wits' end.  Their backs are to the wall, they do not see a future and we need to recognise that.  I again commend the motion.  All of us have a significant job of work to do to turn this around because this entire industry is in crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="21:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400052#ZZ00300"><p>I support the motion and say that the view of the Labour Party is that the suckler sector is a vital for the Irish agrifood sector.  We have been studying the report authored by Professor Thia Hennessy, Dr. Justin Doran, Professor Joe Bogue and Dr. Lana Repar entitled, The Economic and Societal Importance of the Irish Suckler Beef Sector.  My own area of Cork is predominantly a dairy sector and is probably more protected from the vagaries of the market than the Border, midlands and west region to which other speakers have referred.  The report sets out a clear challenge regarding where the suckler beef sector will see itself in a number of years.  Page 66 of the report concerns moves afoot to replace suckler beef with dairy beef.  I will quote from the report because it is worth considering the academic view on this.  Section 7.4 states that:</p><blockquote>It is expected that the dairy sector will continue to grow, and as such an increasing share of the output of the beef sector will be comprised of dairy-bred beef.  Some believe that the threat of a contracting suckler cow herd can be offset by the potential to replace this sector with dairy-bred beef.  However, for others there are concerns about whether rearing dairy calves is an appropriate substitute for suckler farming.  Single suckling selling weanlings is the most common production system in the west of Ireland.Typically, calves remain grazing with the cow and are sold once weaned.  These calves are typically purchased by farmers with better production conditions and possibly based in a better climate, and are then fattened.  Single suckling selling weanling farms may not have the land type, housing facilities and/or husbandry skills to finish dairy animals.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that, despite a number of campaigns to promote dairy calf rearing in the west of Ireland, uptake has been very slow.  It remains to be seen whether dairy beef can be a viable alternative to suckler farming in marginal areas.</blockquote><p>In speakingto that point, it is important that we do not forget that there are regional variations and that in certain areas, farmers must specialise in suckler farming because of the conditions that apply there.  We must be mindful of the fact that those farm families need to earn an income, put food on the table and, as Deputy Rabbitte noted, give their children the option of continuing in farming.  They must have a proper price for their product.  They cannot be merely price takers.</p><p>We also welcome the recent moves regarding price but we feel strongly that the Government must play a more active part in ensuring that there is greater communication between all the stakeholders in a co-ordinated and organised way that recognises the regional variations that exist as they relate to those people who rely on the suckler beef sector.</p><p>The regional spread of the agrifood sector means that it underpins the socioeconomic development of rural areas, in particular.  For example, more than half of all Irish farmers are located in the Border, midlands and west region with around a quarter of farmers being over the age of 65.  Statistics from the Government pointing to job creation in the capital in the areas of finance or IT do little to compensate those farmers left to deal with the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.  Simply put, these regions will need real support to transition through whatever crisis might come down the line.  They are already at crisis point.</p><p>It is our view that the Government has failed to provide the necessary support and funding to the sector and rural Ireland over the past three years.  Its failed management of two programmes, one of which was fully funded by the EU with the others being co-funded, demonstrates this fact.  The LEADER programme 2014-2020, which is a key driver for rural developments, consists of &euro;250 million with regard to projects relating to rural environment, social inclusion and economic development yet with less than 16 months until the deadline.  At a time of deep turbulence for rural Ireland, less than 40% of the total funding has been distributed so far.  These are all major funding lines that have a significant impact in those marginal areas and on the marginal incomes, to which I referred earlier.  There needs to be a more co-ordinated approach at Government level.</p><p>In echoing the call of the motion, we agree that introducing a framework for producer groups is necessary to ensure a critical mass of farmers coming together to facilitate price negotiations.  In addition, fixed-price contracts must be explored, as proposed by the motion, because the farmer takes all the risk.  If a farmer has a fixed-price contract, he or she knows what he or she will get.  It is a fixed price that a farmer can take to the bank, so to speak.  Irrespective of currency devaluation, fluctuations or market conditions, the farmer knows that there is certainty.  It provides a safety net.  It would involve sharing the risk between processors and producers or farmers but it would provide farmers with reassurance and provide greater market stability.</p><p>We support the motion.  We strongly believe that there needs to be a greater interrogation of the dynamics within the suckler sector.  The report from which I quoted provides a strong basis for this.  It states in its conclusions:</p><blockquote>Despite the economic significance of the suckler cow sector, the grave and difficult economic situation at the farm level is a major weakness.  The very low market prices relative to production costs mean that this large farm sector is almost entirely reliant on direct payments.  This obviously makes the sector, and indeed the entire supply chain, extremely vulnerable in light of the proposed cuts to the CAP budget.  Any negative price shocks arising from threats such as Brexit or international trade deals will exacerbate the economic situation at the farm level making farmers even more reliant on payments.</blockquote><p>We have a lot of work to do to ensure the viability of the sector in this country, but this is a starting point, and on that basis we are supporting the motion.</p></speech>

The farmers have shown many of us in this country how important it is to stand up for what is right and just in our lives and to fight for a proper income for our families.  For me, the problem of this crisis is very simple.  The beef industry is an asymmetric industry.  It is an oligopoly.  There are a small number of massive factories that have enormous power over every single condition of sale, including price, and tens of thousands of farmers who are so small that they have no influence over any condition of sale, including price.  It is completely asymmetric, unbalanced, broken and distorted.  We can see that by the fact that one factory can make a profit of &euro;170 million in one year, be tax resident in Luxembourg, pay a 0.5% rate of tax, have assets of &euro;3.5 billion and expect the farmer to bring a beast to the gate at below cost.  It is a shocking injustice that a factory could make so much profit and expect the supplier to bring the product to the gate at a loss.  By participating in this market farmers are making a serious loss.  The average wage of a farmer is now between &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000.  It is only at that level because there is a subsidy.  The subsidy makes up 140% of the income of a farmer.  That is a startling fact.  It shows that if the farmer stopped participating in the market, he or she would be much better off.</p><p>This injustice is black and white.  It is an absolute disgrace that it continues and the Government is an absolute disgrace for presiding over it.  The attitude of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to this has been one of <i>laissez-faire.  </i>The Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government has sat on its hands right throughout this process as though it was not its fault.  It amuses me that Fine Gael states that it is the party of the free market, yet so many markets in this country are absolutely distorted.  The beef market is not the only one.  The insurance market is distorted.  It took the European Union to investigate the cartel in that sector.  The housing market is absolutely distorted.  It seems that there is nobody with an economics background on the Fine Gael benches who can sort out some of the distortions happening in the markets.</p><p>I spoke to a senior Fine Gael Deputy in the middle of the crisis.  That Fine Gael Deputy said that the expectations of the farmers were unreasonable because they expected a price that was above the break-even point.  It is amazing that a person who claimed to represent the farmers believed the expectation to make a living was absolutely unreasonable.  Teagasc tells us that one third of farmers in the State are making a living from their farms, one third are only making a living because they are also working off the farm, and another third is making a loss, which means they are being pushed off their farms and into poverty and debt.  I will say this as well.  I do not believe all the factories are the same.  Some of the factories saw this crisis as an opportunity to allow some of the smaller factories to go bust so that they could win their contracts.</p><p>Most of the speeches from the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government tonight have been fiddling around the edges.  If we do not talk about the base price and the fact that farmers have to make a living from their activities, then we are not at the races.  We are not being serious about the problem.  This week I introduced a new Bill which would ban the below-cost selling of beef on an interim basis over a period of time in which the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission could do the job it is meant to do and ensure balance in the market.  The Bill has a sunset clause and would fall into abeyance after a year if that market is fixed.  I encourage Deputies from across the Chamber to support that Bill.  I also note that the Beef Plan Movement's representatives are coming to the audiovisual room this Thursday at 11 a.m.  I encourage Deputies to come and listen to them. </p><p>There is much more to this.  These protests were about much more than the price of beef.  They were about the straw that broke the camel's back.  I believe this was a form of insurrection in rural Ireland.  People talk about 20-20 vision.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government has M50 vision.  It cannot see this country beyond the M50.  We have an excess concentration of wealth, infrastructure and population in one small part of the country while population is falling in the rest of the country.  Young people are leaving the rest of the country in their droves.  Why would they do otherwise?  Why would someone take over a farm that will drive him or her into poverty by cultivating it?  It is very important that the Government starts to listen.</p><p>The anger over this has not gone away.  Many of the farmers were so economically hammered that they had no choice but to return to their farms.  The protests may be over, but this crisis is by no means over.  I encourage the Government not to squander this opportunity to fix this crisis.  Its members must take their hands from underneath their behinds, start to roll up their sleeves and get working on this issue.  This is a crisis that we have to fix.  We cannot allow a situation where one part of the country is overheating, with new schools being built, while in the rest of the country schools, services, Garda stations, banks and post offices are being closed.  We need proper regional development and we need to make sure that rural Ireland can make a living in the future.</p></speech>

I thank the farmers we met in different places on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  I also note that one meat processor met us on Sunday.  I thank that party for being courteous and resolving the issue for the time being.</p>  <p>  We have to decide what the future of agriculture in Ireland will be.  Where are we going from this debacle?  We know that the price farmers are taking is not sustainable.  Unfortunately, the land in many parts of the country where beef or suckler calves are raised is not of a quality that could be used for dairy farming.  A lot of concerns have out-farms and small plots of land of relatively poor quality.  This is the only way of life these farmers can pursue at the moment.  We must know what path we are leaving open to these people, because what is happening at the moment is not sustainable.</p><p> We have decisions to make.  Are we going to continue to allow slurry to be exported from farms that have no land?  Will cattle be behind barriers all year in feedlots?  Whether in the beef or dairy sectors, are we going to allow slurry go to other farms?  I was brought up with the idea that one should farm the land one had.  It was not a case of putting two cows or two bullocks on top of one another and deciding to send the slurry somewhere else.  Decisions have to be made on issues such as these.</p> <p> We need to start breeding good quality calves out of the dairy herd.  Those farmers are going to hit a wall and no one wants to see that happen but that will happen next spring.  Beef farmers face a burden now and they do not want to go back there again.  Are we going to have bull calves that are impossible to sell or are we going to try to promote a better quality animal to ensure the industry is sustainable for all involved?  I note exports have increased, and I welcome that.  However, we need to look for export markets for the heavier cattle, the stores and the weanlings to ensure it is sustainable.</p> <p> The reality is that most farms in the west of Ireland are sheep or suckler because although one has the farms, one does not have the volume.  Some 90,000 to 100,000 farmers have beef or sheep.  Will they be sustainable?  What is the plan for the future?  Are we bringing in any mitigation measures?  Hedgerows are not even included in the mitigation measures at the moment.  Everybody wants to heap everything on top of the people in rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland is supposed to pay for the carbon tax while at the same time be the carbon sequestration part of the country.  There are solutions that can be implemented in that regard, such as shelter belts.  However, farmers must be rewarded for doing that, rather than having something imposed on them.</p> <p> There has been much talk in recent weeks at the gates of the factories about Polish and every other type of beef.  Will we consider the idea of being the first country to identify all our cattle by DNA?  It would be possible to trace the origins to the relevant tag and animal.  Are we going to do that or are we going to allow the "ifs", "ands" and "maybes" and perhaps the exaggeration of certain things to continue?</p> <p> I refer to the issue of 16% of our private land being designated as a special area of conservation, SAC - people were out and about in connection with that today - natural heritage areas, NHAs, and special protection areas, SPAs.  All that places a burden on the landowners.  There are 35 notifiable actions that have to be done.  Those farmers are not allowed to farm like some of their neighbours.  They have to bear that burden but a family still has to be reared in such circumstances.  The Government hides and does not look after them.  There will be reference to these farmers receiving the GLAS payment.  Anybody can receive that payment if they sow some wild bird cover.  There should be no reference to those farmers being looked through GLAS.  We have to make sure that those farmers are looked after.  We need Europe, as a whole, and not just Ireland, to decide if we are going to keep going with this drive for low-cost products.  Are we going to try to keep bringing in food from Brazil, knowing the standard of traceability used there?  Are we going to decide instead that we will produce and provide a proper traceable product at a proper price?</p> <p> Another aspect that is worrying, and people at the factories will confirm this, is that 15 or 16 years ago, 78% of our cattle were R or U grade but that is now down to 48%.  That shows we are not producing the quality animal.  Have a look at the Italian market or at some of the other markets or just talk to dealers?  They can go into a mart and pick out a pen of cattle in a few minutes.  That is all it takes when they are looking for cattle that are E, U and even R grades.  We have to decide whether we have a path for these people and these families to follow.  I say that because there are more than 80,000 to 100,000 farmers involved.  Probably another 2.4 people in rural areas do not have many alternatives.</p> <p> We cannot continue to neglect and ignore them because as the old saying goes, if you pull a dog's tail often enough it will bite back.  We have to put forward a clear path for them and not leave them in a jungle or a theme park.  We have to ensure the &euro;12 billion or &euro;13 billion in exports will keep these people going.  Our exports will decrease if we do not.  We have to make sure the next generation is able to farm the land.  Perhaps there are other options we can look at, but we have to make sure we provide some kind of clear path into the future.</p></speech>

However, I was watching things from afar.  The beef crisis has been looming for some time.  When I was agriculture spokesman, I argued that farming was in a situation where farmers were losing money.  If we were to look at the accounts of many farmers, minus the fixed grant payments, such as GLAS, the basic payment and the area of natural constraint, ANC, payment, we would find that those farmers are losing money farming.  What has been going on for some time but what has been totally exacerbated this year is the reality that the more and the harder a person farms, the less money that he or she makes.  A minimalist approach with minimalist inputs is the most profitable way of farming.  The farming industry has been so structured for some time but the situation has been completely exacerbated by the collapse in the beef price this year.  Such an industry is not structured correctly.  We need to face up to this issue at national level and examine the way we are assisting farming at EU level.   The collapse in the beef price brought the more intensive farmers to a total crisis this year.  However, to state that this pattern has not been there for some time, particularly for farmers in the less advantaged areas, would be to ignore the reality that is visible in the accounts of farmers.</p>  <p>  A second and valid issue concerns profit-taking in the sector.  Deputies will remember when we did a major analysis of this subject in the agriculture committee.  We looked at the retail sector, in particular.  Work was going on in France and I produced a paper on this issue, which proved to be of great interest to the European Commission at a time.  That paper examined the need to start finding out who was making what out of the farming industry.  The one thing we found out, because it was easy enough to measure, was that out of the price paid for a litre of milk in a shop, the percentage going to the farmer dropped by 10% in the previous 11 years.  It can be taken that the same is happening with other parts of our agriculture.  However, it is much harder to measure the impact in respect of meat than milk because that is sold the next day.  We really need to start to analyse this issue.  Europe stated that it is interested.  We need to deal with the cartels, and that involves not only the factories but the retailers.</p><p>Some evidence shows that the retailers are also manipulating the price and we need to deal with this issue.  We need to examine it very carefully.  An issue that needs to be examined at EU level is the idea that the retailers, who are small in number, and the factories are hugely powerful and can negotiate price but the farmers and other primary producers, who are hugely weak on an individual basis, cannot collectively negotiate price.  If this is what competition law means, then competition law is an ass and it is time Europe faced up to it.<br/><br/>I used to often say when we were debating this issue that the problem of primary producers is not unique to Ireland.  We all know about fair trade coffee, and we understand it perfectly well.  Let us remember that none of us can survive without eating.  We can do without many things in life, and some of us could even survive without an iPhone although it would be hard, but we cannot survive without eating.  Food and drink are absolutely fundamental.  The reality is that primary producers throughout the world are getting pressurised into taking uneconomical prices.  I know about producer groups and all the rest.  They are very handy and will work for some of the bigger players but for many smaller farmers represented on the backbenches by me, Deputy Scanlon and others they are not as good as farm organisations and other representative bodies being able to negotiate.  Would it upset the entire free market of the European Union? I do not believe it would.  Would it bring a bit of justice?  Yes, I believe it would.  We need a lot of change.<br/><br/>The motion also refers to general rural issues.  I will mention a few topics very briefly.  There is talk of a carbon tax in areas where the State underspends significantly <i>per capita</i>on public transport.  The <i>per capita </i>spend in the capital city on buses is three times that of rural areas.  The fares in rural areas are twice those of the cities.  On the same wages, our taxes subsidise urban transport.  I am not complaining about this as I use urban transport but we need equality and we will have to stand up and get it.<br/><br/>Something that slipped through, and perhaps some of us did not see it coming, is that if somebody is building a rural house 100 m away from the public water supply, he or she is no longer allowed to put the pipe in and Uisce &Eacute;ireann will charge $20,000 - sorry &euro;20,000-----</p></speech>

I thank the Members here this evening who have spoken very knowledgeably and sincerely in support of the motion.

I do not know where they think they are going but I know they have forgotten where we have come from.</p>  <p>  I am standing 100% with the farmers of Ireland who are fighting for survival.  I am speaking predominantly about the small family farm.  I hear people saying farmers own land but no farmer in Ireland owns his or her farm.  Farmers possess it from the time it is given to them.  They use it to make a living or a part-time living for their families.  They do not own it.  They do not look on it as an asset.  They look on it as something they are holding on to in order to pass it on to the next generation, be it a son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, preferred niece or preferred nephew.  I do know one thing for certain and that is they will not carry it into the ground with them when they are put six feet under.  I never yet saw a farmer take land with him or her.  Farmers know they are not taking it anywhere with them.  They know they are passing it on to the next generation.</p>  <p>  All of the people I know who own land want to leave it after them in a better way than they got it.  They want to make improvements.  They want to knock a ditch or build a bit of a shed.  They want to improve an old bad road where a pipe needed to be put across it.  Where old flags or gullets might have fallen down or got broken they want to dig them out and put in a proper gullet or a proper pipe.  They want to reclaim land, knock and grow trees and grow and cut grass.  They want to improve the place in every way they can.</p>  <p>  The simple thing they want to do is make something very small, ordinary and decent, which is a small bit of profit.  Whether people are garda&iacute;, dentists, nurses, teachers, working for the local authority or whatever they are doing in life, all they want to do is make a living and a modest amount of money so they can pay their debts, cover their costs and be able to run the show.  At present, and the reason we have tabled this Private Members' motion, and the reason Fianna F&aacute;il, fair dues to it, did the same last week, is we want to acknowledge that our farming community is in the height of trouble.  Any person who produces anything or improves anything believes he or she will make some little bit of profit.  Somebody who bought an old broken down motor car or tractor, fixed it up and sold it would think common sense would prevail and that he or she would make a couple of euro out of it.  People can put a bull into a field with a cow and that can result in a calf.  At the end of the day, if that calf is brought into this world and reared and if that calf gets fat and into beef and the farmer takes it to the factory thinking he or she will make enough money to pay costs, he or she will be wrong because farmers are not making enough money to pay costs.</p>  <p>  Some people are waking up.  Some politicians around the country are waking up and thinking farming is in crisis and that people with suckler cows are in crisis.  They do not realise this is been going on for a long time.  For years, people with cows and calves and rearing beef have not been making money.  This did not start in the past couple of months when the issue has been highlighted, and rightly so, by the Beef Plan movement, the IFA and various organisations.  Of course, the protest happened and I am the first to admit thousands of cattle need to be killed and the sheep sector has been affected.  I know people who desperately want to pay college fees and pay for education but they cannot do so.  Even though we are speaking about bad prices, they want to get some price because, as the Minister knows, they have to sell.  It has caused major disruption but it had to happen because the problem had to be highlighted.</p>  <p>  People are making money out of beef all right but what is highly unfair is that those who are not making any money are those who produce it.  They are the people who are up late at night with cows calving and who have cows going wrong and calves dying.  They are suffering misfortune and every type of penal servitude that God can bestow upon any man or woman.  These people find themselves in severe difficulty.</p><p>What people are going through is beyond belief.  At the end of the day they are left with a massive bill in the local creamery they cannot afford to pay.  It is as simple as that.  They carry their calves, sell their weanlings, fatten cattle, sell them to the factory, get their money and by the time they start paying the contractors, paying for fertiliser and feed they will have got nothing out of it but a puff of smoke.</p> <p> These people are not expecting to make a lot of money, but God blast it, it is a very fair ordinary decent thing for them to make enough money to pay their debts and have a bit of a living so they can pay their electricity bill, pay for the messages, rear their children, send them to school, run the car and tractor, but now they cannot.</p> <p> At this critical time Ministers are talking about imposing a carbon tax to put penal servitude upon penal servitude.  This is what is being proposed by the Government.  It will cripple the most vulnerable people in Ireland who are people in rural Ireland.  This is probably one of the most anti-rural governments since the foundation of the State because every decision it makes centres on improving things in urban areas and disenfranchising rural areas.  It comes back to what I have been saying since the first day I came in here and sat in a far corner of this House.  I said certain people in this House believe there is no life beyond the Red Cow roundabout.  I am trying to tell the Taoiseach every day to wake up and realise Ireland is a bigger place than Dublin.  It does not stop just out the road there.  Ireland is a big country and it takes a lot of time to travel around it.  There is an awful lot of diversity of people in it.  I have nothing but respect for people from Dublin, but the Taoiseach is a Taoiseach for all of Ireland and not just for Dublin.</p> <p> Unfortunately, when it comes to agriculture many of our Ministers may as well be looking up into the blue moon tonight as try to understand what it is to run a small family farm.  They really do not have a clue.  I am too polite to say where I like to think their heads are stuck, but they are certainly not stuck into agriculture.  They do not realise the difficulties and genuine hardships on family farms.</p> <p> The small family farm is not an asset; it is something these people want to pass on to future generations.  Our young people are very astute, smart and clever.  When they see the difficulties people in the farming community have at present and what their parents and grandparents are going through in trying to run the family farm, they will say they are wasting their time.  I do not want them to think they are wasting their time.  I want to see the factories giving a fair price.  If the factories, shops and beef barons can make money out of beef, why in the name of God can the ordinary decent man and woman rearing beef not make money?</p> <p> Our small farms need to become profitable even if only on a part-time basis.  I am not trying to say a small farm will be able to make a full-time living, but at least if farmers had some other off-farm income the farm itself should wash its face and make a little bit of profit.  That is all we are looking for in this Private Members' motion.  I am very grateful to Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling its motion last week.  When I see the crowd from Labour, the crowd from the Green Party and the non-existent Fine Gael Party Members, I compliment Fianna F&aacute;il Members who were here all night.  Where, in the name of God, are the people who are forgetting we are a predominantly agriculture-based country?  Anyone looking in here tonight would say they have lost their way.  How can they know where they have come from if they do not know where they are going?  I know where we want to go with this motion.  We want a thing called fair play for our farmers.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle and I am sorry for going on.</p></speech>

I come from the heart of rural Ireland.  We do not often get an opportunity to speak about agriculture.  I was delighted to see that in the past couple of weeks many Members in this House have a newfound interest in agriculture which is strange for a change.  I hope that is maintained in the future.</p>  <p>  Agriculture is very important to rural areas of Ireland.  During the so-called bad days between 2007 and 2011, agriculture dragged the country out of the mire in which it was at the time.  Agriculture made sure that we laid the foundation for the strong base we have in the country today.  It is very important that agriculture is maintained in the upcoming period.</p>  <p>  The big issue at the moment is with the beef sector.  This sector has been in difficulty for a number of years.  The sector is in deep difficulty when 114% of the beef farmers' income comes from Europe and it must be addressed.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine with the involvement of Deputies McConalogue, Cahill and others, produced a cross-party report on the sector in June or July.  We made 12 recommendations, the majority of which have been taken on board by most of the farming organisations in recent weeks.  The report found that there is no silver bullet to solve the problem.  It is a very complex issue and a very complex sector to deal with.</p>  <p>  My late father used to say that the suckler cow died in debt and he was right.  Once a year the suckler cow produces a calf and that is the only thing she does.  The farmer must wait until September or October to get a few euro out of her.  She then goes on for the following year and the same issue arises.  We have major issues to make that sector profitable in future and it will not be easy.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks we have seen difficulties in the relationship between the factories, processors and the primary producers because transparency has been a major issue for some time.  Trust has broken down completely and there is no confidence in the sector at the moment.  It is vital to rebuild that trust because at the end of the day, whether it is a dispute today, tomorrow or the next day, that farmer has to go to the factory with his end product.  That trust and confidence must be rebuilt.</p>  <p>  It is important to build on the agreement made in the past couple of weeks.  It may not be the perfect solution, but it is a very important first step.  A crucial part of that is the proposed taskforce.  It is important that the taskforce comes into operation as soon as possible.  It needs to meet on a regular basis and specific timeframes need to be put in place to ensure we have a definite result from it.</p>  <p>  When the EU directive on unfair trading practices is transposed into Irish law, it will provide more strength.  It is important to have a sector regulator to deal with the beef sector across the board.  A groceries sector regulator was introduced in Great Britain a number of years ago and it has proven to be very successful.  A beef sector regulator would compliment the work done with the agreement in recent weeks.</p></speech>

I have outlined in this House recent developments which will provide a pathway in that regard.</p>  <p>  Having a shared vision and strategy development process has been crucial to the growth of the entire agrifood sector in recent years.  The FoodWise 2025 strategy has been instrumental in providing a shared framework for the sector since its launch in 2015.  I acknowledge that the agrifood sector is going through an unprecedented time of challenge and uncertainty.  However, we should bear in mind that ours is a sector of resilience.  It has faced many challenges in the past and has pulled through.  We saw this most starkly during the economic crisis Deputy Deering mentioned earlier.  It is worth bearing in mind the extraordinary 73% increase in the value of exports since 2009.  Like all strategic plans, FoodWise 2025 must evolve and respond to rapidly changing context and circumstances.  We are facing new challenges, in particular the unprecedented uncertainty posed by the possibility of a no-deal Brexit as well as a challenge for the sector to contribute effectively to climate action and ongoing concerns over the new European Union budget and CAP reform.</p>  <p>  That challenging background makes it even more important for us to come together and agree a coherent plan for the sector for the decade ahead.  As mentioned by earlier speakers, there are emerging opportunities for the sector in the bio-economy.</p><p>Hearing the views of all interested parties is an important part of the process in developing the new strategy.  In this context I opened a public consultation on 31 July last composed of a public consultation paper that sets out some of the emerging challenges and trends, as well as an online survey.  This will remain open until 1 October.  I will also host a national stakeholder consultation event on 16 October, and more details of this will be announced shortly.  The development of the next agrifood strategy will be a major milestone for the sector and I would urge all interested parties and groups and individuals to contribute to that.</p> <p> On the wider rural development, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, was established in November 2012 as an independent expert group to examine and report on the medium-term economic development of rural Ireland until 2025.  The report of the commission, Energising Ireland's Rural Economy, was published in April 2014 and made 34 recommendations to Government that the commission argued would support the further development of the rural economy by creating a dynamic, adaptable, outward-looking and multi-sectoral economy.  Following the formation of the new Government in 2016, responsibility for rural development policy was transferred from the Department for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In July 2017, rural development policy became the responsibility of the newly formed Department of Rural and Community Development.  In accordance with a commitment in the action plan for rural development, a review of the status of each recommendation contained in the CEDRA report was undertaken by the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2018.  The review found that many of the recommendations contained in the CEDRA report had either been implemented or had been superseded or replaced by actions set out in the action plan for rural development.</p> <p> In January 2017, Realising our Rural Potential, the action plan for rural development, was published.  The action plan built on the CEDRA report and was the first whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland covering a wide range of social and economic issues.  The action plan for rural development has been the primary vehicle for the implementation of the Government's support for rural development over the past three years.  It contains more than 270 actions for delivery across Government, the majority of which have been substantially progressed.  Delivery of the measures contained in the action plan will continue until the end of 2019.  Progress on the implementation of the actions is overseen by a monitoring committee that includes senior representatives of relevant Departments and key rural stakeholder interests.  Progress reports on the implementation of the action plan are published twice yearly.  There has been significant investment in rural areas since the action plan was launched through schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme and the new rural regeneration and development fund, and it will amount to &euro;1 billion over the next ten years.</p> <p> The whole-of-Government approach of the action plan for rural development is bringing real and tangible benefits to rural areas.  Investment is taking place across Government in measures that support rural business, rural communities and connectivity.  The investment is driving job creation, providing new types of service, and enhancing the quality of life in rural Ireland.  My colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, informs me that the action plan for rural development is reaching the end of its three-year life cycle at the end of 2019 and his Department is in the process of developing a new rural development policy to succeed that action plan from 2020.  The next phase will build on progress since 2017 and will focus on building the resilience of rural communities and the diversification of rural economies.  The new rural policy will be forward looking and will focus on building the resilience of rural communities in a period of emerging challenges, which include Brexit, climate change, new technologies and the transformation of traditional industrial sectors.  As was the case with the action plan for rural development, the new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland and will take account of other key policy initiatives such as Project Ireland 2040, future jobs Ireland, the Government's climate action plan, and my Department's agrifood policy to 2030.  It is envisaged that the new rural policy 2020-2025 will be published in January next year.</p> <p> The agreement reached by the beef stakeholders following the talks I facilitated over the weekend of 14-15 September, including the establishment of a beef market task force, has the potential to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.  The establishment of the first beef producer organisation in Ireland earlier this month is a significant milestone for the sector, strengthening the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.  I hope that many more producer organisations will be established in the not too distant future.</p> <p> The Government is committed to strategic rural development, including new plans in the agrifood sector and for wider rural development policy.  I urge all stakeholders to engage in the planning process and to contribute positively to the future in rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-24a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092400057#EEE00200"><p>I thank all the speakers who supported our motion and who came and gave of their time.  Disappointment has been expressed about many who did not come.  Agriculture is our primary industry and we must mind it.</p>  <p>  I learnt a great deal during the time of the protests and it was not just the blockades in Cahir where I was much of the time.  I thank Bob Wilkinson, a man in his 80s, young Daniel Long, and Alison de Vere Hunt, who travelled to Dublin for the talks and who was not treated nicely in the Minister's Department.  I have said that to him before.  I also thank Superintendent Denis Whelan, the garda&iacute; in Cahir Garda station, and the workers who went in and out of the factory and were so peaceful and respectful of what was going on.  Many of them brought food to feed the farmers and their families.  I thank the many companies that brought food and the many women who baked scones and apple tarts and cream.  There was a joyous atmosphere there.  The weather was great.  It went on longer than it should have.</p>  <p>  We should not have had to have been there because this crisis has been coming.  The Minister sleepwalked into it.  When we got the mandate to talk to Fine Gael about the programme for Government and we agreed to include the issue of producer organisations, the Government did nothing about it.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and others have said, this is a Dublin-centric Government.  The Taoiseach, who should be sitting where the Minister is now, said that we must eat less beef.  Is that a man to be heading our country?  We know what his interests are.  Deputy Healy-Rae was right to point that out.  Time and again the Government was warned.</p>  <p>  In recent days when my colleagues and others were working very hard to get the gates opened and the cattle going in, there were rumours that Meat Industry Ireland, MII, met the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to get the Garda to move the rest of the people away.  We were negotiating, and while I acknowledge the Minister took a phone call from one of the Healy-Rae brothers on Saturday to try to get it stood down, he did not take a phone call or a text from me at the start of the protest.  He ignored it and hoped it would go away.  He was on his holidays and wanted to stay on his holidays.  He could be on holidays every day because this is the most useless, toothless and fruitless Government that ever sat in this Chamber.  It has no respect for rural Ireland, no respect for na daoine beaga or for any of the organisations, although some are too cosy with the Government.  MII placed injunctions on the Beef Plan Movement, which had to go to ground.  Then the Government told us it had no one to talk to.  Independent Farmers of Ireland came forward and sent people to talk and, thankfully, we are where we are.  The Minister cobbled together an agreement.  It is a t&uacute;s maith.  It is a good start and we have to work to it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that all the stakeholders, all the usual suspects, will be put onto this task force.  I do not want all the stakeholders.  They can meet the Minister every day of the week, Bord Bia, Teagasc, and Department officials.  This should involve MII, with a truly independent chairperson - someone like Kieran Mulvey.  He does not have to know agriculture.  The less he knows about it the better.  He is someone who will not be fooled or have the wool pulled over his eyes.  It has to include the farming groups, Veterinary Ireland, and MII, and it must have standards.  There should be no threatening.  It is shameful to say that Mr. Healy from my own county was using bully-boy tactics and incensing farmers when I saw the farmers and the workers saluting one another and giving tea and whatever else.  I sympathise with the workers who lost their jobs or who were temporarily laid off.  That should not have happened.  I am an employer, like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, Deputy Michael Collins, and many more.  We would keep our workers for a few weeks certainly.  Where is the good faith and the goodwill?</p>  <p>  One day when I was there, a lorry with a 40 ft container arrived and a vet came to plead with the lads to let him in to inspect it.  He told us that was Polish beef going into the factory.  It left.  Three weeks later another lorry came and we were told it was a load of pork.  That lorry was followed because bringing in pork from Poland is dangerous due to swine flu and other infections.  That would have been devastating.  Everyone at the gates was filmed by powerful cameras all day and night.  As if that was not bad enough, some of the lads came out of the factory to intimidate the protesters and make videos.  We were all told we were caught on video.  That lorry was followed.  I know where it went.  It came back saying it went to the wrong factory.  I want the Minister to investigate those issues.  That could cause unbelievable damage.  It is reckless.  We do not know what is going into the meat.</p>  <p>  One thing that has come out of this protest is that the public has got a greater understanding of how the farmer is being blackguarded, when the fact was put on the posters that only 2.6% of the &euro;10 goes to the farmer and what else goes to the retailers and the factories.</p><p>Where does the fifth quarter go?  I salute Mr. Seamus Maye and the fabulous investigation of the fifth quarter he has carried out.  The problems in that regard are staggering.  The Government allowed a certain mogul in the industry to take control of offal only a couple of years ago.  Every bit of offal is controlled by a big beef baron and nobody else can go anywhere with any of it.  When individual plants were making deals because they wanted to get going and fulfil their contracts, as we all did, the heavy hand came in again.  The moguls rule.  The biggest beef baron in the country - everyone knows who I mean - said the plants could not sell their offal and instead could dump it wherever they liked.  Such cop-on has been allowed.  The Competition Authority is a disgrace.  It has done nothing but tell farmers they could not negotiate the price.  What is the authority meant to be?  If I was running a business up a boreen on the side of a mountain and was doing something to cause unfair competition, the authority would fine me and close me down.  It will not touch the people I have outlined, however, because there is too much money involved, too much big business and too many people who were friends with one another when they were growing up.<br/><br/>The IFA has given the Government an easy ride in the past eight years.  Of course it has, given that most of its members are in the Government's party.  Fair dues to the beef industry of Ireland and independent farmers.  Circumstances have changed and will never be the same because the genie is out of the bottle and people know what is going on.  They know that farmers have been blaggarded.  When the animal is put in the trailer, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae noted, farmers tend to it.  If the cow is inseminated, farmers nurture the little calves, work with the cow the whole way and look after it.  They are accused of all kinds of bad practices but they look after their animals and respect them, their land and their families.  All they want is a fair price for their work, rather than cartels being formed, money being creamed off elsewhere, and the blaggarding that is going on.<br/><br/>I call on the Minister to insist that the Cahir factory is reopened.  Everything was allowed in by the protestors except cattle or beef, while cattle were allowed in for the Chinese visit.  Of course the Chinese delegation was allowed in because it would have been reckless otherwise, and meat was allowed out when it had to be brought out.  All the maintenance crews were allowed in to keep the factory ready and in pristine condition, but now we are told it will take a couple of weeks in some places to start killing again.  That is blaggarding and it must stop.  The power must be given back to the producer.  What are we here for?  Rural Ireland will be wiped out.  As has been noted, with all that is taken away from us, we will lose beef farmers and producers.  They spend every penny in the rural economy, in the schools, shops, GAA clubs and the whole lot.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.<br/><br/>What are we trying to do under the Government?  It is a disgrace how it has treated everyone else.  Any small person is in the way.  It is all about the large supermarkets, Larry Goodman and company, and the rest of them, and to hell with na daoine beaga.  The Government does not want them at all.  It should go back to its roots.  It will have to go back soon enough looking for votes and will find out the hard way.  I thank the garda&iacute; and everyone in Cahir who helped to keep the peace, normal trading and the work going on, even though some people were turfed out.  We were on the cusp of a settlement in Cahir on Monday, 16 September but it did not happen, although it should have.  We were again on the cusp on Wednesday, 18 September, when most of the farmers who wanted to stand down walked away.  A group stayed on, as was their prerogative.  The factory knew on Thursday that the matter would be settled on Friday but what did it do?  It announced another 100 job losses on Friday morning.<br/><br/>It was such contempt, such waving, teasing and mocking of the protestors.  The factory had a monopoly for 35 years and it got away with it, since Charlie Haughey bailed it out and left it alone.  At least he made beef deals and with the Purcells sold exports to Libya.  He did something for the country and did the State some service, but the Government has done nothing.  It has watched it being destroyed, rural Ireland being decimated and farmers being driven to protest this week, but for several weeks the Minister would not even engage.  When he did engage at first, he had MII dictating what would happen, who could be in the room and under what conditions.  It is time the mask was removed from MII and that it respected producers.  Many workers at the factories are annoyed at what happened and some of them are annoyed with me, which I fully accept.  They are entitled to be, given that I was in the middle.  If we did not have producers, the workers would not be kept at the factories.  That is what we do not see in the picture.<br/><br/>I watched a wonderful expos&eacute; on RT&Eacute; last night about what happened at the atrocious event in County Cavan.  It is time that RT&Eacute; and the rest of the media broadcast an expos&eacute; on what is taking place with the cartels in the beef business.  It is beyond time but it will not happen, as it will not in the case of the multiples, because as we see when we open the Sunday newspapers, there are pages and pages of advertisements.  Money talks.  It is time the Minister answered the questions about beef from Poland and, worse again, the pork from Poland.  Did it come into Cahir and, if so, why?  What is happening in that regard?  We demand respect.  We do not want a taskforce with all the usual suspects taking up places, eating their dinner and taking up time.  We want the producers, farm families, the organisations and MII.  There must be an independent regulator, with teeth and power, and it must gain respect.  Respect has to be earned and he or she who earns it will get it.  Previously, the regulator was the Secretary General of the Department.  I do not know the man but how could he be independent?  He is not independent.<br/><br/>We want independence on the taskforce.  We in the Rural Independent Group, <i>en masse</i>day in, day out, will call on the Government to ensure that the taskforce is meaningful, and that it will have respect and teeth.  We will not be fobbed off.  The fobbing-off is over, as the Minister will soon learn.</p></speech>
