There is serious concern that the stagnant level of defence expenditure is having an impact the ability of the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army.  Despite our being a neutral country, we are falling behind in the context of the overall budgetary expenditure.  Will the Minister of State outline the budgetary allocation?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100004#B00500"><p>The provision of current expenditure for the defence sector for 2019 is &euro;888 million, which is an increase of 2.1% on the 2018 provision.  This comprises &euro;639 million in current funding for Vote 36 - Defence and &euro;249 million in current funding for Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  Capital funding of &euro;106 million has also been provided.  Overall, the increase in funding for the defence sector for 2019 is 5%.</p><p>I am delighted to take this opportunity to set out the 2019 funding position which shows this Government&rsquo;s commitment to defence, as evidenced by the increased allocation provided for 2019.  The total defence sector allocation, including Army pensions, will be &euro;994 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;47.5 million over 2018.  This allocation of almost &euro;1 billion emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.</p><p>Defence Forces pay is continuing to increase in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over its lifetime.  The 2019 allocation includes &euro;6.3 million to meet the commitments for next year.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2020.</p><p>The Government has ensured that full funding has been provided for 2019 for the target strength for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500, and I continue to engage with the military authorities to ensure that retention and recruitment continue to be prioritised.  An additional &euro;2.2 million has been allocated to meet other current costs in the Defence Vote, and a further &euro;10 million has been allocated to the Army Pensions Vote to meet the retirement costs of ex-members of the permanent Defence Force and certain dependants.</p><p>In accordance with the national development plan, the capital allocation for defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million.  The national development plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022.  This level of capital funding will allow the defence organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper, and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In summary, the allocation for current expenditure, including pay and pension costs, in the defence sector for 2019 has increased by &euro;18.5 million, an increase of 2.1%.  This, combined with the increased capital allocation, will give an overall provision of almost &euro;1 billion for next year, illustrating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all their assigned roles.</p></speech>

It says that the defence group expenditure for 2019 represents 1.49% of total Government spending.  The group expenditure ceiling as a percentage of GDP last year was higher.  We have a lot of spin around recruitment and retention, but the bare facts show that his Department has the lowest percentage increase in allocation in a Government context.  Year on year, for example, as a percentage of GDP, the allocation for next year has dropped.  It is 0.291% versus 0.292% this year.  The gross national income has dropped to 0.479% for next year, which is again a percentage reduction.</p>  <p>  All the key metrics point to a reduced defence budget in real terms.  In this internal document, which is from the military authorities themselves, it is stated that an evaluation utilising a number of key statistics would indicate that defence spending is reducing or remaining stagnant in real terms.  How can the Minister of State stand over a stagnant budgetary allocation when we have such a recruitment and retention crisis and issues around morale?  It is important that the mandarins in his Department secure a greater allocation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Did he call them mandarins?  It is total ignorance to call a civil servant a mandarin.  It is beneath the Deputy and anybody in this House.  I will say no more.  It is up to the Deputy to correct the record if he wants to proceed in that manner.</p>  <p>  Almost &euro;1 billion is being allocated for defence spending in 2019.  That is a &euro;47 million increase, which equates to a 5% increase in 2019.</p>  <p>  The conclusions reached in the internal document that the Deputy talks about are completely contradicted by its own analysis.  It describes a 5.7% increase of &euro;48 million and also states that there is an increase of &euro;48 million in defence spending or 5.07% of the 2018 gross expenditure ceiling.  This document was prepared internally.</p>  <p>  I will stand over the increase and I am delighted that we gained the increase in this year's budget for defence spending.  We will be able to carry on with the ongoing capital investment within the Department and the Defence Forces.  The Deputy knows the real capital expenditure and investment that we are putting into the Defence Forces.  On the current side there was an increase of 2.1% and an increase of 37.7% on the capital side.  There is ongoing investment within the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to recruitment and retention.  The most important thing here is that the Government has provided resources to the Defence Forces for a full personnel complement of 9,500 members.</p></speech>

Defence spending in all of the key metrics is reducing or remaining stagnant in real terms.  He can spin it whatever way he likes to and so can his Department officials.  The reality is that under his leadership, his Department is beefing up its own internal management.</p><p>The Minister of State has created a new assistant secretary position while we are haemorrhaging massive numbers in a recruitment and retention crisis.  This is happening under the Minister of State's watch.  He secured the lowest percentage increase relative to other Departments.  He is the Scrooge of the Government when it comes to allocations and securing funding for military personnel in the State.  There will be a Public Service Pay Commission report next year, but there does not appear to be much hope in the budgetary allocation for that year.  If the Minister of State rejects the internal note made by military management, it is on him.  It looks at gross national income, gross domestic product and the key metrics in budgetary allocations and the allocation is stagnant.  Management also made a notable point in its report.  When compared to the Minister for Justice and Equality, military management states An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is receiving an additional &euro;60 million in 2019 to fund Garda reforms and the introduction of 800 new recruits.  Similarly, the overseas aid allocation has been increased by &euro;110 million in budget 2019.  Management is comparing the Minister of State's allocations negatively with those for the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

That confirms that the increase in the defence Vote was comparable with the increases in other Votes.  The Deputy says I am a Scrooge when it comes to negotiating a budget for the Department of Defence.  Since I was appointed to the Department, the budget has increased year on year.  The Deputy has an internal document.  It is quite worrying that it has been leaked from the Defence Forces, which it is presumed are secure.  I am disappointed that an internal document has been released into the public domain.  There was an increase of &euro;48 million, or 5.07%, in the 2018 gross expenditure ceiling.  I am quoting from the same document the Deputy has in his possession.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100005#C01500"><p>The Naval Service is the State's principal seagoing agency tasked with a variety of defence and other roles.  While the main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks.  I pay tribute to the significant security role the Naval Service routinely carries out.  By its nature, often that security role goes unrecognised or unacknowledged, but it is vital to Ireland's national priorities and interests.   </p>  <p>  Regarding its sea fisheries protection role, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 established the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, as the competent authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland.  A service level agreement is in place which underpins the relationship between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the defence organisation.  The agreement provides for the development of an annual control plan and agreed reporting and training arrangements.  It also provides a forum for sharing information between parties and dealing with fisheries control and enforcement issues.  </p>  <p>  Departmental officials, members of the Naval Service and the Air Corps have met officials of the SFPA at formal and informal meetings throughout the year and enjoy a collaborative relationship on sea fishery protection matters.  I am advised that, notwithstanding challenges encountered in the Naval Service this year, the projected number of patrol days in 2018 will be 98.2% of the target agreed with the SFPA.  The SFPA has been kept fully informed of developments in sea fishery protection. </p>  <p>  I am assured by military management that the Naval Service continues to carry out its maritime, security and defence operational responsibilities.</p></reply>

There is a huge difference.  Ships are leaving Haulbowline and anchoring off the coast in order that it can be said they are operational.  That is a disgrace and must be addressed.  The Minister of State and the military authorities must admit that they cannot fulfil the duties they undertake with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority because they cannot get ships out to sea.  That would be an honest admission.  Some 138 patrol days had been lost by August this year and I doubt that they have been made up since.  The likelihood is that by the end of the year the annual control plan figures which range from 1,090 to to 1,267 will not have been achieved.  Will the Minister of State admit that the lack of recruits and the exodus of personnel are causing major problems for the Naval Service in delivering the service everybody wants?  What will he do to ensure ships are at sea patrolling and protecting the coastline?</p></speech>

In accordance with the agreement, the 2018 annual control plan has a target range of between 1,090 and 1,267 patrol days.  Notwithstanding the challenges encountered in the Naval Service this year, the projected number of patrol days in 2018 is 1,070, or 20 days short of the original target.  These are the figures I have received from the Naval Service.  The number of patrol days on fisheries and security duties in 2014 was 1,127.  In 2015 it was 1,204; in 2016, 1,367 and in 2017, 1,408.  At the end of October the figure was 1,345.  We have an excellent relationship with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Discussions with the Naval Service on its fisheries protection service have focused increasingly on the quality of inspections undertaken, rather than the quantity of inspections.  It is important that we continue to have that relationship and maintain the number of patrol days.</p></speech>

That may well be the case, but it does not explain the fact that in 2005 there were 1,681 patrol days, while the Minister of State is now talking about a figure of 1,000.  That does not compute.  As we now have more ships than we had in 2005, there is something wrong.  The Minister of State should admit that there is a major problem with retention in the Naval Service and that he cannot get ships out to sea to carry out full operations as it did in the past.</p></speech>

We also have similar commitments to those we had last year in the Mediterranean.  The Deputy referred to what the Chief of Staff said last week at the committee meeting.  He said that in all his years in the Naval Service days at sea had been lost for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Five per cent of the days lost at sea were due to personnel reasons.  That has always been the case and there is nothing new in it.  I have spoken about the challenges faced in the Naval Service.  We are considering our commitments in 2019.  However, this is one of our main commitments to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency and it will continue to be the case in 2019.  We have an excellent relationship with it.  I have instructed senior officials in my Department to meet its chief executive officer.  The letter came from a more junior person within the agency; it did not come from the chief executive officer and I want to get to the bottom of it.  We will continue to prioritise our commitment to the agency.</p></speech>

A new position, that of assistant secretary to deal with staff, has been created.  The Minister of State is beefing up internal bureaucracy, while the numbers in the Defence Forces are falling year on year.  He needs to address that matter.</p></speech>

There are a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.</p><p>Recruitment has continued in 2018, with the running of two general service recruit competitions, a cadet competition, apprentice competitions, an instrumentalist competition and direct entry streams.  They have resulted in more than 600 personnel being inducted to date in 2018.  The most recent figures, provided by the military authorities, give the whole-time equivalent strength of the Permanent Defence Force as just below 9,000 personnel.  Further inductions are scheduled in November and final figures for the numbers inducted in 2018 and strength will not be available until the end of the year.  Progress in recruitment will be reviewed in the coming weeks and inform future plans.</p><p>As I have outlined previously, there are particular challenges in recruiting and retaining certain specialists such as pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in current economic circumstances, there are ongoing lucrative private and commercial public sector job opportunities.  I understand the retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and is not unique to Ireland.  A range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas.  My Department has introduced a scheme which permits former officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.  Currently, there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised in the recruitment of medical officers and engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment to fill certain specialist positions.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with examining recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector and requested material has been forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the Public Service Pay Commissions reports, its findings will be considered.</p><p>The Permanent Defence Force continues to offer excellent career opportunities for serving personnel and new entrants.  Ensuring the terms and conditions of serving members of the Permanent Defence Force are fair and balanced is also a key consideration. </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>There are a range of actions outlined in the 2015 White Paper on Defence which are aimed at advancing this goal.  The criteria for extending service beyond 12 years have been revised and an examination of contracts for enlisted personnel has been prioritised.  A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force has also been brought forward.  In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance, which is also to be welcomed.</p><p>The Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and undertake the tasks laid down by it, both at home and overseas.</p></speech>

We know that last week the Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mellett, had to offer his perspective and unique insight because all of the recommendations he had made to the Minister of State and his Department had been completely ignored in the Minister of State's submission, which represents a complete failure of the Government.  The Public Service Pay Commission potentially may come back next year with recommendations that will not address the serious issues in recruitment and retention.  As of this year, 30% of recruits who left purchased their discharge.  That represents a doubling of the practice in two years.  There has been a massive exodus from the Defence Forces.  In addition, the Minister of State did not clarify when the target strength set out in the White Paper would be reached.  It was set by Deputy Coveney when he was the Minister.  Under the Minister of State's leadership and during his tenure the numbers are moving in only one direction - away from the target strength - because of the Government's failure to address recruitment and retention policies.</p>  <p>  The loss of expertise and experience in the Defence Forces is also an issue and it is not possible to address it by way of recruitment.  Personnel are leaving the Defence Forces year on year and their experience which cannot be replaced is being lost to the organisation.  Even the recruits who are entering the Defence Forces are purchasing their way out under the Minister of State's leadership.  It is pity that he ignored all of the recommendations made by the Chief of Staff and that he has had to make such public pleas.</p></speech>

It come back to us directly because there was too much in the public domain.  A document was put into the public domain and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated it did not want recommendations to be made, that it wanted hard data.  That is exactly what it got in the joint submission, namely, the data analysis it had sought.  I am delighted that both the Department and the military came up with a joint submission.  The Chief of Staff described the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission as being very robust.  I look forward to the commission reporting back in due course.  The Government can then consider its findings.</p></speech>

I will give him some hard facts.  Sixty-six members of the Naval Service are sleeping on Naval Service vessels while onshore because they cannot afford to rent a home.  They are the bare facts and data.  Recommendations were made by the Chief of Staff to shine a light on issues in the organisation, but they were dropped by the mandarins in the Minister of State's Department.  "Mardarins" is an appropriate word to use, but it can be replaced with bureaucracy.  The Minister of State will not shut me down or tell me what is in the confidence and supply arrangement.  He contradicted his previous statement when he said no recommendations had been made when, under his leadership, he made recommendations for pilots in the Air Corps.  His policy is completely contradictory.  He allowed recommendations to be made in one instance and then ignored recommendations made by the Chief of staff's office.  That is a complete contradiction.  I will define what is in the confidence and supply arrangement and will not have the Minister of State or the Government tell me what it is.  Fianna F&aacute;il is clear that we are absolutely committed to the Defence Forces and dealing with the pay and conditions of personnel and retention issues.  During the Minister of State's tenure in the Department the numbers are moving in one direction - away from the target strength of 9,500 as outlined in the White Paper.  He even failed to indicate when he would achieve that target.</p></speech>

The most recent figures provided by the military authorities give the whole-time equivalent strength of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, as just below 9,000 personnel.  The establishment for the Naval Service is 1,094 personnel.  The current strength of the Naval Service is just below 1,000 personnel.  The number of personnel departing the Naval Service can fluctuate year on year.  While the level of turnover may exceed other areas of the public service, this is a feature of military organisations.</p><p>Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force has continued in 2018 and, as I have previously outlined, particular challenges exist in recruiting and retaining certain specialists.  I understand that the retention of such specialists, for example, pilots, has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland.  A range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas.  My Department has introduced a scheme which permits former officers with specialist skills to re-enter the PDF and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.  Currently, there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised for the recruitment of medical officers and engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with examining recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces organisation and requested material has been forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am very much in favour of allowing the commission to undertake its analysis objectively and independently, and I do not wish to pre-empt that process.  When the Public Service Pay Commission reports, its findings will be considered at that point.</p><p>With regard to other retention measures, there are a range of actions outlined in the White Paper on Defence of 2015 which are aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Defence Forces.  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>These include human resources initiatives which impact on retention such as providing career development opportunities and accreditation.  The criteria for extending service beyond 12 years have been revised and this has ensured that personnel who would have had to depart could remain.  An examination of age profiles for enlisted personnel has been prioritised and this is being progressed.  A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force has also been brought forward.  In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and this is also to be welcomed.</p><p>The conciliation and arbitration, CA, scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides an established mechanism for the PDF representative associations to engage with the official side.  The scheme has provided the framework to progress many successful negotiated agreements between defence management and the PDF representative associations.  I initiated a fundamental review of the scheme and have recently received the report from the independent chair.  Currently, the parties to the scheme are considering the process for implementing the recommendations contained in this report.  The Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas. </p></speech>

The Minister of State should have read the question carefully.  Whoever called his officials mandarins was correct.  My question is about the retention and recruitment of staff and the current policy in respect of recognition of representative associations of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  PDFORRA recently took the Government to court over the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Is the Minister of State not ashamed and embarrassed that he had to be taken to court for the Defence Forces to have their basic working rights enforced?  Imagine that.  The Government has legislation on workers' rights but will not implement it for the Defence Forces or members of the Naval Service and Air Corps.  How demoralised does the Minister of State want to make these people?  The figures are available for the number of people who are buying their way out of the most demoralised, low paid job in the public sector, and the Minister of State sits in denial as if he was going on his holidays somewhere.  What is going on here is an absolute scandal.  Members of the Naval Service, Army and Air Corps are being treated like dirt by the Government in many aspects of how they have to live their lives.  They cannot acquire homes.  They are being pushed out of married quarters in the most awful conditions in barracks such as Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I refer in particular to low pay and the lack of recognition for the trade union, PDFORRA.  The Minister of State's continued denial of the right to union recognition is not serving him well.</p></speech>

She spoke about pay.  Members of the Defence Forces, like all members of the public service, have received pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement and the public service stability programme.  There is no use the Deputy nodding her head when I am only telling her the facts.  Further pay increases took effect on 1 January and 1 October this year and by 2020 all those on a salary in excess of &euro;70,000 will have their pay fully restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  In parallel, I increased salaries to address the disparity between pre and post-2013 entrants.  We are entering into negotiations on the adjudications in the public service stability programme.  In addition, a joint submission was made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration in respect of the Public Service Pay Commission.  I hope to see the commission's report in the first or second quarter of 2019 but I want to allow it the time and space to do its work.  It has reported on the health sector and is already meeting members of the Defence Forces regarding the submission we have made.</p></speech>

Yahoo.  He should look at the increases in the cost of living and rents.  What a great thing that members of the Defence Forces will have their pay brought back to 2008 levels.  They are among the lowest paid public sector workers in the country.  It is disingenuous of the Minister of State to refer to those earning &euro;70,000 because they are not the majority in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  When will the Minister of State give recognition to the members of PDFORRA, as recommended by the European Committee on Social Rights?  That is my core question.  It is interesting that the Government is able to recommend introducing certain things the European Union says we must have in this country, for example, water charges, but refuses to recognise workers' rights.  These workers need recognition.  They need to be members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and they do not need to be taking the Minister of State to court because they were threatened with legal action for taking part in a march outside the D&aacute;il over low pay and conditions a couple of months ago.  That was a shocking thing to do to those people and it will embarrass the Government when the case for freedom of assembly becomes public knowledge when it comes to court.  The Defence Forces should be given the right to free assembly and decent pay and conditions.  Failing that, the Government will face the consequences.</p></speech>

On the matter of ICTU, I ask the Deputy to read the report into the review of the CA scheme, which is published on the Department's website.  It was carried out by Mr. Gerard Barry.  He recommends that my Department officials talk to ICTU on the issue the Deputy raised.  I welcomed the report.

Within the European Union, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence, including national spending on defence and security.  We alone continue to decide on defence investment and deployment of our Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's participation in Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, which we joined in December 2017, Ireland has committed to increase our defence budgets regularly in real terms.</p><p>It should be noted that &quot;regularly&quot; does not mean &quot;annually&quot; but in the medium term.  The allocations for defence announced in budget 2019 mean that Ireland's defence expenditure will increase in real terms in the coming three years.<br/><br/>Joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer.  Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency projects.  The projects where Ireland has confirmed our participation relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces' capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations.  Costs associated with participation in these projects will be incurred in the normal course and will, therefore, be met from within the defence Vote. <br/><br/>Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising the national finances during the financial crisis.  The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales.  Pay is being restored for members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of the increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In addition, in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 2013 were implemented. <br/><br/>In 2016 the Government established the Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective advice for it on public service pay policy.  Following the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission's report in May 2017, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The public service stability agreement 2018 to 2020 provides for increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4%, over the lifetime of the agreement.  The focus of the increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  The increases due from 1 January and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br/><br/>By the end of the current public service pay agreement the pay of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will have been restored to pre-FEMPI legislation levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances cut under the FEMPI legislation is also scheduled in the agreement.  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011 will also benefit from the measures recently announced on interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service.  This measure, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, will be effective from 1 March 2019.</p></speech>

I want to go back to a report that was debated in the European Parliament in May on strengthening EU-NATO relations.  It was adopted by the Parliament by 439 votes to 183, with four Irish MEPs voting against it and six abstaining, including the four Fine Gael MEPs.  The report emphasised PESCO's complementarity with NATO and that EU member states should be capable of launching autonomous military missions where NATO was not willing to act.  The EU army, also known as PESCO, is a proxy of NATO policy.  When we look at those calling for a European army such as President Macron and Mrs. Merkel, they are major or senior NATO players.  The increase in spending could mean that we would spend as much as NATO countries contribute, but the ethos of our armed forces is peacekeeping, humanitarian operations and the preservation of life and it contributes to our international reputation.  Will the Oireachtas have an opportunity to debate the same report as that debated by the European Parliament?  There is a contradiction, as there are concerns the increase in military spending will not benefit our military.  When we look at the overall EU budget, &euro;200 billion is spent annually on defence, of which we could be part.</p></speech>

I have no problem in coming before the House.  Ireland's participation in the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, arrangement has no implications for its policy on military neutrality.  It is very important that I point this out to the Deputy.  The PESCO projects in which we are participating will not require me to seek additional money from the Government.  The money will come from existing resources.  The projects in which we are participating are the European Union training mission competence centre project, TMCC, which aims to improve the availability and interoperability of specific skills and the professionalism of personal trainers for EU training missions in participating member states and the project to upgrade maritime surveillance which aims to integrate land based surveillance systems.  These projects will improve the capability of members of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

It would be good to have the debate because the matter is central to our policy on neutrality.  Are these issues raised when the Minister of State attends meetings at European level?  The figure of &euro;200 billion being spent by the European Union on defence is staggering.  When we campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council, we use our neutrality as a selling point.  We have a reputation that is far greater than our size or population would indicate.  We need to be a stronger voice on defence matters and in pointing to where extra finance is really needed.  We played a huge role in drawing up the sustainable development goals and getting agreement on them.  It will take huge resources to implement them and make them realisable.  Our EU partners that are calling for a European army are those with the biggest arms trades.  They are the ones that will benefit from increased defence spending.  We know what bigger armies lead to.  We only have to look at what happened in Germany in the 1930s.  They lead to war and do not prevent it.</p></speech>

No such proposals will come from this side of the House.  The Deputy knows what is provided for in the Lisbon treaty on a European army.  It would have to be subject to a referendum in Ireland.  The Government is not stating we will join a European army.  This has been a huge debate in Europe for many years, particularly when comments were made at Armistice ceremonies last week and the week before.  We are using our position on neutrality when it comes to winning a seat on the UN Security Council.  I was at the launch of our campaign earlier this year in New York.  We are looking at the work done by the Defence Forces on blue hat and overseas peacekeeping missions.  Members of the Defence Forces have a long and proud tradition of participating in blue hat missions.  Long may this continue because they do the country proud.  They serve Ireland with distinction and pride.</p></speech>

I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 81 together.</p>  <p>  The limitations on working time set out in the working time directive are for the purpose of preserving the health and safety of personnel.  The Department of Defence and military management are aware of the provisions of the working time directive and have been working closely to progress its implementation.  As I have previously informed the House, a Government decision, dated 18 November 2016, approved the drafting of the heads of a Bill to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  It will remove the blanket exclusions contained in section 3 of the Act.  Work is under way in the Department of Defence and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection towards the progression of this decision.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the working time directive can be applied to the members of the Defence Forces.  A review of Defence Forces activities found that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces appeared to be already in compliance with the directive.  Certain activities were identified which might require a derogation, as provided for, from its terms.  Other activities, owing to their nature, are unique and will require further consideration and broader consultation.  However, I am confident that such measures can be progressed without compromising the health and safety of members of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Litigation taken by a member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of the applicability of certain elements of the working time directive to the Defence Forces was settled in June this year in the High Court having regard to the specific circumstances of that case.  Further litigation on the working time directive as it relates to the Defence Forces is pending and it is not appropriate to comment further on it at this point.  The Department of Defence is engaging through the conciliation and arbitration process with the Defence Forces representative associations to discuss the application of the working time directive to the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

Such situations are becoming commonplace, and at the recent PDFORRA conference, it was stated that all the military services are overstretched due to ever decreasing manpower level.  PDFORRA is calling on the Department of Defence to carry out an investigation into the physical and psychological effects such prolonged working hours are having on soldiers, sailors and air crews.  This must be a worthwhile call and surely such an investigation could well bolster Defence Forces' cases with the Public Service Pay Commission.  Delegates attending the association's annual conference in Castlebar, County Mayo, heard many of those doing 24 hour shifts also face commutes to and from work to start and carry out those long working hours.  Speakers expressed concern that many military personnel suffer from sleep deprivation and enormous stress levels.  They called it a serious health and safety issue.  Will the Minister investigate this situation?</p></speech>

Many of the activities of the Defence Forces comply with the provisions of the working time directive.  As the Deputy will appreciate, implementation of the directive will amount to a fundamental change in working conditions that have been in place for many years.  The implementation of the working time directive in the Defence Forces is a complex arrangement that requires considerable thought to ensure that, on the one hand, employers' rights are recognised and, on the other hand, the Defence Forces continue to play the varied roles assigned by Government.  Department officials are engaging with military management and are working and engaging with the Defence Forces' representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration process.  I do not accept that members are doing three 24 hour duties per week.  Members are tasked with doing 24 hour duties.  That is the nature of the Defence Forces' organisation, and when members join up, they accept they have to do 24 hour duties.  I do not accept that members are doing three 24 hour duties per week.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has a White Paper target of 9,500 recruits despite massive non-compliance with the working time directive and numbers that fall below 9,000.  What is the pathway of recruitment?  If the Minister of State strives to achieve the White Paper target of 9,500 and compliance with the working time directive, there is a mismatch in respect of the work that can be done.  Does the Minister of State need to review the White Paper recruitment target?  Should the number be much higher as the Minister of State strives to achieve compliance beyond the working time directive?  The Minister of State and maybe everyone involved in this process are not being genuine with people who want to implement the working time directive.  The headline number of 9,500 as a target, despite non-compliance, will be a mismatch even if the Minister does achieve compliance.  What is the Minister of State doing about the White Paper and achieving compliance?</p></speech>

The Defence Forces' organisation is no different.  Then we have to prioritise the work.  What are the most important pieces of work?  Is it sending people overseas, aiding the civil power, aiding the civil authority, or the daily ongoing duties that members of the Defence Forces carry out?  I have tasked the military management with doing a gap analysis.  I have brought forward a White Paper initiative to examine the gaps within the organisation.  We are working on that.  I want to get that back as soon as possible.  It is important work that has to be carried out.  That will help us make decisions on what we can prioritise and what the most important pieces of work are that the Defence Forces have to carry out.  That is all about prioritising work that the Defence Forces do daily, weekly and monthly and which comprises sending people overseas.  Will we be able to continue to send the numbers overseas that we are sending at the moment?</p></speech>

Since then, as the numbers in the Defence Forces have declined, those stress levels can only have increased, especially as the Defence Forces have to work exceptionally long hours on top of that.  I understand that there is still no psychiatrist in the Defence Forces.  Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten us on that.</p>  <p>  Many of the staff are not only working long hours but are caught in poverty traps.  For example, a Defence Forces worker, whose pay is so low that they have to take the family income supplement, cannot get a mortgage.  When such a person goes to the county council for a county council mortgage, they are told the family income supplement is not an income but a social welfare support and the council cannot give them a mortgage.  When they ask if they can go on the housing list, they are told the family income supplement is an income and they are over the threshold go on the housing list.  Some of these soldiers and other Defence Forces personnel are being caught in poverty traps.  Will the Minister of State address these matters?</p></speech>

People talk about 70%, 60% and 40% but it is actually less than 1% of the Defence Forces organisation personnel.  That includes the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  I have not come across people who have not been able to get on the housing list.  I do not know about people's personal circumstances.  The working family payment is there for a reason.  It depends on the size of the family and other reasons.</p>  <p>  We are trying to recruit a psychiatrist and that is proving difficult.  I understand that a proposal is coming to me shortly around that.  The Deputy knows, given that he is a spokesperson in this area, that recruitment of psychiatrists is an issue not just for the Defence Forces but for the HSE as well.  Members of the Defence Forces and the Chief of Staff reiterated this at a committee meeting last Thursday, and any enlisted personnel or officer personnel receive all the medical mental care and attention from the private market when it is required.</p></speech>

It is part of the EU's broader action to provide a comprehensive response to the global migration and refugee crisis and to encourage a democratic, stable and prosperous Libya.  It specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers' business model.  The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan coastguard and navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 2240 and 2292.  These resolutions also authorise the interception of vessels suspected of being used for illicit activities and impose an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related material into that country.</p><p>In July 2017, Government and D&aacute;il approval was secured for the deployment of an Irish Naval Service vessel as part of Operation Sophia.  The participation by <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>in Operation Sophia represented the first involvement by the Naval Service in a multilateral security operation under a UN mandate.</p><p>In the course of an 11 week deployment in the Mediterranean in 2017, the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>rescued 613 migrants, assisting with a further 107 migrant rescues.<br/><br/>In February 2018, the Government approved a further Naval Service contribution to Operation Sophia for a period of approximately eight months.  <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett</i>deployed from mid-April to mid-July and was replaced in the area of operations by <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>.  <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>returned to Ireland on 27 October 2018.  During 2018 <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett</i>rescued 106 migrants in total.  <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>was not tasked by the Operation Sophia Force Commander or by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre with search and rescue activities during its period of deployment. <br/><br/>The type of tasks assigned to Irish naval vessels depends on the Operation Sophia Force Commander and mission requirements at any point in time.  In addition to search and rescue operations, Irish naval vessels undertake activities in support of the core task of the mission including gathering information on oil smuggling, patrols focusing on countering illegal arms trafficking, operations to intercept smugglers and people traffickers and monitoring the effectiveness of the Libyan navy and coastguard activity from a stand-off distance.<br/><br/>Operation Sophia has played a decisive role in improving the overall maritime security in the central Mediterranean.  The latest information from the United Nation's migration agency, International Organisation for Migration, IOM, reports that as of 14 November 2018, the number of migrants and refugees entering Europe by sea was 103,347.  This figure is considerably lower than those at this time in 2017, 156,708, and 2016, 343,258.  In addition, the operation has so far contributed to the apprehension of 151 suspected smugglers and traffickers, removed approximately 550 boats from criminal organisations availability, contributed to over 300 safety of life at sea events and rescued almost 45,000 migrants.  While there is currently no Irish ship deployed to the operation, Defence Forces personnel continue to occupy two posts in the operational headquarters in Rome and two in the force headquarters at sea.<br/><br/>Ireland's participation in Operation Sophia in 2019 is currently being considered and a decision will be taken on the matter following a full review of 2018 deployments.  Other factors to be taken into account include the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces both at home and abroad and available resources.</p></speech>

This has been borne out by the figures provided by the Minister of State, that the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>returned after 100 days at sea, not having saved a single life, which was the intended purpose and why this House and the general public has lauded the Irish Navy for its actions in the past.  In 2015 the Irish Navy saved 8,592 lives, in 2016 it was 7,029 and even last year, when Operation Sophia was fully operational, it was 1,888, yet, as the Minister of State stated, this year the <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett</i>saved only 106 lives and none was saved by the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>in its 16 weeks in the Mediterranean.  The purpose for which the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>was used was to send armed boarding parties onto suspect vessels and it was the only navy to have that duty in the recent past.  Will the Minister of State confirm this?</p></speech>

I think we have saved thousands because we have interrupted the smugglers' model and have destroyed the boats that they used to smuggle migrants.  The UN migration agency has been compiling migrant arrival data across the Mediterranean since 2014 and has reported that the number of migrants arriving by sea has continued to drop.  The numbers arriving in 2018 are the lowest since the crisis began.  Those are not our figures.  As part of Operation Sophia, Ireland is working closely as part of the 27 EU member States making a contribution to addressing some of the root causes of migration and human trafficking as well as continuing to be involved in the rescue of migrants at sea.</p>  <p>  When we joined Operation Sophia, Operation Pontus was a humanitarian search and rescue mission undertaken as part of Ireland's bilateral agreement with the Italian authorities.  Its sole focus was the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean.  Now we have joined Operation Sophia which specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean by taking action against criminal networks-----</p></speech>

Operation Sophia is a military mission.  I am not saying that: that is what the Council decision which established it says, namely that "The Union shall conduct a military crisis management operation".  The Defence Forces 2017 annual report says "In July 2017, Government and D&aacute;il approval was secured for the redeployment of Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue operations, to primarily security and interception operations".  It is not to save migrants from drowning or because we have a particular expertise.  Recently, we submitted a freedom of information request to the Department of Defence which confirmed to us that none of those considerations formed the backdrop of the decision to participate in Operation Sophia.  In fact, it is part of the Government's drip-drip participation into involvement in permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and a future European army.</p></speech>

When we joined PESCO, which I brought to Cabinet and to the House.  Members of this House voted democratically to join Operation Sophia.  It totally changed the mission in which we were participating under Operation Pontus.  Operation Sophia specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers' business model.  By improving maritime security, Operation Sophia is actively contributing to the EU and international efforts for the return of stability in Libya.  In addition, Operation Sophia plays an important role in training the Libyan coastguard.  We were not doing any of these things under Operation Pontus.  I was very clear when we joined Operation Sophia that we were joining a UN-mandated military mission.  The work of members of the Irish Navy and Defence Forces, who are representing Ireland in the Mediterranean, does us proud and they are doing a good job.</p></speech>

Operation Sophia is pulling people back to a place of violence and human rights violations.  Only yesterday, authorities used rubber bullets and tear gas to force more than 90 refugees to disembark a cargo ship docked in Misrata.  The stand off lasted ten days.  The refugees, including children, said that they would rather die than return to indefinite detention in Libya.  This is the reality of Libya and of Operation Sophia.  Scores of refugees are killing themselves in the detention centres where the Irish Navy help the Libyan coastguard to keep these desperate people.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that he is saving lives by interrupting smugglers but he is sending people back to violence.  They would rather be killed than go back.  He spoke of a UN mandate but we should not forget that the UN gave the mandate to destroy this place to begin with.</p><p>There is no sense in what is going on.  We should have nothing to do with this military mission.  We are crucifying people by sending them back to Libya.  The Government agreed with the NATO mission which, sadly, was backed by a UN mandate.</p></speech>

Our number one priority was reducing the number of lives being lost because no one was stopping smugglers from bringing migrants across.  We are now stopping them from bringing migrants across very unsafe waters in unsafe vessels.</p></speech>

Therefore, there is still a need for a humanitarian rescue mission in the Mediterranean.  The Minister of State has said the Naval Service has been responsible for destroying the boats of smugglers.  Will he confirm that because my information is that the Naval Service is not present in Libyan ports?  Is it destroying them at sea?  How many ships or boats have been escorted back to Libyan waters by, for instance, the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>?  How many ships have been escorted to EU ports in the same time period?</p></speech>

We have already started a process in that regard.  The numbers of migrants drowning have decreased, but the numbers of desperate refugees being detained in Libya, sadly, have not.  A M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res doctor has described what it is like for migrants from Libya, stating those who make it are detained arbitrarily.  He continued:</p><blockquote>Many are held for months without adequate sanitation or food.  Torture and rape become a part of daily life.  Scabies eats at their skin.  Infectious diseases like tuberculosis spread easily.  </blockquote><p>That is where we send them back and they are intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, a coast guard we have trained and equipped to hold them in these positions.  It is not humanitarian and not helpful.  It is an absolutely appalling violation of human rights and not something in which the people would want the Defence Forces to be involved.</p></speech>

It was a wonderful achievement.  Now its job is to make sure refugees do not reach Europe and the lawless Libyan coast guard intercepts them before they drown because if they set foot on one of our boats, under humanitarian law, we will be obliged to bring them to Italy.  As we know, the last ship brought nobody there.  The NATO mission that started all of this, with a UN mandate and the support of the Government, destroyed Libya which is now a dysfunctional state and out of control.  Only last year CNN footage showed young black boys being sold as slaves for $400.  France and the United Kingdom drove it with the help of President Obama.  That is what the NATO mission brought about - it brought slavery back to Libya.  It got rid of Gaddafi but replaced him with something 100 times worse.</p></speech>

The European Union was also building capacity in Libya aimed at improving conditions for the exact people to whom the Deputy referred.  That is a known fact which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has stated in the House.  Operation Sophia is only one element of the European Union's response.

In that context, there is ongoing recruitment to replace personnel who depart.  Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force has continued throughout 2018.  It encompassed two general service recruitment competitions, a cadet competition, an apprentice competition, an instrumentalist competition and direct entry streams.  They have resulted in over 600 personnel being inducted to date.  The most recent figures provided by the military authorities give the whole-time equivalent strength of the Permanent Defence Force as being just below 9,000 personnel.  Final figures for the numbers inducted in 2018 and strength will not be available until year end.  Progress in recruitment will be reviewed in the coming weeks and inform future plans.</p>  <p>  There are challenges in recruiting and retaining certain specialists such as pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic environment and jobs market, there are demands for such specialists in other sectors.  It is a challenge being faced by military forces elsewhere and is not confined to Ireland.  A range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas.  My Department has introduced a scheme which permits former officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.  There is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised in the recruitment of medical officers and engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment to fill certain specialist positions.    </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with examining recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector.  An initial tranche of material related to Air Corps pilots was submitted earlier this year.  Further material related to the broader defence sector has been sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is co-ordinating the response on behalf of the Public Service Pay Commission.  When the Public Service Pay Commission reports, its findings will be considered.</p><p> Ensuring that the terms and conditions of serving members of the Permanent Defence Force are fair and balanced is also a key consideration.  A range of actions outlined in the 2015 White Paper on Defence are aimed at advancing this goal.  The criteria for extending service beyond 12 years have been revised and an examination of retirement ages for enlisted personnel has been prioritised.  A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force has also been brought forward.  In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p> The Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles assigned by it Government and to the White Paper strength target of 9,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force.  There are a number of factors, some of which are difficult to predict, that will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.</p></speech>

To do that and maintain increased spending, there had to be increases in taxes elsewhere.  Last year, for example, commercial stamp duty went from 2% to 6%.  That yielded approximately &euro;400 million, which paid for the tax reductions on that occasion.  In this year's budget, income tax and USC reductions of approximately &euro;300 million, or &euro;350 million in a full year, were paid for by a significant increase in VAT on food, accommodation and hotels, raising about &euro;560 million from the hotel and food sector in a full year.</p>  <p>  Last weekend, the Taoiseach promised to raise the income threshold at which people paid the higher rate from &euro;35,000 to &euro;50,000 over the next five years, amounting to approximately &euro;3 billion in that time or anything from &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million per year.  That is double the tax packages of the past two or three years.  Clearly, other taxes will have to increase just like this year and last year.</p>  <p>  We know that carbon tax was on the agenda this year, but the Government decided not to increase it.  The ESRI in its study has stated that there will have to be dramatic increases in carbon tax to make up for our failure in terms of our climate change agenda.  Currently, households are paying about &euro;200 in carbon tax.  According to the ESRI, that could go to &euro;3,000 per year per household by 2024.  That will happen over the next five or six years as income tax is reduced.  All of the scenarios in the ESRI's study are stringent ones, with the figure I cited at the bottom end of the scale.  There could potentially be higher carbon tax increases.</p>  <p>  On 5 August, the Taoiseach said that, if we were going to meet our 2020 climate change targets, which we clearly will not, we would have to grasp the nettle in pricing carbon and increasing the carbon tax in the next couple of years.  He stated that next year's budget, which is the one we have just passed, had to include an increased carbon tax - it did not for some reason - if Ireland was to meet its obligations on tackling climate change and that the Government was working on a set of proposals.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has also stated that carbon tax would have to be increased.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach give us the trajectory of how much carbon tax will rise each year over the next five years?  Can he give the House the same precision on annual carbon tax increases over that time as he has given us regarding income tax reductions over the next five years?</p></speech>

I am a very strong supporter of reducing taxes on income and taxes on work.  I know some people believe that, when one reduces income tax or USC, one is somehow giving people money.  I do not see it that way.  I believe it is allowing people to hold onto more of the money that they earned in the first place.</p>  <p>  We know at the moment, when we need to continue to attract jobs and investment from overseas and so many people are getting increments and pay rises and are now able to work extra hours, that we want to incentivise people.  That means reducing the amount of income taxes that they pay.  Over the last couple of years since we have managed to get the economy working for people again, we have been able to reduce income taxes.  We took hundreds of thousands of people out of the USC net entirely when we were in government with Labour.  Now, one third of people who work do not pay any income tax at all.  In more recent years, we have really focused on reducing the USC and reducing the point at which people pay that highest rate of income tax.  Just in the past three budgets, including the one just gone by, for the average person earning about &euro;45,000, those cuts in income tax and USC are worth about &euro;750 in a full year.  For a couple on an average income, those tax and USC reductions are worth about &euro;1,500 in a full year.  That is not a huge amount of money, but &euro;1,500 a year is probably a month's rent, probably a month's mortgage, probably a month's childcare, or perhaps a bit more than that.  I think we can do better in the years ahead if we keep the economy growing, if we make sure that we manage the public finances prudently.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's assessment that income tax reductions have to be paid for by tax rises elsewhere is not entirely true.  I would argue that most of the money that we are going to get from VAT next year and most of the money that we are getting from stamp duty this year is going into additional public spending.  If one looks at the entire budget package of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion, the amount of that that comes from tax increases or discretionary revenue measures is a couple of hundred million euro.  It is not as straightforward as just offsetting one from the other.  Someone could equally argue that that money is going into health or that money is going into housing, for example.</p></speech>

We are able to afford a tax package of about &euro;620 million per year and still increase public spending from &euro;66.5 billion next year to &euro;68.7 billion the year after to &euro;70.8 billion the year after that, &euro;72.6 billion the year after that and &euro;74.6 billion the year after that.  I am happy to provide those costings, which indicate how we can continue to increase public spending and also afford modest tax reductions.  That is, of course, contingent on managing the economy well, managing the public finances, making sure that people have jobs to go to and doing all of the things that are fundamental to having an economy working well.</p></speech>

I asked whether he could give me a precise trajectory of the annual increases in carbon tax that will happen year by year over the next five years.  The Minister for Finance has said that there will be carbon tax increases.  The Taoiseach said in August that there will be carbon tax increases.  It is all very well to make a specific pledge on one aspect of a budgetary package, that being income tax, but that has to be paid for.  Explicitly, the Taoiseach came to us last year and said the Government would pay for last year's tax package via commercial stamp duty, a one-off windfall owing to an increase from 2% to 6%.  This year, there is no question but that the Government could not have provided a &euro;300 million tax package without deciding to increase VAT on the hotel and food sectors back to 13%.  That is what paid for it.  Otherwise, there would have been drastic cuts in services, for example, health and education, which the Taoiseach has not suggested will happen.</p>  <p>  The bottom line that we are failing abysmally in terms of our climate change targets.  There is no question or dispute about that.  The ESRI has said that this will be the reality over the next number of years and that it will have to be paid for.</p>  <p>  My question was simple.  The Taoiseach has said on the record that carbon tax will and should be increased.  Can he give me a precise trajectory as to how much it will increase by, or is the ESRI completely off the mark with the figure of &euro;3,000 per household by 2024?  It is a fair question.  The Government will not be able to reduce-----</p></speech>

This is a mark and a measure of the desperation and frustration of nurses and midwives.  The Minister for Finance, by way of response to this ballot, is hard-balling nursing and midwifery staff by claiming that their pay demands would compromise budgetary policy.  He made this claim just two days after the Taoiseach promised a &euro;3 billion tax cut at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  The threat of industrial action by nurses and midwives is the inevitable consequence of this Government's failure to deal with the recruitment and retention crisis in our health service and among nursing staff in particular.  For years now nurses, midwives and their unions have highlighted this recruitment and retention crisis and have proposed reasonable and responsible solutions to address it but there has been complete disengagement from the Government on the issue.</p>  <p>  Our nurses and midwives, as everyone will agree, provide an invaluable service to patients in our health system and we should expect that their jobs pay well.  We should also expect high morale in their ranks but that is not the case.  Nurses are justifiably frustrated at the current state of affairs.  It is little wonder that there is just one application for every four nursing and midwifery vacancies in the health service.  That in itself tells the story.  All the while, the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Health do not want to talk about the issue of pay but they must.  We have a very troubling situation now with desperate and frustrated nurses and midwives on one side and a Government that is happy to resort to megaphone diplomacy rather than direct engagement on the other.</p>  <p>  In April, the D&aacute;il passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals, with the prioritisation of pay.  It called on the Government to work with the unions to draw up a roadmap to full pay equality for nurses and midwives, with an implementation plan to deliver that equality within a short timeframe and not the eight year period proposed by the Government.  Will the Taoiseach now commit to acting on that motion?  Will the Government engage with the unions to ensure that nurses and health professionals get a fair deal and we are not facing into industrial relations chaos?</p></speech>

That pay deal was only negotiated and agreed a few months ago and its cost is &euro;400 million this year, another &euro;400 million next year and &euro;650 million the year after that.  The deal comes at considerable expense to the taxpayer, is about at the limit of what can be afforded and has cost a lot of money already.  It is important to remind the House of what is in the pay deal agreed with all of our public servants.  It includes a pay increase of approximately 7% over the period of the deal, with a pay increase next year for all staff and a special additional pay increase for low-paid staff earning less than &euro;30,000.  It also includes an extra pay increase in March for staff recruited after 2012 to bring their salary scales more in line with those of staff recruited before then.  The deal provides an increment for the vast majority of public servants next year and in addition to that, &euro;20 million has been set aside for targeted recruitment and retention measures for the nursing and midwifery professions.  That is what has already been offered, agreed and promised and is on the table.  We will honour that agreement in full.</p>  <p>  We are happy to engage with the nursing unions, of which there are three - SIPTU, the PNA and the INMO.  We are very happy to engage with all three of the unions that represent nurses and will do that in the way that we have always done in the past, namely, through the oversight group for the public service stability agreement, as agreed and, if necessary, through bodies such as the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  That is how industrial relations are handled and have been handled very well in this State for decades.  That is what we will continue to do but we must bear in mind that this is an agreement that applies to all public servants and we will honour it.</p></speech>

There are 63 people on trolleys in Limerick, for example, 34 in Cork University Hospital and 34 in Tallaght Hospital.  I could go on and recite the litany right across the State.  In my opening remarks I said that there is only one application for every four nursing and midwifery vacancies in the system.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged and accepted that there is a crisis at the heart of our health system, yet he seems unprepared to do what is necessary to resolve it.  The very last thing that we need now is industrial action by nurses and midwives.  The HSE will only introduce its winter plan at the end of November.  That is how far behind the curve the system is in dealing with the burden of health care.  The nurses have a legitimate claim and grievance.  The Taoiseach has said the Government will engage with all of the unions.  What form will that engagement take?  He cited the industrial relations apparatus, with which I am more than familiar, but it will take more than that.  Will the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Health meet the unions?  Will they sit down, face to face, around the table to seek a resolution to this crisis?</p></speech>

There are far too many patients waiting for admission to a proper hospital bed almost every day of the week, all year around.  What can we do about that?  Obviously better and proper management systems make a difference and we know that from the hospitals that are performing well.  We also need more beds and better primary care so people do not end up in hospital in the first place.  Additional beds cost money as does additional funding for primary care and general practice.  Additional staff also costs money but if we put too much money into pay rises for existing staff, there will be less money available for more beds, more staff and for primary care and patients will lose out.</p></speech>

How did the Government deal with it?  It rewarded it.  Avestus has been given &euro;25 million to build and make more money.</p> <p> The Comptroller and Auditor General announced last week that he had sought further information on this loan sale and he may begin an investigation.  Why is his office the only one that seems to have any appetite to seriously hold NAMA to account.  Sadly, I do not think the Government has done so and, sadly, the Garda has failed to do so.</p> <p> I want to focus on a different area of white-collar crime today.  The Taoiseach might remember back to May 2017 and the case of the former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, one of the most expensive cases in the history of the State.  It collapsed due to the inadequate investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  The ODCE was then asked to do a report explaining the collapse of the trial.  The report has been with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, since June 2017, yet has not been published due to legal advice.  I have seen the report.  It is a whitewash and does not address the issues regarding the mistakes made by the ODCE during the case.</p> <p> I have here the transcript of Judge John Aylmer's statement from 23 May 2017, when he had no choice but to acquit the former Anglo CEO due to the ODCE's botching of the investigation.  The judge was scathing of the ODCE and, when one compares the judge's transcript with the internal investigation by the ODCE, it is clear that the ODCE is covering up its own mistakes.  The white-collar crime agency, responsible for uncovering crime, is instead covering up itself.  It would be hard to make it up.</p> <p> On 23 October, the Law Reform Commission published an 800-plus page report into white-collar crime with more than 200 recommendations.  One of its main recommendations was the establishment of a corporate crime agency and it even drafted the Bill.  Will the Taoiseach bring forward this legislation immediately and start an immediate wind-down of the ODCE?  Has the Taoiseach read the ODCE report?  Is he concerned that the ODCE has submitted a report to Government that is, in essence, a cover-up of its own mistakes?  How can we have confidence in this organisation?</p></speech>

I imagine the Deputy would have come to his conclusions about whether it was a whitewash or not before he read it.  I will read it and form my own opinion on it once I have.  I am advised by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that the report will be brought to Cabinet this week or the week after and will be published thereafter.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace will recall that, back in November of 2017, the Government published a package of actions that it is taking when it comes to cracking down on white-collar crime.  It was entitled Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework - Ireland combatting &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;.  That was launched by me, the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flanagan, around this time last year.  There are 28 actions we are taking to crack down on white-collar crime and they are very much under way.  One of the key actions in the package is establishing the ODCE as a stand-alone company law, compliance and enforcement agency, and that is the direction of travel in terms of policy.  We are taking it out of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and making it a stand-alone agency in its own right so that it would be better equipped to pursue cases such as this.</p>  <p>  There has also been additional resourcing for the ODCE.  An additional &euro;1 million provided for it next year to strengthen the work it does.  In terms of legislation, the Government, back in July, signed into law the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act and also the shareholders' rights directive will be transposed into law by 2019.  Before the recess, we passed the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act.  A lot of legislation that needed to be put in place has been put in place.  Additional resourcing has been given to the ODCE and our plan is to establish it as a stand-alone agency to give it more teeth.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach made an unfair comment that I would make a judgment before I actually read the report.  No, I did not, and I would not accuse him of it.  What I will ask the Taoiseach to do is that I will give him the judge's statement on the day and he should read that, then read the ODCE report, and he should then tell me if this is an organisation that the Government should be reinforcing, because that is what the Government is doing.  The Government is ignoring what has happened.  It is ignoring the fact that the ODCE has done a complete whitewash.  It has covered up its own mistakes.  What the ODCE has had to say in that whitewashed report bears no resemblance to what the judge had to say on that day back in May 2017.  There is no comparison.  I ask the Taoiseach to read it.  Is he prepared to read it?  I will give it to him, since he seems to have difficulty getting access to these reports.</p>  <p>  I remember the Taoiseach saying he did think we needed an examination as to how the case went wrong and why those mistakes were made by the ODCE.  That is a long time ago for a fellow who is interested in tackling white-collar crime.</p></speech>

It requires a combination of actions.  I have given the Deputy examples of some of the legislation that we have brought through just in the past year to crack down on white-collar crime, and we also need enforcement.  We are doing that by beefing up and providing more resources for the ODCE.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the ODCE, notwithstanding the fact that it has had a number of very successful prosecutions in recent years, should have done a lot better when it comes to other prosecutions, and that is why it is the Government's intention and policy to separate the ODCE from the Department.  It is currently an office of the Department, but we will establish it as a stand-alone agency, a sort of national white-collar crime bureau or an Irish version of the FBI when it comes to white-collar crime.  That is exactly what we intend to do.</p>  <p>  I have not seen that report and it has not yet been brought to Cabinet.  I obviously will read it before it goes to Cabinet and we will be happy to publish it and discuss it further with Deputy Wallace.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said the time will come some day when he is willing to say what he wants to do on climate.  I believe that day is today.  We cannot put it off any longer.  It is today because we, in the Committee on Climate Action, can see the scale of the challenge in front of us.  Under European law, we have to publish the first draft of a new national climate and energy plan by Christmas to be agreed by the end of next year.  We need to know what we are going to do on carbon taxation in drafting that plan.  Does anyone disagree with that?  How can we work out all the other measures if that measure is not in place?  It is one we have control over.</p>  <p>  I have a proposal for Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, McDonald and Howlin, and to be honest, if Fine Gael wishes to abstain from this issue, it would speak volumes.  Let the Taoiseach make that decision himself.  My proposal is similar to what the Taoiseach just said, that we would introduce an increase in carbon tax where every single cent would go straight back to the people in the form of a dividend, whether through the social welfare system, the tax system, or a cheque in the post.  In the climate committee last week, we asked the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to come back to us by 30 November with an outline of how that could work.  My proposal and question is whether we can agree in that committee the following measure, that next year we should introduce an increase of &euro;20 in the level of carbon tax, and that, in each subsequent year, there would be an increase of &euro;5 up to 2030 which would set the level at &euro;90 per tonne by that time.  It gives predictability, follows best policy advice and, critically, the money goes back to the people on any increased revenue.</p><p>We would use the existing carbon tax mechanisms in the way the Government has already planned, so there would be no additional costs or bureaucracy and this proposal would be relatively easy to introduce.  Critically, it would also be progressive as the analysis shows that it would deliver a more significant return for those on lower incomes than for those on higher incomes because the latter tend to consume more.</p> <p> What we learned from the ESRI yesterday is that the tax on its own would be nowhere near enough.  There are massive projects we need to carry out.  I would love if we started by commissioning Bord na M&oacute;na to do a major project of converting Irish homes from oil and gas-fired central heating to heat pumps and installing solar panels, insulation and electric vehicle charging points, particularly in the west, south west and north west and in rural areas.  We would save further through that approach. </p> <p> We need to know what the Taoiseach is going to do on carbon.  If the other party leaders cannot answer, I hope they will be able to do so by 30 November when the joint committee will meet to consider the Department of Finance's note on the ESRI study.  That is a question we all have to answer today, not at some time in the future.</p></speech>

It has to be about tax and regulation, but also investment.  We have set out a large part of the investment piece in Project Ireland 2040, but that will only bring us about one third of the way to meeting our targets for 2030.  It will involve measures such as investment in renewable energy; taking coal out of Moneypoint in 2025; getting out of peat, and the Deputy will have seen what is happening in that regard already; retrofitting homes, schools and buildings; electric vehicles; investment in public transport measures such as MetroLink, BusConnects and other projects around the country; and big changes in agriculture, for example, much more forestry and investment in technologies such as beef genomics.</p>  <p>  Tax has to be a part of this.  It is an area we need to get right.  I am conscious of what happened in Australia where the government tried and failed to bring in a carbon tax and the country has been set back by ten or 20 years as a result.  It was a little like what happened here with water charges.  I see what is now happening in France where President Macron is facing massive protests for increasing taxes on fuel.  If we are going to do this, let us do it successfully.  Let us get it right and learn from the mistakes of other countries and the mistakes we made in trying to introduce water charges, which was the right thing to do from an environmental point of view.  The model I personally favour is that which Prime Minister Trudeau is pursuing in Canada.  I had a chance to speak to him about it around two weeks ago.  </p></speech>

Let us not be dishonest in any way about what a carbon tax means.  It means that it will be more expensive for people to fill their cars with diesel or petrol.  It will increase the cost of transport for the haulage industry, have impacts on agriculture and make it more expensive to buy electricity and gas.  The adaptions that can be made to mitigate those effects will not happen in year one, two or three.  Even with the best intentions, it will take time to make them happen and for some people that will never be possible, in many cases because of where they live.  The best way to get this done, unlike in the case of water, would be on a cross-party basis and to agree on a trajectory over ten years.  I would be up for that.</p></speech>

That is a positive and welcome development.  Regardless of whether the carbon tax is &euro;80 or &euro;90 per tonne by 2030, my suggestion is the appropriate way to reach our objective.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach stated he was confident we would achieve our 2030 targets.  He also said the Government had experience as it had delivered the Action Plan for Jobs.  That is like saying we climbed the Sugar Loaf so we will climb Mount Everest tomorrow.  That is the scale of the change and challenge involved.  The leap we have to make is huge.  As Professor John Fitzgerald has said, we are rapidly moving in the wrong direction.  As the Taoiseach now admits, the development plan will not work and will bring us one third of the way at most.  The development plan says that by 2021 we will be deep retrofitting 45,000 houses a year.  That is the best, most beneficial and economic way to tackle this issue but we do not have the workers or money in place.  We have to set all of this up.  I come back to my key point.  The time is now.  To do this new plan by Christmas, when we have to present it to the European Commission, we need agreement on a whole range of complex and difficult issues.  I am glad the Taoiseach seems to be agreeing with what we are suggesting on the carbon tax.  I put it to the other parties that if, in committee, they agree on that one element and any other elements on which we can get agreement-----</p></speech>

When I compared this issue with the unemployment crisis and the Action Plan for Jobs, I was acknowledging that it is a big deal.  It is, however, a job that can be done.  I do not often find that Leaders' Questions moves things on in policy terms, but perhaps it does today.

There was a time when golf clubs were excluded from sports grants given that many thought that the clubs' own resources were enough to sustain them.  What concerns me is that many clubs in disadvantaged areas did not get lottery grants and have not been treated with the proper priority.  If one takes the sport of boxing, for example, boxing at club level has been very neglected in many localities.  Boxing clubs could do with significant allocations in terms of facilities and so on.  They have far fewer resources than many of the golf clubs that secured allocations as a result of ministerial interventions over the last while.  The issue of disadvantage and partnership areas used to attract a very significant premium in terms of the allocation of lottery grants.  That seems to have been eroded over time.  I ask the Government to address that and to look after those who did not get grants on the last occasion.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach spoke earlier about cross-party consensus, which he seems to support at this juncture.  I remind the Government that the protection of public ownership of water services was a key recommendation of both the expert commission on domestic water services and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  I believe it is a measure that is supported by a majority of Teachta&iacute; in the D&aacute;il and, more important, the vast majority of citizens.  Could we have an indication of when we might see the Bill?  Could we also have an indication of when the referendum might be brought to the people?</p></speech>

I secured approval from the Cabinet yesterday to put potential wording for an amendment to the Deputy's Bill to the Attorney General's office.  The Attorney General will now consider that to make sure that when we come to table the amendment on Committee Stage the wording is robust and will not have unintended consequences or capture parts of the system that are currently managed by private group water schemes.</p></speech>

The Government said it would improve services, increase supports for people with disabilities, remove barriers to access and provide greater independence in accessing services they choose and place them in a stronger position to tailor supports to meet their needs and plan their lives.  Last week, I asked about the utterly disgraceful decision of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, which is funded by the HSE, to close down the NCBI office that provides supports to the blind and visually impaired in the entire D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, as far down as east Wicklow and up to Ringsend.  I got something that looked like assurances from the HSE, although they were slightly ambiguous, that there would be a review and nothing would happen until the review had taken place then, lo and behold, staff were let go this week.  The staff, as the visually impaired and blind community will say, are the service.  They are distraught that the local office is being closed.  People who are elderly and find it difficult to travel are being told they have to go to Tallaght to access services.  It is utterly disgraceful.

I am pleased the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is here this afternoon as he refused to come into the Chamber recently to discuss a Topical Issue matter.  This is becoming a pattern among Ministers.</p>  <p>  An action committee was set up in support of the post office in Newcastle, An Caisle&aacute;n Nua, in Tipperary.  It worked very hard and submitted what I deemed to be a first class professional appeal to the appeals committee that was set up in An Post by the Minister's predecessor.  I and other public representatives got a letter on Monday saying the appeal was rejected and the post office would close on 1 February.  The action committee that collaborated with the Minister and his staff has not even had the gratification of receiving a reply yet or a yea or nay.  Is this the way the so-called independent review body is dealing with the action groups of decent people set up through public meetings who volunteered to work hard, who are being treated in this shambolic way by the Government and its agents in An Post?</p><p>It is as if they have been given a slap in the face without even the courtesy of a letter or a reply.  I want the Minister to answer, please.</p></speech>

This morning AIB shares were selling at &euro;3.79.  That must make it difficult for the State to consider selling on any further stake, given that the revenue would be far lower than previously and the Government would be undermining the shareholders who have already bought in.</p>  <p>  The bank has lost its chief executive, unfortunately, or the chief operating officer and is in a difficult environment, as the head of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, said when he came to the House.  He said the banking model is changing.</p>  <p>  I am keen to find out the Government's latest plans with regard to AIB.  Will the Government consider converting the bank into a public bank along the Sparkassen model?  It could be involved in revitalising small business lending throughout the island.  That would be in the good proud tradition of that bank and its constituent banks, going back to the days of Munster and Leinster Bank and beyond.  What are the Government plans with AIB given that the share price is so low and the bank does not have a chief executive?</p></speech>

It was over &euro;5 earlier this year and has fallen considerably since then.  There are many reasons for that.</p>  <p>  We have no plans to sell any more shares in AIB currently, but over time or at the right time when the share price is good we intend to divest the Government stake in AIB further and use that money to pay down the debt.  One reason we are able to borrow so cheaply on the markets at the moment is the fact that our budget is balanced and because the markets understand our commitment to use any sales of shares or any windfall from NAMA to reduce debt.  If we were to depart from that policy we would find it could cost us a lot very quickly.  The markets have already priced that into their calculations.</p></speech>

Currently, it is taking 18 to 20 weeks for carers to get approved.  These delays are unacceptable in the round but they become especially contemptible in circumstances where the person to be cared for is dying of cancer.  My office has now witnessed several incidents where a person to be cared for is dead before the carer's grant is decided.  Often these are people who cannot afford care in their dying days by their own means.  Surely when there is medical evidence of terminal cancer an exceptional case can be made and a rapid decision on a carer's grant can be made.</p></speech>

A process has to be followed.  Obviously, someone has to apply.  There is a means test element to the process as well.  An applicant needs a medical report establishing that the person requires full-time care.  It is always going to take a few weeks to process applications but it should not take as long as it is taking now in some circumstances.</p></speech>

The budgets also saw the USC ceiling and PRSI thresholds increased to ensure that the increases the Government was paying to people were received.  That was good insofar as it went.  The increases were modest and welcome but they did not make people wealthy.  Largely, they meant that the people who received those increases were keeping pace with the increased costs they were meeting in their daily lives.  However, other income thresholds across other grants and schemes have not kept pace with changes.  In particular, the student grant scheme has not gone up.  The same applies to thresholds for medical cards, the GP card and the over 70s card.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach review income thresholds across all Departments for grants and schemes to ensure they increase in line with budget day announcements and increases?  If a person gets an increase in social welfare payments that is modest but loses a medical card or fails to get a third-level grant, he or she is at a big loss.  That is the problem we must address.</p></speech>

We can have perverse situations whereby someone gets an increase in pay or in a welfare payment and as a result loses entitlement to a medical card or a grant and then, in net terms, ends up worse off.  Overall, of course, people are better off but we can have individual cases where people end up worse off.</p>  <p>  The income limits are under review.  They do not have to be done on budget day; they can be done during the year.  For example, in March the income limit for the general practitioner visit card will increase by &euro;25 per week per adult.  That is a far greater increase than people would have got from the minimum wage increases or welfare changes.  A similar commitment is made for the medical card for pensioners.  The idea is that pensioners would not lose the medical card because of a &euro;5 per week increase in the pension.  The short answer is "Yes", but it is not necessarily all done on budget day.</p></speech>

In University Hospital Kerry the situation is no different.  Often, when elderly people are well enough to leave hospital they are told that they should access the fair deal scheme and go into a nursing home.  Many elderly people are reluctant to do this because they believe the next step is the graveyard.  They see it as the departure lounge.</p>  <p>  We could do far better for these elderly people if more public health nurses were provided and if more home help was provided to look after these people in their own homes.  Many of them would prefer that.  However, they are only able to get home help for five days.</p><p>That is not good enough because they are sick and need attention seven days a week, including on bank holidays and other holidays.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Ministers of State at his Department to do something about this issue.  It is creating a logjam in hospitals.</p></speech>

High numbers on trolleys, late discharges which have led to the loss of 135,000 bed days already this year, and 6,200 people awaiting home care supports compound the issue.

I have specifically asked the Minister of State to lead a task force in the Department which will work with the HSE to drive down the numbers.  At the request of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, I asked the special delivery unit in the HSE to visit Kerry University Hospital to look at how we can continue to improve and support it.

Increasingly there is consensus that such growth is not sustainable if based on a heavy reliance on cars.  Cork needs more buses, bus rapid transit and probably light rail services.  In January I raised the issue of the Cork metropolitan transport strategy with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who said it would be published in February and subject to public consultation, but there is still no sign of it.  Like so many issues affecting Cork, it appears that the Government is dragging its feet.  When will the strategy be published and when will it be subject to public consultation?</p></speech>

The fundamental point made by him is correct.  The population of Cork is going to grow by 50% between now and 2040.  That cannot happen in conjunction with a reliance on cars, which is why Project Ireland 2040 contains hundreds of millions of euros for BusConnects in Cork and protects the alignment of a potential light railway also.  We also have to invest in roads, which is why projects such as the Dunkettle interchange project, for example, will start next year, tender documents have been issued for the M20 motorway project and we are very keen to progress the road project to Ringaskiddy.</p></speech>

There are many concerned and worried parents who have to take their children with special needs to other units much greater distances from their homes, including, for example, the early intervention centre in Mullagh.  Ballyjamesduff covers a huge area and the unit is badly needed.  We expect the unit to be in place and fully operational in September 2019.

It usually takes four weeks for the results to be sent, but four and a half months have gone by without a response, which is totally unacceptable.  She used the words "fear", "stress" and "worry" in speaking to me about the matter during a long telephone conversation.

On CervicalCheck, he is correct that there have been capacity issues owing to the fact that many women sought reassurance during what was a very fraught and difficult period in the public health service and sought and obtained an additional smear test.  Women who have never used the programme before have also begun to use it, which is one good thing to have emerged from a difficult situation.  The HSE is actively engaged with the laboratories to see if additional capacity can be found to ensure the turnaround times will be much more satisfactory.</p></speech>

While it represents a kicking of the can down the road, it still does not address the key issue for thousands of workers.  One major sector of the 130 being reviewed is Tara Mines in my home town of Navan, where 700 miners are set to lose the allowance.  The allowance was designed to cover specialised creams and treatments.  It is a genuine allowance for workers working in very difficult and stifling underground conditions.  It is hardly archaic, as I have heard some suggest in the last 24 hours.  It has been in place for 40 years and helps to mitigate the harsh impact on the workers.  The Taoiseach has suggested they can become vouched expenses, but it is frustrating that it will mean another layer of bureaucracy to receive a small amount of money.  I spoke directly to Revenue about the matter and the review of the allowances claimed by those working in the mine has been completed.  Notwithstanding the deferral of implementation, is the communication detailing the breakdown of qualifying expenses still going be issued to workers this year, or will it too be deferred as it seems to fall into the bad news category?</p></speech>

It has not yet gone to the Government and no Government decision has been made on it.  I am not happy about how it transpired in the last couple of days because it has caused enormous, unnecessary concern for people who fear they may be losing their flat rate allowance for expenses.  It appears as if it is something for which the Government has looked, which is not the case.  As I said, the review is being carried out by the Revenue Commissioners.  No changes will be implemented before 1 January 2020, if at all.  I will make sure changes are politically proofed before they happen.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, the total number of patients on trollies increased from 2,000 in 2016 to 5,000 last year and that figure will be breached again this year.  The hospital and the need for additional beds have been entirely neglected by the Government.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, announced on local radio a month ago that, after discussing the matter with the Taoiseach, funding would be forthcoming for the reopening of the beds, but until now that announcement has amounted to nothing more than wind.  The hospital has not been given sanction to recruit the additional staff necessary to reopen the beds.  What is the status of the commitment given?  Will the Minister immediately give the go-ahead for the recruitment of staff to enable the beds to be reopened as soon as possible?</p></speech>

Eighteen months ago Letterkenny University Hospital asked for the pressure on it to be relieved when there was an average of 19 patients on trollies every day.  Within yards of where patients are lying on trollies there is a ward with 20 beds.  In this instance, there is no need for capital investment but rather for sanction to employ the front-line nurses and support staff needed to run that ward, which would cost in the region of &euro;1.8 million.  It would relieve pressure on a hospital that is seriously suffering as a result of overcrowding and from a lack of capacity.</p><p>The HSE has put it forward as one of its proposals.  As my colleague said, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, went on our local radio and did not just say the ward would be open.  He went as far as telling the public of Donegal that he had told the manager to start recruiting the staff.  I hope that is the case.  This ward needs to be opened to relieve the winter pressure.  Will the Minister give us any commitment?  Any information I have got from him indicates that it will not be open this winter, and indeed there are questions marks over whether it will be open at the start of next year.</p></speech>

In answer to Deputy McConalogue, I note that we have increased bed capacity, with 240 more beds in the system this year and 79 more due to come on stream between now and the early part of next year.  We have asked the HSE to determine how to deliver the 2,600 beds.  The Letterkenny short stay unit is in that next tranche.  I hope and expect it to be part of the winter plan we are finalising, but I will be happy to correspond with all Donegal Deputies on it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100019#R00500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce Bill entitled an Act to require all childcare providers to provide price notices outlining the prices charged for each of their services in their physical premises and on any online platform which their business maintains for the purposes of advertising their services; and to allow the Minister to establish a National Childcare Price Register.</blockquote><p>Today I bring the Childcare Price Transparency Bill 2018 before the House.  This Bill seeks to bring price transparency to the childcare market, as we have done with other services such as dentistry and property.  Currently there is no statutory obligation or requirement on childcare providers to be open and transparent about the fees they charge for services.  If a parent wishes to ascertain how much each childcare provider in their area charges, they are likely to have to make a direct inquiry with the childcare provider themselves.  This makes it very difficult for parents to determine the level of childcare pricing in their area.  This Bill will require all registered childcare providers to display a full list of prices in their establishment as well as on websites and other pages they operate, and to submit their price data to a central price register similar to the residential property price register.  This will allow parents to shop around online as well as in person.</p><p>This Bill will go some way towards supporting parents who are now paying a second mortgage in childcare fees.  The most recent Pobal survey found that on average, one childcare place costs &euro;176 per week in urban areas.  In the likes of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, however, the average weekly price is approximately &euro;228.  The reason I am bringing this Bill forward is that, when Pobal carried out its recent survey, only 84% of all childcare providers completed the documentation.  It is very unfortunate that there was not 100% uptake.  It is obviously not mandatory and providers do not feel that they have an obligation to engage with the funders, which are Pobal and the State.</p><p>We are now extending the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme to more than 4,500 childcare providers nationwide.  Some 75,000 children take up spaces every single year.  It is incumbent on us to support the parents in letting them know exactly how clear and transparent it is.  This Bill will allow all parents to shop around.  It will also be of assistance to agencies.  When the Government makes plans for childcare and peaks and troughs are observed in the market prices, we will be able to get behind it and understand exactly why.  That is why I am bringing this Bill forward, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to introduce it.</p></speech>

The regular meeting of the Council on the morning of 18 October focused on migration, internal security and external relations issues.</p><p>On migration, we discussed the implementation of decisions agreed at the June European Council and at the informal summit in Salzburg in September.  We exchanged views on the external aspects of migration, including the importance of combatting people-smuggling networks and strengthening our co-operation with partner countries.  Chancellor Kurz of Austria, which currently holds the EU Presidency, also provided an update on efforts to reform the common EU asylum system and the prospects for progress in this context.</p><p>On internal security, our discussions focused on recent cyberattacks, cybersecurity and the need to protect the Union's democratic systems to combat disinformation ahead of the 2019 European elections.  On external relations, we discussed our broader relationship with Africa. We welcomed the decision to convene an EU-African Union high-level forum in December, and the first EU-Arab League summit in Egypt in February 2019.</p><p>We also discussed climate change, agreeing on the importance of reaching the goals and implementing the rules outlined in the and on the need for ambition in advance of the COP24 in Poland in December.  This was followed by a euro summit, where we exchanged views on financial issues ahead of the December European Council.</p><p>I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May on 17 October and with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani on 18 October.  I did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel, but we did speak on a number of occasions during the two days.  I also engaged informally with my other EU counterparts in the margins of the European Council.</p><p>In advance of a meeting of the 27 member states in Article 50 format on the evening of 17 October, Prime Minister May outlined her views to EU leaders and gave the UK perspective on the Brexit negotiations.  The 27 EU leaders reaffirmed our full confidence in Mr. Michel Barnier as our chief negotiator and urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement, in accordance with the guidelines previously agreed by the European Council.  President Tusk expressed his readiness to convene a special summit in November if and when Mr. Barnier reported that decisive progress has been achieved.</p><p>At the Article 50 meeting and in my bilateral with Prime Minister May, I stressed the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process.  I said that I hoped the future relationship between the EU and the UK would be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible.  I also stressed that it was essential to ensure that a legally robust backstop, which must apply in all circumstances, was set out clearly in the withdrawal agreement.  In my bilateral meeting with President Tajani and in my engagement with other EU counterparts I expressed appreciation for their ongoing strong solidarity on this issue.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that since the October European Council, agreement has been reached at negotiator level on the draft withdrawal agreement and an outline of the joint political declaration on the future relationship that fully delivers our negotiating objectives.</p></reply>

We will have an opportunity later to deal with the greatest focus for Ireland in European matters, which is the ongoing Brexit situation.  I want to talk about discussions at the European Council concerning migration and internal security.  In regard to migration, the Taoiseach will be aware that the last remaining rescue vessel operating in the Mediterranean, the Aquarius, is now stuck in Marseilles because of an arrest warrant for alleged pollution issued by the Italian authorities.  As far as I am aware, there are now no NGO-operated rescue vessels.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res reports that hundreds of migrants are drowning as a result of this.  Is there a rescue process in place?  Does the Taoiseach have a view on the policy, to which we have committed naval vessels for several years to ensure the safety of people who are so desperate that they take to the sea in completely unsuitable craft, putting themselves and their children at mortal risk?  It is often at the behest of people smugglers.  There is no escaping that reality.</p><p>Do we have an attitude to it and what are we going to do about it?</p> <p> On general migration, obviously, I welcome the holding of the Africa summit, but what is our policy?  What is the European Union's policy on migration?  There are strong views being expressed by the new Italian Government and some eastern European countries, but is there an integrated migration and asylum policy emerging?  Can we have a real debate about it and what is Ireland's participation in it?</p> <p> I have two brief questions about the security issue.  First, will the Taoiseach specify exactly what measures we will take to protect our democracy in the context of European elections?  What was decided on the issue?  Second, what was the Taoiseach's response to the comments of the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, on the creation of a European army?</p></speech>

However, I would like to ask the Taoiseach to comment on the reports that the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, is discussing in Brussels a new backstop text which she hopes will appease some of her Brexiteer backbenchers and Ministers.  Specifically, can the Taoiseach reassure us that nothing has been discussed which would impact on the substance of the draft withdrawal agreement, on which we will be voting later this afternoon?</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach is aware, the French President, Mr. Macron, and the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, have reached agreement in principle on the creation of a eurozone-specific budget which would give the eurozone greater ability to respond to a downturn.  This is a reasonable proposal which Ireland should strongly support.  The lack of such a funding mechanism was at the root of much of the financial crisis and a real issue in terms of the capacity of the eurozone to respond to the global recession and financial crisis that began in 2008 and which had a significant impact on Ireland.  It has also been reported that the Taoiseach is joining with other countries in opposing the proposal from Dr. Merkel and Mr. Macron.  Will the Taoiseach outline whether it is true that Ireland is opposing this essential reform and, if that is the case, why Ireland is taking up a position as one of the most conservative countries on the EU budget when we should be one of its biggest supporters?</p></speech>

The media carry extensive suggestions today that the maximum facilitation, "Max Fac", model is back on the table in terms of not being able to end the backstop early and that it is an olive branch the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, is proposing to offer to Eurosceptics in the UK parliament.  I merely want to ask the Taoiseach whether that particular element of the long discussions that have taken place in the last period has been discussed at the Council in the context of potential discussions to ward off a very hard Brexit.</p>  <p>  I understand that at the Council meeting PESCO was discussed in the context of quite ambitious proposals for significant increases in military spending, not necessarily in the context of a European army as put forward by the Taoiseach's colleague, the French President, Mr. Macron, but more in the sense that all European armies would invest heavily in modern advanced weapons systems.  I would like to know whether, in fact, the Taoiseach has signed Ireland up to a broadening and deepening of PESCO, in particular, given the potential budget to be spent on armaments by European countries.</p></speech>

Frankly, they confirm some of the worst fears of Solidarity-People Before Profit about assurances the Taoiseach, Mr. Michel Barnier and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, have given on the issue of the Border.  The Taoiseach was reported as having said:</p><blockquote>I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border.  As Ireland [is] remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be required to implement European law...</blockquote><p>If there is no deal, it sounds to me as if the Taoiseach is saying the European Union will require us to impose a hard border to protect the Single Market and that he is willing to do so.  If that is not the case, I would like clarification on the matter.  If it is the case, it is a very significant development.  I have always feared that it is the case and sought multiple assurances that in the event that there is no deal, we will simply tell the European Union and Britain that we will not be co-operating in any way in the installation of a hard border.  I would go further.  If the Taoiseach believes this is a real possibility, he should be arguing that if that is the threat, there should be a Border poll, North and South, to give people the opportunity to make a decision democratically on whether that is what they want.  I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's response to that question.  It will have a considerable bearing on the outcome of the vote that will be taken on the motion we will discuss tonight.</p></speech>

Companies in the United Kingdom such as Facebook have agreed to introduce their own accounting mechanisms to show where political advertising is taking place in order that it can be clearly identified, with the amount of money spent being made clear.  If we cannot have the legislation on which Deputy Lawless and others have been working to ensure such transparency, will the Taoiseach push the social media companies here to introduce the same mechanisms in order that there will not be undue influence exerted in local and European Parliament elections or the next general election by such spending on such platforms?</p></speech>

First, he must clarify whether the maximum facilitation proposal that was rejected by the European Union for sound reasons is being advanced again?  Second, will he clarify for us whether any other similar proposition is being advanced that would hollow out or offer something less than that being afforded in the current backstop?  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that it is not good enough for the Taoiseach to be an observer from afar and speculating on the prospect of a hard border.  There cannot be a hard border on the island.  That must remain our position.  In the event that there is, where stands the Taoiseach's thinking on a referendum on Irish unity to remove it?</p>  <p>  I echo the alarm about the talk of a European army - it is not new - being advanced in a proactive, almost aggressive, way by the French President, Mr. Macron, and others.  The State is still, at least nominally, militarily neutral.  Has the Taoiseach signed up?  Has he an understanding with Mr. Macron, the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, or anybody else on his position on the prospect of a European army?</p></speech>

Of course, we have done this.  Naval Service vessels have been involved in search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean, as have many other navies.</p><p>We must also bear in mind that in doing so, we must not do anything that helps human trafficking.  Part of the mission's mandate in the Mediterranean is to disrupt human trafficking.  Human traffickers are putting very vulnerable people in what are essentially large dinghies - unseaworthy vessels - that they know full well will sink long before they get to the coast of Europe.  We need to make sure that nothing we do in terms of search and rescue encourages or assists human traffickers in putting people at risk by putting them in vessels in that way, which is exactly what has been happening.  Very vulnerable people who have trekked across Africa to get to the coast of Libya are being put in unseaworthy vessels by human traffickers with the expectation that they will be rescued by European navies or NGO vessels.  We must always bear that mind in what we do because those people's lives are being put at risk and we should not facilitate that in any way.  </p> <p> In respect of the EU policy on migration, it is fair to say that there is a lot of division around the table.  Countries have different perspectives on how we should manage migration.  Everyone around the table with the exception of the UK, which is leaving the EU, is very much in favour of freedom of movement.  Nobody is questioning freedom of movement within the EU.  Austria, Hungary, Poland and Italy all support freedom of movement within the EU.  What many of them object to is migration from outside the EU or illegal migration involving people arriving and not going through the correct ports, not filing documents on arrival or doing the things we expect people to do.</p> <p> There is agreement on three things.  First, we need greater co-operation with the transit countries and countries of origin.  These are countries on the north African coast and Turkey, which are largely countries of transit, and countries in the Middle East and Africa that are source countries for much of this migration.  People are leaving these countries because they do not have democracy, civil and human rights and economic opportunity.  The best way to deal with uncontrolled migration such as this is to bring about democracy, security and economic opportunity in those countries.  We do not see huge numbers of people from Asian countries coming to Europe in the same way, largely because so many people have been lifted out of poverty in those countries through economic development.  That is the first principle we apply.  Ireland is very much committed to that through increases in funding for international development, in particular an increase of more than &euro;100 million in 2019.</p> <p> The second area on which there is agreement is the need to enhance external border security, for example, the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, and security in the Mediterranean through agreements with Morocco and Libya, for example, to assist them to build up their coastguard, and an agreement with Egypt.</p> <p> The third area on which most, although not all, agree is showing a degree of solidarity and burden sharing by being willing to accept migrants from other countries.  Ireland has done this on a series of occasions when it was asked to take some migrants by Malta, Italy and Greece.  This is an example of us showing solidarity with countries on the front line.  </p> <p> I have had no discussions with President Macron or Chancellor Merkel regarding a European army.  Obviously, I have heard what they have to say about it but they have not approached us to join a European army and I do not anticipate that they will do so.  Ireland will not participate in a European army or join NATO.  However, we decided through a resolution of this House to participate in PESCO, which is structured European co-operation around defence and security.  We are doing this on a case-by-case basis, which is very much to our advantage.  Ireland is a small country with a small military.  We do not have much to offer the EU in terms of military prowess or might but there are lots of things we can offer.  These include humanitarian assistance and training, which the Naval Service is doing with Operation Sophia, participation in peacekeeping operations, which we have done very well for decades, and assisting in European security in areas like cyberterrorism and terrorism intelligence.  This is where we can make a contribution.  I do not envisage us joining a European army or being asked to join one.  Our position as a neutral, non-aligned state is well understood by our European partners and the same goes for Austria and Finland, which are very much in the same position as us.</p> <p> I hear a statement being thrown around all the time that somehow we have committed to increasing our defence budget to 2% of GDP.  We have not done so and will not do so.  However, our defence budget will increase over the next couple of years because of pay rises for Defence Forces personnel, improvements to barracks and the purchase of new equipment, namely, the ships, aircraft and vehicles we need.  There will, therefore, be an increase in defence spending and I stand over such increases next year and in the years to come.  However, they will not be anywhere close to 2% of our GDP, which would be around &euro;6 billion.  They will not be anywhere near a fraction of that.</p> <p> Regarding the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and the backstop, we have had no discussions with the Commission or the UK Government about revisions to the text since it was stabilised last week.  It is important to remember the format that is in the December joint report, that is, options A, B and C.  Option A is the future relationship, option B concerns specific solutions the UK may propose and option C is the backstop.  What has come into the mix since then is option D, which is an extension of the transition period.  Whatever happens, what is required at the end of all of that is a backstop that is legally operative and applies unless and until an alternative solution supersedes it.  I want to state again on the record of the House that it is our intention and commitment as a Government to work with the United Kingdom and the European Union to come up with a future relationship that does not require the backstop to be invoked in full or in part and, in the event that it is invoked, it will only be for a temporary period as a bridge to a future relationship.</p> <p> We are not opposed outright to the proposal for a eurozone budget, nor are we backing it.  It is something to which we will give consideration but we will need to see how the proposal develops.  A eurozone budget could be useful.  In a time of economic crisis, it could operate as an economic and fiscal stabiliser.  For example, if a proportion of unemployment benefits were paid for on a European level, countries with high levels of unemployment would benefit from that during periods of recession and they would help out other countries when they do not have high levels of unemployment.  One thing we need to be very careful about is anything that may impact on our sovereignty, particularly our tax sovereignty.  If there is a European budget with money in it to be spent, that money must be raised.  We would be concerned that any proposal for a eurozone budget may suggest imposing Europe-wide taxes, which we could not accept.  We are entering into discussions on a eurozone budget with an understandable degree of scepticism.  We need to see the detail of what is being proposed, or not even that.  We need to get a better understanding of it before we can agree to it.</p></speech>

I met the leader of the DUP, Mrs. Arlene Foster, on 15 October when we discussed many issues, including the current political situation in Northern Ireland and Brexit.  I emphasised the Government's full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  We discussed what could be done to get the institutions in Northern Ireland up and running again.  I reiterated to Mrs. Foster that the Government wants to put a political process in place that can secure an agreement on the operation of the devolved institutions and that we will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek urgent progress with that in the period immediately ahead.  We agreed that we can continue to build on existing practical North-South co-operation.  We also discussed Brexit, including negotiations on the backstop to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I met Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party on 15 November to brief them on the draft EU-UK withdrawal agreement.  We had a good discussion on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and considered how the backstop arrangements guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland in any circumstances.  We also noted that these arrangements offer the opportunity for Northern Ireland businesses to have unfettered access to both British and EU markets.  We agreed to meet again in a similar format.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100021#T01000"><p>The Taoiseach stated that it was agreed that under no circumstances would there be a hard border.  If that is his view, he did not say how he could have been reported as saying that in a no-deal scenario, it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border.</p><p>As Ireland is remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be required to implement European law.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that statement?  He continually says that we are doing everything not to impose a hard border, but in his statement he appeared to imply that there are circumstances - a no Brexit deal - in which he would have to impose a hard border because the EU would require him to do so.  This deserves clarification.</p> <p> News has just broken in Belfast that Bombardier is to cut its workforce by 500, which is a pretty devastating blow for the area.  We might have been able to assist by buying from Bombardier desperately needed buses for the Dublin Bus fleet, which is way below what it should be.  That aside, did the Taoiseach suggest to Mrs. Arlene Foster that she would be better off worrying about the potential economic damage to people in the North if such a border were to be erected and that she is playing a dangerous game in the politics she is engaging in around this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100022#U00200"><p>On the previous occasion we discussed the breakdown of relations between the Government and the DUP, the Taoiseach said that the relations were fine.  Does he still believe that relations between the Government and the DUP are fine and what efforts has he made in recent months to persuade the DUP that its rejection of the withdrawal agreement is fundamentally wrong?  I have always argued that Northern Ireland should get the best of both worlds, and immediately after the referendum on Brexit in a speech made in the North I argued for an economic zone for the North through which it would have unfettered access to the British market and would still have access to the Single Market and remain within the customs union.  This would be ideal for Northern Ireland and it would give it a badly needed fillip.  Essentially, the agreement that has been reached gives Northern Ireland the best of both worlds.</p>  <p>  The DUP has overreacted to the deal in seeing a constitutional threat where none exists because the Good Friday Agreement stands notwithstanding the withdrawal agreement and this provides the basis for the evolution of the three relationships, as encompassed by the Good Friday Agreement, which is the essential core genius of it in many respects.  The DUP in so doing is standing against the majority opinion in Northern Ireland, not just politically, but in respect of business and working people, in terms of what is best for the North.  It is at times like this that a lack of trust and strong relations has an impact.  Will the Taoiseach set out his plans to do something new to rebuild relations?</p>  <p>  On the fundamental issue of the suspension of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, we have been hearing for months about a new political initiative, but there has been no obvious movement on it.  What I am hearing outside of formal channels is that no effort will be made in this regard until the Brexit issue has been resolved.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if this is true, if he expects to announce an initiative in this regard, and when he last discussed this matter with the British Prime Minister, Mrs May?  Will he also set out how regulatory alignment in Northern Ireland will be possible in the absence of devolved government and a devolved Assembly?</p></speech>

There are no nationalist members in the Houses of the Parliament so we have only one set of voices there representing Northern Ireland, which at this historic time is a weakness in terms of Irish representation in Westminster.  Did the Taoiseach get a sense from Mrs. Foster, on behalf of her party, that in the event of a fresh offer on maximum facilitation the DUP would be inclined to explore it because that might offer some possibilities?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that the border is the border in the event of a hard crash-out and that is the way it is in terms of it being the border of the European Union.  In that context, the Taoiseach has on previous occasions referenced the recruitment of customs officers to facilitate the changes coming down the line for our ports and airports.  Will he advise what progress has been made in regard to the recruitment of additional customs officers and what progress, if any, has been made in identifying technological mechanisms for checking fleet movements and so on?</p>  <p>  I assume that the Taoiseach welcomes the statements and new position of the Ulster Farmers Union and business interests in the North that they welcome the Barnier agreement.</p></speech>

Prior to the summer recess he indicated that there would be an initiative in the autumn.  We are now decisively moving into the winter and there is no word of any sustainable initiative.</p>  <p>  Nobody should be surprised at the DUP's rejection of the Barnier deal.  I urge Members to remember that last February the DUP similarly rejected a viable accommodation to restore power-sharing institutions in the North.  This is the backdrop to all of this and the political acoustic of the moment.  Dinner arrangements aside, what solid proposal does the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste have in terms of a roadmap back to sustainable power-sharing?</p>  <p>  At the urging of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and others, the Taoiseach convened the intergovernmental conference but it has not been utilised as a springboard to resolve the outstanding issues and get us back on track.  What is the Taoiseach's plan and when will he announce it?</p></speech>

In regard to the dialogue that is taking place with the DUP and the Taoiseach's meeting with Mrs. Foster, it is crystal clear to all of us who are desperately struggling to make the best of the Brexit negotiations that it is a real liability for the process that there are not functioning institutions in Northern Ireland.  They were never more urgently needed.  The lack of these institutions for the past year has been a desperate gap in terms of the capacity of the voice of Ireland to be heard.  Notwithstanding the successful work done by the Government and our diplomatic staff in that regard, the absence of a coherent voice from Northern Ireland throughout this process has been extremely debilitating in terms of a coherent voice from the island of Ireland as a whole.</p><p> As was referred to, I am conscious of the positive voices now coming from the Ulster Farmers Union and business in Northern Ireland that have surprised some.  Now that we are at the end of the process, people are speaking out about their own self-interest and the interests of their people.  I would be interested to hear how we might assist in this process.  This could best be done by direct dialogue.  Any notion that the deal is in Ireland's interest or that we are in any way triumphant about it would be very unhelpful.</p> <p> Taoiseach's questions are often not directly answered, but Deputy Boyd Barrett has asked a question that deserves a direct answer in this sense.  While we hope this will not happen, if the United Kingdom departs with no deal, what people have described as a hard Brexit, the Single Market must be protected.  If it is not defined on the island of Ireland, it will be defined in the Irish Sea.  We must be realistic about addressing this issue, and I would welcome a frank answer from the Taoiseach to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question.</p></speech>

I do not want to speculate too much on a no-deal scenario because the truth is that no one really knows for sure what would happen if there were one.  If there were one, no one knows how long that no deal would last.  It is my view that if we did end up with a no-deal situation, we would find ourselves having to negotiate a no-deal deal, as it were, quite soon thereafter.  A no-deal situation might continue for a few weeks.  It might not last more than a few weeks.</p></speech>

This is why we must think about these things.  No one knows for sure, however, what would happen in a scenario in which the UK were to crash out of the European Union without a deal.  We do know the UK would have certain obligations under the rules of World Trade Organization, WTO, for example, but we do not even know if it will be able to join the WTO.  Deputies will know the UK has had difficulties joining aspects of the WTO because of the objections of Moldova, so this is very much uncharted territory.</p>  <p>  We should not see protection of the Single Market through the prism of the demand of a kind of unreasonable EU overlord.  It is our Single Market, and the whole basis behind it is that we are aligned in respect of regulations on health and safety, labour rights, workers' rights, state aid and competition.  This is not a bad thing.  The Single Market is a good thing for Ireland because it ensures not only that we have free trade all across the European Union but also that there is a level playing field and certain standards.  We should want to protect the Single Market, therefore, but this cannot involve the installation of a hard border or physical infrastructure on the Irish Border.</p>  <p>  I think that in a no-deal scenario we would find ourselves having to come up with a deal.  We would have to come to some kind of agreement on regulations and customs to avoid a hard border in order that the UK would honour its obligations as a member of the WTO and that we would continue to honour our obligations as an EU member.  The point I was making is that if we had no deal, we would find ourselves having to find a deal very quickly.  Why then put our countries and people through this when we now have a deal on the table, a deal that was negotiated by 28 member states, has been agreed by the UK Cabinet and, I hope, this D&aacute;il will endorse today?  Why go through this scenario when we now have a proposal on the table that works?</p>  <p>  Obviously, the best outcome would be for the UK not to leave the European Union at all, but the UK has ruled that out.  An alternative solution would be for the UK to stay in the Single Market and the customs union, staying in the European Economic Area, EEA, but it has ruled that out.  Another solution would be a Canada plus model for Britain with a Northern Ireland-specific backstop, but it has ruled that out too.  We are not the ones who have been ruling out solutions all along.  We are the ones who have been working very hard to find a solution.  We have that solution now, it is on the table, I hope the D&aacute;il will endorse it today, and I hope and expect the European Council will endorse it on Sunday.  Let us see what happens in Westminster afterwards.  I think I used the term "very difficult" last week.  We in politics do things that are very difficult all the time.  It was very difficult to repeal the eighth amendment but it was done.  I was a little surprised to see "very difficult" interpreted as "inevitable" because very difficult things are never inevitable.</p>  <p>  Regarding my meeting with Mrs. Arlene Foster, as Deputies know, she is someone I know very well.  She was my counterpart when the institutions were up and running, and we understand each other very well.  Much of the discussion we had when we last met concerned practical co-operation between North and South on transport projects, healthcare and tourism.  Mrs. Foster has a particular interest in children's health and the use of our hospitals here to provide cardiac surgery to children from the North.  I have a particular interest in what we are doing in Altnagelvin about radiotherapy and primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, for people living in Donegal.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin talks about the role we are playing in trying to persuade the DUP to sign up to this agreement, but this misunderstands matters.  When one engages a lot with DUP representatives, one must understand that they are very much a hardline unionist party, and they would not be annoyed at being described as such.  This means they are not well disposed to taking advice from Irish Governments or being persuaded by Irish Governments or Irish political parties, so any dialogue in which one engages must be respectful and sensitive.  I know that when Deputy Martin met Mrs. Foster, he tried to persuade her that Northern Ireland should have the best of both worlds, but this totally misunderstands her view.  It is not the best of both worlds the DUP wants.  The DUP holds very firm to the view that the most important thing is the integrity of the United Kingdom, the precious union.  If this means a lesser world, that is acceptable provided that the integrity of the union is upheld.</p>  <p>  What we have tried to do, therefore, as best we can is to say to people in Northern Ireland, particularly those in the unionist community, that what we are proposing and what the EU and the UK Government are now proposing should not be seen in constitutional terms as a threat to the United Kingdom or any effort to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  Written into the Irish protocol, the backstop, are two provisions, one respecting the principle of consent, that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland cannot be changed unless the majority of people in Northern Ireland want it to change, the other respecting the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, respecting the territorial integrity of the UK.</p>  <p>  This is why calls for Border polls, whether from Sinn F&eacute;in or People Before Profit, are really unhelpful at present.  What we are trying to say to unionists in Northern Ireland is that at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement is acceptance of the principle of consent, acceptance not only that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but also that Northern Ireland is different and needs special arrangements on occasion.  Special arrangements in respect of customs and regulations for industrial goods should not be seen as a constitutional threat.  When people start to talk about Border polls, however, it really undermines the work we are trying to do to convince people that that is not what this is about.</p></speech>

I refer to NGOs as well.  What is really missing, though, and Deputy Howlin is absolutely right about this, is a Northern Ireland Executive, a First Minister and a deputy First Minister.  When a person is in the role of First Minister or deputy First Minister, he or she is much more than a party leader.  That person is required to take into account all the people in Northern Ireland.  It is a real shame that the Executive and the Assembly have not been there at this very significant time.  We had very close contact with the UK Government about what we can do to get the institutions up and running again.  The institutions that involve the Governments are up and running.</p><p>The British-Irish Council is working well.  I was at a meeting of the council only last week on the Isle of Man.  There have been two meetings of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The institutions that are not working are those that relate to Northern Ireland, unfortunately.  </p></speech>

It is no reflection on the staff working in the medical card section.  I compliment the staff, in particular, those dealing with the receipt, registration and processing of medical card applications.  My office is in touch with them daily and find them to be very courteous and helpful.  My office and I also appreciate the work being done by staff dealing with urgent and emergency medical card applications.  My office also deals with them on a regular basis and find them to be professional, helpful and courteous.</p>  <p>  I am making a plea for additional staff for the processing of medical card applications as there is a serious delay in the registration and logging of new applications and further information.  I will give some examples, of which there are many.  I refer to the standard application received from a single person, whose only income is jobseeker's allowance and who forwarded an application on 31 October.  Notification of receipt was received by email on 31 October.  On 14 November the application had not even been logged on the system.  </p>  <p>  Another example involves a request for further information.  The information was sent on 10 October.  Again, receipt was acknowledged very quickly on 11 October, but on Friday, 9 November its registration and logging had still not been completed.  </p>  <p>  I have another example of a request for further information.  It dates from 12 November.  Receipt of the additional information was also acknowledged quickly on 15 November, but as of today, 21 November, it has not been logged on the system for the processing team which was only dealing with information dating from 9 November.  </p>  <p>  In the logging and registration of applications there is a serious delay of two to three weeks and more in some cases.  The delays are significant and causing distress and concern for applicants.  I will give an example of what can happen.  There was a case recently where further information was sent by an applicant.  Its receipt was acknowledged by email, but a few days later the applicant receiving a letter requesting that the further information be sent or the medical card would be withdrawn.  The applicant came back into my office.  It was again confirmed that the information had been received, but it had not been logged on the system.  It led to the medical card being withdrawn.  </p>  <p>  There is a serious issue in the registration of applications and additional information.  It is taking two to three weeks and sometimes longer for registration to happen.  It is causing major delays and the only reason is the lack of staff to deal with the work involved.  Will the Minister of State talk to the Health Service Executive to ensure additional staff will be put in place to make sure applications are dealt with efficiently and speedily?  The lack of a medical card can give rise to major difficulties and great distress for applicants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100025#CC00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Government is conscious of the importance of the medical card system in ensuring people whose needs do not enable them to access general practitioners, GPs, and other health services will be provided with such supports in line with legislative provisions.  As the Deputy will be aware, the medical card system is based primarily on the assessment of an individual's financial means.  Therefore, the vast majority of applicants for a medical card are required to undergo the assessment process.  The Deputy has raised concerns about the delays in dealing with medical card applications.  I have been assured by the HSE&rsquo;s national medical card unit that there are no delays in the processing of medical card applications for any category of applicant, either new or those subject to a review.</p><p>It should be noted that in the period from January 2018 to date the HSE's national medical card unit has consistently met its key performance target to have 95% of complete medical card applications assessed for eligibility within 15 days.  It is currently processing all fully completed applications within 15 working days across all application form types.  There will, however, be situations where the application process may take longer than the 15-day target time.  In some cases, as part of the assessment process, applicants will be required to provide additional documentation to enable the national medical card unit to access whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family.  Every effort is made to ensure ongoing engagement between the HSE and applicants during this process.</p><p>Additional time may also be required to process applications in situations where an applicant's income exceeds the medical card threshold and he or she is then assessed by the national medical card unit for a discretionary medical card.  In this situation, in order to take full account of the difficult circumstances which may apply, additional information such as evidence of the extra costs arising from an illness, will be requested from the applicant.  The national medical card unit affords these applicants every opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  </p><p>In summary, the HSE has indicated that there are currently no delays in processing fully completed applications for a medical card.  However, where an applicant is requested to provide further or additional information, the process may take longer.  The delay is necessary to allow the HSE's national medical card unit to make a comprehensive assessment of the application.</p><p>I also point out that where notice of a review of a medical card has been initiated, it is provided three months in advance of the date of expiry.  This is to afford individuals an extensive time period to provide any required documentation.  It is also important to note that during the review process persons will continue to hold eligibility.  In addition, the HSE strives to have an application process for medical cards which is as streamlined and straightforward as possible for all applicants.  Assistance is offered to persons completing application forms through the national medical card unit and local health offices.  The HSE has also put in place a number of new measures oriented towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical card application process.  On 15 January it launched its new medical card online service at <i>www.medicalcard.ie</i>.  The new system enables people to make online applications for a medical card and is faster and more convenient than the current paper based system.</p></speech>

There is a general problem with the registration and logging of applications, particularly with respect to further information.  I see this on a daily basis and I know other Members are similarly aware of it.  The HSE is assuring the Minister that there is no delay in the processing of these applications but I am not sure what that means.  I ask the Minister of State to check this with the HSE as there is a general problem with logging on and registering further information with medical card applications.  As of today, my office has been told the officials are dealing with information received on 9 November, which is a fortnight ago.  That two-week delay is the current position.  I ask the Minister of State to check this with the HSE.</p>  <p>  Additional staff may be necessary to deal with applications and there is a need to upgrade information technology systems.  There is a main IT system and an Oireachtas system and it appears these systems are not compatible and are not talking to one another.  We also need to have a process similar to that provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, whereby Members can deal directly with dedicated staff dealing with these applications.  There is definitely a difficulty with the area and I again ask the Minister of State to check this with the HSE as it is giving rise to serious difficulties for ordinary people trying to access medical cards.  I compliment the staff at all levels in the medical card area as we find them courteous, helpful and professional.  However, as there is still a problem in the system, I ask the Minister of State to look at it.</p></speech>

As well as being a Minister of State, I am a constituency Deputy like Deputy Healy, and I often have occasion to deal with the staff in the medical card section who I find unfailingly courteous, obliging, helpful and responsive.  I also note what the Deputy told me.  According to the HSE, 95% of all completed applications are processed within 15 days.  The Deputy is talking about incomplete applications.  As a constituency Deputy, I appreciate that he is saying the application forms are difficult and often incomplete when submitted.  Information is sometimes missing and has to be requested, as the Deputy highlighted.</p>  <p>  I will check with the HSE the issue the Deputy brought to my attention.  I absolutely respect his bona fides and I know he has no desire to make anything up or highlight the matter for the sake of it.  The Deputy is a politician with a democratic mandate and if he or people in his office say they are experiencing delays, I have no doubt they are being experienced.  I will check the matter with the HSE.  The Deputy's comments were the first I heard about a two-week delay or staff advising that they are only dealing with information submitted on 9 November.  That is news to me.  As the Deputy will appreciate, when scripts are being prepared, we do not know what details Deputies will raise.  He is around the House long enough to understand that.  I will examine the issue with the HSE and convey the Deputy's concerns to the medical card processing unit.  I thank him again for raising the matter as it is what we are all here for.</p></speech>

When I raised the matter previously with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business he said he would refer it to the Minister for Health.  I have since sent correspondence to the Minister but I have not had a response from either the Taoiseach or the Minister.  It is very disappointing that the Minister is not here today.  This is my third attempt to raise the matter and it is no wonder our public health service is the way it is when the Minister is not here to respond to a very serious issue.</p>  <p>  A few weeks ago the HSE took a decision to remove the X-ray room from plans for an extension to the accident and emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  These plans have been in place for ten years and were costed and included in the tender.  The staff had been patiently waiting for almost a decade.  The medical personnel, including clinicians, nurses and radiographers - all those who work on the front line - have been crying out for years for a second X-ray room.  This was accepted and that is why it was included in the plans.  There is only one X-ray room in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and it is operating at or beyond full capacity.  The equipment is ten years old and obsolete.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is aware that X-ray is a major diagnostic tool in emergency departments in all hospitals.  The only people who will suffer here are patients.  Given that the objective of building an extension to an existing accident and emergency department is to cater for higher turnover, how will the department cope without a second X-ray room?  I said to the Taoiseach that this is like building a house without a roof.  It is sheer madness.  I presume the Minister had no act or part in this decision, or at least I hope that is the case.  I will take it he did not know about this and it is just another example of HSE senior management lunacy.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister intend standing over this unbelievably myopic mindset and the sheer incompetence at HSE senior management level?  Is he happy to ignore professional staff on the front line when they have cried out for years for another X-ray room?  The facility was included in the plans.  Something that has been planned for almost a decade should not be pulled at the 11th hour, as was done three weeks ago.</p>  <p>  I will refer to some of the radiology facilities across the State.  University Hospital Limerick has two X-ray rooms, as has Cork University Hospital.  There are also two at Beaumont Hospital and three at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The hospital in Galway has two X-ray rooms, while Tallaght Hospital has two X-ray rooms and a paediatric X-ray facility.  The Mater Hospital has two X-ray rooms and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, the second biggest trauma centre in the State according to the chief executive officer of the Ireland East Hospital Group, has one.  There is no justification for the removal of this room from the planned extension.  I want this decision reversed.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services.  This includes a major capital development being completed in phases at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The second phase of this project has already seen 29 ward beds opening in December 2017.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform governs the processes surrounding the development of healthcare projects by way of guidelines, principally the public spending code.  Further rigour is demanded by and set out in relevant EU directives.  All proposed projects must be submitted to the HSE's capital and property steering committee for approval and prioritisation prior to inclusion in its multi-annual capital plans.</p>  <p>  The national development plan announced earlier this year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and social care.  Health capital projects and programmes that are under way will continue.  With regard to the provision of a second X-ray room as part of this project, my Department has been informed by HSE estates that this development had been discussed with service user groups.  However, the second X-ray could not be delivered within the capital allocation for this project and, as such, has not been included in the project brief.  An additional computed tomography, CT, scanner is expected to be brought online in early 2019, which will see the hospital equipped with two CT scanners, one MRI scanner, two ultrasound rooms and one plain film room.</p><p> I have been advised by the HSE that the new emergency department, which will be located on the ground floor of the hospital, will be completed and available for opening in early 2019.  The HSE has further advised that there is some work still to be completed in the old emergency department to allow for the installation of a new paediatric emergency department and an extension to radiology services.  The HSE anticipates that the full extension will be ready in early 2019.</p> <p> Further important capital developments are expected to be completed at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in the near future.  These include 29 ward beds, planned to open in January 2019.  Further, 24 additional ward beds and a theatre suite, comprising three fully equipped theatre rooms, are due for completion in the second quarter of 2019.</p> <p> The Department, the HSE, the RCSI hospital group and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are supportive of this project, and the need for this capital development is recognised in supporting the delivery of key services to patients served by the hospital in Drogheda and the surrounding areas.  As the Deputy will be aware, the new emergency department is a part of the major capital infrastructure project that is taking place at the hospital, which includes additional beds, theatres and the expanded emergency department.</p></speech>

What it tells us is that the Minister is happy for plans, which have been in place for ten years, for an extension to the emergency department to proceed under his watch without an X-ray room.  It is like building a house without a roof.  How can the Minister stand over this?  The Minister of State's reply was typical HSE spiel.  He mentioned the 29 beds.  They are welcome, but we already knew about them.</p>  <p>  When an emergency department is extended, of course there will be more patients coming to it.  Some 80% of patients who attend an emergency department need some sort of X-ray or scan.  I have said until I have turned blue in the face that the current X-ray room is working beyond capacity and its equipment is obsolete.  The programme for Government calls for capital funding to be invested in our health services, but this is rubbish.  The Government is extending an emergency department without installing a badly needed X-ray room that was included and costed in the tender.  Why was the money pulled at the last minute and where does patient care come into this?  I will not let this go.  It is pure and utter madness.  I will raise this matter with the Minister again at the next opportunity.  It is ludicrous, as it does not put patients first.  Everything that is written in the programme for Government is baloney if this is the real action being taken and the Government is prepared to stand over such ludicrousness.  It is unbelievable.</p></speech>

It might not provide for everything she wants.  That is fine, and it is her entitlement as a public representative for the area to highlight that not everything she wants is being provided for, but she can at least have the good grace and decency to acknowledge the very significant contribution that is being made to the hospital.</p>  <p>  We are working within a finite budget and there are limited resources.  As much as we would like one, we do not have an endless pot of money from which to give everyone everything he or she needs.</p></speech>

She is calling for a full review of diagnostics at the hospital.  She has also asked that a panel of experts in genetic medicine from outside the State be appointed to carry out the review.  She has threatened High Court proceedings to seek an injunction against an internal HSE review on this.</p>  <p>  The woman was told in 2009 that she did not have the BRCA1 genetic mutation that is linked to breast and ovarian cancer.  Her solicitor has said that, tragically, she has developed cancer and is now in a "grave situation".  The woman says that the mistaken result denied her the opportunity for intervention and preventative treatment almost a decade ago.  Indeed, many people who are correctly identified as having the mutation take preventative measures to avoid developing cancer.</p>  <p>  Professor Andrew Green of Crumlin hospital has written to the woman and apologised.  That is on the public record.  As I am sure the Minister of State knows, Vicky Phelan has said that the situation is eerily similar to her own experience with cervical screening.</p>  <p>  Crumlin hospital has declined to comment publicly on the case or to confirm whether there are similar cases, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, has stated that he is prevented legally from commenting.  In the absence of such comment, and as the Minister of State will appreciate, there is a great deal of fear and concern, particularly given everything that has happened this year in terms of cancer screening for women.</p>  <p>  A report commissioned by the HSE was issued in 2014 by independent experts and made some serious findings.  It criticised the standards in the genetics department in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, which was previously known as the national centre for medical genetics.  The experts, who were from the University of Manchester, stated that communications among staff were "dysfunctional" and patients did not get timely access to tests.  Shockingly, the experts could not find any example of good clinical governance in the genetics department.  That is a stark finding for a group of international experts to make.  The HSE commissioned the 2014 review after it emerged that hundreds of people at risk of cardiac disease were never informed.</p>  <p>  These are serious issues, and now another woman is gravely sick because something was missed.  I am not attacking the Minister on this, but he has stated that he cannot comment and Crumlin hospital is not commenting.  Worryingly, I understand from communications with the solicitor that the solicitor has tried to get this report but cannot get it.  My understanding is that the report is not in the public domain, but I stand to be corrected if it is.  I am told that, not only is it not in the public domain, but the HSE, the hospital or whatever relevant authority is refusing to release it.  If true, that is quite serious.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State release the report to the woman and her solicitor?  I am told that none of the report's recommendations has been implemented.  I am not alleging that, as I do not know it to be true, but it is what I have been told by someone close to the situation.  Will the Minister of State release the report immediately?  Will he report to the House as a matter of urgency on what progress has been made, if any, in implementing the recommendations of what sounds like a very stark report?</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising the issue.  The Minister understands that the question is in the context of the recent incident in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin - the Deputy has now confirmed this - that has been the subject of a number of media reports.  While it is normal practice not to comment on individual cases, I would first like to express my sympathies to the patient and her family on this tragic incident.  The HSE has advised the Department that Crumlin hospital is reviewing the incident as a matter of utmost priority.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Donnai and Newman report on the review of genetics services in Ireland was commissioned by the HSE to recommend improvements in the governance, management and future development of genetic services.  The report made 20 recommendations, the vast majority of which focused on the internal team working and clinical governance issues at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.</p><p>The Donnai and Newman report identified 56 actions to be undertaken by the HSE and Crumlin Hospital.  The HSE has confirmed that 31 of these actions have already been implemented and a further 16 are currently being implemented.  An external multi-professional team led by an experienced NHS health manager from the UK has been assisting the department of clinical genetics to deliver an improved service for patients and clinical service users.  Investment is ongoing in the recruitment of extra staff resources and the purchase of new equipment to assist with the implementation of improvements to the service.</p> <p> While the Donnai and Newman report raised issues with regard to the lack of resources for genetic services at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin, it also acknowledged that investment in genetic services in Ireland should be made in the context of developing a contemporary solution for clinical and laboratory genetics and genomics for the country.  A key recommendation was that a steering group should be set up to develop a national genetic and genomic medicine network that reflects best international practice.  This steering group was established by the HSE in early 2015 under the chairmanship of Professor Owen Smith.  The group concluded that future additional investment could only be appropriately provided in line with the establishment of a national genetics and genomics medicine network.  To this end, the Smith report recommendations included the appointment of a national director of national genetic and genomic medicine network and a clinical laboratory director.  Funding has been allocated in 2018 as part of the HSE's national service plan and these two posts, as well as a business manager post, are currently being progressed for recruitment.  On appointment the post holders, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, will develop the national strategic direction for genetic and genomic medicine services, including genetic laboratory services.</p></speech>

In deputising for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the Minister of State has been consigned to reading out what is written on a piece of paper.  This is topical issues and is meant to be a D&aacute;il debate.  The Minister for Health could have emailed me this response.  I learned how to read ages ago.  It is not fair to the Minister of State.  It is certainly not fair to this woman that in parliamentary debate someone deputises for the Minister for Health and does not answer my questions.  It is not the Minister of State's fault because the answers are not contained in the prepared response.  I am not criticising the Minister of State but this is not satisfactory.  The response given is not what Parliament is for; it is what email is for.  I am going to ask the questions again.  If the Minister of State cannot answer them now, so be it.  The questions I am asking are important and relevant and I ask the Minister of State to answer them if he can.  If he cannot answer them then I ask that the Minister for Health comes to the House to answer them.  That is what this Parliament is meant to be about.</p>  <p>  Will the Department instruct the HSE to release the report?  It is my understanding that the woman's solicitor has requested a copy of the report on numerous occasions but has not received it yet.  If that is true, then the HSE is leaving itself open to allegations of a cover up.  It cannot be tolerated.  A report was commissioned that made very serious findings, with 56 actions and 20 recommendations identified.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me that it is not okay for the HSE to hide and to say that recommendations were made, it has implemented a bunch of them and that we should just go away.  Will the Minister of State instruct the HSE to release the report?  Will he also ask for a much more detailed response from the HSE on the recommendations and actions that have been implemented.  We are talking here about life and death and in the context of everything that has happened this year in terms of failures of audit and testing, this is very serious.  The Minister of State may not be able to answer me now but I ask him to report back on whether the technology, training and skills within the diagnostics team are the very best available.  Has the team had the required capital investment, continuous professional development and so on and does it have everything it needs to do the very best job possible?  Finally, I would like to see an audit done of other potential misses.  It is my fervent hope that this is a one-off, isolated tragedy but given what we have seen in other areas of the country, I would like to see the HSE or another appropriate body ascertain whether this is a one-off incident.  Is there potentially a cluster of misses here and if so, are they due to failures of technology, failures of governance or something else?</p></speech>

I outlined to Deputy Donnelly the number of recommendations that were acted on.  He has asked for clarity on the recommendations that have been implemented and I will request that clarity from the HSE which is the organisation that is delivering the service and responsible for it.  I will also pass on his request to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that the report be published and will ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy directly on that matter.  It is not for me to instruct the HSE but I will certainly ask the Minister for Health to do so on behalf of Deputy Donnelly.  I will also pass on to the HSE the Deputy's request that a detailed audit be conducted.  I will ask the HSE to provide clarity on that.  Deputy Donnelly is referring to a recent case about which I do not want to comment but I have been assured that it is an isolated case.  That is our understanding but an investigation is ongoing, the result of which will be available in a couple of days.</p></speech>

We all understand the implications of wrongful conviction.  In this case we have unsound forensic evidence as well as non-disclosure, mishandling and destruction of evidence and flawed eyewitness testimony.  Mr. Brendan McConville and Mr. John Paul Wooton have been in jail for nearly ten years on the basis of that so-called evidence.  We travelled to Westminster recently out of a sense of frustration at the denial of justice and due process for these two men.  One can only imagine their frustration, having been in Maghaberry Prison for nearly ten years.  While in Westminster, we heard an outline of the case from one of their solicitors.  Reference was made to witness M, whose father signed an affidavit that his son was a fantasist and a very vulnerable person.  What happened then?  The father was arrested.  What happened to witness M?  He was looked after very well financially and the defence team was not given the opportunity to cross-examine him.  It was also proven that witness M's poor eyesight could not have allowed him to make the identification.</p></speech>

I am a socialist and an internationalist.  There are two men who have spent almost ten years in Maghaberry Prison.  These men were known republicans and probably known dissidents and the fear of speaking out against the injustice being suffered by them is a fear of association.  However, as Martin Luther King argued, it is not possible to be in favour of justice for some people and not be in favour of justice for all.  The fact of the matter is that no evidence was produced against these two men.  The Crown never attributed any role to either of them in the murder of PSNI officer Mr. Stephen Carroll.  Myself and a number of the Deputies here attended the appeal of these men in 2013 and met Mr. Carroll's widow.  We expressed our sympathy to her on her loss but that loss will not be overcome by the incarceration of people on the basis of a flawed process.  This is an incredibly dangerous precedent.  Mr. John Paul Wooton was only 17 years old when he was incarcerated.  Mr. Brendan McConville has young children but has spent almost ten years in prison.  Their case has been before the criminal case review commission for two years, which is too long.  This State needs to speak out and argue for it to be dealt with forthwith.</p></speech>

The lack of evidence in this case is frightening.  Central to the prosecution case was the evidence of a man identified only as witness M, who came forward a year after the murder of Stephen Carroll.  He was drunk when he came forward.  He was shortsighted but claimed that he saw the defendants from a long distance.</p><p>As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, his father later came forward to say no one should be in prison on the evidence of his son because he is a Walter Mitty character, who got &pound;50,000 from <i>The Sun</i>and several payments from the PSNI for his efforts.  This is a complete disgrace.  One would struggle to find a worse case of injustice than that of the Craigavon two and one of these days it will become very obvious.  In the meantime, they are having to spend many years in Maghaberry Prison, deemed last year the worst prison in Europe.</p></speech>

I looked up the website of the commission and part of it outlined the history of the setting up of the commission.  It said: "In the 1970s there was a series of high profile cases where the convictions were later recognised as miscarriages of justice: The Guildford Four (1974); The Birmingham Six (1975); The Maguire Seven (1976) and Judith Ward (1974)."  They all have the common theme that they relate to Ireland, even though this commission covers Northern Ireland, Wales and England.</p>  <p>  The situation is that the case has been referred to the commission.  It is our belief that there is substantial evidence that, in terms of proper process, this conviction should never have taken place and the appeal should have been allowed.  We need the Government to press that the commission, which acts independently, and we accept that, gets on speedily with the job of reviewing this case and we would hope it would be referred back at least for a new trial.</p></speech>

My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, and I are aware of the case to which the Deputies refer.  Officials from within our Department, both in Dublin and in the secretariat in Belfast, monitor the case as well as other cases relating to prisoners detained in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  From the outset, I would like to say that the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll was an appalling act of violence which was rightly condemned by the two Governments and by political representatives across party and community lines in Northern Ireland at the time.  It was an attack on the new policing dispensation brought about by the Good Friday Agreement, it was an attack on the Police Service of Northern Ireland which has cross-community backing and serves all the people of Northern Ireland, and it was an attack aimed at discouraging young people, especially those from the nationalist community, considering a policing career.</p>  <p>  It is imperative that we in this House continue to voice our support for the PSNI and for the young women and men from both unionist and nationalist backgrounds who join that service.  It is also imperative that we, as a society, adhere to the rule of law and that we support and have confidence in the policing and justice systems.  I say that without equivocation in relation to the murder of Stephen Carroll and the convictions of Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton.</p>  <p>  Brendan McConville and his co-accused, John Paul Wootton, were convicted of murder by joint enterprise at their trial in 2012.  Their appeal against the convictions failed at the High Court in Belfast in 2014 and the Supreme Court in London later refused them permission to mount a further appeal in 2015.  As the Deputies are aware, at this stage the Criminal Cases Review Commission is looking at the case.  The Criminal Cases Review Commission is an independent public body which is responsible for reviewing possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Darragh Mackin, solicitor for Brendan McConville, spoke about his "real serious concerns as to the safety of the conviction" and that he believes " there are a number of issues that remain effectively unaddressed".</p>  <p>  It is entirely appropriate and correct that these men are now pursuing this channel in the present circumstances.  As I understand it, the solicitors of Brendan McConville have had significant engagement with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and have provided it with a substantial amount of evidence relating to the case.  At this stage in proceedings, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further.  It is important that we respect the legal process and that we allow time for that to conclude.</p>  <p>  That is not to say, however, that we should be unquestioning with regard to the judicial system.  Officials from my Department who are based in Belfast regularly engage with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, and the police and prisoner ombudsmen.</p>  <p>  In addition, at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, engaged with David Lidington and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on matters related to security co-operation.  In these discussions and engagements, the two Governments are able to discuss matters of mutual interest or concern.</p>  <p>  Officials will continue to monitor developments in this particular case.  In the absence of a devolved Assembly, it is regrettable that we do not have a locally elected and accountable justice minister with whom we can engage on matters such as this, but we will continue efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

This is all part of a bigger, unjust system in the North, with revocation of licences, evidence being withheld, legal teams not being able to defend their clients when they do not know what the evidence is.  We have a parole commission hearing, which is incredible in a so-called democracy.  I want to believe in a fair justice system but I do not see it at the moment when I look at all of those examples in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The key point here is that many jurisdictions have proven there can be "No justice, no peace", to use the slogan of the ANC.  It is the same here.  This is an injustice that needs to be examined.  It was a political decision because it was the first killing of a PSNI officer and any old republican would do.  Sadly, the evidence and process do not back up the conviction.  Anybody who believes in the rule of law has to oppose this judgment and call for an immediate review of the case.</p></speech>

If that happened down here, we would be shouting from the rooftops about it.  PSNI Constable Stephen Carroll was murdered and we entirely condemn those who did it, but it is no justice for that family that the wrong people could be in jail for it.</p><p>It was highlighted at the Commons committee that Amnesty International has not got involved in this case, which we are a bit concerned about, and I would remind Amnesty International of the saying of Malcolm X:</p><blockquote>I am for truth, no matter who tells it.  I am for justice, no matter who it is for or against.</blockquote><p>I suggest Amnesty International takes that on board.</p></speech>

That does not mean that the atrocities did not take place.  It means that the convictions were not correct.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, the solicitor for Brendan McConville and the solicitor for John Paul Wootton have said they have real concerns for the safety of the conviction.  That is what we are concerned about.  Convictions can only happen in accordance with law and, if we want people to have confidence in the rule of law, we have to have people who believe there is justice before the law for all in an equal way.  As I pointed out, it is interesting that this commission was set up primarily because of concern about Irish cases.  Therefore, what we are looking for is not to influence the commission, but that it would deal with this matter expeditiously.</p></speech>

It is an emotive issue.  On the one hand, we have the Carroll family grieving the loss of their husband and father and we also have the Wootton and McConville families who have concerns about the processes by which these convictions were made.  The only way to ensure these concerns are considered and addressed is to follow the judicial process to its conclusion.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor developments in this case, ensure that the Government remains informed about the developments and, in that context, we will continue our work in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland to ensure there are no more families grieving for the loss of their loved ones, no matter the context of that loss.</p></speech>

I hope it will be very constructive.  The continuing challenges in meeting the care needs of Ireland's older people must be addressed by Government.  We need a sustained and significant increase in investment in home supports to meet existing unmet needs and future requirements.  Our motion is in direct response to what I and my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues across the country and, I am sure, many other Oireachtas Members see on a weekly basis.  Every week, people in all of our constituencies are worried about their family members who cannot access home care packages.  It is a long-standing policy to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  As we are all aware, Ireland has an ageing populating.  It is estimated that we will have 1 million people aged over 65 by 2030.  As we know, we are all going in only one direction.  I often liken this to a tsunami coming at us.  By 2030, a large proportion of our population will be made up of older people.  </p> <p> Every day, 11 people in Ireland are diagnosed with dementia.  This is extremely challenging for families because 63% of all our older people who have dementia live in the community.  I hope the provision of dementia advisers will be addressed in the HSE service plan.  I have discussed the issue at length with the Minister of State and I appreciate that.  These advisers would also help the situation by providing much-needed guidance and signposting for hard-pressed families reeling from the news of a recent diagnosis.  People with dementia have specific home care needs that differ from those of other cohorts.  It is important that this is highlighted.  </p> <p> While I acknowledge that the Government has spent &euro;411 million on home care supports, we are still a long way off of where we need to be.  There is a shortfall in respect of 6,287 people.  These are our mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles.  They are all family members and they need our support.  People want to be able to live at home in the bosom of their families with the correct wraparound supports for as long as possible.</p> <p> We are facing a winter of discontent in the healthcare services.  The figure of 6,287 people to which I referred is an increase of 700 on last year and an increase of 1,800 on 2016.  The figures are going in only one direction, which is a seriously worry.  The availability of home care can also have significant consequences for capacity in other areas of the health service.  There are approximately 600 people in an acute hospital setting who cannot be released into the care of their community because the necessary supports cannot be found.  If these people could be released into the care of their families in the community, it would go a long way towards solving the issues we have daily with people lying on trollies.  It would free up capacity if we could put home care supports in place.  Some 136,000 bed days have already been lost this year due to late discharges.  In many cases, the reason for these late discharges is that the home care supports are not put in place in a timely manner when needed.</p> <p> This motion calls for home support to be provided on a seven days per week rotation.  I have discussed this with the Minister of State before.  Currently, the majority of home care supports are provided by the HSE from Monday to Friday and by private providers such as Home Instead or Caremark at weekends.  They all do a fantastic job but when a person living in a rural area needs two people to hoist him or her out of bed three times a day and help with toileting and so on, it can sometimes be very difficult to find people for these tasks on a Saturday or a Sunday.  I know of people who have been put to bed at 7 p.m. on a Friday evening and have not been able to get up again until Monday morning.  It is not that they do not get some form of support but that they do not get the two people required to hoist them in or out of bed.  That can be very challenging for their families.</p> <p> We also need to see a sustained and significant increase in investment in home support.  I know the Minister of State made an announcement today and I am sure he will deal with it.  We can discuss it later.  It is also important that individual need, rather than geography or funding, is the primary determinant.  We see demand vary between the various community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  Some areas face significant challenges.  I was struck by figures showing that Galway has 674 people waiting for home care supports, while 578 people are waiting in Wexford.  My constituency of Waterford fares better with 97 people waiting for home care supports.  However, one person waiting is one family too many.  </p> <p> Administration and medical staff are being put under extreme pressure to juggle hours.  I am lucky to have a very good relationship with a service provider in Waterford.  She is a fantastic lady who I can ring her on a Friday evening when somebody is in trouble in a given area and she will juggle her hours as best she can to deal with it.  I am lucky to have that excellent relationship with her, but not everybody has such a relationship.  It is wrong that families have to pick up a phone on a Friday afternoon to tell their local Oireachtas Member they have just been informed that only one person will be available the following day to provide supports when two people are required.  This creates an awful predicament for the administration and medical staff who are trying to juggle this.</p> <p> It has come to my attention that in some areas there is no budget left to provide any more home care packages between now and Christmas.  The only way to provide this support is if, unfortunately, a member of some other family passes away.  That might free up eight, 12 or 14 hours, which can then be allocated to someone else.  That is hard on the staff dealing with the matter.</p> <p> It must be acknowledged that it costs the State three times more to look after older people in a nursing home than it does to look after them in the community.  It makes sense to keep older people in their own homes for as long as possible.  I fervently believe that if we get the home care supports right - I will speak about community care later - the knock-on effect throughout the acute hospital sector would have to be acknowledged.  If we could have people released into their communities from acute hospital settings in a timely manner, it would be a good day's work.</p></speech>

As the Deputy outlined, people often find themselves on a trolley because home care packages and supports are not in place to allow their families to take them home.  She also outlined the facts showing that it is three times cheaper to keep a person at home than for the State to take care of him or her in a nursing home.  That makes the case in black and white.</p>  <p>  In Cavan-Monaghan, there are 240 people on the waiting list for home care packages.  As we know, this is one of the greatest crises for families whose older members depend on the support, assistance and care that enables them to stay in their own homes.  I will cite two particular cases.  All of us deal with a large number of these cases in our offices but these two cases are particularly heart-wrenching.  One involves a gentleman in his 90s who was allocated a home care package last May.  His wife, who is in her late 80s, spent 25 years of her working career as a carer for the HSE.  While I am not saying she should have been shown a positive bias, one would assume that someone who has given her life to minding others would have been taken care of.  However, the home care package was not provided until October, almost six months later.  When I contacted the HSE about this particular case, it replied as follows: "Unfortunately as the home support service must work within an allocated budget, a prioritisation system is used to determine each client's clinical needs."  This case involves someone in his 90s whose wife is in her 80s.  The person who contacted me about it is their daughter who is young widow.  She has one son to raise and depends on her job as a special needs assistant in a school.  It was not an option for her to take time away from the school.</p>  <p>  I support the motion.  Anything the Minister of State can do to ensure there are more home care packages would be very welcome.</p></speech>

She acknowledged an announcement the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, had made during the day.  My concern is that we are not short on announcements but that we are very short on the delivery of home care packages.  The Minister of State is aware of how much time I have spent engaging with him and other Ministers in trying to deliver much needed home care packages.  This is not about staff but about the lack of funding.  For example, since 2016 the number of home care packages has increased by 2,000.  That is causing bed blocking in hospitals and nursing homes.  We know that people are more comfortable living in their own homes where they are happier.  However, additional funding is not being provided to meet the additional demand.  The maths are very simple - the funding is not available.</p>  <p>  In community health organisation, CHO, 7 which covers my constituency of Kildare, part of Dublin and Wicklow a total of 992 people are awaiting approval of home care packages.  In Kildare alone there are 260 people waiting.  The home care packages cannot be approved because there is no money available.  When those responsible met the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, six weeks ago, they pleaded with him for money because of the crisis.  That has been the position since April and the number waiting has been increasing month on month.  Where is the money going?  Why are services not being delivered and why are home care packages not being provided for people who have been identified, assessed and approved to receive them?  The reason they cannot be put in place is there is no money available.</p>  <p>  I will quickly outline two cases for the Minister of State.  One concerns a constituent who was in Peamount Hospital.  It was decided that he would be moved to Naas because of bed blocking.  He is going back to Naas Hospital or another hospital as they have been trying to have him moved.  This has been ongoing for five months because the home care package has not been approved.</p>  <p>  Another case concerns an old lady in her 80s who has a heart condition.  Her husband is very ill, but she cannot have a home care package put in place.  This week she borrowed money from a moneylender to keep her husband in a nursing home until a home care package is put in place.  That is the reality.  We need home care packages to be approved and funding to be put in place.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knows as well as anybody else that since July the provision of home care packages and the allocation of additional home help supports for families throughout the country, especially in County Cork, have completely dried up.  It is impossible to assist constituents who come to us for help to keep their loved ones at home and provide every support they can for families.  Families look at ways by which they can work around their work schedules and other family commitments to try to ensure they will have supports in place.  Nurses and other health professionals recognise the chronic need for additional support, but it is not available.  What we are being told by the HSE is that no additional home help hours are available.  In some cases, the numbers of hours have even been reduced.</p>  <p>  A figure was trotted out again this morning for the number of extra home care packages being allocated in order to alleviate a potential trolley crisis in December and January.  Given the number in chronic need of help, I would dearly love to see the 550 home care packages allocated.  In some cases an elderly husband or wife is caring for his or her partner or loved one and he or she is looking for extra support.  The situation is simply not acceptable.  I put it to the Minister of State that we will come back here in the first or second week of January to see whether any of the extra home care packages has been allocated.  I believe they will not have been.  We must be serious about this issue because there is a chronic need for help across services.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State can hear, we all have stories of problems from our constituencies.  I have raised the issue with him on the Order of Business and the problem has persisted throughout the year.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the public health nurse in my area and, in particular, the staff in Cherry Orchard who deal with this issue.  They are in an impossible position.  They are trying to cherry-pick who should receive help and when they should receive it from very limited and diminished resources available.  The pressure they are put under is not fair.  They are trying to decide how the resource should be divided between two families.</p>  <p>  The HSE's national service plan indicated clearly that it would provide 50,500 home support service packages in the year.  In response to parliamentary questions I have been told that 52,500 people are in receipt of home support service packages and that another 6,000 are on the list.  It appears that at the beginning of the year the HSE grossly underestimated the level of need, yet no attempt has been made during the year to correct the position.  That is the underlying and persisting problem.</p>  <p>  Another problem is that the HSE is unable or unwilling to state for how long people are on waiting lists.  In response to parliamentary questions I have been told that slightly in excess of 6,000 are on waiting lists.  My area is serviced by CHO 7.  At the start of the year while 6,000 were waiting nationally, 650 of them were in CHO 7.  By April the figure of 650 had risen to 857.  The latest figures I received from the HSE this week are to the end of August.  In total there are 6,200 waiting, but the number in CHO 7 has increased to 1,111.  There is a very specific and particular problem in CHO 7 where the numbers are spiralling out of control.  Will the Minister of State, please, examine the issue?</p></speech>

Many families are often misled into believing the battle has been won once they receive approval, yet it only begins at that point to receive the service for the number of hours approved.  Elderly, vulnerable and ill people who have been assessed as being in need of support are not receiving it.  A total of 578 people in Wexford are waiting to receive home support services.  The waiting list is one of the worst in the country.  Conversely, in many counties there are no waiting lists.  Next door in the Carlow-Kilkenny area nobody is waiting for support.  Why are vulnerable people in Wexford being discriminated against in comparison to people living in other counties?</p>  <p>  I will briefly provide three examples for the Minister of State.  An 84 year old woman who is living alone and crippled with arthritis has been approved for a home care package for almost one year, yet she does not receive support for even half an hour.  An 85 year old who is bed ridden and living alone can receive no support at the weekend.  A 74 year old who has an oxygen tank, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and asthma and been approved for home support for almost a year cannot receive any support.  What does the Minister of State say to these people?  It is totally unacceptable that so many older people cannot receive the vital supports they need, but it is outrageous that some counties such as my own - Wexford - are bearing the brunt of the waiting lists.  Why are older people in Wexford being discriminated against and when will it end?</p></speech>

The current method of allocation of home support hours is far from satisfactory.  Access to healthcare should never be based on a postcode; it should be open and transparent and the system applied consistently throughout the country.  Thankfully, home supports provided in my region are good.  I acknowledge the administrative support staff who run the scheme and also those on the front line who provide care for individuals on a daily basis to allow them to stay in their homes where they want to be.  However, as my colleagues have done, I wish to raise some hardship cases.  </p>  <p>  In one case an adult child is being cared for by two parents who are almost 80 years of age.  They have provided care for their adult son for more than four decades.  He has Down's syndrome and now Alzheimer's disease.  They urgently want him to move into long-term care because they can no longer physically provide care.  However, there is no place available for him.  As a compromise, they have been told that they have been approved to receive 14 hours of home help.  However, there is a waiting list.  The business case has been made and the HSE is waiting for recycled hours to come back on-stream.  That is not good enough in this day and age and must stop.  That is the reason my colleague Deputy O'Dea produced a Bill to place the provision of home care services on a statutory basis, just like the fair deal scheme.  It would ensure people would have access to home care services.  It would make good economic sense and, far more important, good social sense.  If anything is to come from this motion, I encourage the Minister of State to accelerate the passage of the Bill to give people confidence that they will be looked after in their homes in their old age.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Deputy Mary Butler, who always has been, if anything, highly consistent and commendable in her approach to issues affecting the elderly, especially in the areas of dementia and home care.  I wish to acknowledge at the outset her consistency and collaborative approach in working on this issue at all times.  Although she is a very nice person socially, I dread meeting her on the corridors.  I find myself ducking the corridors more often than not because of her utter consistency and care in this matter.  I wish to acknowledge her collaborative approach.  She is always constructive and collaborative and wants to work with others as opposed to scoring cheap political points.  She has always found that to be beneath her.  I commend and acknowledge her approach in this regard.</p>  <p>  We all share the common objective in what is being said today in the debate on the motion.  As Minister of State with responsibility for this area, not only do I agree with the motion but I welcome it.  Moreover, I welcome the opportunity for us to debate the issues and to share views from all sides of the House.  This allows us to increase the focus on the issue.  Collectively, we all want to ensure our people are cared for as they get older.  Our elderly people represent our most treasured possession and we want to ensure they get to live and age well in society.  We want to ensure the very best of facilities for them.</p>  <p>  We are all committed to Government policy, which is to allow people to age in their own home and to continue to live as well as they can there.  The policy is to provide as many supports as we can to people to live in their own homes.</p>  <p>  We have several challenges facing us in the demographics as Ireland catches up with the rest of the EU demographically.  Our population is growing older, with the number of people over the age of 65 years set to double and the number of people over 85 years set to treble in the next 20 years.  While this will prove something of a challenge, it will also prove an extraordinary opportunity for us as a society to radically change how we approach the care of our elderly.  It will allow the inter-generational aspect come to the fore more at a time when our younger people are more and more obsessed with screens and lack of social interaction and so on.  This represents an extraordinary challenge for us but also an opportunity to tap into the wisdom, wit, company and friendship of our elderly and young people.  We can realise the challenge by working together.  We must embrace other challenges that are coming down the tracks and we must look at other opportunities when it comes to care.  One such challenge is what is at the heart of this motion, namely, providing home care for the elderly population.</p>  <p>  People will know the statistics.  Last year, the HSE provided 17 million home help hours. Deputy Curran and others are tenacious in seeking this information.  They will know all of these figures by heart.  Anyway, it is no harm to put them on the record and to put them into focus.  Sometimes we say there is no service there.  As politicians we do not have people coming into our offices telling us when they get the service and what they are getting.  Rather, we come across people who do not get the service.  A total of 17 million hours were provided by the HSE last year.  The budget in 2015 was &euro;306 million and it is now at &euro;420 million.  That indicates a significant increase in the budget over that period.  Of course, that is not enough.  I have accepted that every time I have spoken on the matter in the D&aacute;il, including during Questions on Promised Legislation.  I acknowledge that it is not enough and that we need more.  Yet 52,000 families have benefitted from home care delivery.  It is important to acknowledge the good work of the HSE and to acknowledge where the HSE is delivering and providing an exceptional service as well as acknowledging the individuals who are providing the service.</p>  <p>  Certainly, I am not shy in wanting to share in the ambition of the party opposite to increase and improve on this delivery and to ensure that we can allocate the maximum possible amount of resources available to us to ensure we continue in this regard.</p>  <p>  We are keenly aware and acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE monitors the delivery of home care on an ongoing basis to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients' assessed care needs within the overall available resources.</p>  <p>  Following the recent budget announcement, the HSE and officials from the Department of Health are in the process of developing and agreeing the HSE national service plan 2019.  The plan will set out in detail the type and quantum of services to be delivered in 2019, including services for older people.</p>  <p>  In the context of winter planning there has been a sustained focus in recent years on reducing delayed discharges and enabling patients to be discharged from acute hospitals sooner.  The HSE is currently finalising its winter plan in conjunction with the Department of Health to provide the most effective response to the challenges to unscheduled care provision in the coming months.  The plan will contain a range of measures across hospitals, primary care and community care settings to manage critical demand pressures during winter to ensure the system is working at full capacity throughout busy periods.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2019 an additional &euro;10 million has been made available to the HSE for the winter period for home supports and other supports to minimise delays in people getting home from hospital, with a focus on those in the over 75 age group.  My Department immediately sanctioned the release of &euro;5 million of this additional funding to support the deployment of social and primary care measures to enable patients to return from hospital to their home or community with the supports they need.  The funding will support an additional 300 home support packages, additional aids and appliances and additional transitional care in the run up to Christmas.  The expected impact of these measures will be considered in the context of the broader winter plan.</p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to prioritising the full-year cost of these measures in the national service plan for 2019 and to including additional measures in early 2019.  These will include an additional 250 home supports packages.  This means that in the months ahead an additional 550 home support packages will be made available.  Importantly, these measures are being actively operationalised.</p>  <p>  Deputy Troy referred to Deputy O'Dea's Private Members' Bill.  As Members will be aware, we launched a consultation last year to find out what people would like to see in a home care scheme to be set out in statute and underpinned by statute.  The idea is that it would be demand-led like the fair deal scheme.  Anyone who wants to go into nursing home care is guaranteed that the funding would be available.  Thankfully, it has been available for several years now and people have to wait no more than three weeks for an application to be processed.  We have the same ambition for home care.  We have begun the journey.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy sets a target of 2021 for introduction of the new statutory scheme.  We hope that in 2020 we will have an outline of how the scheme will look.  However, it will take a further 12 to 18 months before we can get to where we need to be to design the policy in full.  Much work has to be undertaken behind the scenes to ensure the availability of staff to respond to the needs of such a scheme.  The scheme will introduce clear rules on the services for which individuals are eligible and on how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home support services.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant amount of detailed work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home support scheme and the system of regulation of these services.</p>  <p>  It is important that people are supported and encouraged to live independently in a supportive environment for as long as possible and to plan for this.  The Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are working together on developing a policy framework by which Government can facilitate and promote a variety of housing options, including housing with care for older people.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, and I held an expert conference yesterday on housing for older people.  The conference provided the opportunity to hear from experts in housing, health and social care services.  It was an opportunity to inform those present on the development of an appropriate policy framework to respond to the challenges and opportunities ahead.  The Department of Health and the HSE are participating in a demonstrator project in partnership with Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dublin City Council and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  A site in Inchicore has been identified for development of a housing with support model under the Rebuilding Ireland plan, which will deliver 52 homes and is due for completion in 2020.</p>  <p>  One important aspect of the home care debate is that we provide real and meaningful alternatives for people who want to move, to downsize or to live in supported environments.  These people want a real alternative rather than simply the choice between their own home and a nursing home.  There is a mid-way place where people can go to supported housing developments with on-site supports.  There are some wonderful examples throughout the country.  Many of the Deputies opposite and on this side of the House will be familiar with them.  Often I quote the example of Kilmaley in west Clare, where there are 24 units for elderly people.  One person is on duty 24 hours per day, seven days per week to provide whatever assistance is necessary to the people there.  More important, in 20 years of these 24 units being in place only one person has ever gone from the supported housing unit to a nursing home.  Only one person there has ever graduated to a nursing home.  Anyone who has had end of life experiences or who has died has either died on-site or in an acute setting.  We can be far more ambitious.  That is a part of the solution.  It is not the whole solution but it is another part of the debate.</p>  <p>  We are developing a new statutory care scheme.  It will be 2021 before it will be brought in.  This comes under the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy.  As resources become available we will continue to enhance and improve on the available resources to maximise the amount of home help we can provide to people.  We understand the benefits for the acute setting.  We understand the advantages of taking people out of hospital, which is the least safe place for elderly people to be when they do not need to be there.  We certainly support the motion from the party opposite.</p></speech>

He went on to indicate that it is how we treat all within our number.  It is timely that we are debating this Private Member's motion this evening, and I commend Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing it forward.  I pledge the full support of Sinn F&eacute;in for its proposals.</p>  <p>  Our older people are the bedrock of our society, those who have contributed so much in building our communities, raising families, working and paying their duty of tax to build a better country.  Indeed, they pass on the knowledge they have accrued and experience they have gained to their younger family members, and indeed to younger citizens in general.  They deserve our warmest appreciation.  Do we treat our elder citizens with the dignity and respect they deserve?  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  We have been through horrific economic times, which I acknowledge.  We are still bearing the scars from those times.  Indeed, the cuts that caused those scars over the last number of years are still bleeding inside.  However, we can stop this.  Revenue returns have improved significantly, and we have more money in our public coffers today, which allows the Government to make choices.  The choices it makes will inform the judgment of how we as a nation treat our citizens, especially our older citizens.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, speaking in this very Chamber last Thursday stated that: "6,269 people approved for new or additional home supports were waiting for funding to be made available".  This morning I noted that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, announced an additional 550 home care packages for the winter period, including additional transitional care beds and &euro;4 million towards required aids and appliances.  This investment is to be welcomed, but it is nowhere near enough.  It comes down to choice.  It is estimated that the current waiting time for a home care package averages at three and a half months.  Some of our citizens, including some I know personally, have waited years.  Three and a half months, however, is still too long to wait.  What does this tell us?  As is the case in so many other areas of our health service, it exposes a complete lack of capacity caused by under-investment.  Based on the figures I have cited, and despite today's announcement, the agony experienced by many people continues.</p>  <p>  Perhaps it is a coincidence that this morning's announcement happened on the same day as this private member's business; I would never call it a gimmick or a stunt.  Some might suggest that the announcement was made to nullify the embarrassment this Government feels given that its policy choices determine where public moneys go.  Whatever the reason, we welcome it for what it is.  There will still, however, be 5,700 older people awaiting home care packages to allow them to live in their own home with the necessary additional supports.  It seems to me that this morning's announcement was borne of panic.</p>  <p>  On a not unrelated matter, today there are 425 Irish citizens lying on trolleys in the corridors of hospitals.  Many of them are older people.  On this day in 2017 the figure was 448; in 2016 it was 397; in 2015 it was 292; and in 2014 the figure was 321.  This Government does not have a handle on the health service, evidenced by the figures I have just cited.  The problems are growing.  It has been slow to move on the all-party Sl&aacute;intecare initiative.  It has picked and chosen the items it wants to implement, not wanting to upset certain vested interests.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, only two days ago, referred to "bed-blockers".  I am glad that he did not repeat that in his address a few moments ago.  That phrase is insensitive.  It was repeated by another Member of this House this afternoon.  It should be rejected.  These so-called "bed-blockers" are people.  They are our parents and grandparents, and deserve dignity and respect, and the maintenance of their integrity as they face health challenges in their later years.  These challenges are going to present at some point in all of our lives, so I appeal to everyone to show compassion and respect, and to cease using that objectionable phrase. </p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in absolutely supports the proposition put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il this evening.  I would make further points if I had more time, but I ask the Minister of State, in making the choice to put more euro in the pockets of those who already have enough, to remember that not everyone wants that.  Many Irish people are carers, and many more care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100033#LL00300"><p>Home supports, home help packages and home help hours are some of the most vital services provided by the State.  This was evident to me as someone who represented home help workers a number of years ago when the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government brought in the moratorium on recruitment.  As bad as things were, home help workers were exempted because it was a good value for money service.  There were other issues in terms of the hourly pay, but it provides great value for money.  In truth we should be making sure that the provision keeps step with the age and demographic profile of the population, and the fact is that neither the Minister for Health nor the Fine Gael-led Government have provided the financial and human resources necessary to do that.</p>  <p>  The percentage of our population over 65 years of age and over 85 years of age is increasing every single day.  This is really good news, and is also entirely predictable from Central Statistics Office, CSO, data.  Every single time we raise this issue, either here on the floor of the House or via parliamentary question, we are told that the population is aging and that there is an increase in demand for services.  This is completely predictable, yet the Government acts surprised.  People aging and requiring home support is not the reason for waiting lists.  Waiting lists are caused by poor planning.  To date, the planning for this has been absolutely atrocious.  In 2016 there were 4,481 people waiting for home help.  Today, that number has increased to 6,287.  What kind of planning does that represent?  We knew there was going to be an increase in demand.  Some counties have been totally abandoned.  Some 674 people are waiting in Galway, 623 in north Dublin and 578 in Wexford.  The situation is a serious cause for concern, because these waits for care contribute to an increase in instances of illness.</p>  <p>  Getting older or having a disability should not leave a person invisible in this State.  The supports should be in place.  I represented home helps, but we also spoke to the people who were availing of home help services.  Those people do not want services on the cheap.  They want to know that the person coming into their home has a decent job, decent pay and decent terms and conditions.  As I said at the outset, home helps provide a fantastic value for money service.  I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies for bringing forward this Private Member's motion and I am delighted that Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100033#LL00400"><p>I commend Deputy Butler for bringing forward this motion.  The issue of home help is one that we all deal with on a regular basis across the whole country.  The Minister of State in his speech mentioned that the provision has grown and that more money is being put into home help, and that he has a continual need to better resource the service.</p><p>The reality on the ground which everyone needs to acknowledge is that demand is moving beyond provision.  As the elderly population continues to grow, there will obviously be greater demand.  We are not even keeping up with the current demand, never mind future growth.</p> <p> It is an issue of geography.  Some areas are worse off.  In rural Ireland it is particularly difficult to obtain home help services.  One of the things that stands out for me is that many of the new packages are part home care packages; they are not full packages.  A problem is diagnosed and a solution determined.  It is deemed necessary to prescribe a certain number of home help hours for someone coming home from hospital.  The district nurse determines what is needed.  When the service is required, a package may be put in place, but it might include only half of the number of hours required.  There may be no service provided at weekends.  I am dealing with an elderly person whose family have been told to hire someone to provide home help for an additional number of hours.</p> <p> That is the position for the vast majority.  First, they find it difficult to obtain a service in a lot of rural areas.  If it is available, a huge cost is put on them.  Many of them paid taxes all of their lives.  They worked long and weary years with the expectation that at the end of their days the State would care for them, having paid and contributed so much to it.  They feel extremely let down.</p> <p> The waiting list issue was mentioned.  It was said that in some counties waiting lists were much shorter than in others.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly obtained some lists a couple of months ago and I could not understand them.  They showed that nobody was waiting in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 in Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, yet when I contact the service, I am told that hundreds are waiting.  Sometimes the figures are massaged by someone to look good, but looking good is not good enough for the people who need the services.  The waiting lists are very often misinformed, which needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p> I commend Deputy Butler on bringing forward the motion.  The issues raised clearly need to be dealt with as quickly as possible.  As a merry little dance goes on as the confidence and supply agreement is worked out, I expect the motion to be a signal that the issue will be front and centre and that if a deal is finally done, we can expect to see increased provision of home help services and services for older people before Christmas.</p></speech>

It is an issue that affects every county in the State, none more than my county of Louth.  Fine Gael, with the Labour Party, the party's former partner in government, removed the 23 public long-term care beds from the Cottage Hospital in Drogheda.  They also removed the 15 respite care beds and replaced them with temporary step-down beds to facilitate the transfer of patients to private nursing homes.  At the time, Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a new 100-bed facility at St. Mary's Hospital on the Dublin Road, but it never materialised.  It was clear that the Government never had any intention of delivering a new 100-bed facility.  The plan was to force people into private nursing homes.  That has to be the most sickening aspect of it all.  When Fine Gael looks at old people, it does not see mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles or families.  It sees profit.  It looks at an elderly person in a bed and all it sees is a cash machine, a euro sign over the bed for the benefit of its private nursing home buddies.  The idea of elderly care as a cash cow for private interests runs through the entire system.  For example, under the fair deal scheme, many patients have to pay for toiletries, newspapers, hairdressing costs, transport to hospital appointments, prescription charges and many other items and services.  Perhaps most seriously, patients must also pay out of their own pocket for therapies such as physiotherapy, speech therapy and chiropody.  They even have to pay for social programmes, despite having already paid for their care through the fair deal scheme contribution.  This is blatantly forcing elderly people, many of whom are vulnerable, to pay for their care twice.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month Care Alliance Ireland published a report that outlined the shocking deficiencies in service provision.  It made for stark reading.  Up to 6,000 people are waiting for a home care service and the average waiting time is more than three months.  Those who are deemed to be "low priority" can be left waiting for more than two years.  Another shocking statistic is that people are receiving up to 18% less home care than their assessed needs.  There are such cases all over the State, particularly in County Louth.  There are cases where care for half an hour is provided, despite assessments showing that a higher level of support is required.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to face up to this reality and no piecemeal approach will solve it.  If the Government is going to boast about the importance of independent living, it needs to back it up with services.  It is clear that Fine Gael is incapable of working in the interests of elderly people.  It has failed them miserably on every count, but, above all else, it fails them when they need help the most.</p></speech>

I have vast experience of dealing with the issue.  Working with elderly people with dementia for three years as a care assistant in Cherry Orchard Hospital gave me probably the best life experience I have had in my life.  I refer not only to the elderly people there but also the staff and relatives who had to deal with this issue.  It is testimony to the staff who work in health services.  They show such dedication in these extremely difficult circumstances.  The debate we are having is welcome.</p><p>Elderly people have suffered immensely because of austerity cuts and increasing poverty levels in the last decade.  A report in the<i>Irish Examiner </i>in March this year estimated that 65,000 older people were at risk of poverty and that 85,000 people experienced deprivation.  Another report in October stated about 6,000 elderly people were on waiting lists to receive home care support.  This issue urgently needs to be dealt with.</p><p>To deal with the present we must deal with the past.  In 2008, in response to Fianna Fail's attempt be bring forward changes to the medical card scheme for the over-70s, more than 15,000 older people mobilised to force an embarrassing climbdown by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  In another blow to elderly people Fianna F&aacute;il intended to reduce the State pension in 2011, but huge pressure from elderly groups made it back down.  However, it managed to make significant cuts to carer's benefit, carer's allowance, disability allowance, widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension and death benefit, all of which hugely affected the elderly.  These are not abstract actions but decisions that greatly affected older people's lives and well-being.  </p><p>Let us not forget the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, who in coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the fair deal nursing home support scheme in 2009.  Instead of providing public care for the elderly, the scheme introduced a co-payments system under which the cost of care was shared between the State and patients, making people pay for services to which previously they had been entitled under the guise of so-called &quot;fairness&quot;.  By 2011 the funding allocation for the scheme had run out, leaving elderly people waiting in hospitals instead of nursing homes.  It was an abject failure caused by the very bad decision to privatise elderly care services.  I also note that the Minister of State, Deputy English, made a statement in the<i>Irish Examiner </i>yesterday that public lands could be used to support private ventures such as retirement homes.  It was a bizarre statement.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy English, and Deputy Daly were quoted in <i>The Irish Times </i>warning that a housing crisis was looming for older people.  Of course, they are right; the ongoing housing crisis affects everybody.</p><p>I am curious as to how the obsession with privatisation and the market is going to solve the housing crisis or provide care for the elderly.  We can see the damage this agenda has caused and is causing and what it will do in the future.  I hope this is only the beginning of improvements to care services for the elderly, as weak mitigations will not be enough to provide care on an equal basis for all. </p></speech>

The 550 additional packages would not even clear the 578 waiting in Wexford alone.<br/><br/>The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government - it is interesting that the Labour Party did not turn up today - destroyed home care hours.  The reported additional 550 care packages need to be seen in this context.  Using the original 2011 HSE service goals for home care as a baseline, Care Alliance Ireland found a deficit in provision in 2016 of 1.64 million hours.  In its most recent report, published last month, Care Alliance Ireland shows that while provision has increased since, the rate of increase has simply kept pace with demand.  Therefore, it estimates a deficit in provision in both 2018 and 2019 of a similar amount, in both cases well in excess of 1.5 million hours.  That is a scandalous figure.<br/><br/>There is a considerable discrepancy between the figures on the waiting lists in various counties.  The figures reported last week from a freedom of information request received by Sinn F&eacute;in show that in Wexford there are 578 people on the waiting list for home care support.  In Louth, there were only two on the list.  There is nobody waiting for supports in Kerry, north Cork, north Lee in Cork city, Carlow-Kilkenny and south Tipperary.  I have many questions about these discrepancies between the numbers of people on the waiting lists.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will not be surprised to hear that I find it a bit baffling.  Does each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area or local health office get the same budget per head of population?  If so, how do we account for the wild discrepancies between the different counties?  Are we to believe that Wexford and Galway, for example, have a grossly disproportionate elderly population compared with Kerry, Carlow-Kilkenny or south Tipperary?  If that is the case, which I do not believe is so, surely Wexford and Galway should be getting suitably larger budgets.  Is it the case instead that the administration of home care packages in Wexford is completely inefficient and not fit for purpose?  Is it the case that Kerry and Carlow-Kilkenny are faster and more efficient at assessing claims?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, during Leaders' Questions two weeks ago, stated:</p><blockquote>It is not simply a case of throwing money at the issue.  We need to make sure that the additional resources that we provide are used appropriately.</blockquote><p>The Government is essentially saying that this is a failure by the respective CHO areas to manage their budgets properly.<br/><br/>One Wexford family who are desperately in need of a home care package have been in contact with my office.  Ms Finula Byrne is just 39 years old.  It is important to remember that home care packages are also sometimes required for younger people.  Finula normally lives at home with her mother and father.  She used to have up to ten epileptic seizures per night, but a few months ago she was admitted to hospital because the number of seizures has increased so much.  Finula's parents have been her main carers for their whole lives.  They are elderly pensioners and they cannot cope any more without help.  Finula's father has recently had a hip replacement.  The Byrne family has always maintained responsibility for Finula's care with minimal support from the HSE or any other organisation.  They have not requested help from the HSE for 25 years.  They have sacrificed so much, and when they are, for once, desperate for help, they are told there is no support available.  In early November this year, the office of the general manager for disability services in the south east told the Byrne family that there are no funds available for 2018 as they have been exhausted.  This is not just a postcode lottery, as it was called last week.  Access to a home care package is also determined by the time of year.  We need to find a solution for the Byrne family and many like them.</p></speech>

I commend Fianna F&aacute;il on bringing it forward because we hear every year of the increasing numbers of people who are without home help hours or have insufficient home help.  Indeed, in my constituency of Dublin Bay North, I often meet distressed family members and those who urgently require more home help.  There are many reported instances of constituents being approved for home help but not having access to the service because of a perceived lack of resources from the service providers.  Often these cases are even categorised as urgent but are still left waiting with little or no help.  Week in, week out, I deal with a number of such cases.</p>  <p>  Census 2016 showed that there were 637,000 people over 65 years of age, an increase of more than 100,000 or 19.1% on the previous census.  Of those, 577,000 were living in private households and there were almost 23,000 in nursing homes.  The ESRI has forecast that the demand for home care will increase by 66% up to 2030.  We are aware of the figures and the needs.  It is the job of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to resource that.  As stated in the motion before us, however, the health service capacity review puts that increase at 120% because, at that stage, one in six of us will be over 65 years and the number over 85 years will have doubled.</p>  <p>  As the motion before us also references, by September 2018, the number of hospital delayed discharges had increased from 481 to 613, and a reported 136,239 hospital bed days were lost because of delayed discharges.  I particularly agree with the motion's call that home support should be provided over seven days a week, outside of normal office hours, and to 100% of long-term recipients of social protection payments.  A Programme for Partnership Government 2016 committed to "Working to Make our Older Years Better Years".  The actions in the motion, if the Government were to follow them assiduously, would significantly move along that path, but we have not seen that so far.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Wallace and others have said, the lack of information on this service and that reference to geography are the most frustrating aspects for all of us.  It is difficult to ascertain the level of need and the impact.  That is why Members from all sides of the House are constantly asking questions about this.  For example, in a reply I received to a parliamentary question at the end of last month, the HSE would not provide information on the cost of delivering an additional 5,000 home care packages which I had asked for and instead informed me of the new single funded home support service for older people which has amalgamated the previous home care packages and home help service.  The reply also informed me that, nationally, the average cost per client per week for home support services funded by the HSE is estimated to be in the region of &euro;160 per week and that it would cost approximately &euro;41.5 million to deliver home support services to an additional 5,000 people per year.  Earlier this year, there were reports that private nursing home places are costing approximately &euro;1,200 per week, an astonishing difference when one thinks about it which, in the spirit of the motion before us, puts the emphasis rightly on home care.</p>  <p>  Even today, I received another answer to a parliamentary question, which related to the HSE National Service Plan 2018 targets which provided for 18.25 million home support hours to be delivered to more than 50,000 people.  It is difficult for us Deputies to figure out what these hours mean for citizens who, perhaps, have a half an hour a day and who are looking for an additional half an hour.  As the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in stated recently, what on earth can one do in half an hour?</p>  <p>  I warmly support the motion before us and urge the Minister to move towards a funding model which will support the senior citizens throughout the country.  Of course, what has happened in home care, as in so much else, relates to the ferocious cuts by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael led Governments in the austerity years and we must regain all that territory for senior citizens.</p></speech>

We are here again speaking about elderly people and the difficulties that they face.  Is it not clear to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that issues of the elderly are coming up every day, sometimes several times a day, in the D&aacute;il?  This surely highlights the seriousness of the issues that elderly people face.</p>  <p>  Elderly people are being victimised in this country.  I have recently been told of the closure of the west Cork carers support group's office in Bantry.  This is a terrible loss to carers in Bantry.</p><p>Not only will Bantry lose this facility, but I have been told today that the blood pressure clinic there is also closing.  This is another attack on our elderly people.</p> <p> We can see the splashing around that has happened but nothing is happening on the ground.  We have seen the release of shocking statistics.  It has been reported that in the past year, almost 10,000 elderly people were left waiting on hospital trolleys for over 24 hours.  These shocking statistics have led to this being branded a national scandal.  My fear is that with the onset of winter, these numbers will increase again.  A HIQA report from 2012 suggests that best practice should involve a patient spending six hours or less in an emergency department.  In its service plan, this Government recently set a target of 24 hours or less.  This is 18 hours more than the suggestion by HIQA.  There are elderly people waiting years for procedures, some of which only take 15 minutes.  How does the Minister of State think it acceptable to ask an individual aged 90 to wait for up to four years for a cataract procedure?  Many of our carers are elderly.  Time and again, I have raised in this Chamber the unacceptable situation whereby carers wait months for their carer's allowance.  How does the Minister of State expect anyone to survive without money for months?  I have been crying out for extra home help hours.  When will this happen?  The bottom line is that elderly people are bearing the brunt of the Government's leadership from the lack of home help hours to the lack of respite facilities to the long waiting times for procedures to delays in emergency departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100036#OO00200"><p>It goes without saying that keeping people in their homes and communities provides the best value for money.  It also gives them a superior quality of life.  Regardless of what nursing homes do, with the best intentions in the world, it is very hard to prevent people from becoming institutionalised in them.  They have a significant amount of activities and other supports that allow residents to live a life as close as possible to life in their own home but living in a nursing home is a second-class option.  Of course, some people have to go into nursing homes because of their needs but many people are still going into nursing homes when they could be supported at home.  It is very important that we realise that the best quality of life is provided by allowing somebody to live in their own home.</p>  <p>  I note that the Fianna F&aacute;il motion argues that supported housing options must also be provided as an alternative to residential care.  This is very important because there are low-support housing units around the country for people who cannot live in their own homes because of the quality of the house, because they are living in social isolation or because they are living in fear in isolated areas.  When they come down into these supported communities, they are still living independently but they have a much better quality of life, greater security and care either from other able-bodied residents looking after them or the local community.  These options should be looked at, particularly supported housing.  Each community, parish and village should have a supported housing unit where the elderly can live in security with minimal or low support.</p>  <p>  The other issue that arises is that many people are allocated home care packages but the carers to provide that package are not available.  With the increase in employment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people who will act as carers.  I have come across people who have been allocated home care packages but cannot find the personnel to deliver them.  I spoke to the previous Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection about altering social welfare rules so that if somebody on social welfare delivers one or two hours of home care per day, they would not lose their entire day of social welfare.  It should be calculated on the number of hours per week rather than the number of days per week.  If somebody on social welfare provides home care for ten hours per week, ten hours should be taken from their social welfare payment instead of removing social welfare in its entirety.  Trying to find personnel to deliver home care is a significant problem.</p>  <p>  When statutory home care comes in, and I hope it comes in very quickly, it will come at a price and we will have to explain to people that if the State is to deliver statutory home care, it cannot be entirely free.  A cost must be attached to it otherwise it will become completely unaffordable, particularly with our growing population.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Butler on bringing forward this motion.  The protection of older persons and the prioritisation of service delivery for them are things that concerns us all.  As Deputy Michael Collins said earlier, we talked about it only last week.  I made these points recently in the context of my Private Members' Bill, the Vulnerable Persons Bill, which dealt specifically with the issue of elder abuse, in particular the financial abuse of older persons.  Deputy Harty made some very good suggestions on that occasion.  Being a practising GP in rural Ireland, he sees the issues at first hand.  In terms of the more obvious policy challenges, we are aware that approximately 50,000 people are in receipt of publicly funded home care.  However, there is no statutory entitlement to it.  It is the luck of the draw or, as someone said, a post code lottery.  As a result, there is a lack of clarity and consistency about who is eligible for services and how they are allocated.  There have been clear policy statements dating back a number of years - a decade - making a commitment to move resources out of the acute healthcare sector and into community care services.  The Taoiseach stands up here every day every week to talk about the &euro;17 billion in health.  A couple of years ago, it was &euro;14 billion.  The billions are going in but we are not getting the outcomes.  It is all being gobbled up in administration.  In 2008, the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, stated that the whole purpose of health service reform was to take resources from the acute hospital sector and spend more resources in the community sector.  That was ten years ago and as far as I can see, the situation has got worse.  Where are we now?  I suggest we have actually moved backwards in this regard and at quite a pace as well.</p>  <p>  We know that 10.7% of pensioners live on an income below the poverty line.  We can come in here and talk all we like and Deputy Butler and ourselves can bring Bills forward but nothing seems to change in the HSE.  Nothing seems to change with the delay regarding carer's allowance.  There is a listening service in south Tipperary called Good Morning South Tipperary that also covers part of Deputy Butler's constituency in west Waterford.  The service cannot get a cent in funding from the HSE.  This is a very valuable service.  The people who engage with it love it.  They spend one day per week with specially trained volunteers who do not receive a shilling.</p>  <p>  It is the same with the lack of home help.  As Deputy Harty said, it will be harder to get home help staff so we must be flexible with people on social welfare so that they can provide the hours because the personnel simply are not there.  Regarding waiting times and delays relating to home care, there are a number of people in my constituency who have had strokes and are awaiting a DPG.  One gentleman is at home and cannot shower.  He was told this week that funding has run out.  This is in mid-November.  He might not be able to do anything until next March or April.  This is disgraceful.  Surely there should be an emergency fund kept back for people who have had an acute stroke and are in acute need of a special downstairs shower or something like that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100036#OO00400"><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and welcome the tabling of this motion by Deputy Butler.  It is very important that we take time in this House to talk about what is a very pressing issue, namely, the services or, in many cases, the lack of services for older people, particularly with regard to health and social care.  Healthcare for older people is sometimes regarded as a minority aspect of the health service or an add-on when the provision of services for older people is integral to how we organise our health service and ensure that people are provided with an opportunity to live as long as possible, to live a life free from disability or chronic illness and to live with dignity.  This should be everybody's entitlement but, unfortunately, it is not.  If we are to uphold those rights, it is incumbent on Government to ensure that adequate services are available.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case to date.  Not only should older people be entitled to appropriate services provided at the appropriate time in the appropriate location, it makes significant sense for the health service generally to provide those services in an appropriate way.</p><p>This is how we ensure we have the most efficient health services available and at the same time get much better value for money.  Delayed discharges are an issue across the country.  Many people in acute hospital beds whose acute phase of treatment is complete and who are ready to go home with supports or move to a step-down facility or nursing home are awaiting physiotherapy.  At any one time over recent years there have been between 500 and 600 people in acute hospital beds who are ready to leave hospital but cannot be discharged because funding is not being provided for home care supports or step-down facilities.  In terms of health service management, this is a no-brainer yet the issue has not been addressed head on.  This is, in part, due to the manner in which the HSE operates and the way in which it has been structured by Government.  On the one hand, we have hospitals and on the other hand we have community social care services and never the twain shall meet.  They do not speak to each other and they operate under separate budgets, which is one of the reasons our health services are dysfunctional and we get poor value for money.</p> <p> Today, it was announced that funding is to be provided for an additional 550 home care packages, which is good news but it should have happened long before now.  We should not have spent the last few years with hospital beds being occupied by people who are ready to go home and all of the knock-on implications of that for older people and the operation of the hospitals.  This is not a once-off need.  The funding is welcome but this is a constant issue.  For as long as we have a dearth of supported places in the home for older people and a shortage of step-down facilities and nursing home places, we will continue to have large numbers of acute hospital beds occupied by people who are ready to be discharged.  This makes no sense.  In terms of the operation of the hospitals, when this is the case, we do not achieve the level of value of money one would expect from the use of those hospital beds to accommodate patients who come through the emergency departments or from the waiting list for elective surgery because those beds are effectively closed from the point of view of other patients.  They are inappropriately occupied, which means there are major inefficiencies within the hospitals.  It means that the normal throughput of patients, for example, admitting people for hip operations and moving them to hospital wards three or four days later to enable recovery, cannot happen and this is leading to further increases in the waiting lists.  It also leads to a shortage of beds for admissions through emergency departments, which causes blockages in emergency departments and extra beds being placed in wards and so on.  As a result of there being between 500 and 600 delayed discharges at any one time, these beds are lost to the system, with the resultant loss of value for money and inefficiencies on the part of staff and hospital management.  As I said, the announcement is welcome but we should ensure that delayed discharges are kept to a minimum on an ongoing basis.</p> <p> We do not have an entitlement to home care on a statutory basis.  This is long overdue and I welcome that work is being done in this area, albeit painfully slowly.  It makes no sense from the point of view of the patient or from a health management point of view to have a system which provides for a statutory entitlement to a nursing home place at a cost of &euro;1,300 or more per week and no similar statutory entitlement to a home care package which costs a fraction of the cost of a nursing home place.  The cost of an acute hospital bed is &euro;1,200 per night.  The cost of a nursing home place is &euro;1,200 per week and a decent home care package costs less than &euro;200 per week.  It is a no-brainer.  I do not know why we are being so inefficient and disrespectful of the wishes and best interests of older people who find themselves in this position.  </p> <p> It is welcome that funding is being provided for delayed discharges and additional home care packages.  However, there are many older people in their 70s, 80s or 90s who are living at home and are infirm and becoming less mobile, very often with nobody to look after them, who have never been in the hospital system and are not in the hospital delayed discharges category but are waiting on home care packages.  Currently, there are 6,287 people on waiting lists for home care packages.  This is an indictment of Government policy.  As public representatives, we deal daily with people whose sight or mobility is severely impaired and who are at high risk of falling.  Despite having been assessed and deemed to be in urgent need of a home care package, they are place on a waiting list.  As I said, there are currently over 6,000 people in this category.  The longer they remain without support in their homes, the more likely they are to fall or burn themselves and end up in emergency departments.  This is one of the drivers of the high number of presentations at emergency departments, particularly in winter.  Again, this issue could be addressed by joined up thinking in this area.  We must ensure that there are services available to support people to remain in their homes, where they have the best health outcomes and we achieve the best value for money.</p> <p> What is happening in regard to home help services and home care organisations is a disgrace.  There is now a race to the bottom, with community organisations that have been providing these services for years on end being sidelined in the name of privatisation.  Services are being contracted out in many cases to companies whose main interest is the profit to be made.  Meanwhile, many people who have provided excellent services to the State are being swept aside.  We will pay a huge price for this because standards and terms of employment are dropping and, most important, the quality of service being provided to older people is disimproving as a result of this trend.  This has happened in my constituency in regard to the Drumcondra Home Help and Care Services Company, with which I have engaged recently on this issue.  The HSE is being forced to consider only the bottom line rather than quality of service.  This is a disgraceful move in regard to home help services and home care services.  As I said, we will pay a huge price for this but, most important, older paying are currently paying the price for it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the thousands of people who are caring for people in their homes.  They are doing phenomenal work for families.  When the system is not delivering for them, they are too busy caring to be able to fight it.  This needs to change, in particular, as the number of people with dementia and other conditions is ever increasing.</p>  <p>  Day centres are of great benefit to carers and the people for whom they care and they should be available in every community.  There are a number of day centres in the areas surrounding Macroom but there is gap in this regard in the town, one which I have highlighted to the authorities a number of times.  For example, on the hospital grounds there is a vacant HSE building that would make an ideal day care centre. </p>  <p>  When a person leaves a job or moves to part-time employment to care for a family member that person is eligible for carer's benefit.</p><p>However, it can take anything up to 16 to 18 weeks to have the benefit approved and it is a benefit based on one's stamps.  It is not means-tested.  It should be very straightforward and approved to support carers in supporting their families at home.</p> <p> The home help service is fantastic.  When approved, people think it is great that they have it, but there is still a challenge to have it delivered on the ground.  It needs to be smoothed out and speeded up.</p></speech>

I met wonderful men and women who were supporting their wives, husbands and parents in a home setting.  It suits them to be in a familiar setting.  Some of the families receive support, while some do not.  Speaking to the outgoing chairperson, Margaret Nolan, who has been a very effective chairperson of the organisation for 14 years, reminded me of the many challenges families faced in providing care for people with dementia and how many thousands of families there were throughout the country who were selflessly caring for older relatives with very little help from the Government.  Without doubt, staying at home with the appropriate assistance and support from the State was and is the preferred option of the older people whose relatives I met last night and those to whom I speak in my constituency day after day, week after week.  They deserve dignity, respect and a choice as to where they want to live out the last years of their lives.</p>  <p>  Not only is the most humane solution to offer decent, relevant home care packages, but it also offers the best value for money for the State coffers.  The home care package introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2006 provided for the provision of the necessary financial support and help for the families who availed of it.  However, with the ageing population, the demand for packages is increasing steadily.  There is no doubt that when we look at the ESRI's figures which show the increased demand for home care packages, we must be ready to meet that demand.  It appears that geography is dictating whether families receive home care packages.  There are six CHO areas in which there is absolutely no one on the waiting list, yet in CHO 7 which covers Kildare and west Wicklow there are 992 people awaiting the provision of home support, the third highest number in the regions, with Laois not being far behind.</p>  <p>  At a public meeting I held last year the most common query from the very large crowd was about home care packages.  Some attendees were very distressed and older people who spoke about how difficult life was as a carer with no Government support.  They also queried the length of time it took to process applications for carer's allowance.  That is one of the most common queries I receive.  People's lives and health, physical, mental and emotional, are being impacted on by the backlog and delays in the processing system.  We believe funding allocated to older people to enable them to remain at home provides the best value and the fairest, most dignified result for older people.  We need to make real progress in dealing with this issue.  </p>  <p>  I thank my colleague, Deputy Butler, for bringing forward the motion.</p></speech>

In my constituency there are now more than 16,000 people over that age, accounting for one in eight of the population of Louth and the coastal area of Meath.  I acknowledge the good work that has been done and the great initiatives undertaken, be it by HSE staff or voluntary organisations such as Good Morning Louth, meals on wheels and the community alert scheme.  There are also great examples of sheltered housing, including Moorehall Lodge and Great Northern Haven, a local institute which uses virtual care accommodation and technology to provide a service for older people.</p>  <p>  All that said, the reality is that if someone is sick or old at the weekend, he or she must wait.  A person cannot be sick between Friday and Monday.  There is a crisis looming.  There is an over-reliance on nursing home care.  We all know that it is the preference of those who are ageing to remain in their own home, with adequate support available to allow it to happen.  However, the complete dearth of options between independent living and nursing care must be addressed.  Funding for home care packages needs to be increased.  My office is constantly frustrated at the number of calls received about people blocking beds needlessly because a package has not been put in place.  I am aware that the Government is introducing an additional 550 home care packages, but the reality is that there are 680 waiting for such a package in my area alone.</p>  <p>  I support Fianna F&aacute;il's motion.  A famous lady by the name of Eartha Kitt said ageing had a wonderful beauty, for which we should have respect.  I urge the House to show respect for the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100038#QQ00400"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Butler, for bringing forward this timely, appropriate and important motion.  Since the home care package was introduced by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in 2006, there has been a significant rise in its uptake, and for good reason.  Everyone, regardless of age, prefers to be at home, particularly when he or she is at his or her most vulnerable.  It behoves us, as legislators, to ensure this is possible, yet there are 107 people waiting in Cork South-West for home care support.  Some 610 patients are eligible for a hospital discharge, but there is nowhere for them to go.  It has reached the stage where constituents of mine are advising the discharge teams in Cork University Hospital, CUH, that they cannot take their loved ones home without a plan being in place.  They are aware of the fact that the moment they go through the revolving door of the hospital with their loved one, the supports required will not be in place to facilitate a smooth transition, be it short-term respite care or returning to the family home to provide long-term care.</p>  <p>  I note the intention to provide an additional 550 home care packages to cope with the winter trolley crisis.  That number falls short of the 610 awaiting discharge from hospitals.  With respect, I ask the Minister of State to simply get on with it, put this system in place and ensure the announcement will not be like many others but rather ensure this will one come to fruition.  As an aside, my office is constantly fielding calls from concerned relatives who are experiencing great difficulties in accessing information on home care services.  With this in mind, the Minister of State can imagine my surprise when I received a call this morning advising that the HSE-funded West Cork Carers Support Group located in Bantry would close at the end of 2018.  It has been a huge crutch for so many carers in recent decades.  How can any Minister who is serious about improving supports for home care service users and others, specifically the people who are saving the State thousands by caring for their loves ones, turn it around and dispense with such a vital service?</p>  <p>  I have an awful lot more to say about this issue, but, as unfortunately, some of my colleagues ran a little over time, I will sit down to allow in the last Deputy.</p></speech>

They can often be put under extreme pressure to meet the extensive care needs of the older people for whom they are caring owing to unreasonable expectations and unrealistic time constraints.  Will the Minister of State take note of this and liaise with those in the relevant management positions within the HSE to ensure their staff on the ground will be managed as efficiently as possible to avoid incidents where a home care worker can only spend five minutes with the person he or she visits at the end of the day due owing the fact that he or she may have run over time in visiting other service users earlier in the day.  The people working on the ground are passionate about their jobs and have a strong vocation which the Government must support and facilitate.  I have always believed the funding allocated to enable older people to remain at home provides not only the best value but also the most humane result for older people.  Many thousands of families help their loved ones to stay at home when they are ill or very frail and receive very little assistance from the State.  This needs to change, especially to deal with the growing challenge presented in delivering dementia care services.</p>  <p>  Real progress must be made in meeting the challenge presented in providing home care which is the preferred option of older people.  It is well acknowledged that care provided in the home is vital in keeping people active in their communities which has enormous health benefits.  The importance of the provision of home care cannot be emphasised enough.</p><p>It keeps older people in their homes and in the home environment.  It is a proven fact that this saves the State and taxpayers large sums of money compared with either private or public nursing homes.  More important, it prevents the holding up of beds in hospitals that are badly needed in accident and emergency departments.  It also reduces the use of trolleys, which is an epidemic at present.  I call on the Minister of State to continue to finance home care to the greatest possible extent with whatever funding can be made available.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100039#RR00200"><p>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who had to leave.  In his opening statement the Minister of State agreed with many of the sentiments expressed in the motion.  It reflects work that is, hopefully, well under way.  It is one of the great success stories of our age that so many more people are living for much longer.  The success achieved in recent decades in improving health and extending life expectancy should be acknowledged and celebrated.  However, without doubt, our ageing population poses significant challenges, and those challenges need to be recognised and addressed across a wide range of areas.  This includes ensuring that the best possible health and social services are in place to meet the changing needs of people as they age.</p>  <p>  To the Opposition Deputies and those that have already spoken, I speak as someone who had an elderly mother who was cared for at home by my two brothers.  I know only too well how important family is in times of need in respect of elderly people.  Not every family, unfortunately, can have that service at home so they rely on services from the community as well.  Home supports are crucial to helping older people, and people of all ages with particular care needs, to remain where they want to be, namely, at home in the surroundings with which they are most familiar and comfortable.  Regarding resources, the HSE will spend approximately &euro;420 million on home care packages in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I recognise some of the issues raised and also that most Deputies spoke in support of the 550 home care support packages that will be available for winter time.  That is a step in the right direction.  I acknowledge, however, that the process of approving carer's allowance application is taking a long time and we need to speed it up.  I receive many calls on this issue.  I agree with Deputy Shortall on the support provided by community care services and other organisations on the ground that do so much with so little acknowledgement.  One of those in my area, the Mother McAuley centre in Drimnagh, deals with elderly people every day.  I acknowledge the work done at the centre, not only by the people from the community who run the service but also the many volunteers.  </p>  <p>  Many more of our older people with complex care needs are now being maintained at home, leading to increased demand for additional levels of service and for services outside of core hours from Monday to Friday.  We want to develop home care services and we are working to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people.  Demand for community services is rising as more people are supported in their homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.  The HSE funds a range of community supports aimed at supporting older people at a cost of approximately &euro;300 million annually.  These include short-stay beds, day care centres, meals on wheels and other services.  </p>  <p>  As I indicated, the Government agrees with many aspects of the motion.  Our health care system must acknowledge that older people by and large prefer to stay at home for as long as they can.  We are already looking at how that preference can be facilitated and supported.  It is critical that the appropriate supports are in place to match each person's needs at whatever point he or she is at in his or her interaction with the healthcare system.  This means providing a range of flexible supports focused on prevention and early intervention and providing the greater portion of care in the community.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge again the contributions of many Deputies on this matter.  I give my full support to finding solutions for the many issues raised by all of the speakers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, told me before he left that he will also support the motion.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Butler for giving me some time.  We have a major difficulty in Roscommon.  The community healthcare organisation, CHO 2, area, covers a population of 475,000 in counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.  There are 1,246 people in the area waiting on a home care package, which is shocking considering it is one of the smaller areas.</p>  <p>  Per head of population, my county of Roscommon has the highest rate of Alzheimer's disease in the country.  It also has a large elderly population.  We need to get home care packages in place without delay.  As Deputy Breathnach pointed out, the number of people aged 65 and over is projected to increase from one in eight to one in six of the population by 2030.  The number of people aged 85 and over is projected to almost double by 2030.  There will also be a major increase in the number of people with dementia in the coming decades.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has forecast increased demand for home care of up to 66% by 2030 relative to 2015.  </p>  <p>  Why is the Government not taking this matter seriously?  We must address it.  I will cite one example that involves a constituent of mine whom we will call "Kay".  I have lodged appeals on Kay's behalf numerous times and she has been unsuccessful in securing a home support package.  She has undergone many reviews and has been on the waiting list for a service since September 2017.  Her family are anxious that she secure a long-term home care package as she would like to continue to live at home.  I understand Kay received approval for three hours of home support but resources were not available at the time.  Unfortunately, she is still waiting for home care to this day.  She has mobility issues, is diabetic, suffers blackouts and is in the early stages of dementia.  She is a 73 year old lady who, in the words of her general practitioner, GP, is in dire need of a carer.  She lives in a remote area with her son but he works some distance away and is not with her during the day.  She suffered numerous falls over the past year and is on many different medications, as is made clear in the GP's letter to which I referred.  That is the best way to describe the crisis we have in our system.  We have to deal with the issue.  While I welcome the more than 500 home care packages announced by the Minister today, more than 220 of them are needed in County Roscommon at this very moment.  These packages are appreciated but they will do little to bring down the waiting lists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100039#RR00900"><p>I thank everyone who contributed to this constructive debate.  In my opening comments, I expressed hope that it would be constructive because that is what is needed.  All our constituency offices are inundated with constituents who are trying to secure home supports for elderly relatives.  I warmly welcome the Government's decision to support the motion.  There was not one dissenting voice among all the Deputies who spoke.   There was cross-party support and it is not often we see that.  Some history might have been thrown in but I am only concerned about the present, the here and now, and the 6,287 people who are unable to avail of home supports.</p>  <p>  I have some concerns.  I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated that the cynic in him was a little surprised when he saw the reports this morning indicating that 550 extra home care packages were to be provided.  I am not a cynical person, so when I saw the news this morning I welcomed it.  It is very important.  As part of budget 2019, &euro;10 million has been made available to the HSE for home supports during the winter period, with a special focus on those aged over 75.  We warmly welcome that.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health immediately sanctioned &euro;5 million to support an additional 300 home support packages.  The other 250 packages will come in the months ahead.  Unfortunately, we do not have time because the health service is overloaded.  Every day, 300, 400 or 500 people are on trolleys.  There are 610 people in the acute hospital system who cannot be released into community care or the care of their loved ones because they do not have home care supports.  This year alone, 135,000 bed days will be lost in the system because of late discharges.</p><p>I welcome that there will be 550 additional packages in the months ahead but the measure is too bland.  We really need definition in this and, as people always say, the devil is in the detail.  There is not enough detail there.  We really must deal with the issues.</p> <p> Deputy Harty made some very good points on supporting housing options, and we must consider different housing options.  There is a model of support in the south east that has low intensity community care homes.  For example, in St. Carthage's in Lismore there is a home where 42 people live.  They have meals provided, laundry sorted and companionship.  They get their medication every day.  Nevertheless, they still live independently in a home care setting.  That is something we will have to consider as this model could be rolled out throughout the country.  It works extremely well for bachelors or older people who may not have family any more but who do not want to live in rural isolation.</p> <p> I know the following does not come under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, but rather the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  He mentioned it.  The timely processing of carer's allowance applications is a major issue and it now takes up to 20 weeks to have an application processed.  It is really causing a blockage.  If there is an appeal, a person could be waiting for another 20 weeks.  It is another reason for the system being blocked.</p> <p> We must really see movement on the rolling out of the single assessment tool for the assessment of care needs.  It has been too slow, and although it has been piloted in some constituencies, it has not been rolled out everywhere.  The figures have 6,287 people waiting for home care supports, with 674 waiting in Galway but nobody waiting in Kilkenny.  The same statistics must apply to each community as this would make a major difference.</p> <p> Keeping people in their homes for as long as possible delivers better results, as everybody here acknowledged.  Everybody supported the motion.  Older people who get to live in their homes, surrounded by friends, families and neighbours, do better than those who live in nursing homes.  I will hold the Minister to account on the 550 home care packages promised today.  If those packages could be made available immediately, it would make some difference to the 610 people in the acute hospital setting who cannot be released into their communities and to their families.  If they were released from the acute setting, we might not have as many people on trolleys tomorrow, next week or next month.  I thank everybody for their constructive support today and I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

This agreement was reached at negotiator level on 14 November 2018 and includes the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which forms an integral part of it.  After almost 20 months of intensive and difficult negotiations, I ask the House to join me in welcoming this agreement and also the outline of the joint political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  It is an agreement that fully secures the negotiating objectives we set out at the start.  Most important, it fully protects the Good Friday Agreement and ensures the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I am pleased that Prime Minister May has secured her Cabinet&rsquo;s approval for the draft agreement.  On Sunday, President Tusk will convene a meeting of the European Council with a view to it formally endorsing the draft withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the joint political declaration on the future relationship.</p><p>It is worth restating that we have always said that we regret the decision of the UK to leave the European Union.  The United Kingdom is our closest neighbour and our friend.  We are bound together by geography and centuries of shared history, culture, kinship and trade.  We deeply regret that the UK chose to leave the European Union, a Union which, together, we have helped to shape over the past 45 years.  However, we respect the vote of the British people.  We also regret that the British Government has ruled out ongoing membership of the EU customs union, Single Market and the European Economic Area, thus limiting the scope for a solution.  Nevertheless, we respect the decision to do so.</p><p>At the outset, we agreed our unique concerns and identified our priorities for the negotiations and these have stayed constant throughout.  These are protecting the peace and the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the common travel area and its associated benefits for citizens, minimising the impact on our trade, jobs and our economy and reaffirming our place at the heart of a strong and prosperous European Union.  On each of these priorities, we have reached a satisfactory outcome.  From the very start, we worked to ensure our unique concerns were understood by our EU partners, the member states and the EU institutions.</p><p>As Taoiseach, I have had formal bilateral meetings with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Finland, Estonia, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia either in Dublin or in their capitals to emphasise these issues.  I have also met many times with the presidents of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission, as well as the chief EU negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, and the head of the European Parliament Brexit steering group.  I have used the EPP network of sister parties of Fine Gael as well to Ireland&rsquo;s advantage.  The House will know that Presidents Juncker, Tusk and Tajani, Mr. Michel Barnier and Chancellor Merkel are both interlocutors and party colleagues.  I have attended 11 formal and informal meetings of the European Council, as well as many other international meetings where I have engaged with EU leaders to explain and to contextualise our unique concerns and to ensure that our priorities were taken on board.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, and their predecessors have traversed the Continent to engage with relevant EU counterparts.  Other Ministers have met their counterparts and at official level there have been extensive and detailed consultations.  I thank all concerned for their hard work and personal commitment, especially officials in my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the permanent representation in Brussels and our ambassadors and diplomats on the ground in member state capitals.  I recognise the Members of this House who have played their part in helping to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns were communicated and understood through party and interparliamentary networks.  All these efforts have been reflected in the series of European Council guidelines, Commission communications and European Parliament resolutions, as well as in speeches and statements by EU leaders across Europe.</p><p>They have taken Ireland's concerns to heart and have made them European concerns and priorities for the EU negotiators.</p> <p> At the core of these concerns lies our awareness of the tragic history of violence in Northern Ireland and in Ireland and Britain.  After 20 years of relative peace, we are determined to ensure that there can be no return to the past, so the Government has been determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement, an internationally and legally binding agreement, in all its parts.  The absence of a hard border has been critical to what has been achieved North-South and the development of the all-island economy and practical co-operation in areas like education, health, infrastructure and tourism.  We have insisted that there can be no going back on this and no new barriers to the movement of people or commerce.</p> <p> The draft withdrawal agreement provides that, in the event that it is required after the period of transition, the UK and the EU will establish a shared customs territory.  Northern Ireland will apply some additional rules for goods and ensure there would be no need for a hard border between North and South.  To facilitate this and to ensure that there can be no unfair competitive advantage, the agreement also provides that, if the backstop is invoked, rules to ensure a level playing field in areas such as environment, state aid and labour standards will apply.  The Union's customs code will apply to Northern Ireland so that businesses there do not face obstacles in accessing the Single Market for goods, including here, south of the Border.  Northern Ireland business will continue to enjoy unfettered access to the Great Britain market as well as that of the whole of the European Union.</p> <p> The text says that, if this backstop would apply, it should apply "unless and until" alternative arrangements are found to supersede it that make it no longer necessary in part or in full.  It is therefore intended to be temporary and to act as a bridge to a future relationship.  As I have said many times before, I hope and believe that those alternative arrangements will be negotiated.  It is, however, important that we now have the insurance policy we need if all other efforts fail to produce a better solution.  The agreement also provides a mechanism for review of the backstop, which would allow it to cease to apply, in whole or in part, if and when a better solution was agreed that superseded it. </p> <p> It is important to underscore that any such decision will be a joint one for the European Union and the United Kingdom to take together.  Therefore, the agreement says that there can be no unilateral withdrawal from the backstop if it is ever activated.</p> <p> The draft withdrawal agreement contains other important commitments and assurances regarding the Good Friday Agreement, closer North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  Once again I would like to say that we have no hidden agenda or motivation here and the draft withdrawal agreement states in black and white that Ireland and the European Union fully respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, and that this can change only if the majority of people in Northern Ireland vote for it to change.  It ensures that there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, and it recognises the right of people in Northern Ireland to identify as Irish, become Irish citizens and, therefore, be European citizens as well.</p> <p> It also ensures that Ireland and the UK can continue to operate the common travel area.  This means that the arrangements that have enabled us to live, work, study and access services in each other's countries as though we are citizens of both will continue into the future.  It confirms that the single electricity market will be maintained on the island of Ireland and confirms that PEACE and INTERREG funding will continue.  This is really important for Northern Ireland and for the Border counties.</p> <p> It is important to note that the UK agrees that it will facilitate the transit of goods moving to and from Ireland.  This is significant, as the UK landbridge is the most important route from Ireland to mainland Europe and, of course, Ireland is a landbridge to Great Britain for a lot of exporters in Northern Ireland.  The agreement provides a basis on which we can avoid a hard Brexit, which would see the United Kingdom crash out of the European Union without an agreement.</p> <p> If it secures the necessary endorsement in Westminster next month and the consent of the European Parliament, there will be a period of transition, which will run until at least to the end of December 2020.  As we approach the end of this period of transition, the UK will be empowered to ask for the period of transition to be extended - on one occasion - if agreement on a future relationship that would avoid a hard border is not yet in place.</p> <p> I have acknowledged the integrity of Prime Minister May in honouring her promise to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and her commitment, despite the many difficulties along the way, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  For our part, we have consistently said that we are absolutely committed to working with Prime Minister Mary and the UK Government to secure a deep, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship between the UK and the European Union so that the backstop does not need to be invoked in full or in part.</p> <p> I would also like to take this opportunity to express again my deep appreciation and gratitude to all of our EU partners - my fellow members of the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.  They have understood our unique concerns and made them their concerns, and they have shown unwavering solidarity in ensuring that these have been taken into account in the draft withdrawal agreement.  Many people predicted that, in the final moment, our European partners would turn on us or put pressure on us.  That did not happen.  We have had unwavering solidarity and support throughout.</p> <p> In particular, I want to acknowledge the commitment and professionalism of Michel Barnier, Sabine Weyand and their team, with whom we have worked extremely closely over the past 20 months.  There could be no better example of the advantages of EU membership for a small country.  Sometimes, when people calculate the value of EU membership, they talk about how much we pay into the budget and how much we get out, but the intangible benefits of being part of the largest free trade area in the world and a single currency, and the intangible benefits of solidarity among 27 member states, are incalculable and enormous.  We have seen that demonstrated for Ireland in recent months, so no matter what happens anywhere else, Ireland will stay a fully committed member of the European Union.  It is a home that we have built together and it is where we will stay.</p> <p> The draft agreement represents a finely balanced compromise between the concerns and priorities of all 28 countries involved.  Finalising and approving it is the best way of ensuring an orderly withdrawal.  I will attend the special meeting of the European Council in Brussels this Sunday, 25 November.  I hope and expect that EU leaders will be in a position there to sign off on the draft withdrawal agreement and the joint political declaration.  It is my sincere wish that the withdrawal agreement will then receive the necessary approval of both Westminster and the European Parliament.  It represents a good outcome for Ireland, for the EU as a whole and for the UK itself.  It protects people's jobs and the economy and defends the rights and freedoms of our citizens.</p> <p> I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100041#TT00200"><p>As the Taoiseach has said, Ireland and the UK share profound and strong ties across many areas, which have benefitted greatly from both countries' membership of the EU.  There could never in my view, therefore, be a positive outcome to our closest neighbour and friend leaving a European Union that we joined together in 1973.  That remains the case today.  While we respect the UK vote, we think it is bad for Britain, we think it is bad for Europe and we think it is bad for Ireland, too.</p>  <p>  Since the decision was taken in 2016, however, and even before it was reached, the Government has sought to ensure that we in Ireland can minimise the negative impact of Brexit for this island.  We have had clear objectives throughout, centring on protecting our peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and our common travel area and avoiding any return to the borders or tensions of the past.</p>  <p>  We could not expect that all EU governments would be familiar with the detail of these concerns, but we felt that they would listen.  In truth, they have gone on to do so much more than that.  Prime Ministers and foreign Ministers took the time to visit the Border for themselves and to see how it facilitated peace, North-South co-operation and our all-island economy in terms of how it functions today.  The solidarity that flowed from these visits and meetings became a powerful shared bond across the 27 states in Brussels.  Michel Barnier channelled that shared outlook with determination, great skill and subtlety throughout.  He has been a formidable chief negotiator for the EU and for Ireland, leading a highly talented team that we have got to know very well.</p>  <p>  Over the past two years, the complexity of the United Kingdom's departure from the EU and the scale of the challenge it presents have become only too clear.  The draft withdrawal agreement that has been achieved by both sets of negotiators represents real compromise by both sides.  It provides the best way of ensuring that the UK's departure can happen in an orderly manner, avoiding the UK crashing out, with all of the severe consequences that would undoubtedly bring.</p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement covers all elements of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>This includes the protection of UK and EU citizens&rsquo; rights as well as protecting the current EU budget.  It provides for the orderly winding down of current arrangements across the broad spectrum of EU co-operation as well as the governance structures for the implementation of the agreement.  It also includes protocols on Gibraltar and the British sovereign bases in Cyprus.</p> <p> The agreement provides for a period of transition up to December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK.  This will allow for the negotiation of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK which we hope will be deep and comprehensive.  The transition period should also provide certainty to citizens and businesses as we continue our preparations for a new relationship with the UK outside the EU.  It is welcome that the agreement now includes an option to extend this transition if more time is needed to complete negotiations and conclude a future agreement, something I have long argued would be necessary in time.</p> <p> Crucially, this draft agreement meets Ireland&rsquo;s key objective of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, with a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to address issues specific to this island.  The protocol underpins in a dynamic way continued North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It acknowledges the common travel area whereby Irish and British people can live, work, study and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions.  In many ways, the common travel area has almost become a mutual recognition of citizenship on these islands.  The agreement includes important commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement and confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens.  This will remain a significant priority for the Government throughout the Brexit process.  We will do our utmost to ensure that the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland are protected to the fullest possible extent.</p> <p> The withdrawal agreement provides for continued support for the North-South PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes.  It also preserves the single electricity market which is crucial for the interests of Northern Ireland in particular, but also for the island as a whole.  Vitally, nothing in the agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is explicitly laid out in the very first clause of the first article of the protocol and it is there for good reason.  Most importantly, the protocol includes a backstop to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border on this island in all circumstances.  The backstop is an insurance policy which we hope will never be used.  It remains our priority to achieve a future EU-UK agreement that can in its own right maintain an open border while protecting North-South co-operation and our all-island economy.  The withdrawal agreement itself includes a so-called best endeavours clause that commits both sides to pursuing this aim.</p> <p> Over the next two years we will be working closely with our EU partners to meet that commitment.  However, if this is not possible within that time, the draft agreement provides for the transition period to be extended once, for a limited time.  If there is no subsequent agreement at the end of transition, then the backstop can apply.  The UK-wide customs territory which would apply under the backstop will involve no tariffs or quotas and includes well-established rules with regard to ensuring a level playing field.  Northern Ireland would remain aligned to the rules of the Single Market that are indispensable to avoiding a hard border.  The only exception to those measures is fishing because there is recognition on both sides that a detailed negotiation is required to get a future relationship agreement on fishing that is balanced and fair.</p> <p> A review mechanism for the backstop allows that these provisions can cease to apply, in whole or part, once a better solution has been found.  The agreement makes clear, however, that this decision cannot be taken unilaterally but must be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.  This translates the UK&rsquo;s political commitment to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland into a legal guarantee.  I pay tribute to Prime Minister May in following through in full on the important commitments she made last December and again last March to this island as a whole.</p> <p> The focus now is on ensuring that the agreement will be endorsed by a special meeting of the European Council on Sunday, 25 November, together with a political declaration on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship.  It is hoped we will see the text of that declaration later this evening.  The European Parliament will also have to provide its consent before the EU formally concludes the withdrawal agreement.  At the same time, the UK must ratify the agreement according to its own constitutional arrangements.  All going well, and I accept that is a significant caveat, from 30 March 2019 we will start the considerable work of negotiating a comprehensive and deep future relationship.  Our goal has always been for the closest possible relationship between Britain and Ireland and between the UK and the EU.  The draft political declaration expresses the hope of all sides that the future relationship will be as deep and comprehensive as possible.  In doing this of course, we must also maintain the integrity of the EU Single Market.</p> <p> Unfortunately however, as we know very well, developments over the coming weeks cannot be taken for granted.  Therefore the Government continues to advance extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work across all Departments and State agencies.  This addresses the full range of Brexit scenarios to make sure Ireland is ready no matter what may come in the future.  The Government has focused on preparedness measures needed on an east-west basis, preparing our ports and airports.  The first phase of a recruitment programme of approximately 1,000 staff for customs and sanitary and phyto sanitary, SPS, controls, in addition to information and communications technology, ICT, and infrastructure measures, is already underway.  This initial phase of recruitment will see staff in place by the end of March next year.  The intention is that further recruitment will take place during the transition period.  Planning is also in place to allow for these measures to be accelerated or adapted in the event of no deal.</p> <p> In a number of key areas, it will be at the EU level that the appropriate response and mitigation will be needed.  We have also actively engaged with the European Commission and its Brexit preparedness unit on areas where the lead policy role lies with the EU.  We are working closely with the Commission and other affected member states to ensure continued effective use of the UK land bridge, for instance.  This includes preparing EU ports to facilitate transit of EU products through the UK once they leave the EU.  In Ireland, a cross-departmental land bridge project group, chaired by my Department, co-ordinates our approach.  This is a priority given the importance of getting Irish products to market in Europe, particularly agrifood products.  This work is intensifying and I am glad to say that good progress is being made.  The importance has been recognised and agreed in the protocol to the draft withdrawal agreement which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate efficient and timely transit.  I welcome the UK&rsquo;s formal notification of its intention to join the common transit convention which would play an important role in ensuring Irish access to the EU using the UK as a land bridge.</p> <p> In our last two budgets we announced a wide array of supports for business.  To better inform business and the public at large, the Government has also overseen a co-ordinated communication and outreach campaign through the Brexit website, social media and public events.  The getting Ireland Brexit ready public information campaign has seen very successful outreach events held throughout October in Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin, with further events this week in Limerick and next week in Letterkenny.</p> <p> We are grateful for the support and advice received from all sides of the House.  We need to sustain this effort now.  Leaders and spokespersons with sister parties in the UK need to ensure our British colleagues are fully seized of the protections for this island and our peace process in the agreement under consideration.</p><p>I am on the record as stating that parties with a vote in these landmark decisions should use that franchise in the interests of all the people on this island.  As Theresa May has acknowledged, these are now difficult days as she tries to gain support in the House of Commons for this hard-won deal that has taken two years to put together.  We can only hope the arguments which hold sway in the coming weeks are economic ones and practical ones that are aware of our shared history rather than forgetful of what we have overcome together.  The support of this House for the draft withdrawal agreement, I am sure, will send a strong signal ahead of the European Council meeting on Sunday that Ireland is fully behind this deal, and I therefore ask the D&aacute;il to support this motion.</p> <p> I know there are two amendments to the motion the Government has proposed.  On the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment in particular, while I agree with the sentiment and the words in it, I do not think it is helpful for us to take away from the core message we are trying to send from this House, which is that we support the text of the withdrawal agreement that was agreed last week by the British Government and the EU negotiating team.  It is time that we kept our message simple and clear, and we have, I hope, all-party support for that text of last week.  Of course, parties could add a lot to it in terms of emphasising points.  We could have written a much longer motion, outlining many of the things in the motion that I have outlined and the Taoiseach has outlined in his speech, but I think that potentially loses the opportunity that we have tonight to be crystal clear on one message.  That message has to be that the withdrawal agreement text of last week is fully supported across all parties in this D&aacute;il.  I ask parties to support us, please, in that singular effort, rather than looking to add to this motion, making points that are understandable and valid, but in a way that takes away from the clarity of what we are trying to achieve in terms of a clear, simple statement from Ireland that we fully support the text that was agreed last week and that we are encouraging others to do the same.</p></speech>

If things go as well as possible, the withdrawal treaty will be agreed and will then go forward to the United Kingdom and European Parliaments for ratification.  While this would be very welcome, it is important that we do not waste this rare, full debate on Brexit by ignoring the fact that not only is the short-term outcome uncertain, there is still no clarity on many long-term issues.  Even more importantly, Ireland is today well behind where it should be in preparing for the inevitable impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  A fully agreed and ratified withdrawal treaty will be, at best, the end of the beginning.  We will still potentially face years of negotiations and damaging uncertainty.  As we saw last year, overemphasising interim agreements, however welcome they may be, breeds a damaging complacency.  It serves no useful purpose for us to waste our time here commenting on the ignorant and clownish behaviour of some Brexiteers.  In meetings in different contexts, I have experienced the Brexit advocacy of certain of the loudest Tory Europhobes.  It is clear they have no interest in rational discussion.  Just like fundamentalists of all varieties, the more their ignorance is exposed, the more fanatical they are in their advocacy.  I would go so far as to say that we have, as a country, spent too much time in the past two years feeling indignant about the dishonesty and ignorance of many Brexiteers.  Some of this time and space would have been better spent on a more questioning approach to our national preparations for Brexit.  There is simply no way of looking at the hard facts of preparations and missing the gap between the rhetoric and the reality.</p>  <p>  The motion before the House will have no legal impact.  The position of the majority in this House is well known and we are not in a position to ratify a text which has not been finalised or sent for ratification.  It is the explicit policy of Government that the D&aacute;il does not give it a negotiating mandate as we have seen in the Government&rsquo;s dismissal of the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s views on matters such as the Middle East.  In spite of this, we will of course be supporting the motion and we have already expressed our support for the draft text in our discussions with our European partners.  I agree with the T&aacute;naiste in terms of giving a simple message from the House.  It was my understanding that it was to be a simple motion.  We could all table amendments, emphasising this and aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and so on, but I think there has been an attempt just to support withdrawal treaty as negotiated &ndash; the draft agreement.  I think that is the intention of this motion, that there would be unanimity from this House that we support this text, that is, the withdrawal treaty.</p></speech>

It is his position that we should rely only on the opinion of the EU&rsquo;s legal service, something which will not be available until the text has been sent to the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  It appears that there are significant practical issues over what checks would and would not be required for North-South trade under the proposed arrangements post 2020.  Equally, the draft agreement does not include text on a range of issues which have to be sorted before the customs arrangement in the backstop could be implemented.  We understand that Michel Barnier&rsquo;s team has mentioned this in presentations and it has already been raised by the Parliament&rsquo;s Brexit committee as a concern.</p>  <p>  We obviously do not have the type of legal expertise available to us to assess whether the text is as certain as the claims being made for it.  Regardless of whether the text delivers on what is claimed for it, it is politically and economically a welcome and essential step forward and its ratification would mark real good faith towards delivering on its claims.</p>  <p>  If there are practical agreements required after next March, such as the road transport agreement, which is a fundamental requirement of a single customs territory, it is reasonable to assume that these will be addressed as a priority.</p>  <p>  There were reports last night and again this morning that Prime Minister May is proposing an amendment concerning the backstop which may satisfy the less revolutionary Brexiteers in her party.  Without any concrete details on this we are not in a position to comment, though we expect that there will be no agreement to any amendment which would in practice make the backstop unusable.</p>  <p>  It appears to us to be a balanced text where the European Union&rsquo;s negotiators went to the very limit of their mandate to show flexibility and to help London address its self-imposed preconditions.  They did this in a highly professional and creative way.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the regular, comprehensive and professional information and briefings which my party has received from Michel Barnier and his team since their appointment.  His commitment to Ireland and to the European Union has been both resolute and fair.  We particularly welcome the fact that he considered technical suggestions from a wide range of sources.</p>  <p>  Should the text change significantly this weekend, we will not be looking for issues to cause controversy.  If the core principles of seeking to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the European Union are maintained, we will continue our unmatched, nearly 60 year record of choosing a European future for Ireland.</p>  <p>  I want to address a series of urgent issues linked directly to Brexit on which we need to act.  Before doing this, it is important to comment on a number of political matters.  From very soon after the start of 2013 when David Cameron announced his disastrous decision to hold an in-or-out referendum, this has been an issue regularly addressed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Unlike the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il did not wait until mid-2016 to call for preparations.  In fact it has been one of the most prominent and regular issues addressed by Fianna F&aacute;il for more than five years, including the period of the Cameron government&rsquo;s absurd review of EU competencies and its campaign to renegotiate European Union treaties.</p>  <p>  Since the referendum, Fianna F&aacute;il has been actively constructive.  During the appearances of key EU leaders in Dublin, in meetings in Brussels and in wider political contexts, we have made it absolutely clear that there is a broad pro-EU, anti-Brexit consensus among the Irish population and the majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>We have also gone further than this in specifically assuring the Council, the Commission and Parliament of the stable support of the majority for the negotiating objectives which were first set out by Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach with the support of the D&aacute;il and which have been reaffirmed since then.  When the Government starting briefing that it might need to call an election to have a mandate for Brexit discussions we responded to European inquiries and confirmed our consistent position that nothing would be done to question this mandate or to bring down the Government at critical moments.  Having checked with parties in other countries, I can confirm that the Irish Government is the only one of the many minority governments in Europe to have been offered a guarantee from the largest Opposition party that it will maintain its mandate during this critical phase of Brexit negotiation. </p> <p> In the context of five years of addressing the issue, constant affirmation of a consensus on the key issues, and active lobbying for the Irish position, we will take no lectures about stability or responsible behaviour on Brexit from a government which has regularly sought to project instability.  The Government has received far more backing and active support than any other government in Europe yet we have seen what I would regard as over-the-top and choreographed reactions to even the smallest criticisms.  The record of the House shows that any challenge from any part of the House has been denounced as irresponsible.  Always eager Fine Gael backbenchers have been sent out to amplify the message.  The fact that the first reaction to last week&rsquo;s deal was for Ministers to discuss how to trigger an election suggests a government which always puts politics first.</p> <p> It has been always our position that we all have to look beyond the crisis in hand and realise that there are many broader issues to be discussed.  The impact of Brexit on the peace settlement has quite rightly been the dominant focus of discussions here and throughout the country.  When my party, while in government, negotiated the Good Friday Agreement, we ensured that throughout the agreement membership of the European Union was used as a way of providing common ground on political, legal, economic, social, and identity issues.  Europe is in the DNA of the peace settlement because the Ahern and Blair Governments, along with John Hume, understood the European Union&rsquo;s unmatched genius at breaking down barriers and overcoming historic conflict.  However, while Europe was once a point of shared interest in Northern Irish politics, it has now become, as observed by Dr. Mary Murphy in her excellent publication, the greatest cause of division in the North over two decades.  That is a worry in terms of the impact of Brexit.</p> <p> Following next March, Northern Ireland will contain the largest number of EU citizens anywhere outside of the Union&rsquo;s borders.  The acknowledgement of the continued automatic right to EU citizenship of Northern Irish residents is a very important issue.  It is an issue which we have raised consistently since the Brexit vote and we appreciate the steadfast support which European Union states have given the country in that regard.  How the Northern Ireland-specific elements of a backstop will work is not very clear.  Mechanisms for ensuring regulatory alignment and exactly how frictionless trade will be delivered have not been fully defined and remain to be negotiated during the next two years.  However, as I have said, the withdrawal agreement demonstrates good faith and we will have to hope that discussions during the transition period get under way as soon as possible.</p> <p> What the European Union is offering Northern Ireland is a very good deal which would make it the only place in the world with guaranteed free access to the single markets of the United Kingdom and the European Union.  For the first time in its recent history, Northern Ireland would have a competitive edge to address the economic challenges which have been ignored for far too long.  This is why so many organisations in Northern Ireland which are solidly non-political have come out in favour of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p> It has been the core position of democratic parties on this island for half a century that Northern Ireland can be peaceful and prosper only if minority views are capable of being heard and taken seriously.  This applies to the minority views of those who oppose the withdrawal agreement.  We achieve nothing by condemning them or engaging in a destructive war of words.  In newspaper articles, speeches, and meetings, my party and I have sought to reach out to unionist opinion and to reaffirm the fact that the democratic majority in the D&aacute;il in no way seeks to use Brexit as a way around the unequivocal protections which unionists have under the Good Friday Agreement.  We welcome the Taoiseach and Government&rsquo;s continued affirmation of this as well.  For Northern Ireland to miss out on the European Union's generous offer would be to tragically miss an opportunity for economic development which would threaten none and benefit all.</p> <p> It is important to say that the continued absence of the Assembly and Executive has damaged Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests profoundly.  The institutions which were collapsed because of a heating scheme have been silenced at the time when they are needed the most.  It is impossible not to comment on the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in has claimed that Brexit is a defining issue of our time but has denied Northern Ireland a voice on this issue.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s most consistently anti-European Union party and has directly sought to introduce long-term constitutional issues into the Brexit discussions.  It cannot have intended to help sooth unionist fears when it announced that Brexit should be a cause for a unification referendum.  Once again, unionists should listen instead to the majority voice in this place and throughout the island which says that their constitutional position is unaffected by anything in this draft agreement and that all they are being offered is unique access to a major market, access which offers unprecedented new opportunities for investment and growth.</p> <p> In terms of the overall transition backstop and future trading relationship, what has been agreed by Michel Barnier is dramatically better for Ireland than a crash-out Brexit on World Trade Organisation terms.  He has shown creativity, generosity and flexibility towards the United Kingdom.  While the deal may be as good as it gets, people need to step back for one moment and realise that there is nothing to celebrate and that the agreement leaves in place much of the likely economic damage of Brexit.  The European Union-United Kingdom relationship is intended to be a hybrid of a customs union, free trade area, and Single Market access.  The balance within this hybrid relationship will change as time progresses and new agreements take effect.  As such, it is unclear what the exact economic impact of this deal on Ireland will be, however we do know that it will be significant and damaging.</p> <p> Based on the only independent economic impact assessment commissioned by the Government, the full implementation of the agreement will deliver a loss of between 2.8% and 4.3% of national income.  In monetary terms, and using the conservative GNI* measure, the hit to national income will be between &euro;5 billion and &euro;7.7 billion per annum.  This is over twice the size of the enormous unfunded tax promise announced by the Taoiseach at the weekend.  There has been far too little attention paid to whether we are prepared to meet an economic threat of the level of at least &euro;5 billion per year.</p> <p> As everyone knows by now, the failure to turn words into action, combined with an obsession with marketing, is a defining characteristic of this Government.  The delivery gap is acute across a wide range of policies, with policies on housing, health and critical infrastructure like broadband causing real social and economic damage.  Unfortunately, this delivery gap is also being seen with Brexit preparations.  There are many Brexit schemes, there is an increasing amount of advertising and there is a non-stop effort by Ministers to claim that everything is in hand.  Unfortunately the growing evidence is that Ireland is nowhere near Brexit-ready.  The Netherlands is the European Union member state most similar to Ireland in terms of the potential scale of Brexit impact.  It has already hired and trained 1,000 customs and related staff who will be in place on 29 March next year.  Ireland has just started the process of hiring 400 and there is no detail about when they may be trained and available.  It is absolutely clear that we will not have the staff in place to meet all eventualities next March.</p> <p> Many Brexit schemes have been announced but their impact has been minor at best.  A &euro;23 million working capital guarantee scheme was announced last year, with the European Investment Bank offering to leverage this up to &euro;300 million.  The latest available figures show that only 3% has been allocated and only 38 small and medium enterprises have been sanctioned for loans.  A Brexit future loans scheme was announced in October 2017 with the intention of providing eight to ten-year loans for market and product diversification.  This scheme has not even opened for applications yet and it is unlikely that a single company will have received funding before Brexit takes effect next March.  Other small advisory grants are being allocated at a rate of 12 companies a month and are benefitting a small number of impacted companies.  Wherever the fault for this lies, the simple fact is that Brexit supports are having only a marginal impact and all available surveys suggest critical parts of Irish business are not Brexit-ready.</p><p>According to Bord Bia which has published the most recent survey results available, 83% of companies likely to be impacted on have not yet modelled the impact of tariffs and regulatory compliance, 60% have no plans for dealing with increased costs, while 61% have no contingency plans for dealing with supply chain disruptions.  Few have plans for dealing with disruptions on the landbridge route to continental Europe.  Two thirds of companies have not begun to prepare for the trusted trader status which is central to avoiding major disruption.</p> <p> Currency fluctuations are already a reality and the devaluation of sterling is something which may continue, irrespective of whatever deal is reached.  In fact, 77% of companies included in the research state currency fluctuations are the biggest risk they face.  This has become an emergency, with nearly one in five businesses exporting to the United Kingdom stating they will face severe difficulty at the exchange rate today, while most of the rest will face severe difficulty if the value of sterling declines by up to 3% more.  Brexit is already hurting, with the Central Bank pointing to emerging problems in industrial production, including chemicals and machinery, and food export volumes down by nearly 5% because of the value of sterling.</p> <p> There is simply no doubt that we need a dramatic improvement in the implementation and impact of Brexit supports.  Much of the information activity under way should have been completed long ago, as most of the preparations needed are required, no matter what the outcome is of the transition period or the final relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  The complacency of ministerial statements about being Brexit ready must be replaced by an urgent approach of going directly to companies to aid them in starting to address key risks.  Absolutely everyone knows that 29 March is a critical date and that there are many possible outcomes.  The fevered intensity of politics at Westminster means that there are no certainties.  Ireland is simply not ready for many of the possible outcomes.</p> <p> We will support any reasonable request for urgent legislation or funding which will help to speed up the current snail pace of implementation.  It is our understanding the European Union will be flexible in providing aid which is essential to help companies and communities to address a threat of unprecedented scale, even if the draft agreement is ratified at Westminster and in Brussels.</p> <p> It is more than two years since the two Governments and the European Union agreed that the common travel area should continue.  It is welcome that this commitment has been repeated.  However, the failure to move forward with more concrete measures is a source of serious concern.  Most expert opinion points to the need for a legal approach to both formalise existing practice and manage future rights once the United Kingdom is no longer implementing common EU legislation.  Some legal experts have suggested a new Anglo-Irish treaty is required.  We need formal legal agreements on health and education, for example.  Already students from the island of Ireland and the United Kingdom face challenges in deciding on courses because of the uncertainty in fee structures.  Apparently, 20% fewer students have come to the South in this academic year.</p> <p> We need systems that will ensure ongoing consultation and the avoidance of conflict.  The common travel area is about much more than the lack of passport checks and the right of residence; it has significant fiscal and legal dimensions which have to be addressed.  For that work to be done, we should seek the establishment of a task force between Dublin and London separated from the overall Brexit negotiations.  If the withdrawal treaty is finalised and ratified, it will be an important and positive step, but it comes nowhere close to delivering a final form of Brexit for Ireland or the European Union as a whole.  It is the end of the beginning of Brexit, not the final destination which potentially will require years of further negotiations.  If it is not ratified, the first step should be an extension of the Article 50 process to avoid a cliff edge next March.  Other than that, there is no useful purpose in escalating concerns at this point.  What is for sure is that Brexit is already causing damage and will cause much more.  We need a much greater sense of urgency to close the growing gap between words and the impact on preparations for Brexit.</p></speech>

The 585 page document represents the potential for a deal, but we are not yet there.  It must be ratified at EU level and also at Westminster, a part of the process that no one is taking for granted.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit, but this deal will be positive for Ireland if it is settled.  It contains the necessary protections to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, respects the status of the Good Friday Agreement and works to address the continuance of North-South co-operation.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the good work done by our own team - the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, our diplomats and civil servants - in getting us to where we are.  We have a draft withdrawal treaty text on the table and it has taken us two years to get here.  I also acknowledge the hard work done by Michel Barnier and his team who negotiated on behalf of the EU 27 block, ensured the Irish issues were to the fore and that our concerns, particularly about the Border, were addressed.  We know that at times pressure was applied from other quarters to try to shift the focus away from the Border issue, but Mr. Barnier and his team never wavered on the issue and there was no chink in the armour to be exploited.  </p>  <p>  This is the best and fairest deal that could have been negotiated and there is no room to reopen or revisit what has been agreed to by both teams.  The European Union made a considerable concession on the Northern Ireland protocol, the backstop, by agreeing to a UK-wide customs territory.  When the idea was first mooted, it was rejected by the European Union and caused concern among some member states who wanted to ensure the United Kingdom would not have a competitive advantage post-Brexit and that we would all be operating on a level playing field.  Nonetheless, this compromise was offered by the European Union and it demonstrates its genuine and sincere wish to forge a new relationship with the United Kingdom and secure a Brexit deal that will work for everyone.</p>  <p>  One of the most important aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol is the commitment in black and white to the Good Friday Agreement.  The very first line of Article 1 of the protocol reads: "This Protocol is without prejudice to the provisions of the 1998 Agreement regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent, which provides that any change in that status can only be made with the consent of the majority of its people".  That could not be clearer.  The withdrawal treaty is not a back-door grab for territory.  Nothing within the agreement seeks to undermine the Good Friday Agreement or in any way alter the constitutional position of the United Kingdom.  That is a really important message to impress on the unionist community in Northern Ireland who are an important part of this all-island community.  Under the terms of the deal, should the Northern Ireland protocol, the backstop, ever kick into action, Northern Ireland will retain the economic benefits of EU membership, while also retaining unfettered access to the UK market.  That is a good outcome for Northern Ireland and broadly in line with my party's call that Northern Ireland be treated as a special economic zone.</p>  <p>  There is also sensible provision made for the potential extension of the transition period post-2020.  Article 3 recognises the monumental task which lies ahead, beyond ratification of the withdrawal treaty, that is, the negotiation of a future trading agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  When one considers that it took nine years to negotiate and ratify the deal between the European Union and Canada, it is very ambitious to expect that a deal can be concluded between the United Kingdom and the European Union in just 20 months; therefore, this article is welcome.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer briefly to Article 18 which states: "If the application of this Protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties liable to persist, or to diversion of trade, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate measures".  I acknowledge the assurances the T&aacute;naiste has given me in respect of the article, but it is important to flag it.  The treaty must withstand the inevitable changes in personnel across governments over time.  We need to ensure this provision will never be abused.</p>  <p>  An EU summit has been set for 25 November, but the resignations from the UK Government and the lack of support for the agreement from the Labour Party, the DUP and within the Conservative Party underscore the very difficult task ahead for the British Prime Minister.  At this point the outcome is uncertain, but it is essential that calm prevail and that every effort be made to advocate for the deal to try to get it across the line.  My party will do everything it can to advocate that it be ratified.</p></speech>

In this case a terrible beast was born, the beast of Brexit.  Sometimes it is hard to believe all of this is happening, but, as the saying goes, we are where we are and must deal with the so-called Brexit disaster as best we can.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion before the House and welcomes the draft withdrawal agreement.  I assume that it will be agreed to by the EU 27 on Sunday, despite last minute concerns expressed by Spain about the status of Gibraltar and France about fisheries.  Considerable time, effort and resources have been expended by the Government and the public administration on this issue since 2016, possibly to the neglect of other policy priorities, which is a pity.  The efforts of diplomatic officials in Brussels and Dublin in getting to this stage deserve our highest praise.</p><p>Our civil servants do exceptional work on our behalf and that should be acknowledged.  In passing, I wish to note that the offer by Fianna F&aacute;il to provide political stability until this process is finalised should not be underestimated.</p> <p> We should acknowledge the steadfast solidarity shown to Ireland by other EU states.  We appreciate the understanding of our position that they have displayed.  Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt have shown exceptional understanding of our position as well.</p> <p> I have fears for Anglo-Irish relations.  Ireland has a unique relationship with the UK economically, socially and culturally.  There has been a serious cooling in this relationship in recent years and I do not think that was necessary.  Many in this country are too young to remember the IRA campaign of violence and daily atrocities.  The Taoiseach and his Government must never allow us to return to those days again.  Brit-bashing can be popular and electorally advantageous but it is dangerous in the long term.  Far more should be done, even while these Brexit negotiations are under way, to restore Anglo-Irish relations to previous levels of co-operation and understanding.</p> <p> Our main concern should be the situation in Northern Ireland.  The draft withdrawal agreement protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects.  Therefore, it is difficult to understand the position of the DUP in all of this.  The draft withdrawal agreement makes clear that it does not provide for a change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland in the absence of consent.  A majority of citizens in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union.  The agreement offers unique opportunities for the economic development of Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland can have the best of all worlds.  Northern Ireland is different in many ways to the rest of the UK.  The differences in social legislation represent only one example.  It is unbelievable that the DUP is opposed to the agreement on ideological grounds.  The DUP would appear to be adhering to old-fashioned unionism which surely must be outdated in today's globalised and interdependent world.  One glimmer of hope is that farming organisations, tourism interests and business organisations in Northern Ireland see the positive advantages of the agreement and are making their voices heard with their MPs.  Let us hope they will be listened to.  It cannot be emphasised enough that everything possible should be done to get the Northern Ireland institutions up and running and to get normal political processes back on track.</p> <p> The exit of the UK from the EU will have more impact on Ireland than on any other EU state.  This draft withdrawal agreement offers us the best prospect of minimising the damage that could be done to our economy.  There is a real possibility that the UK will crash out with no deal.  That would be a disaster.  We would then be in uncharted waters.  The options to consider in such circumstances can be debated on another day, including the possibility of a second vote.  Let us hope that the deal now on the table succeeds.</p></speech>

This is an important motion and I hope all Members support it along with the amendment I have moved in the name of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.</p><p>Earlier this year we marked the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  It was, and remains, an agreement that, despite the challenges and difficulties that remain as a result of the partition of our country, we can collectively hold up as an illustration that tolerance and inclusivity will ultimately always triumph over division and mistrust.  The first line of the Good Friday Agreement reads: &quot;We, the participants in the multi-party negotiations, believe that the agreement we have negotiated offers a truly historic opportunity for a new beginning.&quot;  That it was.  Over the past 20 years our island has changed beyond recognition.  Children born today in Belfast, Cork, Derry, Galway or here in Dublin are born to a society that is now more prosperous, open and tolerant.  It is a society that is more confident and outward looking.  It is a country that is, in almost every respect, better.  That is because our fear and suspicion gave way to hope and because we all collectively embraced peace.  There have been ups and downs, setbacks and knocks along the way, but the trajectory has been constant.  We have moved, and we are moving, forward.</p><p>Yet, there is a problem and that problem is Brexit.  Our island's progress and our island's future did not feature as part of the debate surrounding the Brexit referendum.  Let us face it: the referendum was held primarily because of a squabble among the Tories.  Ireland was, at best and as ever, an afterthought in the minds of the English establishment.  No thought was given to our peace process, the Good Friday Agreement, the social and cultural fabric of our island or our island's shared economy.</p><p>Those on this island who voted - citizens in the North - recognised that it did not make sense for one part of our island to be inside the European Union and the other outside.  That is why the electorate in the North, from all backgrounds, by the way, voted to remain.  They did not consent to leave.  This was not due to a fawning admiration for the EU &ndash; far from it - but was driven by common sense.  Many a staunch unionist recognises that all-island trade, commerce, co-operation and movement are vital to our collective economic capacity and progress.  Citizens recognise that it makes sense for Ireland in its entirety to be part of the same trading bloc and the same Single Market.  That is what the people of the North want.  That is what the people of the South want.  That is why, since the Brexit referendum result became clear, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been unequivocal in stating that Brexit represents the most serious social, economic and political threat to our island in a generation.  It threatens to undermine the progress of the past 20 years.  It threatens to undermine the new landscape of our island.  It threatens the future of our country.</p><p>We have been clear in stating that the Government's approach to negotiations had to be guided by an appreciation of the fact that citizens in the North voted to remain and how this must be recognised and respected.  We first put the case for a special deal that would take cognisance of the unique circumstances that present on our island.  This meant ensuring no return to a hard border.  It meant ensuring that citizens' rights are explicitly protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is held up in all its parts.</p><p>Many people have been rightfully acknowledged here this evening.  I wish to recognise and appreciate the work of Michel Barnier and his colleagues.  The Barnier deal agreed last week, on which we are voting today, is not perfect.  I cannot even describe it as a good one, because the fact is there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  Brexit is bad for our island, whatever the circumstances or whatever the deal on the table.  We need to be clear on that.  However, I acknowledge that last week's deal is one that mitigates some of the worst aspects of Brexit.  There are other issues, including issues of citizens' rights, that ought to have been contained in the withdrawal agreement but do not feature.  To that end we have submitted an amendment to the motion.  It is submitted by way of additionality, not to take from the substance of the motion but to add to it.  This is because we must ensure that rights are protected.  We must ensure in practical ways that basic rights that are now taken for granted prevail into the future.  We must ensure that citizens in the North continue to have access to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.  We must ensure that citizens in the North continue to have access to third level education throughout Europe and to the EU health insurance card.</p><p>Issues pertaining to these rights and more were raised in some detail with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last week by a delegation of the four pro-remain parties in the North, namely, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party.  Our parties represent the majority view of citizens in the North.  The DUP does not.  It got it catastrophically wrong on Brexit and in the referendum debate and it has been wrong in its aftermath.  It is also wrong about the draft agreement that is now on the table.  It is disappointing and disturbing that the DUP has sought to take the side of Tory Brexiteers and UKIP over the needs and aspirations of citizens in the North and across the island.  It has decided to be reckless and irresponsible.  The truth is that ordinary citizens in the North, whether republican, nationalist, unionist, loyalist or otherwise, recognise that Brexit is not good and they want a deal that protects their livelihoods and future.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in speaks for all communities on this issue, not narrow interests.  We have consistently brought our view to Europe, the Irish Government and the British Government over the past year and a half.  When we first articulated a policy of special status for the North, some of the parties in this House accused us of grandstanding and claimed our approach was unrealistic.  It has since become the agreed EU position in negotiations.  I welcome that and acknowledge the shift in the Government&rsquo;s position.  I believe we have made an impact in that regard.  I pay particular tribute to my party colleague and Member of the European Parliament for the North of Ireland, Martina Anderson, who has been extremely active at European level in pushing all of these bottom line requirements.  </p> <p> I made the point on previous occasions that Brexit is not a temporary phase.  It has consequences that are very real, lasting and enduring.  They are for keeps and we need a solution to match, one that is lasting and not time bound or temporary.  That is why I so strenuously put the case here a fortnight ago that a temporary or transitory backstop was not a backstop at all.  Temporary protections mean no protection.  We need permanent guarantees regardless of the machinations at Westminster over the coming weeks.  There can be no backsliding from the backstop.  It must be durable, permanent and legally robust.  There must never, ever be a hard border in Ireland again.  In fact, we need to move to a point where there is no border.  In that regard, there is considerable merit in looking at the post-Brexit environment through a new lens.  In time, I believe we will collectively come to the conclusion that the real, lasting guarantee we desire is the unity of our country.  It is, I believe, safe to say that there are now many within unionism who are assessing old allegiances.  That is not to say that they are not British; they are and always will be British.  However, I believe that a significant number of people who would traditionally have staunchly opposed any notion of unity have been challenged to ponder the future.  A large number of unionists recognise the benefits of continuing and enhancing all-Ireland co-operation and breaking down barriers.  </p> <p> We are on the road to a unity referendum.  It is no longer a case of if but rather when.  Sinn F&eacute;in has made it very clear to Theresa May that, in the event of a Brexit crash-out or a no deal scenario, it will be incumbent on the British Government to put the constitutional future of the North to the people by way of a unity referendum.  The Irish Government should articulate that same position.  It should, in any event, commence a discussion with the European Commission and other institutions to explore their role and support in facilitating an efficient process of reunification.  If the people of the North are to be disregarded by London and have their futures toyed with by a British Government that has no regard for Ireland, then the people of the North should have their say.  This is a reasonable position which I believe all parties in the D&aacute;il could support.  The European Council, on 29 April 2017, agreed that in the event of national reunification the whole of our island will automatically be afforded membership of the European Union.  That is right, proper and welcome.  All options must be on the table as we shape the future.</p> <p> There are other big issues to consider.  Britain leaving the EU presents new challenges, but also a new opportunity to reassess our entire approach to Europe.  This will be important work.  If we are to be honest, we should acknowledge that the British did not decide to leave the EU for no reason.  While the Brexit debate centred in the main on immigration and became mired in racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, there are other serious matters to consider.  Hundreds of millions of citizens are disillusioned with the European Union and believe it has become removed from its citizens.  It is no longer seen by many as a vehicle for co-operation, but has become associated with elites with power and control.  We must propose and initiate radical reform.  It will not be easy, but it can be done.  A social Europe can be built, one that cherishes its citizens and which, instead of placing narrow economic interests at its core, puts people front and centre.  </p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s place is in the European Union but the EU needs to change.  We need to construct a democratic Europe and ensure that certain aspects of the current system are reformed.  We must ensure that member states have a greater say in formulating positive policy.  We want a Europe of equals, partnership and solidarity, one in which member states, in times of adversity, work together in the spirit of internationalist co-operation to collectively tackle the problems we face.  We want a union which works together to build opportunity and prosperity, one that can respond when a member state faces economic difficulties or hundreds of thousands of displaced peoples look for the assistance of a prosperous and peaceful region of the world.</p> <p> Europe can play a role as a catalyst for co-operation and progress on the big issues that affect all of us, including trade, climate change, human rights, regulation, migration and immigration.  It is notable that the debate under way on the future of Europe does not focus on these issues.  In a time of political flux following Brexit, there is a danger that the simplistic narrative being peddled by some, that a more federal Europe will cure the ills of the EU, will prevail.  That is in spite of most recent studies that show that a majority of citizens in Europe do not support the transfer of further powers to Brussels.  They do not want more Europe, they want better Europe.  The EU needs to begin listening to citizens.  It needs to move away from a bureaucratic model intended for the benefit of a few and towards a social Europe which reflects the interests of the many.  That is the only way to address the imbalance of power we currently have.</p> <p> The withdrawal agreement on offer is not perfect, but it is reasonable.  It is the least worst option, given the cards that have been dealt, and we will support it.  There is an onus on political leaders to do what is right to defend our country&rsquo;s political and economic interests.  That has guided us in Sinn F&eacute;in.  We have supported the Government and the European negotiating team in their endeavours and attempt to get the best deal possible.  We want that as the final outcome, and that should be the position of everybody on this island.  We want to avert the imposition of a hard border, ensure the protection of citizens&rsquo; rights and, crucially, ensure that the hard-won gains and progress of the past 20 years are not squandered but are built on.  We can do that with this deal but, more important, with a lot of hard work, we can deliver.  I urge support for the motion before the D&aacute;il and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p></speech>

We have to remind ourselves, as Teachta McDonald has done, that a majority of people in the North voted to stay in the European Union.</p><p>That has to be the catalyst for us to respond to the needs of people in the North.  The majority cross-party view in the North of Ireland is that we should not have a hardening of the Border.  Brexit, as it was presented, is not what the majority of people want.  The draft agreement, therefore, is the absolute bare minimum needed to protect the rights of the people of the North.  </p> <p> My party has worked constructively with the Government through the stakeholder forum which the T&aacute;naiste led, in D&aacute;il committees, inside this Chamber and outside this Chamber through the work of our MEPs and MPs dealing with parties in Westminster and the European Parliament.  Sinn F&eacute;in was clear on the need for a special or unique arrangement for the North to ensure the Good Friday Agreement was protected in all its parts, there was no hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland and the rights of Irish and EU citizens were fully protected.  While there has been movement and we acknowledge the gains that have been made in this agreement on the Border, the same progress has not been made in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the rights of citizens in the North.  I hope the Taoiseach understands that while citizens and businesses North and South need certainty on trade and the Border, they also need certainty on rights.  A person who lives in the North of Ireland, whether an Irish citizen or a British citizen, needs to be able to vindicate his or her rights as a European citizen where he or she lives.  There is an obligation and a responsibility on the Irish Government to make sure of that.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in also argued that frictionless movement of goods from Ireland through Britain on their way to the rest of the European Union was required.  While there are outstanding issues, the draft agreement provides some assurance for the citizens of the North and businesses in regard to the Border and trade.</p> <p> The agreement is now on the table and subject to ratification.  All eyes will be on the summit in the next few days.  However, in the short and medium terms we need to turn our attention to the issue of Europe.  The uncomfortable truth that some people in this Chamber need to face up to is that the drive to create a European superstate which acts in the interests of an elite, lacks democracy and is becoming increasingly militarised is pushing voters into the hands of the far right.  What Europe needs is more democracy, not less.  Senior figures in the European institutions are in many cases unelected and unaccountable to the people they serve.  The economic crisis showed that when push came to shove, the European Union backed the banks and the financial elite over the needs of ordinary people.  That message is not lost on people in Ireland and across the European Union.  The federalists need to be sent a very clear message by politicians in Ireland.  The Irish people do not want a European superstate.  That would be a more undemocratic Europe in which the big institutions would have far too much power, making decisions affecting the lives of others without being fully held to account.  We all know what happens in that scenario.  In this State we can point to many examples, including the most recent scandals, to show that it does not work.</p> <p> The creeping federalisation of Europe did not happen by chance or overnight.  It happened with the passing of every single treaty, treaties that my party did not support and champion.  We saw that the creation of a European superstate, unelected people having the powers they have and the economic orthodoxy underpinning the European Union were not in the interests of people who live on the island of Ireland.  All of the treaties that gave the big institutions their power created the undemocratic Europe we live in today.  It is absolutely clear that the actions of the European Union, especially the European Commission, are feeding the growth of Europe's extreme right.  Poll after poll shows that trust in the institutions is falling, adding to the rise of what are essentially fascist parties in Europe.  That is not in the interests of anybody who lives in Europe.  We are fortunate that we have not seen the rise of the far right in this State-----</p></speech>

We must realise the need to work for a more democratic and social Europe and ensure that is what we get.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the vast majority of people who live in Ireland want the island of Ireland to stay in the European Union.  In recent several months, indeed since the Brexit referendum, people in the North have been very concerned that Brexit would not be good for them.  I commend Teachta Adams on being one of the first Members of the D&aacute;il to put forward the proposition that what the North needed and what Ireland needed was a unique set of bespoke solutions and that special status for the North was necessary.  Those protections are the absolute bare minimum to meet our needs.</p>  <p>  Teachta Adams will deal with some of the outstanding issues that need to be dealt with, but I will say this.  The Taoiseach said earlier this year that citizens in the North would never be left behind again.  People in the North listened to that.  They are also watching what is happening.  They will acknowledge the progress made on the Border and that there has been an Irish approach to this, with both Government and Opposition in this State working constructively to deal with the issue of the Border.  However, they are now looking at the issue of rights.  I urge the Taoiseach to remember the majority view in the North, reflected by Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party, the Green Party and the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP.  Those parties have also been working collectively, with one voice in Britain and Europe, to send a message that they want these issues dealt with.  That is the majority view in the North.  That is the voice of the majority of people and their rights have to be vindicated.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, there is concern among people in the North about the issues which have not been resolved.  It is important to place on the record that Sinn F&eacute;in has worked constructively with the Government and to recognise the gains that have been made.  It is equally important to point out the gains that have not been made and to very forcibly make the point that the people who want these issues dealt with are watching and are concerned.</p></speech>

We do not support it because it is the best option.  It is not the best option because, among other issues, it disregards and ignores the vote of the people in the North to remain in the European Union.  Abiding by the will of the people would be the best option but that is an option which the Government failed to secure.  It failed because it never pressed for it or accepted it, either in Deputy Enda Kenny's time or in Deputy Leo Varadkar's time as Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Government will argue that it had to abide by the United Kingdom's vote.  Mar dhea.  I do not accept that.  I am with Parnell, who said "No man has the right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation."  At any time of big change, those special big moments of history, big imaginations are needed to determine how we proceed.  There was an absence of this type of thinking within the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership and the Government as they came to terms with what was happening as a consequence of the Brexit referendum.  </p></speech>

Eventually the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State and their officials applied themselves to this, especially after the change of the Fine Gael leadership.  I commend all involved, including the officials.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge the positive role that Sinn F&eacute;in played, including and especially our team in the European Parliament, which engaged regularly with Mr. Michel Barnier and other EU officials, as did the party president, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, and Michelle O'Neill, MLA.  They presented clear and cogent arguments for a special designated status for the North.  The outlined backstop proposal owes much to their hard work.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment on the need to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the North.  An cuimhin leis an Taoiseach that last December he said that citizens in the North would never again be left behind by an Irish Government?  He added: "These rights will, of course, be available to everyone in Northern Ireland who chooses to exercise his or her right to be an Irish citizen, regardless of his or her political persuasion or religious beliefs."  </p><p>Last December's joint report stated there would be "no diminution of rights" and that "Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in Northern Ireland".  That has now been deleted and it is a significant backward step.  The draft agreement contains a clause on rights, but it is not legally binding and not what the Taoiseach committed to last December.  The Government should be aware that Irish citizens in the North are conscious of this.  Recently 1,000 leaders of civic nationalism reminded the Taoiseach of his commitments.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach have got to know some of them.  They are same as me and other Deputies; they are thinking human beings who are now locked out of the rights the Taoiseach promised to uphold for them.</p> <p> There is particular annoyance that Irish and EU citizens in the North will not be able to elect an MEP.  The State is being allocated an additional two seats in the European Parliament.  Has the Government considered allocating them to the North?  In addition, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights will no longer apply in the North, which means that certain rights will be undermined.  There are a range of other social and economic rights, including workers' rights, which people currently enjoy in the European Union which will be left to the British Government's discretion.  Will the Government insist - I wrote to the Minister involved some time ago - on the publication of the mapping report which identified 142 areas of all-island co-operation as called for by the EU Ombudsman?</p> <p> Let us be clear that Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement demands that the British Government exercise its power in the North with rigorous impartiality.  Many of us justifiably remain sceptical about this, but that is what the British Government signed up to and that is to what the Irish Government must hold it.  The refusal of the British to defend the rights of Irish language speakers and women's rights, protect equality and human rights for gay and lesbian citizens, implement legacy agreements, or honour outstanding agreement commitments to establish a Bill of Rights and create a civic forum is evidence of the absence of rigorous impartiality.  Moreover, following Brexit, British Conservatives remain wedded to ending the role of the European Court of Justice and getting rid of the UK Human Rights Act 1998 which protects the equality and human rights principles of the agreement.  I outline all of this to bring context and reality to this discussion.  There is also, in that context, greater significance attached to the objective of Irish unity.  From our point of view, it is a logical, common-sense outcome to the political, social and economic divisions imposed by partition, but it also makes sense in the current Brexit-provoked crisis.  Apart from other considerations, reunification would allow the North to again become part of the European Union.  Rather than having a hard or soft border, it would be better to have no border at all.  That is what the Government and the Oireachtas should be working for.</p></speech>

Looking back over the last five decades, the British media have portrayed the European Union in a simplistic and hostile way.  One need only read the front pages of tabloid newspapers - not only the tabloids - to be forgiven for believing all sorts of crazy lies about the European Union.  This is not trivial.  The office of the European Commission in the United Kingdom set up a website to counter myths about the European Union, covering the period 1992 to 2017.  It lists nearly 700 myths that have been circulated in Britain about the European Union, from false claims that it would ban fresh pasta, colouring pencils and vitamin supplements through to that it would standardise the sizes of vegetables, rename popular British products and even abolish the double-decker bus.  Seen collectively, it is preposterous nonsense, but for many the relentless background noise about the European Union is the only information they have received on European co-operation and the major political movement on the continent since the devastation caused by two world wars.  This bias was not helped by generations of politicians who took the credit for popular policies but blamed Brussels for imposing anything from which they wanted to distance themselves.  It is no wonder that UKIP grew from this fertile soil.  It is no wonder that the European Union began to be seen as the problem and that leaving it was the solution.</p>  <p>  As my colleague, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, MP, reminds us, we have to understand the reasons many British people voted to leave the European Union in the referendum two years ago.  For some Leave voters, it was because they had been lied to, not just during the referendum campaign when illegal campaign spending and a host of lies were exposed but throughout years of anti-EU propaganda.  For many other Leave voters, it was due to domestic policies and choices made by the Government of Britain but which had been blamed on Brussels or foreigners generally.  For now, the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union raises three simple questions for Ireland.  What is the likely future of the United Kingdom?  How does this future potentially affect Ireland?  How should we react?</p>  <p>  Let us consider an island nation with a distinctive culture and identity which includes its tradition of monarchy; a nation that has given up aggressive imperialism and is now reliant on the United States as a military partner; one of the world's largest economies, with a welfare state; a nation that possesses one of the world's safe currencies; a trading nation, with investment in high-tech industries, that sells its products across the world but that keeps strong control of immigration; a nation with a stable democratic system, with guaranteed civil liberties and a dominant conservative party; a nation that co-operates on an intergovernmental basis with its neighbours but that has a history of not getting on with the continental states beside it; and a nation that rejects political unions or other close economic unions.  The nation I describe is Japan.  </p>  <p>  One possible post-Brexit future is for Britain to become more like Japan in going it alone.  It is a vision of fortress Britain, a country that wants to trade with the world but that does not want to share decision-making with another country through co-operation or partnership arrangements, that prefers strictly limited trading deals instead.  Clearly, there are some who are pro-Brexit who believe the United Kingdom can pull up the drawbridge and, as they put it, have greater control of its borders, laws and moneys, but there are serious flaws in any such vision of a Britain in splendid isolation.  First, it was telling that one of the first news items in response to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May&rsquo;s big reveal last week was not the Opposition's reaction but the reaction of the global currency markets.  A version of Brexit that stays close to the EU customs union and Single Market is good for business and the currency markets respond favourably, but the risk of a no deal scenario is greeted with panic and the relative value of the pound drops.  That is where the comparison with Japan breaks down.</p>  <p>  The UK economy is more globally integrated than Japan's and the pound is a global currency.  The United Kingdom is part of European supply chains, many of which operate on a just-in-time basis.</p><p>The UK is primarily a services economy with leading companies in finance, IT and communications, all of which require regulatory alignment and close integration with other countries' markets in order to sell their wares.  A Fortress Britain could take back control of migration but to what end?</p> <p> What motivated the concern with migration?  Some surveys suggest the main fears about migration are about competition for jobs, concern about crime and access to housing.  Just before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU, UK unemployment was just under 5% and employment was nearly 75%.  Clearly, migrants were not leaving many British people outside the jobs market.  Crime rates have been static or falling across the UK for a number of years with no evidence that recent migration has increased crime.  Housing is a problem with issues similar to here in terms of unaffordable housing but in the north of England, where I canvassed and where large majorities of people voted to leave, pressure on housing is far less acute than it is in London and the south east of England, which largely voted to remain.  None of these reasons is convincing when it comes to why so many people voted to leave the EU.  A more plausible explanation is that British people are dissatisfied with the status quo because a fifth of the UK population live in poverty.  A total of 1.5 million people are unable to afford the essentials of life and we have seen the soaring use of food banks in Britain in recent years.  Jeremy Corbyn is right to say that investment is needed across the UK to create decent jobs and better living conditions for all but that is not something that Fortress Britain can deliver and it is not fair to lay the blame for so-called "neo-liberal" policies at the door of the European Union.  The European Single Market has vibrant State industries alongside the private sector in many countries.  There is little or nothing in the British Labour Party's industrial strategies that could not be achieved within the EU.  There has been a right-wing turn in recent European policies associated with the rise of conservative parties across Europe and not least the influence of the strong Conservative Party in the UK itself in shaping the EU Single Market but the EU also has the strongest protections for workers and the environment of any single market in the world.  A strong Labour Government in the UK could help to enhance these protections, expand the social dimension of European co-operation and create a social Europe.  </p> <p> UK Labour desires a future relationship that is very close to the EU with a customs union to protect jobs and close alignment to the Single Market.  This type of future relationship may well be possible as one outworking of Theresa May's deal but in addition to the inevitable extra costs and delays of so-called "friction" at the border, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair has pointed out a profound political flaw in May's Brexit deal.  She has tried to give Brexiteers a form of Brexit while minimising the economic damage.  This makes the UK a rule taker instead of a rule maker.  Having the theoretical ability to strike independent trade deals elsewhere will not soften this genuine loss of sovereignty for those who so wanted to "take back control".  This is the same problem that Jeremy Corbyn faces by trying to keep the UK close to the EU Single Market. </p> <p> Another former Labour Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has made the sensible suggestion of running citizens' assemblies up and down the UK to at least lay out all the sides and test whether pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit voters can find common ground.  Gordon Brown is right to identify that the UK is still deeply and bitterly divided on the issue of Europe and that some way needs to be found to heal those divisions.  He believes that a second referendum must be carefully prepared for to avoid a situation where even if the UK people voted to remain after all, there would be millions of Leave voters who would feel betrayed, humiliated and resentful.  </p> <p> The deal to exit the EU is what it is and I pay tribute to Irish Ministers and diplomats who so valiantly protected Irish interests in the negotiations.  The UK will pay around &euro;41 billion - &euro;18.5 billion in 2019 and 2020 during the transition.  It must be emphasised that this is a significantly discounted entry fee for full access to the EU's customs union and Single Market.  People talk about the UK paying a divorce bill.  It is paying a discounted rate for the benefits of the Single Market for two years.  The remainder in the following years will go towards projects that the UK agreed to fund in the last MFF round and its contribution to the pensions of UK civil servants working in Brussels for the past 40 years and British MEPs.  It is hardly money for nothing as the Brexiteers pretend.  Given that the UK actually spent more than &euro;900 billion in 2016, its contribution to the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement can be shown to be relatively small.  </p> <p> The withdrawal agreement protects the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens across Europe.  That provides additional legal certainty for Irish citizens in Great Britain and the British in Ireland.  We cannot assume that our historical agreements under the common travel area would flawlessly fall into place once Brexit happens.  This is an issue I have been pursuing over the past year.  We should remember that this agreement on rights is particularly important for Irish families where one or more family member is a British or EU national.  </p> <p> It is important to recall that we are not voting today with regard to that future relationship; we are simply being asked to endorse the orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU by March next year.  There are really only two deeply contentious aspects of the withdrawal agreement from my perspective.  One is our core concern, which is that there cannot be a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Second, the extent to which the withdrawal agreement constrains or limits the future relationship agreement is of concern to the most ardent Leave supporters.  </p> <p> In respect of Ireland, the negotiation process showed solidarity between member states of the EU.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns were well flagged in advance and the EU negotiation team has delivered a viable proposal from our perspective.  Our friends in the British Labour party and across Westminster have also listened to and understood our serious concerns about the border and I am grateful for their solidarity.  The bottom line is that we want people north and south of the border to continue to enjoy the most significant benefit of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the free and unfettered access to both jurisdictions.  This free and genuinely frictionless movement of people facilitates family and personal relationships and facilitates doing business on a cross-Border basis.  This has boosted prosperity and embedded peace.  What made this possible was shared European law.  Brexit means that for these benefits to continue, we must be certain to have a body of law that continues to facilitate that open border.  The transition period as the UK leaves the EU contains that legal certainty because existing EU laws continue to operate.  The future relationship agreement is expected to contain equivalent legal certainty to maintain such a non-existent border.  Of course, that has not yet been negotiated but in the unlikely event that the future relationship does not provide such certainty or that no future relationship agreement can be made at all, we need to have a legally operable backstop in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.  That has been the position of this House and of the Government.  </p><p>We have this in the document revealed last week, alongside a commitment to use our best efforts to ensure we never need to use that insurance policy.  Unionists do have a legitimate concern about the backstop because it does single out Northern Ireland in certain respects, but this has to be examined in a measured way.  For centuries, the United Kingdom has treated Scotland and Northern Ireland - and all of Ireland - differently from England and Wales.  Different legislation and policies applied and continue to apply in each jurisdiction.  Devolution has enhanced regional differences.  The UK was never a unitary state where all parts enjoyed or operated the same body of law.  It is not a radical suggestion that Northern Ireland might do some things differently in the interests of its people and businesses.  As it happens, Northern Ireland benefits from the all-island energy market under EU rules, and the draft withdrawal agreement provides a legal basis for this to continue.  An all-island wholesale electricity market does not undermine anyone's sovereignty, identity or constitutional preferences.  Northern Ireland benefits from an all-island food health and safety regime.  For years, live animals moving between Britain and Northern Ireland have been tested before transport across the Irish Sea, and this has never been raised as a constitutional issue.  If, and only if, the backstop is needed, this will be extended to other food products.</p> <p> If our insurance policy is needed, Northern Ireland will remain in the EU customs union and subject to parts of the Single Market rules to the extent necessary to keep the Border open.  This will create some paperwork east-west between Northern Ireland and Britain if, and only if, the future relationship between the UK and EU is so distant that this is rendered necessary.  The benefit to Northern Ireland's people and businesses is that the backstop gives them free access to the entire EU market.  It is potentially a tremendous win-win scenario, but it will require political leadership in Northern Ireland to explain its potential fully.</p> <p> At any rate, this is only hypothetical as we do not yet know the shape of the future relationship.  There is a danger of countries playing constitutional politics with the draft withdrawal agreement, as we heard in the mutterings in the past hour or so, with Spain and France threatening the agreement in regard to Gibraltar and other matters.  There is no such constitutional manoeuvring going on in the Irish case.  Let us be clear about that across this House.  We should not try to muscle constitutional issues into this agreement.  We will not accept a backstop that moves backwards and would take away the tangible benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, or leverages in something that is not agreed in the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p> There is nothing in the Irish component of the draft withdrawal agreement that should concern unionists.  In this regard, I include unionists across all parties in Westminster.  The real and substantial sticking point is whether the draft withdrawal agreement constrains or limits the future relationship agreement, to which the answer is, yes it does.  The draft withdrawal agreement has close co-operation on customs built into it, which strongly signals close alignment on customs into the future.  Is this a problem?  For most people of most political persuasions, it most certainly is not.  Deeper economic co-operation is happening across the globe.  Countries everywhere are in customs unions and negotiating new arrangements, including, for example, south-east Asia, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, east Africa, central Africa, west Africa and southern Africa through the Gulf Co-operation Council and in the Eurasian customs union.  Most of the world is in one or more customs or free trade agreement.  The future UK-EU relationship will inevitably involve economic co-operation.  Both sides have talked up an ambitious close future relationship.  It is in our best interests that east-west trade between Ireland and Britain be as free and open as possible.  We would prefer a scenario wherein the British people got to vote again.  I tend to agree with Mr. Gordon Brown that not enough has been done to allow people across the UK to address their sense of frustration properly.  Not enough has been done to counteract a media environment that has dripped poison about the EU for decades, not least through the toxic pen of former Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson.</p> <p> A significant number of people in the UK have serious doubts about the EU.  We need to understand these doubts.  I do not believe they are due to nationalist xenophobia.  Rather, I believe they are largely because of domestic economic policies that have left far too many people behind, especially in the north of England and in rural England.  Fuel has been poured on the fire of Euroscepticism by cynical public commentary over too many years.  Following a process of national deliberation, including business and civil society alongside ordinary citizens, we might see the kind of societal shift of attitudes that we have seen in our society through citizens' assemblies, which have profoundly moved and shifted public attitudes on issues that we thought were entrenched.  This, in turn, would make it possible to believe that a second referendum might produce a very different result, but not just a narrow victory for Remain that would leave behind too much bitterness and cynicism.</p> <p> There is nothing undemocratic about consulting the people a second time as long as something substantial has changed that might reasonably cause people to change their views.  Two things have certainly changed.  First, the level of general knowledge about the EU has grown immeasurably.  Leading politicians apparently knew little about the detail of the customs union, atomic energy co-operation or countless other details of the European Union.  They do now.  Second, there is a deal on the table.  It has its strengths, weaknesses, upsides and downsides.  It is telling that many of the arch-Brexiteers only talk about the downsides and still fail to articulate any vision of how Britain might prosper outside of the European Union.  In my view, this is because the UK cannot become another Japan.  The UK economy does not produce the kinds of goods and services that would make fortress Britain a viable model in global trade.  Enough has changed since June 2016 that it would be reasonable and sensible to ask the British people if they are sure that they still want what they voted for in 2016.  Who wins from Brexit?  It is not the people of the UK, who will almost certainly be poorer under even the most generous future relationship.  Clearly, certain wealthy individuals and organisations see opportunities for themselves.</p> <p> The draft withdrawal agreement deal that is on the table is as good as the circumstances allow.  It is a sad loss for the European Union but we can hope that a process of reconciliation can occur between the UK and the European Union post Brexit.  We would certainly welcome the return of the UK people as full members of the European project into the future.  We would warmly welcome a second referendum before the door is firmly closed, perhaps after a postponement of the trigger date of Article 50.  As for this motion, the Labour Party will support it as the best deal that could be negotiated in the circumstances that prevail.</p></speech>

So much has been spoken and written about it that many people are weary of this convoluted and complex discussion.  The document presented by Mr. Barnier and his team represents one of the better possibilities for Ireland, or the least worst.  Few people on this island, North and South, wanted a referendum.  The possibility of a hard border is an enormous threat to livelihoods North and South and so the backstop is essential.</p><p>The UK and Ireland have now been in the European Union for more than 45 years.  In the context of the First World War Armistice remembrances, it is important to remember that we have now been in the EU longer than the period of the First World War, the interwar years and the period up to the end and after the end of the Second World War combined.</p> <p> Our membership has helped to transform this country, particularly, speaking as a woman Deputy, the approach of the European Union collectively to equality towards women and in the workplace and human rights, civil rights and workers' rights.  This has enabled a huge amount of progress in this country that otherwise could have taken three times longer to achieve.  The best hope for our Ireland and particularly for the European Union is that we have a renewed vision of a social EU, which is strongly what it was until about 20 years ago, that the EU represents and joins the fight to end poverty, homelessness and lack of social provision and that in Ireland we continue to develop our model of social provision and care in line with the best performers in the European Union.</p> <p> We need as a country and as a society to do much more to reach out to all the citizens of Northern Ireland.  To give an example of how unsettling this debate has been at times, Boris Johnson, in a comment which I think raised many eyebrows, recently remarked that the Border between the two parts of Ireland is no different to the border between Camden and Islington.  If the House can imagine it, Dundalk and Newry and the borderlands in between are basically his Camden and Islington.  "How posh," one might say, but also how removed this comment is from any real notion of what life and indeed geography are like in this country.  In the context of very difficult debates, disruptions and changes still to come, we need to take the Good Friday Agreement as offering in many ways the best roadmap for possibilities in a post-Brexit settlement.  It should be recalled that the agreement recognises that it is for the people of Ireland alone to exercise the right to self-determination, but on the basis of consent North and South to progress it.  It is critical that everyone in this Chamber acknowledge and recognise this.  We really do not need rhetoric about easy achievements that we all know mean changes of hearts and minds and not simply a determination that it is our way, right or wrong.</p></speech>

These two immediate imperatives flow from more general principles we hold which are internationalist in outlook.  We think borders divide people, whether they be north-south, east-west or around fortress Europe.  We do not like borders because they divide people, set them against one another and encourage them to see themselves in competition with one another.  Workers always lose in this.  This is our guiding principle and it is the logic behind the position we will take on the motion.</p>  <p>  As to the question of the North-South Border, there is no doubt that the Government and the officials have achieved something significant in getting a commitment not to have a hard border, or to avoid a hard border, to be strictly accurate about what is in the document.  For this reason we will certainly not oppose the motion.</p>  <p>  We do not, however, have the same guarantees on the fate of workers in the Brexit drama.  I noticed that ICTU came out today in support of the agreement, although its slogan, that workers should not pay the price for Brexit, was a good one.  This is an important thought and one that has not been discussed sufficiently throughout the Brexit drama.  As Naomi Klein pointed out in respect of the economic collapse, there is a thing these days called disaster capitalism, whereby certain people - big business, primarily, and states - use the opportunities presented by crises to push forward their own agenda, and the losers are working people.  We saw this most dramatically with the crash of 2008, a crash that was caused by bankers but paid for by working people with horrendous consequences not just in this country but globally.  Our amendment concerning workers aims precisely to trumpet the demand that, whatever else happens in this drama, working people should not suffer nor be asked to pay the bill and that any agreement, or lack thereof, should not be used as a pretext to attack incomes and wages, demand wage restraint or cut public services.  This is a very important demand, particularly given, as previous speakers have mentioned, the fatigue that is setting in, with many people listening to talk of backstops, longstops, long backstops and back longstops and wondering when this stuff will end.  What they want to know is how it will impact them.  What we are setting out in our amendment and our general attitude to this is our determination to fight on behalf of working people to ensure they do not end up paying the price as various, frankly unsavoury, political forces politically manoeuvre for their own narrow agendas.</p><p>Looking at the leadership of Britain, or the people who have led the narrative on the British exit from the European Union, the threat to worker's rights is obvious.  The particular form of exit from the European Union that those people want is that which leads to a bargain-basement Fortress Britain.  It will lead to a race to the bottom at every single level in a way that will impact detrimentally on working people in the interests of narrow sections of British capital.  It sees Brexit as an opportunity to attack workers' rights and advance its own particular interests.</p> <p> Those people have also very cynically used xenophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as a mechanism to deflect attention away from their own failings and the disaster they have inflicted on many sections of the British working class.  They want to deflect attention away from their responsibility for that and to attack vulnerable people such as immigrants, minorities etc.  The danger from those people is pretty obvious.  The other danger is not so obvious because the narrative that has dominated in this debate has been that of Tory Brexiteers, the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and all of those sorts of people.  They are bad, so anybody on the other side of the debate must necessarily be good.</p> <p> That, of course, is not necessarily true.  I do not buy into the lesser of two evils theory of politics.  It is a bad theory of politics.  The enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend.  When we look at how Europe has similarity treated immigrants, and the thousands of dead drowned in the Mediterranean because of Fortress Europe policies, the idea that Europe is the good guy when it comes to immigration and the treatment of minorities and the vulnerable does not really stack up.  Europe is also not the good guy in protecting working people's rights.</p> <p> As we know, when the crash happened in Europe, there was a determination to make working people pay for it to the extent of threatening to let off financial bombs in Dublin if we dared to burn the bondholders.  That is what was said.  Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, the then President of the European Central Bank, said that a financial bomb would be let off in Dublin.  Are these people our allies?  I do not think so, not at all.  Do I trust them with the best interests of working people?  I certainly do not.  Do I trust them with the whole question of the increased militarisation of Europe and the advance of a military project focused on a European army?  How could we possibly do that when some of the leading figures in Europe are now blatantly talking about wanting to move towards a European army?</p> <p> It is good that the Irish Government, with the support of everyone in this House, has secured a commitment to avoid a hard border.  Do I trust either of our interlocutors in this to guarantee that?  I absolutely do not.  I thought it was telling in that regard that at the weekend the Taoiseach said, "I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border because of the obvious fact that, Ireland remaining part of the European Union, would no doubt be asked to implement European Union law".  That is a very alarming comment.  I made this point when this whole debate started and I have made it successively since.  There is a real danger this deal will not be agreed, no matter what happens in the D&aacute;il tonight.  It will go through the D&aacute;il and we will not oppose it.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, however, or this deal not going through or a situation where it unravels and does not succeed, there may be a hard Brexit.  If that is the case, what the Taoiseach is saying is that pressure is going to come on from Europe to secure the Single Market and that its priority is going to be the market over averting a hard border.  That is the unmistakable logic of those words.</p></speech>

"I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border because of the obvious fact that, Ireland remaining part of the European Union, would no doubt be asked to implement European Union law".  That sounds clear to me.  Pressure will come on to protect the integrity of the market and, therefore, the issue of averting a hard border could also come under pressure.  It is in that context that our second amendment has been put forward stating that the Irish Government should seek a Border poll, to happen simultaneously North and South, if there is any inkling that a hard border might be established.  That is on basic democratic grounds.  If there is a possibility of a hard border, with pressure from Britain or Europe, then on basic democratic grounds, people North and South should have the right to have a say on whether they want or are willing to accept that.  That is a simple thing we should say.  To be honest, it is also a warning shot to Europe that if any pressure comes on us we will have to do that.  It is also the case that the logic of all of this crisis and drama is to state that a border does not make sense.  This is the time to advance an argument about the benefits of a united Ireland.</p>  <p>  The 500 redundancies in Bombardier in Belfast this week gave a sense of how we could begin to advance that argument.  I refer to the common interests of working people and uniting in their common interests on the basis that they are workers.  I refer to opposing a Border, having unity and breaking from the green-orange tribal politics which has divided and weakened working people.  It has resulted in a rotten little statelet up in the North which has done little for working people.  This is an argument that can gain an echo not just among people who see themselves as nationalists but also among working-class Protestants.</p>  <p>  That is logic behind our two amendments.  I will conclude by saying that while we are not going to oppose this motion, neither can we vote for the agreement.  I will explain why.  It is precisely because I am an internationalist.  The agreement makes reference, for example, to the need for Britain and the European Union to continue their commitment on the EU-Turkey deal.  That deal is an absolutely rotten Fortress Europe anti-immigrant deal.  It is a deal with a rotten and brutal regime that has no respect for human rights in Turkey.  We have essentially used Turkey by paying it to be a buffer against desperate Syrians trying to flee from the horrendous situation in Syria.  I refer to trying to keep them out of the European Union.  The need to maintain that commitment is referred to in the agreement.  I could not possibly support that in an active way.  I am not going to oppose the deal because it has a commitment on the Border issue but neither am I going to endorse it.</p>  <p>  I am also not going to endorse references to EU policies on state aid.  They are a real problem.  I disagree with Deputy Howlin on this.  EU state aid rules are a problem for us in being able to invest in key strategic public enterprises without having to be subject to the rules of competition according to the fiscal treaties.  They insist on competition when there are key areas of public investment and infrastructure that do not need competition.  The last thing needed is competition.  What is needed is public investment in key services and infrastructure.  That is our position.  We should hold fast to having no Border North and South and insist that working people should not pay the price for whatever resolution finally emerges from the Brexit drama.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.587" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100053#FFF00600"><p>I am going to start with a statement of first principles.  Reference has been made to the national interest.  We care about the interests of working-class people.</p><p>When we say working-class people, we mean the interests of working-class people here in the Republic of Ireland, the interests of working-class people in Northern Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant, and the interests of working-class people in England, Scotland and Wales, and right across the European Union.  We will judge this agreement on how well it serves the interests of working-class people or otherwise, as the case may be.  For us, the key questions are whether this agreement guarantees jobs, living standards and peace.  Will it serve to heal sectarian division or will it serve to exacerbate it?</p> <p> Apart from the previous speaker, not a single Deputy has referred to the fact that the politics of neoliberalism runs through this document like the stitching on a jacket.  To focus on just one example, the question of state intervention, article 16 of Annex 4 on page 373 states: "The Union and the [UK] acknowledge that anti-competitive business practices, concentrations of [industries] and State interventions have the potential to distort the proper functioning of markets and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation."  Pages 465 to 469 refer to limiting state aid for postal services, broadband, railways and airports etc.</p> <p> We hear much talk of division in the British Conservative Party, government instability and a UK general election.  The Taoiseach, British Prime Minister May and the EU negotiators are all no doubt aware that the likely winner of that election is Mr. Jeremy Corbyn.  Neither are they blind to the fact that Mr. Corbyn has pledged to reverse the many of the cases of privatisation put in place by British Governments going back to the time of Mrs. Thatcher.  He has pledged to reverse rail and water privatisation and he has pledged to renationalise the mail.  State aid has been pledged by him to help build a million new homes.  How many of these will be permitted under this deal?  None of these will be permitted.  If this is a deal for Brexit, it is clearly a deal for a Tory Brexit.  It is pro-market, pro-privatisation and pro-rich.  It is against nationalisation, public services and the interests of the working class.</p> <p> That is not a surprise given who was at the talks.  The Tory Government and the EU top officialdom represent the interests of big business elites.  Nobody in these negotiations represented the interests of working-class people.  The interests of working-class people need to be represented now.  The Minister for Finance indicates a hard Brexit could cost 40,000 jobs.  The ESRI has indicated that wage cuts could be in the 5% to 10% range for workers in agrifood, tourism and manufacturing.  The ESRI, the Nevin Economic Research Institute and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government all agree that Brexit will mean more rent rises in the big cities.  In Northern Ireland, Bombardier welcomed the deal and then announced the destruction of 500 jobs, or 10% of its Northern Ireland work force.</p> <p> There has been much talk of "red lines" having been laid down by the various parties engaged in the negotiations to date.  It is time for the organised working-class movement to lay down its red lines.  No to job losses, no to wage cuts, no to cuts in services or an exacerbation of the housing crisis and, importantly, no to sectarian division.  I will return to that point in a moment.  The bosses should be put on notice that any and all attempts to attack our jobs, pay and conditions will meet with real resistance and no holds barred.  We call for the convening of an emergency conference with the widest possible participation of workers&rsquo; representatives from workplaces across Ireland, North and South, alongside trade unionists from Britain.  Such a conference should host a full and democratic discussion on how best to defend and fight for the interests of workers and the communities they come from.  Our hope is that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will take responsibility for the convening of such a conference.  Should the congress decide not to take such a step, our hope would be that a coalition of the trade union bodies prepared to do so would do so.</p> <p> The trade union movement represents 800,000 members in Ireland, including 200,000 members in the North.  The trade union movement has more than 6 million members in Britain and it has the potential to be a powerful force intervening in the matter.  Such a conference should dispel the myth that workers&rsquo; rights have been handed down by a benevolent European Union.  This turns reality on its head.  The European Union has been central to waging a war on workers, particularly given its role in troika austerity programmes, as we have experienced in this country.  It did it along with right-wing governments like the Irish Government.  Who has really fought for workers&rsquo; rights and how are they really won?  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Ford strike in Dagenham, which forced a Labour Government to concede the Equal Pay Act.  The incredibly strong strike of 8,500 council workers in Glasgow recently, which the BBC described as "one of the biggest ever strikes in the UK on the issue of equal pay" is testament to the fact that these rights are won through struggle.  The trade union movement must reject the false choice of this deal versus the UK walking out of the EU.  In the words of Mr. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, "Unite utterly opposes the false choice of a bad deal versus no deal."  This should become the position of the movement as a whole.</p> <p> There is another reason the trade union movement must reject false choices on this issue.  Both this deal and the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal contain within those processes the potential for sectarian polarisation in Northern Ireland.  This deal provides for extra non-customs checks on some types of goods passing between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in certain circumstances in approximately two years.  In other words, an east-west border could begin to emerge as early as December 2020.  That is not even to mention the North-South Border, which I will return to later.  In that sense, this deal will add to the insecurities felt about the future by many ordinary Protestants.  If there is a perception over time that their identity is being diminished, it could provoke a serious reaction, as we have seen in the past.  The real issue here is not the DUP.  The real issue relates to the concerns and fears of ordinary working-class Protestant people.  Is there any chance we could see those concerns being dealt with in a more serious and sensitive way in the media here rather than the patronising portrayals that we see so often?  That would be a step forward.</p> <p> Even if the parliamentary arithmetic had been different after the previous general election and there had been no DUP-Tory deal, the opposition of Northern Ireland Protestants to any perception of an east-west border being created would still be a factor to be weighed.  Equally, on the basis of this deal being rejected now with a move to a hard border, there is the potential for a strong reaction from the Catholic community.  Border posts, customs posts or any physical manifestation of a hard border would become symbols of a denial of the national aspirations of the Catholic population and would not be accepted in any way.  They would be opposed in a vocal and very active way.  Trade Union, which unite people across the sectarian divide, should take action against any moves which would harden the border or raise the prospect of an east-west border in the Irish Sea.</p> <p> When our colleagues in People Before Profit state, as they do in their amendment, that the Brexit crisis must not be used as a pretext by employers or the Government to enforce wage restraint etc., we can only agree with them.</p><p>On the other hand, when they issue a call for a Border poll in the same amendment, we must fundamentally disagree.  A Border poll does not offer any solution to the issues raised by the Brexit negotiations or to the national question in Ireland.  The logic of a Border poll is based on the mathematics of sectarianism.  It either means a continued coercion of the Catholic population into the <i>status quo</i>or a vote that would attempt to coerce the Protestant population into a state that it would refuse to accept.</p></speech>

The only solution to the problems of sectarianism is to build a powerful workers' movement that can challenge both unionism and nationalism with socialist policies, including through the creation of a new mass political party that represents Catholic and Protestant working-class people.  The real guarantors of peace in Northern Ireland are these people, who have been prepared to take to the streets to take action against the forces of sectarianism.  The EU is not a guarantor of peace.  Any idea that it is completely contradicted by the recent calls by Merkel and Macron for a European army and the plans to ramp up EU military spending as well as the militarisation contained in PESCO, which includes Irish Government participation.</p>  <p>  Nor is the EU a guarantor of the right of minorities.  This was shown recently by EU support for the Spanish state in repressing the national aspirations and rights of people in Catalonia.  Last week, UN rapporteur Professor Philip Alston said of the 14 million people who live in poverty in Tory Britain: "a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them".  It was this anger against the system that carried the Brexit vote.  It has the power to rock the establishment once again by bringing down the crisis ridden Tory Government and bringing a Corbyn government to power.  Socialists in Ireland would welcome the return of a Corbyn government.  If such a government were to adopt a position of socialist opposition to the European Union, it would transform the situation.  A Corbyn government should seek to reopen negotiations and demand an entirely different relationship with the EU, including new trade and custom arrangements based on the interests of working-class people, not the 1%.  Corbyn could speak over the heads of the Commission, reaching out to class people across Europe in rejecting neoliberal rules, calling for co-ordinated action for green energy on a Europe-wide basis and popularising a socialist vision of Europe.  A left government would be able to call on workers throughout the Continent to fight the race to the bottom in their own countries, mobilising against attempts by their own governments or the EU to pursue punitive measures against other workers, be they in Britain, Ireland or elsewhere.  The workers' movement in Ireland should mobilise its resources as part of a Europe-wide fight back.</p>  <p>  Socialists are in favour of a genuinely united Europe.  This will be possible only with the socialist transformation of society, allowing the coming together of nations of Europe in a democratic, Europe-wide confederation.  We fight for socialism in Ireland, with full democratic rights for the Protestant community.  We are in favour of a free and voluntary socialist federation of Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales and a socialist "United States of Europe".</p>  <p>  I started by asking whether this agreement served the interests of working-class people.  Our answer is that it does not.  For this reason, we will vote against the Government's proposal.  The real challenge is for the working-class movement to carve out a genuine alternative to this system and what it offers to people, and to put the interests of working people at the heart of building such an alternative.</p></speech>

I cannot help but think about how that work and energy and those hours could have been better spent on other issues in Ireland, Europe and the world.</p>  <p>  While we respect the democratic vote of some 51% in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain, as did the majority in Scotland.  In Gibraltar, a significant 96% voted to remain.  Now, an ambiguity relating to Gibraltar may create Spanish opposition, but that will not prevent the agreement going through the EU.</p>  <p>  Protecting the Good Friday Agreement has been paramount.  That is obvious to us but not, I believe, to people in Britain.  The Good Friday Agreement was hard won and it is positive that a generation of young people in Northern Ireland have not experienced the violence, disruption and devastation that their parents and grandparents experienced during the troubles.  As such, it was difficult to listen to a vox pop last week when people who lived on the Border did not seem to mind about a border returning.  It was almost as if they were welcoming its return.  We know that position has been fuelled by DUP MPs.  One cannot help but think that, if they are not living in the past, then they want a return to it.</p>  <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and we have spent every meeting of the past year and a half hearing from a wide range of groups, organisations and officials about the potential impact of Brexit.  We did not hear anyone speak positively about Brexit.  However, there is the potential for Ireland to do better, as Brexit will remove our over-reliance on one particular market.  According to a statistic, if even 1% of firms relocated to Ireland, it could mean 6,000 jobs.</p>  <p>  Brexit is a wake-up call to the EU on the need to reconsider its vision, principles and values and to look honestly at the areas that are in need of reform.  There are deficiencies, an increasingly two-tiered EU in the growth of inequality and the dominance of certain EU powers.  We acknowledge that the EU recognised and respected how Ireland would be particularly affected by the withdrawal of Britain and the possible political and economic consequences for us.  I agree that Michel Barnier seemed to be on Ireland's side.</p>  <p>  There are positives to this agreement.  The transition period is good, as are the continued co-operation between North-South bodies, the electricity market, the common travel area and the backstop, which I hope will prevent the return of a border.  However, there are concerns, one of which has to do with community relations, which have been damaged.  We know how important community relations are.  Support for Brexit was strongest in unionist areas outside of Belfast whereas Remain was supported in most of the other areas.  Given the deterioration in community relations, it is time that we rebuild them and get them back on track.  In the Brexit debate, there has been almost a normalisation of anti-immigrant rhetoric as well as an increase in racist attacks in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  There are concerns around workers' rights.  With Britain out of the EU and a possible increase in competitiveness, workers will lose out.  If Britain is not bound by certain EU directives on the environment, environmental issues will also arise.</p>  <p>  There was a charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  It has not been implemented, and it is time to re-examine that matter.  The EU PEACE and Structural Funds have been valuable to the voluntary and community sector, which has used them for many projects, including in some of the most disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland.  There are communities there that feel hard done by and that they have not benefitted from the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  We have been so consumed by Brexit that other issues have been sidelined even further than they were.  There are outstanding issues from the Fresh Start and Stormont House agreements, for example, criminal justice, community engagement and preventing the return to militarism, not to mention the legacy issues.  In that regard, a section of the Stormont House Agreement deals with the past.  We know about the outstanding issues.  There were proposals on an historical investigations unit, an independent commission on information retrieval, an implementation and reconciliation group and an oral history archive, but all of these have been at a standstill.  In the midst of Brexit, there is a danger that the legacy issues will drop further down the list of priorities, assuming they were ever on it.  The Commission for Victims and Survivors needs to be considered.  Some interesting submissions have been made to it recently.</p>  <p>  I was watching this debate from my office.  It was all calm and orderly.  It appears that most Deputies are on the same page, which is positive.</p><p>However, I turned on the BBC news and what was happening in the House of Commons was a very different matter.  There were also some disquieting signals coming from Brussels.  While we may support the draft withdrawal agreement and it will be passed in this House as well as at EU level, there is no guarantee that it will get through the British Parliament.  That could mean going back to the drawing board because there are so many possible permutations and combinations.  Will it mean the downfall of Theresa May?  Will there be a change of Government?  Will there be a general election in the UK or even another referendum?  In the meantime, it is time for us to get back to the real business of life and living and the issues affecting people living in Northern Ireland, regardless of the senselessness of a small island with 26 counties in the EU and six outside.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100056#JJJ00200"><p>When I downloaded the 585 page draft agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU last Wednesday evening in my office, like many others, I turned very quickly to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland on page 302.  On first reading, the protocol seemed to satisfy Ireland&rsquo;s core and essential demand that there could not be a return to a hard border in Ireland.  The preface to the protocol acknowledged, among other basic realities, the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, the importance of the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement and the rights of Irish and EU citizens in Northern Ireland.  The commitment to unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and the UK being committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South and east-west co-operation also seemed to indicate that Michel Barnier, the EU 27 and the various UK negotiators had produced a reasonable compromise on avoiding a hard border and arranging the exit of the UK from the EU.  On a number of occasions during visits to this House, several Deputies stressed to Mr. Barnier how much we depended on EU solidarity with the Irish Government in this whole endeavour.</p>  <p>  The backstop in Article 2 of the protocol, the extension of the transition period in Article 3, the rights of individuals in Article 4 and the common travel area in Article 5 all set out the important basic requirements of preventing the return of a hard border.  Most important, Article 6 keeps the UK in the customs union but also refers to the joint committee adopting detailed rules for the two parts of this customs union before 1 July 2020.  I note that unfortunately, access to waters and fisheries is not covered by this commitment.  The reference to the single electricity market in Article 11 is noteworthy as are the common provisions in Article 15.  The specialised committee and the joint consultative working group on implementation of the protocol in Articles 16 and 17 and the review of the backstop protocol in Article 20, although framed very briefly, seem to give a basic guarantee that the protocol cannot be abandoned unilaterally by the UK and that the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland must have an input.</p>  <p>  While the protocol gives some satisfaction that the worst impacts of a no deal Brexit on Ireland, North and South, may be avoided, the substantive draft text of the overall agreement still faces a momentous challenge.  Of course, the profound east-west economic and social connections between Ireland and Britain would be best served by the UK remaining in the European Union and working with us to achieve much-needed democratic change in the European institutions.  I do not disagree with my colleagues who spoke earlier about a future democratic and socially just Europe.  This halfway house agreement continues the deep uncertainty for our economy and country which the withdrawal agreement now pushes out to December 2020 and possibly to late 2022.</p>  <p>  Articles 9 to 39 of the draft agreement refer to citizens&rsquo; rights but again Ireland is in a unique situation with the common travel area.  The Taoiseach informed me last week that bilateral agreements will have to be forged between Ireland and the UK in addition to the future trade relationship agreement between the EU and UK after 2020 because of the shaky legal basis of the common travel area.  Article 40 and subsequent articles deal with the divorce or separation provisions for the UK and the EU.  The UK Brexit department&rsquo;s commentary on the draft agreement refers to the EU economic and legal order in the UK being brought "to an orderly conclusion" which sounds very ominous for Ireland, North and South.  That said, sections like Articles 62 to 65 on ongoing police and judicial co-operation, Articles 70 to 74 on data and information and Articles 79 to 85 give some hope that a clear alignment of the EU and UK in key areas will continue after 2020 or 2022.</p>  <p>  Articles 126 to 132 of the withdrawal agreement on the transition period confirm that Brexit uncertainties and disruption may continue for many years into the future.  The UK has achieved a time limited implementation period from 29 March next up to 31 December 2020 which, remarkably, includes continued attendance at many EU meetings, especially around common foreign and security policy.  It is alarming for our fishing communities that the EU intends to negotiate its own fishing opportunities from 2021.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland gives the UK the right to request an extension of the implementation period before 1 July 2020 if a future agreement to supersede the protocol cannot be finalised by December 2020.  The UK then has the choice to either implement the agreed Northern Ireland backstop or to seek an extension of the implementation period.  </p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s financial settlement with the EU in Articles 133 to 157 of the withdrawal agreement will have significant implications for Ireland&rsquo;s budget after 2020.  The British Treasury has estimated the total to be in the region of between &euro;45 billion and &euro;60 billion.  The possible budgetary impact is worrying, despite reassurances from the Minister for Finance on the UK&rsquo;s continuing payments to the EU up to at least 2031 and possibly up to 2064 in the context of pensions.  We had a debate previously with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, on the proportion of an increased budgetary contribution that we will have to make to Europe.  Given the fact that we are now a net contributor, that proportion could be very significant, with estimates ranging from 0.102% to 0.112% or even 1.3%, as demanded by some MEPs.   </p>  <p>  Obviously, the draft agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol would seem to need a small miracle to pass through the House of Commons.  Like many others, I have closely followed the debate in the British Labour Party about the whole Brexit policy of UKIP and the chaotic Tory Government.  The admirable Keir Starmer, MP, has devised six tests that the British Labour Party believes any Brexit deal should include.  These tests are a future close relationship with the EU, the exact same benefits as the UK now has in the Single Market and customs union, the fair management of migration, rights and protections for workers, the protection of national security, including against crime, and being fair to all regions and nations of the UK.  It is hard to see how the draft agreement before us can possibly pass the second test.  In that context, it is understandable that many UK Labour Party representatives and activists want to reject the agreement and go all out to eject this terrible Tory Government.  Commentators such as the distinguished journalist, Paul Mason, have urged the party to offer a second referendum when the Prime Minister, Theresa May, is defeated on this deal and a general election comes about.  </p>  <p>  UK socialists and social democrats, in common with the broad left across Europe and in this House, need to look again at the core reasons behind the UK vote for Brexit.  These include protest at the bureaucratic and remote character of the EU institutions and the ferocious race to the bottom character of much EU economic policy, including the disastrous unregulated financialisation which devastated so many EU countries in the crash from 2008 and which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael implemented here.  The unforgivable treatment of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and many regions of the larger states created the atmosphere which produced Brexit.  Those of us who want a confederal Europe - arguably most of us in this House - see that President Macron and Chancellor Merkel still have not learned the lessons of Brexit.  The fantasist who is now the President of France, Mr. Macron, is demanding a European army while his own people put on yellow high-vis jackets and march on the streets in pursuit of their rights.  It would be best if the UK stayed beside us and worked to reform Europe.  Its departure will leave Ireland as the only common law jurisdiction in the EU.</p>  <p>  The negotiation process led by Mr. Barnier has been predicated on making it very hard for any state to leave the EU.  Indeed leaving the EU has been compared to the Eagle&rsquo;s old song "Hotel California" where "you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave".  In the draft agreement before us the UK, even from the Brexiteer point of view, has at least got out of the hotel lobby and is now in the hotel grounds.  For that reason and respecting the vote of the British people, the UK should accept the agreement and we in this country should use the breathing space to 2020 or 2022 to encourage Britain to rejoin us in the EU in a campaign for major changes to EU institutions and laws and especially for the retention of the EU&rsquo;s confederal character.</p><p>I will be supporting the T&aacute;naiste's motion.  I am also happy that he should accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100057#KKK00200"><p>In supporting the motion, I wish first to commend the many politicians, of every party and none, and the public officials, together with those in the many sectoral areas, who worked tirelessly to come to this draft agreement that is before us.  In saying that, I preface my remarks by saying that this House respects the UK vote.  We regret their decisions.  If the UK does wish to leave, we will resolve to minimise any damage to the people and our economy, both North and South, but more importantly to maintain peace on our island.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Brexit is a regressive and retrograde step.  It is ridiculously wrong that such exhaustive resources and time has had to be committed to resolving the issue.  The biggest R that I find in all of this rhetoric is for this House and Government to be ready for all eventualities.  I say to those who seem to desire that cliff-edge Brexit that the cards have been dealt and one has to know when to hold them and when to fold them.  I say to the DUP that the Good Friday Agreement protects all our constitutional rights.  The deal on offer is about ensuring that our all-island economy strives, and continues to strive, struggle and succeed.  I say to them to forget their ideologies.  This draft withdrawal agreement is about the unity of our people and, as I have said many times, not about our land.  It is all about our base and that is our families, especially our young, and that unity is in the interests of both our islands' progression, peace and prosperity.</p>  <p>  Theresa May has a long way to go to achieve consensus on the agreement for her side, and I wish her well in that uphill struggle.  While the Minister and others have said the agreement was not open to negotiation, Mrs. May was in Brussels today in the scramble to finalise a deal in time for Sunday's summit.  While I know that Theresa May is trying her best to achieve consensus on the Brexit agreement, officials today in the EU are hinting that Sunday's EU summit could be cancelled, with one official saying he would need to have agreed the political declaration on the future relationship beforehand and we are not there yet.</p>  <p>  In my view, Theresa May is a long way off achieving any agreement in her own Parliament.  As a Border Deputy, the impact on the North of our island and the Border region, which I represent, cannot be underestimated.  The Irish and British Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and therefore this must be respected in all its parts.  The fact that the parties in the North cannot reach agreement to restore power-sharing does not help our situation.</p>  <p>  This week, the European Ombudsman called on the European Commission to publish a key document spelling out all the areas of North-South co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement that are at risk from Brexit.  This document came about following the mapping exercise which was jointly carried out by the UK and EU in 2017 to identify all of the areas which were at risk and which discovered that there were more than 150 areas contained in the Good Friday Agreement which were underpinned by EU law.  When will we have sight of this most important document?  I believe it covers a wide range and array of cross-Border topics, such as trade, animal health, tourism and environment, cross-Border fraud prevention and mutual recognition of professional qualifications, to name but a few.  These are some of the areas that I wish to mention today as a resident of north County Louth.  The practical changes that a no-deal Brexit would present are enormous.  Many of my neighbours have to travel across the Border daily, some students, some farmers, some transporting produce and other goods, and some healthcare workers.  I could go on and on.</p>  <p>  Dominic Raab, after his resignation, admitted he did not realise the full extent of UK trade on the Dover-Calais crossing.  I am quite sure he also has no idea what Brexit means to the Border region in Ireland and the Irish-British trade route.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus for a few moments on the young people, many of whom feel their voices have not been heard.  One young person's blog, called "Brexit will define my generation, yet young people's voices are still ignored", pointed out that they are already set to be worse off than their parents and now they face another assault, through Brexit, on their futures.  I also watched a video of young people in Northern Ireland on the threat of Brexit which was contrary to what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has said.  They were called the children of the peace process.  They said they had never known a border, never mind a hard border.  The sectarian divide, they said, is palpable again in the North because of Brexit.  These young people are speaking out against Brexit and in favour of peace.  They have never known that hard border and they have never witnessed the terrible violence of the past and do not wish to return to it.  They say that they are being completely ignored and do not have a government in the North to speak up for them, even though the majority of the North voted to remain.  On that, I commend the Irish Government in taking young people in to listen to their voices, and indeed other sectoral interests in the North, when they had nobody to speak to.</p>  <p>  Across the UK, the consumer organisation Which? found that, among the 18 to 34 year olds in the UK, 64% say they are concerned about the consequences of any Brexit.  The same survey stated that the older generation, the over 65s, are becoming increasingly concerned about Brexit.  While the majority of the older generation voted to leave the EU, 61% of them are now just as worried about Brexit as the young voting group.  In fact, the Which? survey found that almost two out of three people nationwide in the UK now have very serious concerns.</p>  <p>  This is another reason Theresa May has a job on her hands, not only to convince the Parliament but to convince her people.  I firmly believe that, despite all of the hard work that has gone in from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to get us to where we are today, this agreement may still not have the backing of the British Parliament.</p>  <p>  Whether the deal gets through or not, there is no Brexit outcome that is economically good for Ireland or indeed for the islands.  It is a worry that it seems to me that our Government here has been operating on the basis of an agreement.  There is no serious contingency plan for a no-deal Brexit.  I know the UK Government has already published 85 guidance notes on a no-deal Brexit scenario covering a range of possible areas affected, from consumer rights to climate change, medicines, blood and blood products and many more.  I am asking a simple question today.  How prepared are we in Ireland for a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100057#KKK00300"><p>In welcoming the draft withdrawal agreement, and recognising the painstaking work by teams of politicians and officials from the EU and Britain which went into its negotiation, we should all remind ourselves that this withdrawal agreement remains, at very best, the second-best available option.  The best option remains Britain remaining in the European Union by reconsidering the absolute political and economic folly that is Brexit.</p>  <p>  At this stage, we should not completely discount the possibility that a cross-party political consensus can be built in the House of Commons for a second Brexit referendum, a referendum where the option to remain within the EU is on the ballot paper.  While the issue of holding a second referendum is a matter for the Parliament in Westminster alone to decide, we should not deny that we have a vital, national interest in that discussion and, obviously, in its outcome.</p>  <p>  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has strongly argued, particularly in the past week, that the draft withdrawal agreement represents the worst of all worlds for Britain.  He called it an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable as it tries to keep Britain in step with Europe's trade rules while, at the same time, reserving the right to depart from them.  Mr. Blair outlined the myriad complexities still to be confronted in everything from fishing to mobile telephony, and that is apart from the Government of the day dealing with its day-to-day challenges, and all of these problems are before we get to the issue of the Border and the backstop.  Tony Blair and John Major, both of whom contributed so much to the peace process on this island, explicitly warned politicians during the referendum campaign that Brexit would have serious and damaging consequences for the Irish Border and the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>They were both roundly abused for their pains and their opinions.  The fact that both of these issues are comprehensively addressed in the withdrawal agreement and were not left to the negotiations on future arrangements should remind British decision makers of their massive importance to both us and the entire EU 27 and of their continuing centrality to the process.  It is a credit to the work of the Government and its skilled and committed officials across the European Union, especially in Brussels, in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote that the Irish Border and the Good Friday Agreement were identified as one of the three key issues to be addressed in the first round of talks between the European Union and Britain.  In my own work on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I have, along with colleagues from all parties and none, engaged actively with parliamentarians from most of the other EU member states, and particularly with colleagues from Britain, on these critical issues.  We have outlined the concerns of the Irish people, North and South.  </p> <p> However, the fact that so much of the draft withdrawal agreement is devoted to these issues should not cause us to imagine that all is well and that all possible and potential concerns have been finally addressed.  There has been much focus among pro-Brexit Members of Parliament and the media on a phrase that appears on page 302 of the draft agreement.  That paragraph reads, "RECALLING the Union's and the United Kingdom's intention to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing".  There is increasing chatter and commentary in the media suggesting that the British Government may have some wriggle room around the definition of the phrase "alternative arrangements".  Some are saying that the Brexiteers within the British Cabinet see the lack of clarity about what this phrase may mean as allowing them to load expectations onto the words.  One such expectation is a return to the nonsense talk of some months back regarding technological solutions and the infamous maximum facilitation, "max fac".  We in this House need to make it clear that the definition of "alternative arrangements" is not for the Brexiteer wing of the Tory Party to decide.  It is a matter for the EU 27 and Ireland must be 100% satisfied about any alternative arrangements.  That means no change from the current day-to-day operations of the Border, which is a border I cross many times a week as I go about my normal constituency activity.</p> <p> I support this motion, subject to these concerns and knowing that we on this island need to provide sufficient supports to businesses and small and medium enterprises to help them deal with the impact of Brexit.  The reality is that there is no such thing as a good Brexit deal.  The ongoing political instability in Britain, including the uncertainty of the political viability of this draft agreement, makes it absolutely essential that the Government steps up its work to have detailed contingency plans in place for all eventualities.  It is to be hoped those plans would never need to be operated or called into use.  </p> <p> I agree with my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, that it is shameful that there is no voice representing the people of Northern Ireland.  It is so regrettable that at a time when Northern Ireland needs a clear voice coming from an assembly and an executive, a government, such a voice has now been absent for most of two years.  The political system in this House and in this State has worked very hard, consistently, and constructively in supporting the Government in its efforts to ensure that there is a good deal and that we are not impacted adversely by Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100058#LLL00200"><p>I am happy to make some brief remarks on this important issue.  The publication by the European Commission of the withdrawal agreement was supposed to provide some sort of clarity.  We all waited eagerly for it, but I am worried about what clarity it has provided.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an T&aacute;naiste.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his officials because this night last week he gave us a very extensive briefing on the deal which was on the table which went on late into the night.  Unfortunately we seem to have the exact opposite of clarity.  The Commission spoke about how it hoped that the agreement would ensure that the withdrawal would happen in an orderly manner and offer legal certainty regarding when the treaties and EU law will cease to apply to the UK.  Again there has been a near total absence of consensus on how this can happen despite the publication of the text.</p><p>A central question is whether the agreement itself is, as one UK Member of Parliament put it, dead on arrival.  Did it ever have any hope of generating broad support?  We know that the Prime Minister, Theresa May, is in serious difficulty and, at the very least, that the process will result in an even more deeply fractured UK with all of the consequences that follow on from that for this island of ours.  The political bullets flying around Westminster are getting perilously close to causing untold damage here in our country.  </p><p>In terms of the parts of the withdrawal agreement that affect us most, we of course have to look at the protocol dealing with the North.  This element of the deal offers a legally operable backstop to ensure that there will be no hard border between North and South.  Having listened to Deputy Brendan Smith, who lives on the Border, I am very familiar with the area myself and it would be unthinkable to go back to a border regime.  The protocol also contains UK commitments not to diminish rights set out in the Good Friday Agreement and to protect North-South co-operation.  That is very important.  I was pretty pleased when the T&aacute;naiste outlined the agreement to us because the Good Friday Agreement has to be sacrosanct.  Too much hard work was done in getting that agreement for it to be otherwise.  I salute my former colleague, Dr. Martin Mansergh, who was an adviser in that process at the time.  </p><p>The agreement provides for the possibility of continuing the common travel area arrangements between Ireland and the UK and preserves the single electricity market, the SEM, on the island of Ireland.  It would have been protected in any case.  I was puzzled as to why the SEM was even mentioned because, as the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, has pointed out:</p><blockquote>The SEM is clearly established in national law in both the UK and Ireland.  It is not the result of laws transposed directly from any EU-level directive.  Thus the SEM as a standalone product of UK-Irish bilateral co-operation would remain unaltered in its legal constitution by the UK&rsquo;s departure, as it is primarily the product of concerted co-operation between the energy regulators and government ministers in Dublin and Belfast dating from the early 2000s.</blockquote><p>Regardless of all of this, the agreement is very much to be welcomed.  The fact remains, however, that the economic impact on almost every other sector is uncertain.  It is very uncertain across a wide range of areas.  We are still unclear as to whether Mrs. May can get this over the line.  We are also unclear as to whether there is going to be a Tory heave against her and even more unclear about what would happen should she fall and be replaced by someone who rushes towards a hard Brexit.  A hard or crash-out Brexit should be totally anathema to any right-thinking person in our Twenty-six Counties at this stage.  We are just not ready for it.  We do not know the implications of it or the limits of those implications going forward.  When one reads the hard-negotiated agreement which has been thrashed out and sees the annexes to it, the lack of agreement attached to it, and the issues to be dealt with much further down the road, one really becomes aware of the complexity of it all.</p><p>On top of all this we have the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, today saying that Spain will reject the withdrawal deal if it does not include a clarification in the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste back to the Chamber and I thank him for having been here all evening for the debate.  I heard no mention of this issue when we had that late night meeting this night last week.</p><p>Could the T&aacute;naiste clarify in his reply whether this is a new issue?  Will others among the 27 member states come up with different issues they want to sort out as part of this deal?  That is to say nothing of the bind that our unionist friends in the DUP have placed on Prime Minister May.  In reality, how could they be expected to do anything else?  We knew all the time that they had her in a bind and their support is based on support for the union, and them being in the union.  They are unionists who value the union of the United Kingdom and they will not be coerced or bullied into abandoning those principles regardless of the impact.  If nothing else, we should know that by now.  While there is something admirable in that, it is also veering very close to political recklessness.</p> <p> One might say that this is not the end but it is the beginning of the end.  That is where we seem to be.  The withdrawal agreement is seen by some as a moderate compromise, with give and take on both sides.  I believe that is what it is.  By others, it is seen as an act of political betrayal and folly that has not been seen for generations.  Abraham Lincoln once said, "I walk slowly but I never walk backward."  To be fair to Mrs. May, that seems to be her approach too.  She is attempting to bring the process over the line without dragging us back to a point where no agreement is possible or even desired.  That would be a disaster for all of us.  In fairness, I would say the same for our own negotiating team of the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach.  This is far too serious an issue to be used for cheap political point scoring.  I support the motion and wish it well.</p> <p> There is only one Teachta from Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is a pity that party does not take its seats in Westminster.  It is also a pity that the Stormont assembly is not sitting given the importance of the process that is affecting the nation at this point in time.</p></speech>

My Rural Independent Alliance colleague, Deputy Harty, made a valid point earlier this year when he pointed out that the Government is dedicating a lot of time to preventing the impact of Brexit from causing damage.  Deputy Harty was right when he said closing the post offices in rural areas is like encouraging an "internal Brexit".  I could not agree more with him on that point.  In my local constituency area in the past two years alone I have seen the closure of post offices, schools, pubs, shops, butchers, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, petrol stations and an insurance office in Bantry.  Even today the blood pressure clinic in Bantry closed.</p>  <p>  In addition we have seen the continued closure of Garda stations such as the Garda station in Ballinspittle.  Those are all vital services for rural communities, and without them we are seeing a very serious situation develop in rural areas where towns and villages are literally dying before our eyes.  As Deputy Harty says, he would equate that to an internal Brexit where there is a detrimental effect in rural areas similar to the damage a hard Brexit would wreak nationally.  The Government must put measures in place to protect Ireland from Brexit, but it must also take urgent action to protect and restore rural Ireland to its former glory.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned about the cross-border directive if Brexit comes about.  This directive is very important to people in this country as it allows those who are on long waiting lists for health procedures to travel to Belfast and have the procedure carried out without having to endure the long waiting times.  To date, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have sent 17 buses to Belfast with people who have availed of cataract procedures through the cross-border directive.  Those people could have been waiting for anything up to five years if they were not able to avail of the directive.  During the Brexit negotiations we must ensure that the cross-border directive is protected with Northern Ireland and Britain.</p>  <p>  There are two Ministers in the House.  Could one of them assure me that they have been discussing such issues in the negotiations?  If so, it is time to be clear on what will happen with the cross-border directive and other issues that are very serious concerns.  Many people are seriously alarmed that such reciprocal arrangements could end, perhaps in March.  Will they end or are there negotiations to continue the arrangements during a cooling-off period?  It is time for the Government to clarify the position.  Negotiations are taking place and we need to be aware of what is going on.</p>  <p>  Brexit will have many implications for Ireland, some of which we can predict and others which we cannot, but one thing is for sure, there will be a lot of challenges ahead for Ireland.  It is vital during the Brexit negotiations that we steer through these waters with a clear vision of what Brexit will mean to Ireland.  We need to pay particular attention to the agriculture sector.  In June the Taoiseach announced the Government's proposal to hire 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors as part of Ireland's Brexit preparation.  The concern is that this could be negative in the event of a reduced availability of farmed animal veterinary services, as it would draw vets away for State work.  The chief executive of Veterinary Ireland suggested that some of this work could be opened up to private veterinary practitioners in a similar way to how work is carried out in meat factories, where part-time, temporary veterinary inspectors successfully assist official veterinarians.  The Government needs to look at the suggestions.  Ministers cannot afford to put their heads in the sand on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, needs to be protected post-Brexit.  We must examine that now and put provisions in place.  Ireland is very much dependent on agricultural exports.  The food industry is the most exposed sector of the economy to Brexit, especially subsectors such as processed foods, beef and dairy.  Ireland exports almost 70% of its agricultural produce to Britain.  The report carried out by Copenhagen Economics for the Government estimates that the UK's departure from the European Union will cause the value of output from these key parts of the agrifood sector to fall between 10% and 20% by 2030.  The sector currently employs 175,000 people and that could mean 17,000 fewer jobs or more than 30,000 fewer jobs in the event of a hard Brexit.  It is vital during the Brexit negotiations that our agricultural produce being exported to Britain is protected.</p>  <p>  In addition to the agricultural exports, we need to protect all our export markets.  We must maintain strong and competitive transport links with the rest of the EU in order to secure Ireland's economic future.  Two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK landbridge to access Europe and Brexit is going to have a significant effect on Ireland's ability to use that route for exports.  We must consider negotiating transport routes now.</p>  <p>  Coming from west Cork I know only too well how much fishermen have suffered during very difficult times.  In recent years, Irish fishermen hoped for a brighter future after battling through the recession, but Brexit puts them in uncharted waters.  On average, it is estimated that approximately 36% of Irish landings are taken from UK waters.  Irish fishermen face losing access to lucrative UK fishing grounds currently in EU waters and may have problems transporting their catch.  From speaking to local fishermen I know they feel the industry has had a raw deal and they do not trust the Government to deliver.  It is vital that we protect the livelihood of fishermen as there is a serious danger of increased numbers of European boats fishing in Irish waters post-Brexit.  I ask the Minister to give a clear answer as to what will happen if European trawlers are dismissed from UK waters.  Has the Government considered the issue or is the fishing industry going to play second fiddle yet again?  Only yesterday Spain got the all-clear from Europe for 5,559 tonnes of bluefin tuna quota.  No matter how good Patrick Murphy, the CEO of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, is at fighting for fishermen, if the Government does not have its eye on the ball the future of fishermen after Brexit looks very bleak.  I spoke to an inshore fisherman in Schull this evening.  He outlined to me the difficulties they face even prior to Brexit never mind what could happen after it.  That is quite scary.</p>  <p>  Neither can we forget about the effect Brexit will have on ports and the export market.  In my constituency we have ports such as Bantry Bay, Castletown Berehaven and Kinsale.  Their futures need to be secured.  I plead with the Government to support those ports through the uncertain times that lie ahead with Brexit on the horizon.</p>  <p>  We must also ensure the future of Irish citizens living in the UK as a matter of urgency.  No Irish citizen living in the UK should have to live in fear.  We must further ensure that during Brexit negotiations there will be freedom of movement between us and our neighbours.  In addition, during the Brexit negotiations we must consider what will happen to Irish students studying in the UK.  This a great worry for many of them.  Overall, it is clear that Brexit will have a significant effect on Ireland and we need to step up to the challenges that lie ahead for the country and put the provisions in place to deal with the challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100059#MMM00300"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for being here this evening.  Brexit is bad for everybody, no matter what format it takes.  The UK has sought it but the consequent adjustments that all will have to make to accommodate Brexit are mostly negative.  Brexit will have profoundly negative economic implications for Ireland regardless of it being a hard or soft option.</p><p>In the case of a hard Brexit it may be catastrophic by adding a measure of political uncertainty to the hard-won Northern Ireland peace process.  In the case of a soft Brexit Ireland will be losing a vast market for goods, especially agricultural goods.  Those of us in County Clare are very worried.  The county is substantially dependent on agriculture and tourism.  Farmers are concerned that access to the UK markets will be damaged.  Farming is the backbone of rural Ireland and so any form of Brexit would be bad, but a hard Brexit would be devastating for the farming community, especially since 40% of agricultural exports go to the United Kingdom.  Those in the tourism industry are also concerned as those in business and industry hate uncertainty.</p> <p> Once the UK exits the European Union Shannon Airport will be without connectivity to a European hub.  Currently, the airport is not linked to a hub on mainland Europe and at the moment European connectivity is serviced through Heathrow Airport, London.  Shannon Airport and foreign direct investment and tourism in the west of Ireland will be challenged in overcoming the problems faced by an organised Brexit.  A hard Brexit is unthinkable.  Right now, the Shannon Group is calling on the Government for support in protecting EU connectivity.  The company is asking for a connectivity funding programme to secure strategic routes.  Shannon needs access to a European Union hub.</p> <p> The UK has sought its freedom, for want of a better term, from Europe by removing itself from the largest free trade zone in the world.  This is quite unbelievable.  Brexit was voted on without informed consent and thus its validity must be questioned.  Misinformation was used to influence the vote.  This was not apparently from outside the UK but from within.  Hard Brexiteers have put narrow national self-interest above a wider world view.  They have neither put stability and co-operation above chaos and dissension nor the fragile peace ahead of old sectarian rhetoric and old-fashioned century-old politics.  Brexit is the triumph of misguided ideology over pragmatism.</p> <p> Economic models tell us that countries trade with their neighbours.  Yet, the UK is rejecting its neighbours for people tens of thousands of miles across the globe.  It prefers the World Trade Organization to the EU and fictional trade deals to real trade deals.  Brexit was fermented in a vat of misinformation and opportunism.  It was rendered by a Tory government that put party before country.</p> <p> In Northern Ireland, the DUP has rejected what is possibly the best deal available.  Those in the party claim to be the true upholders of the union with the United Kingdom while supporting Brexiteers who will undermine the UK no matter what the cost politically or economically.  The DUP prefers a no-deal to a good deal in defiance of the wishes of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland, including those in businesses and the farming community.  The party has ignored the fact that Northern Ireland has always been different from the UK.</p> <p> If the DUP is a prisoner of history and outdated ideology, so too is Sinn Fein.  The focus on the DUP in this debate is understandable but there seems be some reluctance, to date anyway, to take a hard look at what Sinn F&eacute;in is doing.  The lack of an Assembly in Northern Ireland denies Sinn F&eacute;in a voice that could articulate views other than those of the DUP.  This has allowed strands 2 and 3 of the Good Friday Agreement to wither.  It is clear that the health of the North-South institutions is in decline.  The maintenance of human rights in the North was to be ensured by the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as by the European Convention on Human Rights.  Brexit will sever these guarantees.</p> <p> The DUP has ten seats at Westminster and Sinn F&eacute;in has seven.  In the past, there have been many Irish nationalist voices at Westminster.  John Hume, Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan were among the most distinguished of them.  Now, there is no voice of nationalism from Northern Ireland to be heard in the House of Commons because Sinn F&eacute;in members will not take their seats and vote.  I understand the historical reasons for abstentionism.  They date from a time when Ireland was clamouring for its independence and the right to take its place among the nations of the world.  What was apparent, appropriate and pragmatic 100 years ago may not be the answer to the needs of today.  We all must change and evolve.  I urge Sinn F&eacute;in members to take their seats and defend the Good Friday Agreement in this perilous hour.</p> <p> The European Commission and the other 27 capitals of the European Union have supported the necessity of defending the Good Friday Agreement by preventing a hard border.  Mrs. May is trying to deliver a Brexit deal that will achieve this aim.  Sinn F&eacute;in should support this aim.  The status of Northern Ireland within the withdrawal agreement is similar to Schroedinger's cat, simultaneously inside and outside the European Union and occupying the best of both worlds.  This is the most apt analogy because it confers on Northern Ireland a special status with special benefits.  Yet, the DUP interprets the draft withdrawal agreement as diminishing the status of Northern Ireland rather than enhancing its status.</p> <p> The complexities of the Border between the North and South of this island did not feature in the run-up to the Brexit referendum at all yet the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland has been the most contentious and difficult issue to resolve.  We should remember that the backstop will only be triggered should a final overall agreement not be finalised at the end of the transition period in July 2020.  Within the withdrawal agreement the Northern Ireland backstop has become a UK-wide backstop.  Thus there will be no barriers to trade either North-South across the border or east-west across the Irish Sea.  The backstop is not time-limited, it is legally binding and it requires mutual agreement to end it.  The backstop, if triggered, would make Northern Ireland a special case.  It would be part of a single UK-EU customs territory.  It would allow a level playing field between the EU and the UK.  It would benefit from the EU customs code, allowing Northern Ireland businesses to place products on the Single Market and the UK market.  Northern Ireland would remain aligned to a limited set of rules relating to the Single Market to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  This gives Northern Ireland the best of both worlds economically.  This has been recognised by the farming and business communities in Northern Ireland.  It is certainly better than no deal.  However, reality does not influence the hard Brexiteers.  A no-deal hard Brexit and the consequent hard border will damage both countries.  At the end of the day we must prepare for the fact that, while Mrs. May cannot be underestimated, the mathematics of the House of Commons is against the draft withdrawal agreement.</p> <p> I support the motion and commend the Irish Government on reaching the best possible Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100060#NNN00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  Of all the debates held in the House, being present for the debate this evening, with everyone being involved and everyone having their say from the various groups, is most important.  The result of any vote on the agreement represents what I believe to be all of us putting our shoulders to the wheel at this critical time.  That is most important.</p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am the Chairman, has been closely monitoring the progress of the Brexit negotiations since the referendum vote in 2016.  We have been following the entire process.  We have considered the various statements and conclusions of the Council of the European Union and the European Council during the past two and a half years.  These have paved the way for the draft withdrawal agreement.  While the details seldom emerged in public, apart from at the staging posts, it is clear from looking at the draft agreement that Michel Barnier's taskforce has been hard at work all this time.  Throughout the Brexit process I have spoken in this Chamber and at meetings of the joint committee about the need for decisive progress on Brexit.  I said that the clock was ticking and that time was running out.  Now, here it is.  After long negotiations we now have a draft of the withdrawal agreement.  I think it is great that we are finally seeing all of the technical detail of the withdrawal agreement and that the negotiating teams are suggesting that we consider it now, even if it is a little close to the wire.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, our Ministers and all the officials who have been working hard to ensure that Ireland's interest are heard in Europe.  The Government has succeeded in making our case in Europe and ensured that Ireland has been kept at the top of the Brexit agenda.  That is terribly important.  In parallel, many Members have been conscientious in doing their part by engaging with parliamentary delegations from EU member states and explaining the unique Irish situation.  On account of all of that work there is strong understanding of the challenges posed by the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Only this week at the meeting of COSAC, the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, the delegations from the French and German parliaments tabled a proposal for an amendment.  It stressed that the Good Friday Agreement must be protected unconditionally for a sustainable solution for all Irish citizens and emphasised the need for solidarity towards Ireland.</p><p>The amendment was accepted.  This is just a small example of the important solidarity we have been afforded by our European partners.  It is important to recognise that.  As I have said on previous occasions, there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland, the UK or the EU.  However, I respect the result of the referendum vote.  We all need to move forward, and this draft agreement allows us to do that.  It is not perfect, but it provides a workable solution to the biggest public policy challenge we have faced as a nation in decades.</p> <p> In view of the circumstances, we should welcome and support the draft withdrawal agreement.  It is important that a strong backstop is put in place.  We need that guarantee and the draft agreement provides it.  It is important that the backstop will be in place for as long as it is needed and will only be replaced when we have found something better.  The draft agreement provides for that.  It is also very important that there is a sufficient transition period.  People in the UK, Ireland and the EU need time to prepare for the effect of Brexit on their businesses and communities.  The draft agreement provides for that.  It is important that Irish citizens living in the UK are able to continue with their lives, and the draft agreement provides for that.  It is important that the common travel area will continue, and the draft agreement will provide for that.  It is important that all parts of the Good Friday agreement are protected and that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to the draft agreements commits not to diminish the rights set out in that agreement, and that North-South co-operation is protected.  It is important that the unique single electricity market on the island of Ireland is protected so that there is no disruption in our homes, and the draft agreement provides for that.</p> <p> We have a draft withdrawal agreement.  It seems to mitigate most of the worst affects of Brexit, but not all of them.  There are many hurdles yet to be traversed, including agreeing the withdrawal with all sides.  The draft withdrawal agreement has been cleared by Theresa May&rsquo;s cabinet, but that, as we know, was far from straightforward.  Getting the withdrawal treaty through the House of Commons will be an enormous challenge, and we do not know how that will go.  The full text of the draft withdrawal agreement also has to be agreed by the European Council and the European Parliament.  These are all important hurdles that must be cleared.</p> <p> There are just over four months until Brexit.  There is a lot of work to be done between now and then.  We will have a lot of work to do afterwards as the EU and the UK start to negotiate the second phase and the details of their future relationship.  We must remember that all of this is just the first stage, but it now looks like it is the beginning of the end of the first stage.  Realistically, it will be a very long time before the Brexit process is finished.  There might be many years of discussions and negotiations before the terms of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU are finally agreed and implemented.  I still hope that we manage to get to the end of it with a good and strong relationship.  It is vital to remember that our farmers, our business people, those in the tourism sector and our fishermen, who we have already spoken about tonight, did not dream up the idea of Brexit.  They are the bystanders whose lives and incomes will be affected detrimentally by it.  That is why all politicians - including our Government, Irish officials and everyone in this House - must play their part.  That joint effort is a good defence of the people we were elected to represent and who we are duty bound to stand by.  We must be there to support them and watch out for their interests.  They did not vote for Brexit.  They are not the politicians who dreamt it up.  Others did that, and they can be judged on their actions.  History will judge them - they are already being judge - on the basis of their actions.  To date, the Government, its negotiators and the Members of this House have not let the people down.  Everyone has worked diligently, and we will all continue to work to do the right thing by the people at all times.  I welcome the draft withdrawal agreement and believe this house should support it.  We should all, in our own little way, put our shoulders to the wheel and do the right thing by Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="20:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100061#OOO00200"><p>In previous debates on Brexit, many Deputies have repeatedly urged that, in the context of the negotiations, the British Government should outline its exact plans for avoiding a hard border in Ireland and indicate what the final arrangement for the Border will look like.  Unfortunately, we still have not seen those plans.  It seems that in reaching this agreement, Prime Minister May has managed to shock many in her Cabinet into resigning.  The political infighting in the Conservative Party has been allowed to hamper and delay these negotiations to such an extent that the deal agreed last week already seems to be in grave danger.</p>  <p>  While the contents of the agreement are to be broadly welcomed - and I pay tribute to the hard work of Ministers, civil servants and others involved in the negotiations - there was a sense of unreality from Government last week that was not helpful.  In the context of the very tricky political arithmetic that Prime Minister May faces in the House of Commons, the hubris in which the Government and others chose to engage was, in my view, damaging.  I welcome the fact that we have a calm motion before us tonight.  There was a danger that this motion might be a different kind of motion, but it is calm, short and to the point, and it is the correct approach to take.  It is right that the Irish parliament endorses that motion.  The Social Democrats are very happy to do that.  I do not believe that the two amendments tabled are particularly helpful.  Many of us might have sought changes to the motion and to add on various important things relevant to this whole issue, but it is important that a very straightforward, unanimous decision is made by Irish parliamentarians.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Government welcomed the content of the draft withdrawal agreement enthusiastically.  That was not helpful in terms of quelling the fears of even moderate Brexiteers that this deal was anything other than a capitulation to the demands of the EU 27.  A difficult balance must be struck in that regard, particularly as what is very good for Ireland is seen as being very bad for the UK.  This is an extremely sensitive matter and people must tread a very careful line.  Similarly, the DUP, whose crucial votes in the House of Commons seem to be slipping through the Prime Minister&rsquo;s fingers, will undoubtedly have been put in a position where it could not be seen to be supporting anything that Dublin was welcoming so heartily.  This view is shared by many hard-line Brexiteers in the Conservative Party and the British Labour Party.  Kate Hoey, for example, described elements of the backstop arrangement yesterday in the Belfast Telegraph as &ldquo;look[ing] like they were written by the Irish Government".</p>  <p>  I attended the briefing with the T&aacute;naiste and his staff late last Wednesday night.  I and others were very appreciative of that briefing; it was worthwhile.  However, it would have been helpful if other party representatives had a greater insight into the actual politics of the issue.  We had confidence that the Government had negotiated a good deal on our behalf but the politics of the situation in the UK and the relationship between the UK, Ireland and the EU will ultimately decide the outcome of Brexit.</p><p>It would have been helpful if we had more discussion in that regard.  <br/><br/>It was a short-lived thing, but there were times last Wednesday when the reaction to the deal on the part of representatives of both the Government and other parties showed a lack of appreciation of how the mechanics and operation of this draft agreement are so intimately bound to the political reality in Westminster.  While many may lambaste those in the Conservative Party and the DUP who seem to be intent on making their constituents poorer in order to further their particular political agenda, we must accept that the composition of the House of Commons will remain as it is until such time as there is a general election.  While many are predicting that will happen soon, this may not necessarily be the case.  That is why the reality with which the Government is dealing must be recognised and everybody should be mindful of the very difficult situation in which Prime Minister May finds herself. <br/><br/>I note with interest the comments by Amber Rudd this morning, who effectively contradicted the Prime Minister by saying the British Cabinet would act to prevent a no-deal situation in the event that the draft agreement fails to make its way through the House of Commons.  That was a welcome comment.  With these mixed signals in mind, I wish to ask the Minister a question I have previously raised in this Chamber.  What will be the practical response of the Irish Government if the unthinkable happens and the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal in place next March?  Is a clear contingency plan in place to ensure that the land Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland remains open?  Given the very volatile and unpredictable situation in Westminster, it is imperative that we are well prepared for this eventuality.  While it has been said by others, we continue to be in a situation in which we hope for the best but must prepare properly for the worst.  <br/><br/>While the focus of our attention is on the UK, it should not be forgotten that other EU states will be directly affected by Brexit.  One such state is Cyprus, as thousands of Cypriots are employed on two British army bases in the south of the island which are considered sovereign British territory.  Another such state is Spain.  I note that reports emerged yesterday that the Spanish Government is unhappy with certain elements of the withdrawal agreement as they relate to the relationship between Gibraltar and the EU.  I urge the Minister to engage carefully with his counterparts to ensure that the hard work on the deal is not scuppered by last-minute local political concerns in the EU 27, if it does manage to pass through the House of Commons.<br/><br/>If this issue is drawn out or if there is an extension, we simply do not know what other issues might come into play in a year or two that will affect the EU's attitude.  We do not know if it will be possible to hold the EU together in that regard, which is why it is so important to get to a point at an early stage where there is an agreement on the final deal.  Things will not always remain the way they are within the other member states.  There is a genuine fear that the political situation in other countries could change.  Attitudes to the EU could change in the next couple of years, which could make reaching a final agreement all the more difficult.<br/><br/>While there is an acceptance that this deal, if endorsed by the UK and EU, is the best that can be negotiated, it bears repeating that there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland.  Regardless of the UK's relationship with the European Union, it is inevitable that the relationship between our two states will be diminished.  It is a great shame for Ireland that a state with which we shared a common position on many aspects of the European project is leaving the bloc, particularly a state which enjoyed as much influence in shaping the EU of today as did the UK.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Government in building new alliances with small EU states similar to ourselves.  These relationships will undoubtedly prove crucial in the future, when the dust of Brexit settles and the day-to-day functioning of the EU readjusts to the reality of the UK's absence. <br/><br/>I wish to draw attention to one particular area of the draft withdrawal agreement that I believe warrants further scrutiny and will need clarification.  I refer to Article 5 of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which concerns the common travel area.  I have previously raised in the Chamber the seemingly impossible situation whereby other citizens of the European Union will continue to enjoy the right to free movement into and out of the Republic of Ireland, while the common travel area is retained as it is.  As we know, the common travel area allows for citizens of Ireland and the United Kingdom to travel and work freely in each jurisdiction.  It is not difficult to understand the issue with this proposal.  In effect, the Border between the UK and Ireland will be an open land frontier into the United Kingdom for EU citizens.  I do not see how this circle can be squared given how vociferous Prime Minister May has been regarding the fact that this deal will end free movement of non-Irish EU nationals into the UK.<br/><br/>If the DUP will not accept travel restrictions between Northern Ireland and mainland Great Britain, this presents a major stumbling block for the deal.  I would very much welcome clarity from the T&aacute;naiste on this issue, as the Border could in effect become a magnet for those wishing to enter the UK illegally.  I note that reports emerged earlier in the week indicating that Ireland could refuse entry for EU <i>personae non gratae</i>who are not allowed to enter the United Kingdom.  However, this does not address the issue of regular EU nationals intent on entering the UK via Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>While I commend the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister in particular, as well as all of the others who have ensured that this deal is the best that could be brokered from an Irish perspective, I still harbour some grave fears about how this scenario will play out.  Undoubtedly the Minister does too.  We can only hope that the summit this weekend will be enough to ensure that the issues with the deal can be addressed without having to make major alterations and that the Prime Minister will be able to command enough support to guide it through Westminster.<br/><br/>The challenge for the Government is to strike a balance, holding the line on no hard border while also acknowledging the reality of the political arithmetic for the British Prime Minister.  The fact that the promise of Mrs. May&rsquo;s predecessor to hold a Brexit referendum was an enormous mistake does not make the task any easier.</p></speech>

If it is approved at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels next Sunday, it will be put before the UK Parliament for ratification.  That is to occur after the meeting, not in advance of it.  That is the opposite to what we are doing here.  In my view, the D&aacute;il should not approve any measure until the final text emerges from Brussels, as its provisions will deeply affect Irish citizens both North and South.  This is all the more urgent because the request of the European Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, for the publication by the EU and the United Kingdom of a key document on North-South relations has not yet been met.  Ms O'Reilly called on the European Commission to publish a key document spelling out all the areas of North-South co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement that are at risk because of Brexit.</p><p>Ms O'Reilly was reported as stating that the mapping table her office inspected shows in comprehensive form the very many elements of cross-Border co-operation underpinned by EU law which are factual in nature and that while the commission, as requested by the UK, declined to release the table in order not to disturb the negotiations, there is now no obvious reason for the table not to be published.  Importantly, it was reported Ms O'Reilly further stated that as major decisions in relation to the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the EU are now about to be made, there is a strong public interest case for its release.</p> <p> When British, Irish and EU officials explored all the avenues of North-South co-operation, they discovered there were approximately 120 areas underpinned by EU law and these are set out in this secret document.  That secret document deals with the so-called mapping exercise, which became a key plank in the Government's strategy to highlight the risks to the Good Friday Agreement.  The mapping exercise highlights the extent to which North-South co-operation relies upon, or is enhanced by, mutual EU membership by both Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p> <p> In view of the fact that the United Kingdom and the EU have not yet released this document, it is an abdication of responsibility by the Government to ask the D&aacute;il to approve or disapprove of any proposed Brexit agreement.  We must also remember the various issues raised by the 1,000 Northern nationalists when they wrote to the Taoiseach recently.  Also, what is clear and concerning, not only of itself but of how various other issues might be dealt with in this agreement, is the replacement of a paragraph in the 2017 document regarding the rights of citizens in the North with a non-binding rights clause.  That is very significant.</p> <p> I call on the Taoiseach to release the document referred to by Ms O'Reilly today and in any event, before a vote of any kind on the proposed deal takes place in the D&aacute;il.  It is worth repeating that Ms O'Reilly was reported as stating that, as major decisions in relation to the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the EU are now about to be made, there is a strong public interest case for its release.  Of course, it is clear that the public interest case for its release is much stronger in Ireland than in any other European country.</p> <p> The consideration of the Government proposal tonight must be postponed until after that secret document referred to by Ms O'Reilly has been published.  Many of the matters dealt with in the draft deal can only be fully understood in the context of the unpublished document.</p> <p> Of course, there is no need for a vote here prior to Sunday's meeting.  The British Prime Minister is not having a vote in Westminster - Mrs. May does not need one.  Neither does the Taoiseach need a vote here.  The Taoiseach has told us that it has no legal effect anyway.</p> <p> Will the final document be brought back to the D&aacute;il for debate and decision?  I believe it must because that agreement affects this country, North and South, and its citizens very seriously indeed.  It is my view that this motion is a political manoeuvre to rush this draft deal with unknown consequences through the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> Regarding the various amendments that have been tabled, I believe it would be wrong of me to give any section of the Irish people, North or South, to understand that these amendments would in any way protect them because they are mere declarations.</p> <p> I propose that this debate be adjourned until the O'Reilly document, as I called it, is published to give us an opportunity to assess to what extent this 500 page draft document protects human rights and labour rights of the Irish people, North and South.  If that proposal to adjourn the debate is not accepted, the only responsible thing I can do as an individual Deputy is to abstain on the proposal and the amendments until I have sight of and an opportunity to study the secret document referred to by the EU Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100063#QQQ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.</p>  <p>  There is no quick-fix solution to this as we have seen, even over the past week, what has happened.</p>  <p>  While it would be easier to criticise him, I have seen the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, over the past few months, especially with some journalists in England who would put one to the pin of one's collar in getting vexed, handle it well.  I urge the Taoiseach to refrain from saying too much for the simple reason this ball is largely out of our hands.  It is in the hands of the British Parliament.  We have watched the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May.  There are different views and we, no more than every parliament right across the world, must understand and respect that.  It is a time for people not to overstate and provide excessive commentary on matters because space needs to be given.  It was not overly helpful that some in the UK decided to say that they would not vote for the deal even though they had not seen it.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  We do not know whether this will be the final text.  There is word coming out - we are like hurlers on the ditch.  What we read or see is coming from either media or certain updates, but we do not know what is happening, to put it simply, at the engine room.  We need to know whether there will be another bit of tweaking by Mrs. May and Mr. Michel Barnier or whether the document that we are voting on this evening will be the final document.</p>  <p>  Can we help Mrs. May in the line of getting something in a trade deal that may help some of the people who are worried about the situation going forward?  Can that be done or can there be a bit of wriggle room found in the meantime?</p>  <p>  The bottom line on it, as I hear in commentary every day, is that there may be some parts of Brexit that would be good for some cities which would get extra financial business and additional employment but for rural areas, and especially the agricultural sector, 40% of Ireland's exports go to the United Kingdom.  At a time that the Turkish market is in trouble, agriculture is reliant on the British market, although one would wonder when there is &euro;200 in the difference between the price of an animal killed in Ireland and an animal of the same weight in England by which the British farmer is better off.  In the scale of things, the importance of that can never be forgotten because to do so would be detrimental to not only Border counties but rural areas north, south, east and west which are reliant on agriculture and the export of goods to England.</p>  <p>  There is much trepidation out there, even in the markets and marts.  There is a sort of vacuum where people do not know whether they are coming or going.</p><p>Some people may not understand that everything will not just stop at the 59th minute of the 11th hour.  We need to put the message out there in order to try to instill some confidence.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State went to different places trying to explain what is involved.  That is fair enough but we need to get the message out there because there is a lot of misunderstanding about dates, when this and that will happen and the lead-in period.  It is very important to get this across.</p> <p> We have had an agreement in the form of the common travel area since the 1940s.  That should stand regardless of what happens.  People do not want to go back to the old days.  I remember the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  It is great that people can now cross the Border without being held up for half an hour and being asked all sorts of questions.  What has happened in Northern Ireland in recent years in the context of the amount of work that has been done by those all sides has been very good.  This is not about any one individual blowing his or her trumpet; it involves the Catholic and Protestant communities.  Those involved must be recognised for the effort that has been made.  We need to ensure that this happens.</p> <p> If a hard Brexit came about, is there a danger that many EU nationals could use this country to gain access to the UK?  Is there a possibility that Ireland might almost be smothered because it is the nearest access point?  Even though I would not be a big admirer of British politics, I think Mrs. May deserves credit for what she has done.  She is almost like a cat with nine lives.  She has come through every type of grenade thrown at her.  People probably need to step back and see sense over there but in fairness to Mrs. May, she has moved on and has stood out over the past number of weeks.  We do not know what will happen.  It is entirely up to the politicians in the British Parliament.  It appears that Mrs. May will not get her deal through.  Perhaps we are wrong.  A week ago, they were saying the magic number of 48 would be reached but that does not seem to have happened.  Perhaps common sense might prevail.  In the event that there is an election and Mrs. May is no longer leader, what is our plan B to ensure that agricultural and manufacturing exports from rural areas of Ireland will be safeguarded and that there will be no "big bang"?</p> <p> I wish the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State well in the negotiations in the coming week.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and many people in this House have stated, there is still a lot of work ahead.  The solidarity and support of our EU partners have been hallmarks of this process and have been unwavering and consistent throughout all the twists and turns that have occurred so far.  I have witnessed at first hand the attention and consideration colleagues across Europe have given to the unique issues facing this island and this Government is profoundly grateful for the unity our European friends and colleagues have demonstrated.  There is, of course, solidarity and support at home as well.  This has been amply demonstrated in this debate.</p>  <p>  Brexit has presented us with unique challenges of an unprecedented nature.  As the Taoiseach has stressed, Brexit is not something we sought.  It is something we regret but we must also accept the decision of the British people and we are committed to working towards an outcome that protects all of our interests.  In responding to Brexit, the Government has faced the task with welcome support from this House for the priority issues we have placed at the centre of our negotiation strategy.  Although we may differ from time to time in approach or emphasis, the core objectives we have pursued have been supported across this House, which, again, is welcome.  The informed and thoughtful debate that has taken place this evening is consistent with this approach and has greatly assisted us in demonstrating unity throughout the negotiating process - a unity that in no small part has helped us to get to where we are today.  For our part, we have sought to inform the House on a regular basis about the various different developments in the negotiations and related events.  At all times, we have been conscious that there is significant interest and concern about the issues on the part of the people we represent in the D&aacute;il and in our respective constituencies.</p>  <p>  In setting and developing our priorities, the concerns of citizens, businesses and every aspect of Irish society have been to the forefront of all our minds.  This has included protecting the hard-won peace on this island and explaining to our EU partners how people in Northern Ireland north and the south have felt the benefits of this peace, in particular in a very tangible way across the open and invisible border that exists between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I have accompanied European Ministers and many others on visits to the Border region and have witnessed the impact on our EU partners of the stories of ordinary people who just want to get on with their lives and who want us to find practical solutions to the many challenges of Brexit.  I will continue to raise these concerns and questions in this House and in my ongoing contacts with my European partners.  Ireland's commitment to EU membership is stronger than ever.  There are challenges beyond Brexit that will require attention in the months and years ahead.  We will continue to engage on those issues.</p>  <p>  The negotiations on the draft withdrawal agreement have been tough and difficult for all involved.  However, the draft agreement we are discussing this evening represents the best way ahead for all of us.  As has been said by many tonight, it is by no means perfect.  It represents important compromises on both sides.  However, it ensures that key interests of the UK and all of the EU are addressed.  It was never the case that Brexit would be straightforward or easy.  This has become increasingly clear as the negotiations have gone on so it is important for us all - citizens, enterprises and even our international partners - that the UK's withdrawal happens in an orderly manner.  The withdrawal agreement provides the best way - the only way - to achieve this.  Nobody benefits from a hard Brexit and the serious consequences it would have for the UK, EU and us here in Ireland.  The draft agreement provides for the orderly winding down of the current arrangements across what is a broad spectrum of EU co-operation as well as the governance structures for the implementation of the agreement.  This, of course, includes the protection of UK and EU citizens as well the current EU budget, which is really important for us, particularly in areas such as CAP, which many have mentioned this evening.</p>  <p>  With the withdrawal agreement, we can rely on a transition period providing certainty for citizens and businesses as we prepare for a new relationship with the UK outside the EU.  Transition also provides us with the time we need to negotiate what we want, which is a deep, meaningful and comprehensive arrangement regarding our future relationship.</p>  <p>  The draft withdrawal agreement plays an essential role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland, to which many Deputies referred.  The importance of this has been recognised and supported by all our EU partners.  It has also been recognised in the repeated political commitments made by Prime Minister May in December and March.  This document very much upholds those commitments.  The backstop provisions provide an important insurance policy that we will not see a return to a hard border on this island under any circumstances.  This translates the UK's political commitments to avoid a hard border into a legal guarantee - something we have sought to do for the past year.  Of course, we hope the backstop will never be used.  We are committed to working closely with the UK and our EU partners to agree a deep and comprehensive future relationship - one that will mean that the backstop provision will never be needed.  Rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement as well as EU citizenship rights for people in Northern Ireland are also protected under the agreement.  I reiterate what the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste stated earlier, namely, that nothing in the agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  As we look to the future, the agreement also acknowledges the common travel area whereby Irish and British people can live, work, study and access healthcare, social security and public services in either jurisdiction.  While the UK's decision to leave has serious implications for Ireland, we will maintain a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with the UK.  We are fully committed to developing and enhancing this relationship in the coming years.</p><p>This will include making full use of the channels that already exist for ongoing dialogue and co-operation between the Irish and British Governments, including those provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, with important institutional co-operation taking place on an east-west basis through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British Irish Council.  In addition, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, Northern Ireland and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.  These structures have shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.  In addition, we will explore other avenues, which many have raised this evening, to maintain the habit of co-operation that currently exists through the regular meetings of the Irish and UK Government Ministers in Brussels and elsewhere in Europe on a range of EU matters that are significant to Ireland and the UK.</p> <p> This evening's debate has focused on the draft withdrawal agreement.  For all of the reasons we have discussed, it is likely to continue to be the focus of much attention for coming weeks.  There are two documents being discussed, namely, this draft withdrawal agreement and the future political declaration which sets out the direction in which we want the future relationship to go, on which we hope to have a final agreement before the EU Council meeting on Sunday next.  A negotiated withdrawal agreement remains the best possible outcome in regard to Brexit.  A no-deal scenario is bad for the UK and the EU and I do not believe it is in any of our interests at this stage to contemplate such a negative conclusion to the UK's membership of the European Union.  Ireland has always been clear that it wants the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK.  While it is, perhaps, not the kind of future we had envisaged when we both joined the European Union together many years ago, Ireland is clear that our place remains as a part of that Union, a home that we helped to build.  Together with our EU partners we must now find a way to imagine a new relationship with our neighbours in the United Kingdom.</p> <p> I ask all Deputies to support the motion in its current form, without amendment.  Concerns have been raised, and amendments put forward in that regard, and the T&aacute;naiste has already acknowledged they are important.  However, a clear message of support for the draft withdrawal agreement text would send a message of solidarity, which as I said earlier, has been paramount to this entire process.</p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

I was just clarifying where we are starting.  In the budget announcement and provided for within the Finance Bill is a very welcome regional uplift of 5% with respect to the film tax relief.  As I understand it, the uplift of the tax relief across the regions is underpinned by the European Union regional aid guidelines.  The map accompanying those guidelines indicates the greater Dublin area and Cork are excluded.  Nevertheless, there is film, television and animation activity in Cork and this means, in effect, that my city and county will be at a very significant disadvantage in that qualifying activity there will attract less relief than in other parts of the country.  I wish to raise the matter with the Minister on behalf of Film in Cork, which is the local organisation providing production and location support services to those working in film, television and animation.  It is an initiative of Cork county and city councils, and it quite justifiably makes the point that the exclusion of the city and the county from the regional uplift element of the extension of this relief will have consequences.  It will mean, when it comes to investment decisions, that Cork will inevitably lose out.</p>  <p>  I understand the background and the EU regional aid guidelines.  My question is whether there is any flexibility.  Does the relief in the application of the regional uplift have to be underpinned by those guidelines, which explicitly exclude not just Dublin but also Meath, Wicklow and Kildare, as well as Cork city and county.  The rest of the country is included under those guidelines.  If it cannot be done in this way, I know that in the past Screen Ireland, the national organisation that is the development agency for Irish film, television and the animation industry, had a regional support fund.  That does not currently exist but perhaps it is an avenue that could be examined as well.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath mentioned Film in Cork, an organisation that has been going for a number of years.  It not only supports film-makers but also development and young people in the industry.  There is a strong tradition of film in Cork and in recent years we have seen films like "War of the Buttons" and "The Wind that Shakes the Barley", along with many more.  There is a great deal more potential for film in Cork, including in employment for both rural and urban locations.  It would be of value to industry, film and the arts in Cork if the regional uplift could be extended to the city and county.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, there has been quite a lot of film activity in and around Cork city and county.  There is a very strong arts base in the county.  In the absence of this or an alternative arrangement to bring Cork to the same scale of support as other areas for a significant sector of the arts, Cork would miss out.  In the context of all that has been done to develop the arts in Cork and the large amount of artistic activity that exists, including in film, and because of the interconnection between people engaged in different elements of the arts, I ask the Minister to give consideration to what is, after all, just a report.  If there are impossible issues that cannot be negotiated to remove the disadvantage for Cork, at least the Minister would at least have made an effort to have a report prepared on the subject.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100068#VVV01200"><p>There has been much discussion on section 481 both on Committee and now on Report Stage.  We focused on those topics last night.</p><p>Specifically, we discussed the economic benefits of section 481 in terms of jobs, social impacts and so on, but I would like to hear more from the Minister about the rationale for the regional uplift measure that he has proposed.  Do not get me wrong - we need to stimulate, promote and encourage film making in the regions and in areas beyond where it is currently taking place.  As Deputy Michael McGrath's amendment implies, though, there may be a difficulty, in that the measure is encouraging film production and film investment to go to particular places, possibly at the expense of other places that would equally like to develop a film industry or where a film industry already exists.</p> <p> Could this underpin the decline and demise of Ardmore Studios in Bray?  The Government made a terrible decision in selling its share to the people who own Troy Studios and who now have a serious conflict of interest between their ambitions for Troy Studios and the fact that they also have Ardmore Studios.  The latter is potentially prime real estate and there have been attempts to rezone it.  Whoever gets it rezoned will make an absolute fortune.  There may be a material interest for the owners of Ardmore Studios and Troy Studios in redirecting investment and production to the latter at the expense of the former.  I do not raise this as a parochial matter, as I would argue that the local concerns about employment and the tradition of Ardmore as effectively the national studio are also national issues.  The bigger questions are whether this could happen and would it be desirable?  It would be desirable for some, but not for the development of the film industry as a whole.</p> <p> We should stimulate the development of film production in places other than where it is currently being done.  It might be of interest to the Minister to note something in this regard.  I attended one of the pre-screenings of "Black 47", the director of which said something interesting when speaking about the production.  He basically said that the film did not really work out quite as he had wanted, as the production did not have sufficient investment.  Interestingly, it could not afford to go to Mayo to film parts of "Black 47" as desired.  A digital landscape had to be used for part of the film.  I do not know whether people have seen it.  Do not get me wrong - it was a great effort by the writer and director to do what they had to with limited resources, but the director said that, for the lack of &euro;50,000, the production could not go to Mayo.  This film about the Famine, which is a seminal moment in Irish history, was made on a shoestring.  I will not go into the other issues that arose on the employment front, but many of them also revolved around a lack of investment and so on.</p> <p>To cut a long story short, if we want to develop the Cork film industry, a film industry in Connemara and a film industry in Limerick while maintaining the industry in places like Ardmore and Dublin, and given the suggestion made by some film workers in my area that we should build a film studio in the old terminal building on D&uacute;n Laoghaire pier - it is not a bad idea, as the terminal is almost ready made for it-----</p></speech>

To my mind, all these options would be good, but what would not be good would be us robbing Peter to pay Paul, with one area benefitting and others losing out.</p><p>Given that we have such a pool of talent at every level in this industry and the associated sectors, we should start looking at this matter in the way we look at theatre.  The Abbey Theatre's existence is not an <i>ad hoc</i>one based on tax reliefs, where it gets reliefs if it happens to put on a good production but otherwise disappears.  Instead, we say that we want a national theatre as well as theatres in Cork, Galway, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Limerick and so on.  I do not know why we would not build studio capacity and a standing workforce that is trained and specialist in the various areas of film production in a few locations around the country.  If we created that capacity, we would get much more State and external investment, allowing us to produce more and better films in a way that benefitted everyone.  It might also end some of the scrapping that is going on in the background in the industry.</p><p>I would like to hear from the Minister whether he accepts that there is a concern about this measure inadvertently favouring just one or two locations, most likely Troy Studios, at the expense of everywhere else.</p></speech>

It should be noted that this is subject to state aid approval.  The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis, with 5% available in years one and two, 3% in year three, then 2% before reducing to zero.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs and the geographic spread of the audiovisual sector.  The regions availing of the uplift will be limited to areas sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines, which was Deputy Michael McGrath's point.  Those guidelines allow each member state to provide enhanced rates of state aid in its least economically developed areas.  This enables the State's enterprise development agency to grant state aid at enhanced rates to businesses in order to support new investment and employment in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.</p>  <p>  Based on these guidelines, areas that do not qualify for regional aid will be outside the scope of the regional uplift.  That includes Dublin, Cork and the mid-east generally, that being, most of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  The uplift is subject to state aid approval and my officials are in the process of notifying the aid to the European Commission.  Should it transpire during our engagement with the Commission that the geographic regions able to avail of the uplift can be amended, it may be something that we can consider.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that productions in regions unable to avail of the uplift are still able to benefit from the existing film tax credit of up to 32% of eligible expenditure.  Therefore, while I cannot accept the amendment, I assure the Deputy that options in respect of the geographical applicability of the uplift will be discussed by my officials during the notification process.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about the scheme.  On Committee Stage, I went through the rationale for this change.  I am trying to encourage a more even spread of the industry across the country.</p><p>I am cautious about making changes to reliefs of this nature which is why I have introduced this relief on a tapered and reducing basis.  The objective is to develop some alternative clusters of production and development talent beyond those already established.  However, I only buy the argument that this should be available for a limited period of time.  We should not be bringing in a relief at the expense of the Exchequer which continues indefinitely.  If after the period of time outlined in the Bill the relief does not deliver a cluster of employment and capital in some additional areas or build up beyond what is there at the moment, then the scheme cannot deliver the objective laid out for it.  This is why it has been introduced on a tapered basis.  Making it available for four years is adequate and provides enough time for new hubs to be further developed.  After that point, frankly, the hubs are either developed or not and the relief has either done its job or has not been properly crafted.  Putting it in place for a four-year period should deal with some of the concerns raised.</p></speech>

He has given a commitment to seek to explore and stretch whatever flexibility may be available in the course of discussions with the European Commission.  The regional uplift has been welcomed as a positive step but I ask the Minister to consider it from the perspective of people involved in this sector across Cork city and county.  They are now in a worse position relative to the rest of the country, with the exception of the other excluded areas including Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath and the three local electoral areas of Kells, Athy and Arklow.  That is the position in which they find themselves.  They are of the view that existing jobs and the lives of stakeholders in the sector in Cork city and county will be negatively affected for the next five years.  Obviously, when it comes to investment decisions the fact that there is less tax relief available when this comes into effect for productions in Cork city and county than in surrounding counties and elsewhere in the country, apart from the other excluded zones, puts Cork at a disadvantage.</p>  <p>  I am not going to press the amendment but ask the Minister to reaffirm that he will, in a genuine way, explore with the European Commission and with departmental officials the possibility of including Cork city and county within the scope of this relief scheme.  If not, I ask him to consult other stakeholders, including Screen Ireland, to see what supports might be available to counterbalance the impact of this.</p></speech>

Those intangible assets that were onshored after 2017 revert to the 80% rate.  Prior to 2015, a rate of 80% was all that was allowed.  We know the history of this and I discussed it at length with the Minister during the debate on last year's Finance Bill and during the Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  A change was made in 2015 that allowed for international multi-national companies to onshore intangible assets.  Previously they could only offset 80% against their tax liability but the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, decided to increase that to 100%.</p><p>I have noted before that when a suggestion was made to change the rate to 90% rather than the 100% rate that finally emerged in the Finance Bill, a senior tax policy advisor to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said that he disagreed with this on reputation grounds and argued that it would reduce the potential effective rate from 2.5% to 1.25%.  He said that 1.25% was too low and that such a change could backfire and backfire it did.  The rate was changed to 100%, which meant that the effective tax rate in certain cases was zero.  Billions of euro worth of intangible assets were onshored in this period, with one particular company availing of this loophole in a major way.  All of this played out in the international press.  Apple restructured itself following the closing of the double Irish and, in particular, the stateless companies rules and used this mechanism to write down its tax liability to a very low level indeed.  </p><p>I acknowledge that in last year's Finance Act the Minister closed this loophole but only did so for intangible assets onshored from that date forward.  The problem is that next year and in every subsequent year, the assets that were onshored in the relevant period can be written against profits at 100%.  The Minister for Finance commissioned the expert Mr. Seamus Coffey to look at corporation tax.  He made it clear, as part of his recommendations, that the 100% rate should no longer apply and that it should revert back to 80%.  He was very clear that what the Minister for Finance did last year did not go far enough and that it needed to be reduced for the intangible assets that were brought onshore during the period in question, 2015 to 2017.  He debunked one of the arguments made last year that this is retrospective taxation, which it is not.  We are not arguing that those who availed of this provision during that period would be penalised or that we would look for a clawback from them.  What we are saying is that if they use those intangible assets to write down their tax liabilities in 2020, 2021 and so on, they can only do so at the 80% rate.  That is the rate that now applies to any other company operating on the island of Ireland that has onshored such assets.  </p><p>This is not small potatoes.  This week we discussed the fiasco of the Government stripping away the flat rate tax allowances from moderate and low-paid workers.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that this has been deferred but will fight the Government on that issue.  I have written to the finance committee to ask that officials from Revenue would appear before it to answer questions on the review currently under way.  In that case, we are talking about a couple of million euro and while it is not a small amount of money, it is across a large group of people.</p><p>This measure, on the other hand, brings in &euro;750 million.  A total of &euro;750 million can be availed of if the Government implements the recommendation of the author of the expert report.  There is no reason not to do this.  This could go a long way in terms of dealing with some of the very difficult social problems that we have in Irish society, not least the fact that we have so many families and individuals that are homeless, so many children waiting for needs assessments and so many families struggling to get by because of the high cost of energy, childcare, insurance and so on.  Significant resources can be made available to the State if the Minister accepts this amendment and puts it into effect by ensuring that intangible assets can only be used to write off against 80% of profits and not 100%, as the Minister has allowed for in last year's Finance Act for those that were onshored between 2015 and 2017.</p></speech>

It could be called the let-us-tax-the-leprechaun amendment given this window was opened after the double Irish arrangement was closed down because of political pressure.  This window was the mechanism through which the companies that had availed of the arrangement then moved into a new tax avoidance mechanism which seemed to be designed for them.  It is a scandal.</p>  <p>  The consequence of that was a massive onshoring of intangible assets that spiked Irish economic growth rates to the levels where we became the laughing stock of the entire world and gained the name leprechaun economics.  It is not glib to say the leprechaun should be taxed because we are talking about hundreds of millions of euros from these companies which are making staggering profits and even granting an 80% relief on these intangibles is extraordinarily generous to these companies.  The intangibility of assets is precisely the means through which these large multinational corporations can essentially put whatever price they like on their intellectual property and move it from one arm of their company to another, with one arm charging for the use of that asset, or paying for that asset or the royalties on the use of that asset, and, through that mechanism, they can essentially write their own tax bill.  To give those companies 100% relief was extraordinary and inexplicable.</p>  <p>  I believe it was explained by several high level meetings that took place that year between Ministers and executives of a certain company, called Apple, after it was obvious that the double Irish had to close down and there were moves which were going to lead to it being closed down.  I cannot explain it any other way and particularly when we then discovered afterwards that officials were saying this should not be done, but it was done anyway.</p>  <p>  The minimum we could ask is for a report on why we should not do this.  It is not just the left saying that.  The fact that Mr. Seamus Coffey recommended this suggests that it is not an ideological demand.  It is a reasonable demand to close a window that should not have been opened to allow extraordinarily profitable companies avoid vast amounts of tax.  At the end of the day, we lose out.  Those revenues would make a substantial difference in housing or health.  We also lost out, and are losing out, because we have to pay larger contributions to the European Union because of artificially inflated growth rates.  I do not have the figures in front of me, but I think we are talking about a couple of hundred million euros worth of additional contributions to the EU based on the size of our GDP, which is inflated because of the tax avoidance mechanisms being used by these companies.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that the Exchequer would taken in an additional &euro;750 million if he made this change?  The cap would apply in respect of the capital allowances associated with the intellectual property that was onshored during the window.  Does he accept that?</p>  <p>  Can he again outline for the House the reasons he decided not to do that?  Is it because he regarded it as damaging the reputation of Ireland?  Is it because he regarded it as moving the goalposts?  It is well accepted that capital allowances are a legitimate tax deduction in our corporate tax code.  That is certainly the case.  Before the cap was lifted, we had a restriction on the income that could be offset by the capital allowances on this intellectual property.  It was 80%, it was removed, and a staggering volume of onshoring took place during that window that Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pearse Doherty referred to.  Now the cap has been reinstated.</p>  <p>  The Minister had made the point previously that this is a timing issue and, all other things being equal, it is just a timing issue but there is no guarantee that the companies concerned will maintain the same tax structure, will continue to make profits of the same order for years to come, for this to be a timing issue over time.  We cannot say that is certain.</p>  <p>  At the same time, our corporate tax receipts are booming.  The Exchequer has taken in close to &euro;10 billion in 2018, with more than &euro;1 billion in additional, unexpected receipts being collected around now.  Whatever changes have been made, whether in our tax code or the tax structure that multinational companies are using, tax receipts are booming and have doubled in four years.</p>  <p>  The Minister needs to explain whether he accept the figures that have been put forward and to outline his reasons for ensuring the cap does not apply in respect of the capital allowances associated with the intellectual property that was onshored to Ireland during that window.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-21a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100071#YYY00300"><p>I have put forward a Private Members' Bill, which proposes that Ireland would have a minimum effective tax rate on corporation tax profits and that we would also have a standing commission to examine matters of taxation.</p>  <p>  The Government is on notice, and I am sure the Minister is well aware of it himself, of a situation whereby global companies, whether financial companies, social media companies such as the FANG - Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google - companies, cannot continue to operate on a global basis where, effectively, they contribute little or no taxation in different jurisdictions in which they both provide and sell their goods and services.  It is not reasonable to expect that we become perceived as some kind of global centre for an unacceptable form of tax mitigation and avoidance.</p>  <p>  I have a later amendment asking that, in a similar way, the Minister would make provision for a report in respect of digital taxation because now, and in the recent UK budget, even the Tories, from the heart of the city of London, proposed a digital tax commencing in 2020.  This is intimately related to any review because we are talking about people making excessive profits.  I am sure many of the Minister's economic heroes, from Adam Smith on, would look favourably at returns and taxation which are fair and do not have the distorting influences on economic activity of the extreme position that is now shown to prevail.</p>  <p>  We need a response from the Minister.  I am sure it will be thoughtful.</p><p>The Minister might say that the 12.5% rate is not the lowest tax rate in Europe but we know that.  He might say that the rate has been a bedrock of the Irish offering in respect of foreign direct investment, but it is not being applied in the case of these companies.  If the Minister were to say that, notwithstanding investment into assets of different kinds and the write-offs they might generate, there would be a minimum effective rate of 6.5% or 7%, that would at least mean that these companies were paying something.  At the moment they effectively choose the figure and they are choosing to pay pretty much nothing.  Ireland is just drinking in the last chance saloon in respect of these kinds of tax breaks.</p> <p> There are also many correlative adjustments.  The Minister and his officials were obliging in supplying me with the figures, which are big.  In respect of many of the FANG companies,, national and regional jurisdictions in countries such as Italy are saying that the companies must either pay some tax on what they are selling and the profits they are making in the country or they must provide for a location in the country.  That is happening increasingly in different parts of Europe and even in different parts of the United States.  Does the Minister have a strategy to address this at all or is he just going to pull down the entire deck of cards?  What is happening with many of these companies has become economically absurd.  Not even the most right-wing economist in the canons of economics would defend it.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty and I have debated this issue on many occasions and we have differing views on it.  While he acknowledges the decision I made in respect of the change, he feels it should have been handled over a different period.  I have offered my reason as to why I believe this is the right decision on other occasions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath is right to acknowledge that corporation tax figures are doing well at the moment.  As to why I made the decision I made in respect of timing, I will briefly reiterate that my view is that to change it in the way Deputy Doherty is advocating would have consequences for the certainty that should be, and needs to be, at the heart of the tax code for a small and open economy.  I believe this change needed to be made and that is why I made it in last year's budget.  On Deputy McGrath's second question, which related to the figure Deputy Doherty quoted, it is difficult for us to put an exact figure on the tax revenue that could be reinstated because it is difficult to be accurate in respect of the degree to which available allowances will be drawn down and when.  However, I acknowledge that the figure in this regard will be many hundreds of millions of euro.  It is revenue that will come in to us, just over a longer period.</p>  <p> Deputy Burton asked me if I had a strategy.  Yes, I do.  I published the roadmap on corporate tax reform a number of weeks ago.  There are reasonably few countries laying out the kind of changes they believe need to be made in their corporate tax policy with the clarity with which we have.  The Coffey report lays out the effective tax rates for companies that have paid corporate tax here in Ireland over recent years.  At their lowest point, these rates are still higher than the effective tax rate figures the Deputy quoted.</p></speech>
