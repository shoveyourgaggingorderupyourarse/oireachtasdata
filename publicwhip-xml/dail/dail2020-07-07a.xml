    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700003#A00100"><p>This morning, the National Women's Council of Ireland and a group of parents, mostly mothers, held a demonstration outside Leinster House in support of the call for an extension to maternity leave and pay.  During the Covid-19 crisis, many women have called for a 12-week extension because the emergency has fundamentally impacted on and changed the nature of the important time that they have to spend with their new babies.</p>  <p>  Rugadh leana&iacute; i l&aacute;r na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime seo agus t&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; ag roinnt teaghlaigh mar gheall ar Covid-19 agus mar gheall ar easpa taca&iacute;ochta &oacute;n Rialtas.  Caithfidh an Rialtas saoire mh&aacute;ithreachais a leathn&uacute; chun faoiseamh a thabhairt do theaghlaigh at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute;.</p>  <p>  On 11 June, the National Women's Council handed in a petition signed by more than 28,000 people, supporting this demand.  It gave that petition to the then Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  At that time, Deputy Varadkar said that he would give full and meaningful consideration to the request for the extension.  The programme for Government commits to extending paid parental leave for parents to allow them to spend more time with their baby during the first year and although the language is vague, it raises the expectation that the Government will now act.</p>  <p>  Extending maternity leave and pay is the right thing to do, particularly in these times of public health emergency, during which women have given birth without their partner present, they have faced the first few months of motherhood without access to the usual important supports, and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis has consumed time that should have been about the mother and her new baby.  What usually characterises this important time has been replaced by immense levels of stress, as the Taoiseach knows.  Covid-19 has had a real effect on these families and it has been my view for some time that maternity leave in this State is not fit for purpose.  The scheme is unfair and outdated, but perhaps how we remedy that is a discussion for another day.  For now, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that his Government will do the right thing and that he will extend maternity leave and maternity pay for the 12 weeks requested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700003#A00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I am conscious that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised this with the outgoing Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, some time ago in the context of the significant impact on women, particularly those on maternity leave, that Covid-19 has had, especially with regard to access to the normal supports such as childcare, baby groups and so on that was denied to mothers during this critical period.</p>  <p>  Admha&iacute;m go bhfuil agus go raibh br&uacute; ar na mn&aacute; sin filleadh i gcomhth&eacute;acs an cor&oacute;inv&iacute;reas.  N&iacute;l aon amhras gur sin an sc&eacute;al agus t&aacute; an Rialtas ag d&eacute;anamh scr&uacute;d&uacute; ar an gceist, ach n&iacute;l s&iacute; simpl&iacute;.  T&aacute; an-chuid laistigh den cheist, agus t&aacute; roinnt le d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh r&eacute;iteach na ceiste.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has policy responsibility for maternity leave while the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays the benefit.  This matter is being examined by the Government and there is consultation between the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Minister for Justice and Equality, although that Department is breaking up, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>The retrospective nature of what is proposed may create legal and policy difficulties.  For example, some of the women who have exhausted their maternity benefit are now back at work or on the pandemic unemployment payment.  Other stakeholders are involved and there will be consultation with other stakeholders on this, particularly employers who are facing challenges with Covid-19.  In that context, I spoke to the Ministers yesterday.  They are engaged in consultations on this issue.  It is our intention to come back with a very considered response on the issue shortly and to deal with the matters I have outlined to the Deputy. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700004#B00200"><p>In that case, we are of one mind.  We all recognise that those women and couples who have had children in this period have faced very considerable difficulties and stress without all of the normal supports that new parents generally enjoy when they bring home their newborn.</p>  <p>  This is a very straightforward request.  The Taoiseach should not hide behind a veil of complexity.  The simple facts are that these women need additional time.  They need additional leave and they need to be sure that that additional leave will be paid leave.  To me, this is very straightforward, not least because childcare provision is now under such stress.  There is no certainty for many parents that they will be able to get adequate and appropriate childcare, particularly for newborn infants.</p>  <p>  I again ask the Taoiseach to act swiftly.  I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality in the previous Government had some jurisdiction on these issues.  Responsibility for equality has now been moved to a different Department.  I do not wish this issue to get lost in the labyrinth or the bureaucratic machinations of the new Government.  This is not a time for delay.  This is a time for timely action.  The matter is time sensitive because many women are now on maternity leave.  They are looking at the prospect and the pressure of returning to work.  As his first act in government, I ask the Taoiseach to act now, make a clear decision on the matter, act fairly and do the right thing by Irish women and these new mothers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700004#B00300"><p>It is our intention to do the right thing but to do it in a considered way.  It is not as simple as the Deputy has outlined and there are both legal and policy complexities with it.  The estimated cost is &euro;78 million and it would affect about 24,500 women.  That is being considered by the relevant Departments.  I do not intend to come in here and say what might be popular or just give a simple affirmative response.  I want to see a considered response from the Departments concerned.  It will come to Government and obviously we will influence that.  The Government will make a decision on it bearing in mind all the wider issues the Deputy also alluded to.  The programme for Government gives very clear commitments to improving maternity leave, paternity leave as well as the wider strategy designed to improve the quality of life of mothers, particularly after their babies are born.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700004#B00400"><p>The Taoiseach has probably had the shortest honeymoon period of any incoming Taoiseach in the history of the State.  It lasted about two hours before some of his colleagues started turning on him.  That has continued for the last week and a half, even up to today.  I appreciate that he is only a week and a half in the job but he is not a newcomer to politics.  He is one of the most experienced people in the House.  There is, therefore, a reasonable expectation that he will hit the ground running and provide stability and a clear direction for the people.  Instead, he has had to manage a considerable amount of unrest, commencing with open criticism from his own party.  As we now know, one of his Ministers has had to apologise to him and publicly for his driving ban while on a provisional licence.</p> <p>We will deal with that matter later and I hope we will get full clarity.  In the same week, the Minister for Health has stood over an interview in which he admitted taking illegal drugs.  That is another matter that needs to be teased out further by the Taoiseach.  In addition, a Fianna F&aacute;il MEP ignored the requirement for quarantine when he travelled to the Taoiseach's inauguration.<br/><br/>I must ask the Taoiseach now that Fianna F&aacute;il is back in government, are its public representatives above the law again and above public health advice?  The Taoiseach comes from old Fianna F&aacute;il politics.  It has not been a good first week for the Government and the Taoiseach must think that.  The <i>modus operandi </i>looks to have returned to an old style of cute hoor politics.  I am not sure how the Taoiseach's colleagues in government will respond to that style.  What kind of example does it give to the public when three senior Fianna F&aacute;il representatives have openly flouted the law and public health rules?<br/><br/>On top of that, the leaders of one of the Opposition parties in this Chamber, Sinn F&eacute;in, broke all social distancing rules to attend an IRA funeral and rally, as it turned out, in Belfast.  That was the second time that members of Sinn F&eacute;in attended a funeral during the Covid lockdown while everyone else had to respectfully stay at home while friends, neighbours and supporters were laid to rest.  People might expect the practice of exceptionalism from Sinn F&eacute;in but the public may have thought that Fianna F&aacute;il had been humbled since it led the Government during the financial crash.<br/><br/>The first act of the new Minister for Education and Skills was to bellow about a new grant for an extension to a school in her constituency despite the country being in the biggest educational crisis in the history of the State.  Fianna F&aacute;il is certainly back in power.  The country needs a stable Government, not more of this.  This kind of activity needs to end this week.  People are rightly concerned about whether they can return to work, whether health services will resume soon, when schools will reopen and how rent and mortgage arrears will be dealt with.  When will the Taoiseach be in a position to provide the people with a clear statement on all four of those issues?  The Taoiseach must ensure that a plan will be in place for the summer months and September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700005#C00200"><p>I do not accept the Deputy's analysis of the first week of the Government.  He can talk about internal party issues pertaining to certain individuals but my focus has been unwavering since I was elected Taoiseach.  That focus has been on policy and substance from the beginning.  We have an extensive legislative programme for this month, as the Business Committee is well aware.  I would say that the programme is unprecedented in terms of the amount of legislation we will try to get through the House in order to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.  We will deal with the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill, the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill, the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill to set up the Department of Higher of Education and Research and various other items of legislation.  The Cabinet subcommittees have already been established by the Government.</p>  <p>  I spent a week speaking to the President of the EU Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the EU Council, Mr. Charles Michel, Mr. Michel Barnier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - in the context of Brexit - and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, about matters such as the European recovery fund, the multi-annual financial framework and how Europe, as an entity, will deal with Brexit and the Irish position on it.  I have been very focused.  Other stuff goes on, as it always does in politics, and we will deal with that too.  From the perspective of the Government, we must focus on the people.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about reopening schools and travel advice.  The Government has focused on those issues in the past week.  We had a meeting of the Covid-19 sub-committee on Friday to deal with the matter of international travel.</p> <p>We had an extensive consultation with Government colleagues and announced the decision yesterday that the existing advice against unnecessary travel abroad will continue in the interests of public safety and suppressing the virus.  Above all, this is to help us get schools open in September.  It is a passion of mine that we get the schools open in September because children's development rests on it.  We limit the life chances of children if we deprive them any longer of schooling and education.  The Cabinet sub-committee on Covid will meet again to discuss that issue now that we have dealt with international travel.  The committee will now focus in on education and engaging with the education authorities on the return to school.</p> <p> I met the Minister for Health and the acting Secretary General of the Department of Health last evening in order to focus in on the non-Covid strand of disease, illnesses and the need for diagnostics, to get resumption of services now that critical care beds have been freed up as a result of the suppression of the virus.  The number of patients in such beds has been significantly reduced.  I have not wasted an hour since I was elected Taoiseach in the context of concentrating on the fundamentals that face the Irish people.  No politician is above the law and no politician should be above the law.  In respect of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Cowen, the Deputy will note that punishment was meted out in respect of his transgression four years ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700006#D00200"><p>I am delighted that the Taoiseach referenced so often in his reply that not one hour has been wasted.  He has been very focused.  He has gone into an awful lot of detail, he said it numerous times, and specifics.  In that context, I want to ask him one question.  There are hundreds of thousands of people worried about their livelihoods.  The Government has its July stimulus coming forward.  As policymakers and as legislators, we do not have the information we need to plan for this crisis.  The Central Statistics Office reports that just over 131,000 people were unemployed at the end of June, which is the seasonally adjusted, traditional unemployment figure of 5.8%.  However, at the same time, it reports a Covid-19 adjusted unemployment rate of 22.5%.  There is a world of difference between the two figures.  I do not want figures to be massaged.  Given all the specific, detailed work and the fact that not an hour has been wasted, I am sure that today, 7 July, the Taoiseach has the capacity to confirm - to the best of his knowledge, to be fair - what is the real unemployment rate as of today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700006#D00300"><p>Again, the Covid figure is the one I take as my yardstick in terms of the unemployment rate and the reality of the situation for many people.  Of course, in the context of those supports, the jobs stimulus programme will focus on that area and on the wage subsidy scheme, which has protected thousands of jobs.  We can get into all sorts of statistics, but it remains unclear how many companies will be viable over time.  Many companies have been and are being protected by the wage subsidy scheme.  Part of the July stimulus programme will be to evaluate that scheme and fine-tune it.  No one will come off a cliff as a result of any policy decisions.  The July job stimulus is aimed not just at protecting jobs but at creating additional jobs.  It is going to be an uncertain time ahead in terms of the employment situation.  There are various estimates made by the bodies that project employment figures and so on.  I hope some of them are realised in the context of a significant reduction by the end of the year.  It is fair to say to all concerned, however, that supports will be necessary in the medium term but also that initiatives will have to be taken to create jobs and alternative opportunities, particularly for young people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700006#D00400"><p>We note from the number of clusters and deaths from Covid-19 in the nursing home sector just how exposed that sector was and the tragic consequences that followed from that exposure.</p> <p>At the height of the crisis, the sector's lack of preparedness was raised in the House on numerous occasions.  We heard concerns raised by Nursing Home Ireland as early as the beginning of March, including concerns about safe and appropriate discharges from acute hospitals to nursing homes, about staff being recruited into the health service at the expense of the nursing home sector raising the risk that it would endanger older people, concerns about PPE, testing and so on.  More information came into the public domain yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i>as a result of a freedom of information request.  We learned that senior HSE officials privately raised major concern about coronavirus hitting nursing homes in March with one flagging their &ldquo;totally inadequate preparation&rdquo; and another saying it could be &ldquo;the biggest live risk&rdquo; facing the health service.  We learned that agency staff were being supplied to nursing homes at double cost, where they were available.  Safe Ireland has raised serious concerns about the care of the late Mr. Ultan Meehan, a nursing home resident from County Meath, after he was admitted to Connolly Hospital.  The care home was unable to manage his care for a facial wound which became badly infected.<br/><br/>Will the Taoiseach commit to ensure that Mr. Meehan's wife, Mary, is given a full report?  This could be undertaken by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, or the expert panel.  The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, established a Covid committee - an expert panel - to investigate the nursing home sector on 23 May.  This expert panel was supposed to report by the end of June.  Has it reported and, if not, when is this likely to happen?  The temporary assistance payment scheme to nursing homes was amended by the Minister for Health last week.  It reduces the overall amount.  Is that because of an income-related reason?  Is it funding or was there another rationale?  If there is a rationale, will the Taoiseach provide it to the D&aacute;il?  Does he believe that clinical governance should remain the responsibility of the nursing home sector?  If not, who should have responsibility and how quickly can it be put in place?<br/><br/>In Opposition, the Taoiseach was one of those who raised concerns about the nursing home sector.  How concerned is he now about what is emerging in the public domain about the sector and how exposed it was?  How satisfied is he that on his watch, the sector is fully prepared should there be another outbreak?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700007#E00200"><p>I empathise with much of the Deputy's comments about the challenges that faced the nursing home sector at the outset of Covid-19.  I do not believe it was adequately prepared at that time to cope with the pandemic.  Much has been learned since.  The expert panel has been set up by the previous Minister and I understand it should report within the next fortnight.  It will be an important basis on which to evaluate policy in the next number of months.  There is comprehensive testing in nursing homes now.  In one nursing home, five people have the virus who are asymptomatic.  That illustrates how even now, with the suppression of the virus, the challenges clearly still there in the sector.</p>  <p>  On clinical governance, I will be guided by the report of the expert panel, however we have learned enough from the experience during the pandemic to accept that changes must take place around governance in the nursing home sector, particularly on the clinical side.  Stronger clinical oversight will be required.</p> <p>That is my view on that.</p> <p> I am also very concerned about the case that has been raised of Mary Bartley Meehan.  HIQA is the regulating authority for the nursing home sector and Ms Bartley Meehan is entitled, at the very least, to a report, and from what I have read of the case, it should be reviewed.  I have sought from the Department of Health a further update on this particular case.  It is very worrying indeed as to Ms Bartley Meehan&rsquo;s own experiences when she visited, where she lost both her son, Adrian, and her husband.  It is a very traumatic and shocking situation which deserves a comprehensive and full response for Mary Bartley Meehan herself and her family, and that should be done.</p> <p> As to future preparation and preparedness for any resurgence in the virus, the testing exercise that is under way is something I take solace from in the sense that we desire the HSE and the public health authorities to be on top of this in the nursing home sector to ensure that it is not caught off guard as perhaps it was at the outset of the Covid-19 virus outbreak, which was an unprecedented global pandemic.  At the beginning all concern was around the acute hospital side and the nursing home side received attention somewhat later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700008#F00200"><p>I take it then that the Taoiseach will be talking to HIQA to ensure that that report is done and will be produced for that tragic case.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did not address the issue of the reduction of funding.  Will he address that in his response, and if there is a report or evaluation, that that will be provided to the D&aacute;il?</p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach surprised about the kind of warnings that were coming from senior officials in the HSE who had a responsibility?  Very serious concerns were raised.  Is he concerned that they did not come into play earlier, because they were being raised at the beginning of March?  Some of these concerns, including those from Nursing Home Ireland, were being raised at the same time that NPHET was saying that there was not a requirement to isolate nursing homes from visitors.  It was at a very early stage.  Does that surprise the Taoiseach?  This has been raised.  We all felt that we were a bit dismissed when we raised the issue about what we were seeing in nursing homes.  Will those concerns in particular be looked at by the expert committee?</p></speech>

There should be comprehensive reviews of everything that took place, but with a view to learning lessons and not trying to damn people or apportion particular blame.  The exercise has to be about learning lessons, because if it happens again, we need to be able to respond better and more effectively.  We do not want future public health officials or public servants hamstrung by the fact that there may be another inquiry conducted into what they are doing in the middle of a crisis.</p>  <p>  All international responses to crises have this is a basic standard, that we look back to evaluate and learn and ensure that those lessons are applied to future pandemics and crises.  That is the general philosophy and one that I would have.  That said, the fact that senior people raised those concerns is a worry, although the system did respond.  The biggest issue early on was personal protective equipment, PPE.  Public health officials will still say that it may not necessarily have been visitors coming into the nursing homes that was the primary conduit or cause of the transmission of the virus and that there were other factors as well.  The current testing is beginning to throw some light on that also at the moment.</p></speech>

For most people the test as to whether Fianna F&aacute;il has changed and will lead the Government of change that people voted for on 8 February is how working people will fair under its government.  A key and immediate litmus test as to whether it will bring that change and whether ordinary, working people are going to get a fair deal and the support they need under this Government, faced with another crisis, is the situation faced by 1,500 Debenhams workers who have been protesting following Debenhams' treatment of them in the most despicable manner by, without consultation and without notice, moving the company into liquidation in April of this year.  The company has refused to negotiate with the workers and is orchestrating this situation.  Even though there are probably tens of millions of euro worth of stock in the stores in Henry Street, Blackrock, Cork, Tallaght and Blanchardstown, apparently, this is a company with no assets.  This is because, conveniently, the company, through a subsidiary, lent itself some money and made the Irish business a co-guarantor on money that it lent to itself, effectively eliminating all assets from the balance sheet of the company.  This is despicable treatment of workers.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said earlier that he is focused on legislation.  What does he propose to do to support the Debenhams workers?  Debenhams cannot be allowed to siphon off assets, as it is trying to do, to prevent a fair redundancy deal for these workers.  The legislation to re-order the priority creditors in situations of liquidation needs to be immediately amended such that workers in this situation are not treated in this despicable way, as happened in the case of the Clerys' workers.  This issue has been well flagged.  Where companies are contravening employment legislation or treating workers in this way they should suffer serious penalties for doing so.  The Taoiseach needs to utilise all of the sections available to Government through the Companies Act 2014, in particular sections 599 and 608, to make sure that the company does not take off with the assets and that the workers get the fair redundancy and decent treatment they deserve.  Solidarity-People Before Profit has placed a motion to this effect on the D&aacute;il Order Paper, which the Debenhams' workers hope the Government and all parties will support and thus take the actions necessary to get them a just settlement.  As we speak, these women workers are picketing outside the Henry Street store to prevent assets being physically removed from it by a cynical company that has treated them with contempt.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the company has availed of the legal framework within the Companies Act in regard to insolvencies, winding-up and so on, to leave the workers extremely short.  The State will have to do its bit to provide, within the legal framework, what it can in terms of statutory redundancy, but it is unacceptable.  In my view, the legislation will have to be re-examined in terms of the devices that companies may use, separating out assets from trading income in particular, to deprive workers of their just entitlements in terms of redundancy.  This will not be simple because reform of any legislation can have unintended consequences.  This issue is referenced in the programme for Government.  It is an area on which work will commence in terms of examining the overall company law situation with a view to reducing the capacity of companies to deny workers their entitlements in terms of redundancy and workers' rights generally when a company is winding up.</p> <p>It is an area in which work will commence in terms of examining the overall company law situation with a view to reducing the capacity of companies to deny workers their redundancy entitlements and their rights generally when a company is being wound up.  That it happened in the context of Covid-19 was particularly regrettable.  The sense is that Covid-19 was used as a basis for closing the company and leaving 1,500 people out of work.</p></speech>

We need to act urgently to do everything we can to make sure that Debenhams does not get away with manipulating the law as it stands to siphon off these assets.  Its failure to consult workers and the fact that the State may have to pay out the statutory redundancy gives us certain leverage under that legislation for the insolvency fund to go after the assets of Debenhams, and we should do that.  It tried to siphon off those assets but was prevented because of the heroic protests of the workers.</p>  <p>  There are echoes of the Dunnes Stores-South Africa strike battle on those picket lines.  I encourage the Taoiseach to go down and meet the women because they are an absolute inspiration and they are not going away.  They are going to fight for justice.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to do absolutely everything to ensure justice for the workers.  The assets are in those shops.  Debenhams must not be allowed to take them out.  The assets should be liquidated to the benefit of the workers to ensure a just settlement for them.</p>  <p>  There is a lot at stake because this is not just about Debenhams workers.  We are facing potentially tens of thousands of similar redundancies, so this is a test.  Are we going to stand with workers faced with this kind of treatment and the possibility of mass redundancies in this country to prevent that sort of shoddy treatment and to protect workers who have given decades of loyal service, as these workers have?</p></speech>

For the existing workforce, the liquidation process and how we can leverage the remaining assets to secure the rights of workers is a challenging and complex issue, as the Deputy knows deep down.  I accept his bona fides in respect of what he wishes to happen on behalf of the workers and understand where he is coming from in that regard.</p>  <p>  There are a few dimensions to this.  How can we support in the most practical way the workers who have been laid off?  How can we prevent the exploitation of company law to prevent such exploitation of workers into the future?  How can we build in greater protections for workers, in case of such eventualities, so that they will have greater claims and access to clawbacks following closures engineered in this way in future.  That is what I would like to examine with my colleagues in government.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable for us that he would be able to give a statement and there would not be opportunities for questions from the Opposition and answers from the Minister, as was the case and became the precedent on numerous occasions in the previous D&aacute;il.  There are, as the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said on the radio this morning, numerous questions outstanding relating to the offence itself, the status of Deputy Cowen's driving licence and whether he was repeatedly in breach of the law in terms of learner driver plates, accompanying drivers and so on.

The Taoiseach is aware that parents of children with additional needs are currently before the courts in a bid to obtain this assessment of need for their children within the legally set timeframe, which, as he is also aware, is three months.  I will not comment on individual cases, but the Taoiseach will know that any child who is thought to have additional needs is legally entitled to this assessment within three months under the Disability Act.</p> <p>This timeframe is crucial because it recognises the importance of early intervention and support.  It is scandalous that nine out of ten children who apply for an assessment do not have that assessment completed within the statutory timeframe and some wait for up to two years.  The State forces parents into lengthy, stressful and expensive battles in the courts.  This is not new.  The State has behaved this way before.  Brigid McCole, Louise O'Keeffe and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na faced this.  This attitude and approach need to change.  As Head of Government, will the Taoiseach act immediately to ensure that no other parent has to go to the courts to get the assessment of needs that his or her child is entitled to within three months?</p></speech>

There have been issues ever since that Act was introduced in 2005.  I understand that some sections of that Act remain to be commenced regarding children with special needs.  The allocation of resources in education does not always depend on that assessment of need having taken place but it is nonetheless obviously desirable for parents to have an assessment of need carried out so that the best health and education provision can be made for the child.  The Ministers with specific responsibility for this in the new Government will work to get the waiting times down significantly, both for assessment of need and for allocation of places in special schools and mainstream education, as well as access to healthcare facilities.  That will be an objective of the Government.</p></speech>

I would like the Taoiseach to deal with the issue I am about to raise fairly quickly because there is a significant anomaly as a result of Covid.  All driver licences and learner permits which expire before 30 June have been extended by a further four months but full licences that expire from 1 July onwards have not been extended.  All learner driver permits that expire between 1 July and 30 October have also been extended by four months.  This is an anomaly.  People with full licences cannot renew the licences.  As a temporary measure, will the Taoiseach extend that period as he did with other licences?  I am sorry for bringing up licences again.  The period should be extended at least until the date on which people get their appointment, which may be up to six weeks away.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Taoiseach said earlier that three Ministers are looking at the issue.  In light of the fact that it is so urgent and that mothers have had to give up jobs because they cannot access childcare, what timescale are Ministers working to?  Will the Taoiseach give a time by which he expects a decision to be made because new mothers need to know where they stand?</p></speech>

A similar stand-off is taking place right now in Blanchardstown.  New legislation to protect workers' rights in cases of company liquidation is referred to on page 23 of the programme for Government.  My colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, raised points about the Duffy Cahill report.  The experience of the Debenhams workers shows, however, that new legislation needs to go further than Duffy Cahill in two urgent respects and I ask the Taoiseach to comment.  The first is that the 30 day consultation period has to be meaningful.  Workers affected and their representatives need to have full sight of the company books and prompt responses.  Second, in anticipation of further waves of Covid and the possible reversion to lockdown, legislation needs to provide for a suspension of liquidations that arise or ostensibly arise from the impact of Covid in order to permit time and space to examine the option of saving jobs.  I would like the Taoiseach to comment on that.</p></speech>

There are many unanswered questions and a lack of information available to businesses.  Will there be a hard border?  Will there be customs checks on the Border?  What will be the situation with tariffs?  How will workers travel from Dundalk to the North and <i>vice versa</i>?  Will people be stopped at the Border?  Will driving licences and car insurance still be valid in both jurisdictions?  People in Border areas are concerned.  What  preparation have the Taoiseach and his Government made to help combat this?  There will be a hard border.</p></speech>

The situation with negotiations between the European Union and British Government is difficult.  I spoke to the British Prime Minister and we both agreed that there was a need to comprehensively deal with the issue in a way that would involve a comprehensive free trade agreement and would be of benefit to Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and that it was not desirable to have a poor Brexit or a no-deal Brexit.  We also emphasised the need to implement the protocol as it pertains to Northern Ireland, and for what has been agreed to date to be adhered to in any subsequent agreement and in the operation of any post-Brexit scenario.  The Government will prepare for a number of scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.  We will work with all the stakeholders and companies in that regard to ensure that people are properly prepared at all levels and in all sectors for such an eventuality, which we do not desire and do not want to happen.</p></speech>

We referred to some of them today.  There is a cohort of young men and women with intellectual disabilities.  There are a couple in my parish.  One story about little Jack was shared on Facebook on Sunday.  It is heart-rending.  I welcome the July provision but this cohort of people does not have anything, even trips to their special schools on the bus with their carers.  I salute everybody involved on boards of management, workers and teaching staff.  Can the Government or the Minister with responsibility for disability do something for this cohort of people who are profoundly affected?  They are incarcerated in their houses and need to be able to get out to interact with others who go to those special schools.  They are severely impacted.  We see self-harm and a significant regression of the progress that they have made in those special schools and with special tuition.  They need support immediately.  They have been incarcerated for too long and they are trapped.</p></speech>

I would like if he could forward to me the example of the schools or the cohort of students in question.  This year's July provision has been expanded significantly compared with previous years, including school-based provision, home-based provision and the extension and expansion of DEIS schools.</p> <p>Yesterday the Minister for Education and Skills got sanction from Cabinet to provide for post-primary children with Down's syndrome, who previously had been outside the scheme, to participate.  We are anxious to respond to any cohort of children who for one reason or another, as the Deputy has articulated, do not have access to the July provision.  I would appreciate if the Deputy could send me on the details.</p></speech>

On 18 June, the Taoiseach said of Shane Ross, the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, "I don't think he gets the regions ... both Shannon and Cork have huge roles to play [if we are to be serious about] rebalancing the [State]."  Today Shannon Airport is seeking redundancies.  Some Shannon Heritage sites are closed, and others are closing at the end of August.  There is no balanced regional development.  The same company is keeping sites open in Dublin.  When will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to rebalance our aviation sector and ensure we have balanced development across that sector?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may have seen national television and newspaper reports in recent weeks that Gaggan, west of Bandon, has little or no broadband.  Areas in Kinsale, Bandon and Clonakilty all the way back to the three peninsulas in west Cork have similar nightmares.  Owing to Covid, the previous Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment allowed extra capacity to broadband and mobile phone companies to help people who live in rural communities to access broadband and phone services.  Strangely enough, not one area that had issues in west Cork that I am aware of got extra services due to this extra capacity being given, leading to the question: where in rural Ireland was the extra capacity rolled out?</p>  <p>  Many people who could work from home are unable to do so.  The people of Gaggan, like many more in west Cork, are subject to spending their day in a church car park so that they can work.  What can I tell the people of Gaggan, Bandon and other parts of west Cork?  Will they get a broadband service immediately or will they have to continue to go to the church car park for broadband?</p></speech>

That said, the programme for Government is committed to rolling out the national broadband contract as agreed by the previous Government.  The indications are that the company may be in a position to accelerate some dimensions of that plan.  The objective is to get broadband rolled out as quickly as possible.  The Minister will be looking at hubs, for example, in certain locations that may facilitate people in rural areas to get quicker and more effective access and greater connectivity.  To answer the Deputy's question, I cannot promise him something immediately, but it is very high on the Government's agenda to roll out the broadband plan as fast as possible and to do so in a way that would give communities quicker access than may have been previously envisaged.</p></speech>

He will also probably be aware that on 11 May the then Taoiseach, and Ministers for Finance, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation met the heads of the five retail banks.  I have the minutes of that meeting here.  At that meeting the CEO of Bank of Ireland claimed that the charging of interest accrued during mortgage payment breaks was required by the regulator.  The CEO of AIB said that unless the additional interest was charged, loans would go into default and the credit ratings of customers would be impacted.  Jeremy Masding of Permanent TSB said that the approach that was being taken was required to prevent the loans from being considered as going into default.</p>  <p>  This morning at the Special Committee on Covid-19 response, I questioned the Governor of the Central Bank.  All those claims are false, untrue and misinformation.  That has been clarified by the Governor of the Central Bank.  I knew that at the time.  What surprises me is that the Minister for Finance, the then Taoiseach and the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation did not know.  What will the Taoiseach do about State-owned banks that misinformed the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach of the time?  Will he take steps to support ordinary customers and prevent them from being ripped off, as has happened in Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and other areas where legislation was introduced?</p></speech>

Two years ago, the Taoiseach led a debate in this Chamber where we voted by 2:1 to change that scheme to ensure the survivors would get redress.  In recent comments the Taoiseach mentioned that progress had been made with a view to reopening the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme.  Will he outline what progress has been made?  Like me, the Taoiseach has met a number of these groups.  I know he met the Creagh Lane group from Limerick on a number of occasions.  When does he anticipate the matter being resolved?</p></speech>

Since we raised this issue the last time, the outgoing Taoiseach outlined that there would be a redesign or a review of the redress scheme and that it would be changed.  That work is under way.  I understand that since the judge's determination at the time and the review, offers of compensation have been made to 13 survivors as a result of that report and review.  I will meet the Department of Education and Skills on Friday.  I hope to be in a position to get more specific detail and a report on the issue.  I hope to give the Deputy a timeline then for rolling out the new redress scheme.</p></speech>

Louth County Council has made another application under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, for this vital and badly needed piece of infrastructure.  It would also open up lands to provide homes in the depths of a housing crisis.  Just over a year ago the new Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was in Drogheda with Fianna F&aacute;il councillors in the run-up to the local elections.  He called for the funding to be provided for the northern cross route.  Little did he know that just over a year later he would be Minister in that Department with the ability to ensure that that funding can be given for the northern cross route.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to deliver that funding?  Can we take as genuine the Minister's word that funding should be provided?  Will he deliver?  Will the Taoiseach reassure me and the people of Drogheda that he will deliver that funding for the northern cross route?</p></speech>

Yesterday we heard the harrowing account of the treatment of one nursing home resident in County Meath, Ultan Meehan, and the condition in which he was transferred to Connolly Hospital where he later passed away.</p> <p>In early June, I raised the case with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, HIQA and the HSE.  It is very apparent that the monitoring of private nursing homes falls between the cracks and that the system is totally inadequate.  A full independent investigation is needed in this case.  In the sector more broadly, we need robust safeguarding legislation and legislation to improve clinical governance.  I think that is agreed across the board.  What are the Taoiseach's plans for this matter?  Do they involve expanding the role of HIQA and the HSE?</p></speech>

He now believes he will not get the points he needs to study politics and journalism in the University of Limerick.  I also give the example of Kinga Szalaj who wants to study medicine.  She completed her leaving certificate last year and while she received good points, it was not enough to get her into a medical degree.  She taught herself at home with the help of <i>homeschool.ie </i>and <i>themathstutor.ie</i>because she could not afford grinds.  Her health professions admission test, HPAT, results were excellent - in the 92nd percentile - but because she does not qualify for a calculated grade, she will miss out on the opportunity to study medicine despite those excellent results.  Does the Taoiseach accept that those students are facing an injustice?  Will he engage with them to try to find a solution for them so that they do not miss out on places in third level through no fault of their own?</p></speech>

One must be balanced about the leaving certificate and the allocation of third level places because there are many competing rights.  What is done to affirm and help people in one area could have the unintended consequence of undermining the rights of others and their access to places in medicine or other courses.  I make that general point.</p>  <p>  When estimated grades emerged as a solution, it was clear that problems would emerge.  That said, mechanisms exist within the third level sector to facilitate access for students from specific backgrounds and contexts through the disability access route to education, DARE, project and others.  I will have to engage with the Department to see if some resolution can be found.</p></speech>

I have worked in that area for the past 20 years and there has been a massive increase in drug use and criminality.  The people involved are younger and younger.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if there will be a structured link between schools and local youth drug services?  There is no such link at the moment.  Arrangements are <i>ad hoc </i>and a matter for individual principals and schools.  They need to be more structured.</p><p>Will the community sector be involved in a public awareness programme?

The more critical point is that there are very strong self-esteem and self-respect modules of learning within school curricula and programmes to enable young people to be strong enough within their peer groups to resist temptation and being lured into behaviour which is injurious and damaging to them.  I am a great believer in inculcating self-respect and self-esteem in young people from the earliest age.  That is the best protection we can give our children.</p>  <p>  Equally, I am conscious of what the Deputy is saying and it is a serious issue for society.  There are measures to deal with the issue in the programme for Government.  I am anxious that the school completion programme will come back within the Department of Education and Skills and integrate better with our educational structures.  If we maintain children in school longer, we will have a better chance of keeping them from harm.</p></speech>

Four buses are being cut from one school and seven from another.  These cuts appear to be Dublin-wide and will therefore affect thousands of students and their parents.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700018#S01100"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to give statutory effect to recommendations of the Labour Court in relation to pay and conditions in certain sectors of the economy; and to provide for connected matters. </blockquote>  <p>A recent High Court judgment struck down the sectoral employment order, SEO, system for the electrical contracting sector and also the statutory framework for other such orders as set out in Chapter 3 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  The judgment has had a chilling effect on the conduct of industrial relations in this country.  It is a far-reaching judgment and there may be consequences outside the immediate subject area of the actual Bill.  The judgment must be appealed to the Supreme Court because there are very significant issues of public interest at hand.</p><p>Since 1908 under the old Trade Boards Act and later under an Act of the Oireachtas enacted in 1946, it has been the policy of the State to provide a framework for sectoral collective bargaining to promote decent pay, terms and conditions above the statutory basic minima in areas of the economy that were susceptible to low pay, exploitation and where trade union density may be patchy or non-existent.  Chapter 3 of the 2015 Act, on the SEO system, which was the subject of the recent High Court ruling and was deemed to be in conflict with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, was designed to address deficiencies in the role of the Oireachtas in the making of the former registered employment agreements, as found in what is known as the McGowan judgment of 2013.  The High Court has now judged, in the National Electrical Contractors of Ireland, NECI, <i>v.</i>the Labour Court, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Attorney General, that, in essence, the Minister and the Labour Court are exercising the legislative power of the State by making laws giving effect to the terms of the three purported sectoral employment orders without being the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Industrial Relations (Sectoral Employment Orders Confirmation) Bill 2020 seeks immediately to remedy this defect by giving statutory effect to the recommendations of three purported sectoral employment orders covering tens of thousands of electricians and construction workers across all kinds of grades and categories and, indeed, mechanical engineers and related disciplines too.  In other words, the terms of these three orders that were struck down essentially by the High Court can under the proposed legislation be converted into primary law with the blessing of both Houses of the Oireachtas to address some of these significant defects identified by the High Court.</p><p>The programme for Government is virtually silent, sadly, on the whole question of workers' rights and their advancement.  Since its foundation, the State has expressed it to be desirable that there should be space to allow unions and employers to engage in sectorally applicable and enforceable agreements across entire economic sectors in order to support the principle of decent work, avoid a damaging race to the bottom and promote a level playing pitch for good, compliant businesses.  This Bill continues in that tradition.  Its ambitions have the support of the trade union movement.  It is urgent for tens of thousands of workers across the construction sector and related disciplines and for our economy.  I am hopeful the Government will see fit to support this legislation when it is tabled for Second Stage debate shortly.</p></speech>

While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in some of these offices, they operate independently of my Department.  I will first briefly outline what is involved with the other Votes and then address them in greater detail.</p><p>On Vote 1, the Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;4.5 million.  This includes some &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.  On Vote 3, the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;16.18 million.</p> <p>Of this, just over &euro;12 million relates to staff costs and almost &euro;2.45 million is allocated to the Law Reform Commission.</p> <p> Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The CSO plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data on a broad range of topics including social, economic and environmental issues.  In a world where alternative facts are regularly circulated to try to distort debate, institutions such as the CSO are becoming ever more important in providing the essential foundation of expertise to underpin policy.  In recent months, the CSO has taken a lead in gathering data relevant to understanding and overcoming the impact of Covid-19 on our society and economy.  It has also moved rapidly to adapt its methodologies, and its work will be fundamental as we plan for a recovery which benefits all of our people.  The Estimate for the CSO is &euro;65.7 million and provides funding for additional cyclical work, in particular the delivery of a census of agriculture in 2020 and planning for next year's full census of population.</p> <p> Vote 5 relates to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the allocation for which is &euro;43.97 million.  This Vote provides for fees to counsel, costs awarded against the State arising out of legal proceedings, and the cost of the local state solicitor service.</p> <p> Vote 6  is the Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and amounts to &euro;37.4 million, the bulk of which relates to salaries and administration.</p> <p> Vote 2  is for the Department of the Taoiseach.  The largest provision in this group of Votes relates to my Department, for which the Estimate is just over &euro;54 million.  Approximately 41% relates to staff and administration.  This funding is intended to enable my Department to play a unique role in co-ordinating Government and leading on certain critical issues.  The programme for Government sets out transformative policies on the full range of issues of concern to the people.  Starting with urgent action for social and economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and continuing with actions on health, housing, climate change and education, the three parties in this Government have jointly committed to a programme of sustained action.  In order to deliver this, we need a new approach to managing Government.  We have begun establishing a series of new Cabinet committees that will mark a significant departure.  They will cover more topics, will meet more regularly and will allow a much deeper engagement with policy development and oversight of delivery.  They will ensure that all relevant Departments take responsibility for their roles in delivering priorities rather than placing sole responsibility on a single lead Department.  Reflecting its new roles and the priorities set out by Government, a new departmental strategy statement will be published in the coming months.</p> <p> The Department of the Taoiseach has taken a central role in co-ordinating the State&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This will continue to be an overriding priority for as long as is necessary.  We are only just beginning to understand the full impact of the pandemic and we continue to face new challenges as we work to control the spread of the virus, treat it effectively and move towards recovery.  In the fifth month of an unprecedented national effort, and with three steps of the reopening plan implemented, we simply cannot let our guard down.  We are reopening, but this reopening absolutely requires us all to continue to act to control the possible spread of the virus.  When people ignore basic precautions by gathering in large numbers with no social distancing, no masks and no hygiene measures, they represent a direct threat to the control of the virus.  I do not intend to provide a running commentary on major instances where guidelines have been breached, and all of the evidence is that the vast majority of people continue to act responsibly, but let no one be in any doubt, the virus has not been defeated and we must all continue to play our part.</p> <p> We also need to understand that there are still many in our society who are vulnerable and many others who are fearful.  All of the economic and social research available to us confirms that the impact of the crisis is not being felt equally.  We must do everything possible to protect those who are vulnerable and to help those who are suffering other impacts such as to their mental health.  The first step in showing continued solidarity is to accept the restrictions which remain in place.</p> <p> My Department has taken the lead in key elements of the public communication challenge of ensuring that we all know what is happening and what is required of each of us.  This represents the largest unanticipated cost in these Estimates.  The focus of the public awareness programme to date has been to build mass awareness and understanding of key information relating to the Covid-19 emergency response as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The approach is aligned with World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control advice.  The scale of the effort required to reach as many people as possible, with regular messages to raise awareness and build public support for the collective effort required, has necessitated a significant spending.  A provision of &euro;20 million for this work is included in the Revised Estimates for 2020.  In the early stages, the work in question involved providing information to the public on the various restrictions as they were implemented and on the wide range of business supports, social welfare supports and community supports available.  Targeted campaigns have addressed specific issues such as social distancing and the leaving certificate.  At the moment, the emphasis is on explaining each phase of the Roadmap for the Reopening of Society and Business as they come into effect.  The public awareness campaigns have cost &euro;10.5 million to date.</p> <p> Comprehensive public communications with broad media reach will continue to be run for as long as is necessary to inform on crucial public health guidance.  My intention is that in the coming weeks we will specifically review the most effective messages for the task of ensuring that people both take advantage of reopening steps and continue to take essential precautions.  People must understand that until there is an available and widely-administered vaccine, full normality is not going to happen.</p> <p> I would like us all to note that in a free democracy such as ours, the independent media is the principal channel of communication with the public during a major emergency such as this.  I want to acknowledge the commitment of journalists to covering this crisis in often stressful circumstances and also for asking the tough questions essential to challenging us to be more effective.</p> <p> In the Government&rsquo;s first week in office, our two overriding priorities have been to take decisions relating to the control of the virus and to rapidly commence work on an initiative to address the devastating economic impact of the pandemic.  We have been reviewing work by the Department of Finance on high-frequency data on economic activity to try to get a level of understanding of the current situation.  Overall, the data shows that many sectors are seeing a strong rebound as the reopening of the economy has moved forward.  However, we are also seeing that other sectors are stabilising at a lower level.  This could become a new normal unless we act.  We will act and we will do so with urgency.  An investment-led, jobs and recovery initiative is being developed and will be finalised in the coming weeks.  Our priority will be to protect businesses - and the jobs relating to them - which are still struggling and need help to be able to first survive and then compete as the international economic situation improves.</p> <p> Later in the year, we will also produce a new economic plan.  This plan, will detail how we will secure a strong and dynamic economy, prepare workers and businesses for the challenges and changes of the future, enhance our skills base, retrain and support workers to seize new opportunities, and bring about the transformation in our economy that the crisis of climate change demands.  This work will be overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment which we established last week.</p> <p> I intend that this Government will build further on Ireland's record of being an effective and active participant in both the European Union and international organisations.  This is a grave moment in world history.  Those of us who believe in free democracy and co-operation between nations cannot stand on the sidelines while they are under attack.  As is signalled in the programme for Government, we will be promoting the strengthening of the European Union and the extension of its ability to be a driver of progress and a protector of core values.  We will implement a whole-of-Government approach to cross-cutting EU and international issues such as the sustainable development goals and international trade.  We will also take a seat on the UN Security Council for a two-year term from 2021 to 2022.  This gives Ireland another opportunity to advance our foreign policy objectives and values, and influence decisions that impact the lives of millions of the most vulnerable of the world&rsquo;s citizens.  We will continue to increase the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint in terms of diplomacy, culture, business, official development assistance, tourism and trade.</p> <p> As part of the EU institutional changeover last year, EU Heads of State and Government agreed a new strategic agenda to guide EU policy, ambition and budgets over the next number of years.  The scale and urgency of many issues has evolved rapidly since then and Ireland will use every opportunity to support this new level of ambition, especially where it is based on addressing entrenched problems and is fair to all members.</p> <p> In recent months, Covid-19 has caused a crisis without precedent at global and European level.  Focus has rightly changed to managing and controlling the pandemic and to mitigating and recovering from its impacts, including the extensive economic damage it has inflicted.  In the European Union, this has involved intensive discussions at all levels on limiting the spread of the virus, ensuring the supply of medicines, equipment and goods, supporting research, tackling socioeconomic consequences and co-operating to bring citizens home from other countries.  I will continue the work with other European Union leaders to protect our citizens and to secure the speediest possible recovery.  Reaching an early agreement on the European Union's multi-annual financial framework for the period of 2021-2027 and on the proposed recovery fund for the European Union would be a strong signal that the Union is determined to come together at this difficult time.  I hope that when the European Council meets later this month, it will be possible to make strong and positive progress.</p> <p> From the moment the Brexit referendum was proposed, I have been very clear in describing it as an error of historic proportions.  However, it is done and the challenge we continue to face is managing its impact and developing a new and constructive relationship with our neighbour without the framework of joint European Union membership which we shared for nearly five decades.  Negotiations are continuing on the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Achieving an agreement that fully protects Irish interests will be a central objective of this Government and Ireland will work tirelessly for that outcome as part of the European Union 27.</p> <p> We will also continue to work with partners to ensure that the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is implemented in full, engaging closely with the European Union-United Kingdom joint committee and the specialised committee, to ensure bedding down of the new arrangements.  My Department is also strongly engaged in the ongoing work on national preparedness for the outcome of Brexit negotiations, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and all across Government in anticipation of the end of the transition period in January 2021.  While much work was done last year, we still have much more to do, especially in helping businesses who face new barriers to trade with Britain.  A heightened round of stakeholder engagement will be undertaken and contingency plans will be updated.</p> <p> Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will take effect from the end of the transition period.  During the remainder of 2020 we will engage closely with the European Union-United Kingdom joint committee and the specialised committee to ensure the bedding down of the new arrangements.  The restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and the assembly provides a moment of hope for all who share this island.  Among my first telephone calls as Taoiseach were calls with First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  I told them that this Government is determined to work actively and constructively with them in their vital work.</p> <p> The Good Friday Agreement remains the defining blueprint for our island&rsquo;s future and a vindication of democratic politics.  The very genius of the agreement is how it shows that we need not bring constitutional differences into every issue.  It shows us how to work together for the peace and prosperity which everyone can hold as a shared goal.  This new Government will move forward quickly to try to fulfil the vision set out in the agreement and will work closely with the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland.  A new shared island unit will be established within the Department of the Taoiseach and will begin a renewed push to use the potential of the agreement to deliver sustained progress for all communities.  It is my intention that the new unit will be in place and its work programme agreed by the Government at the end of this month.  The Government is committed to having an early plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council as soon as possible so that we can make progress on the many shared challenges that we face across this island.</p> <p> Tackling the climate crisis is a key focus of this Government.  The programme for Government recognises that the next ten years are critical if we are to address the climate and biodiversity crisis which threatens our safe future on this planet.  Under existing plans, my Department is tasked with supervising delivery and now has a key role to ensure the critical co-ordination across all Departments and agencies.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, leads a new Department with a clear and ambitious agenda across a number of the key areas for climate action and, in particular, energy and transport.  The climate action unit within the Department of the Taoiseach plays an important role in ensuring centre-of-Government co-ordination, which is essential in making sure that every Department plays its part.</p> <p> It is a fundamental premise of this Government that gains from the growing economy are shared fairly with all Irish citizens.  We want to create a socially inclusive and fair society with opportunities for all.  Under the new Cabinet committees agreed in the programme for Government, we will implement programme for Government commitments in the context of a new national social contract between citizens and the State.  The ambition of this Government is to provide each citizen with accessible and affordable healthcare, housing, education, childcare and disability services, as well as working towards a living wage, upskilling, and a dignified retirement.</p> <p> My Department also supports the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality established last July.  The first meeting took place in February but subsequent meetings were postponed due to Covid-19.  An online half-day seminar for members took place last Saturday.  The secretariat is looking at the best way to progress the work of the assembly in light of the current public health restrictions.</p> <p> The Revised Estimate for my Department also includes an allocation of just over &euro;2 million for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, for its work in providing forward-looking, strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes Covid-19 research contributing to policy response and analysis.  The work of the implementation group on policing reform is supported by an implementation office in my Department.  I am encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation.  This is building on good work already undertaken in the reform programme but it has also highlighted, and brought to the fore, core values about our approach to policing in this country - policing for and with the support of the community.</p> <p> Provision is also made in the Estimate for a number of independent inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission and the Cooke commission.  My Department also organises State events, including the anniversary of the Easter Rising and the National Day of Commemoration ceremony, which will take place this Sunday at the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks.  Work is ongoing with Cork City Council to plan the State commemoration in Cork on 1 November.  Since it was first adopted in commemorating the 1798 Rebellion, the approach of expert and inclusive commemoration has proven itself time and again.  Our history belongs to no one group and there is also no single correct version of history.  I intend that we build upon this approach as we move towards commemorating a dramatic period in the foundation of our state and the assertion the will of the Irish people to live in a free democracy.</p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates with Deputies.</p></speech>

If we could engage in an interactive format and the Taoiseach could respond, that would be very helpful.</p>  <p>  Today is the first occasion on which Deputy Martin, as Taoiseach, presented himself for Leaders' Questions and also the Revised Estimates.  In building for the future, it should be understood that Irish unity is the very best plan for this island and for our people.  It should be recalled that we are living in times of change across the island and in relationships between our island and that of Britain.  Brexit and the Covid-19 public health emergency have reshaped how people think and talk about reunification.  Both of these crises have shown very dramatically the danger and jeopardy of the Border on our island.  No longer is Irish unity discussed only in aspirational terms, it is now increasingly regarded as a common-sense approach and essential to the prosperity of all of our people.  I say that because growing our green economy requires an all-Ireland approach.  Protecting and building public health services and protecting public health requires an all-Ireland approach, as does strengthening our agricultural sector and defending rural Ireland.  All of these things must be all-Ireland in nature.  This conversation is happening across the island.  People from many different perspectives are reconsidering long-held views and they are looking anew at the prospect of a new Ireland, a united Ireland, and asking how this might deliver a better future for us all.</p> <p> Given all of that, it is disappointing that constitutional change on Irish unity is not featured in the programme for Government.  This missed opportunity was compounded by the fact that the Taoiseach failed to appoint anyone from the North to the Seanad.  That was a grave mistake.  I think we would all agree that the former Senator, Ian Marshall, made a very valuable contribution to the Seanad.  He was a strong, independent, unionist and anti-Brexit voice and a very welcome addition to our political discourse.  It is very important that Northern society be represented within the Oireachtas and that people from a unionist tradition be included, and so the Taoiseach got this one wrong.  Ironically, it flies in the face of commitments made by previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments to ensuring Northern representation in the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach will recall that that was committed to by his predecessor Bertie Ahern - fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;.</p> <p> In light of all that, I ask the Taoiseach about his shared island unit.  He stated it will be up and running and have a programme of work by the end of this month.  No provision is made for this unit in the Estimate.  Will the Taoiseach explain that?  What exactly is the unit going to do?  Will he establish an Oireachtas joint committee on Irish unity?  Will he convene an all-island representative citizens' assembly, or such an appropriate forum, to discuss and plan for constitutional change?  Will he initiate the process for a referendum and get clarity on what the thresholds for triggering such a referendum might be?  I ask that the Taoiseach respond to those initial questions and I will then raise two other issues relating to the Estimates.</p></speech>

We have deliberately said we are setting up a shared island unit within the Department of An Taoiseach.  As for why we use the term "shared island", in his autobiography the late Seamus Mallon talked about a shared home place.  The agenda for the future on this island is how we engineer and develop an accommodation where we can all live in peace, harmony and reconciliation on the island and not to, at the outset, try to dictate to one tradition or one group what the solution is going to be, which seems to be the agenda the Deputy is pursuing.</p>  <p>  My view, as I said earlier, is that the Good Friday Agreement is the defining document and the defining agreement because it was based on three relationships, namely, the British-Irish relationship, the North-South relationship and the relationship between the two different traditions within Northern Ireland.  Irrespective of what may emerge in the future or how the island develops in the future, it is my view that those three relationships will have to underpin any future dispensation or arrangements.  The idea of the shared island unit is to work, develop a process and seek to understand how we can develop a shared future on the island, politically, administratively, departmentally, socially, culturally and so forth.  We want the unit to develop some research, to get some work done and to engage with other parties as a forerunner to other initiatives that could be taken.  What is essential, however, is that we reach out to and try to persuade those who are not of the same view as us in terms of what we might see as the desired eventual outcome.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that precipitating or organising a referendum immediately is the way to go.  That was the Sinn F&eacute;in position since Brexit happened, although it has come back a bit from that.  The over-focus on the Border poll was too divisive and too partisan and ran counter to what Sinn F&eacute;in wanted to achieve.  That is my view.  I favour a different approach.  For example, I favour a stronger North-South dimension now.  Aspects of that dimension of the Good Friday Agreement need greater development than it currently enjoys and some of the bodies need to be given greater support in terms of their respective agenda.  This is a positive initiative we are taking in good faith involving all parties, traditions and communities and we want to try to move ahead with it on as non-partisan a basis as possible.</p></speech>

That is at the core of the Good Friday Agreement.  That matter is settled.  Neither do I believe that anything I have said is partisan.  It is a clear enunciation of my long-held and well-known beliefs.  Far from excluding the other tradition, we supported Ian Marshall when he entered the Seanad and I voted for him as a Seanad&oacute;ir, even though he clearly does not share my political perspective.  It is, in fact, the Taoiseach and the Government that have failed to include a critical voice in the Oireachtas.  They lost that opportunity and that is a great pity.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did not really answer my questions so I will write to him and perhaps we will correspond on the matter.  There needs to be-----</p></speech>

It happened in 1998.  There are people now at work and voting who have lived their whole lives in a post-Good Friday Agreement Ireland - thank God - and that is a great credit to all concerned.  The idea that we are moving with excessive haste, frankly, does not stack up at all.</p>  <p>  I turn to the issue of the office of the T&aacute;naiste, which will be established within the Taoiseach's office, and of an office for the leader of the Green Party.  Am I right in understanding that the Fine Gael and Green Party leaders will have ministerial advisers, press officers and an aide-de-camp in the case of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar?  That is strange and the Taoiseach might explain the precedent for it.  Moreover, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will each have an additional team of staff, including a private office, a policy and programme implementation unit and a deputy Government press secretary.  Will the Taoiseach explain and clarify for the House what additional resources the office of the T&aacute;naiste and the new office for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will have and where they will come from?  Are they new resources or are they redeployments and what is it going to cost?</p></speech>

This is a tripartite Government and I will retain roughly the same number of staff that the previous Taoiseach had, but there will be a T&aacute;naiste's office within the Department of An Taoiseach and the Green Party leader will also have staff.  The full complement has not yet been finalised to my knowledge but as soon it has, it will be transparent and published.  The idea is that this is a programme of Government and it needs to be delivered.</p> <p>All three parties have clear priorities within the programme that they are anxious to have delivered.  The complement of politically appointed staff under the previous Government was 20.6.  There were a number of party and non-party participants.  There is precedent for this going back to the early 1990s.  Deputy Howlin would have been a member of the Government in 1992 when the T&aacute;naiste's office was established, the idea being - there is an open debate about this - that political input is important in delivering a programme for Government.  However, there has to be constructive interaction between the political advisers and the civil servants to ensure that the programme is delivered.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the precedents.  There is also a precedent for the number of Ministers of State appointed.  We need to know not only the structure and rationale for any of the appointments or expansions but also the cost, because the taxpayer is picking up the bill.</p>  <p>  It is also important to state that there is one Taoiseach in office.  I am correct in understanding that.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is not great for our system of government if there is any real or perceived rivalry from the get-go.  I am at a loss to know why the T&aacute;naiste needs an aide-de-camp.  I am aware that others are at a loss also.  The general public - the people we serve - look on and ask legitimate questions about how we are spending their money.  I am unclear, having heard the Taoiseach's response, why somebody in ministerial office, for arguments sake, let us take the leader of the Green Party, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has a big job to do and an extensive portfolio, might need additional resources and staff.  An additional office is to be provided for the Minister.  The Department of the Taoiseach will have a department of the T&aacute;naiste within it.  What will the other office be?  Will it be the office of the leader of the Green Party?  We just need to know what it looks like and, critically, the cost.</p>  <p>  My final point, to which the Taoiseach may not get a chance to respond, is on citizens' assemblies.  They are very effective mechanisms and involve deliberative processes and absolutely powerful stuff.  The Taoiseach has committed to assemblies on biodiversity, matters relating to drug use, the future of education and, later, an elected mayor and local government structures best suited to Dublin.  There is, however, no additional money in the Estimates for any of these.  Are we to take it as read that the single Citizens' Assembly on gender equality is the only one that will be up and running between now and the end of the year?</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach rightly stated, the work of his Department, as in other areas of Government, will in the coming years and certainly in the coming months focus on and be dominated by the challenges and demands of the ongoing Covid crisis, from both health and economic perspectives.  Please God, we have seen the worst of the crisis.  I hope we will not be visited by a second wave.  There will be a focus on the economic consequences of whatever stimulus will be presented in the coming weeks and months to deal with the unprecedented impact.  As we go on, we will have very many opportunities to deal with these particular aspects.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Taoiseach on his appointment.  This is my first opportunity to do so formally.  It is an extraordinary honour for him.  I wish him well.  If he does well, the State does well.  I genuinely wish him and his family every success in this regard.</p>  <p>  In the few minutes I have, I want to deal with some of the aspects of the Votes the Taoiseach says are under his remit but over which he does not have direct administrative control.  He does, however, have legislative control over them.  I want to focus on the role of the Chief State Solicitor.  Obviously, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is part of the Office of the Attorney General.  The Chief State Solicitor represents the State in litigation, including before the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The office deals with immigration and asylum and has an administrative law division.  It represents the State in judicial review proceedings on matters of immigration, nationality, citizenship and applications in that regard.</p>  <p>  I raise this matter with the Taoiseach because the application of the International Protection Act 2015, which is relatively new, has been a cause of concern for me recently.  The Act was to consolidate, in a single process, asylum applications and so on.  I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this with the Taoiseach as opposed to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I have written my email on this matter to the Minister for Justice and Equality but I got a response not from that Minister but from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, telling me what I had outlined as a problem in the first place.  As we have known, we have had various issues with the agencies of the State dealing with complicated issues.  It is always a good idea for every agency of the State to be subject to the overview of this House and its Members.  INIS is not.  One gets the standard reply that, because the House has enacted the International Protection Act 2015, which I support and which came into effect on 31 December 2016, Members of this House cannot make representations regarding anomalies and concerns we have about the processing of applications.  The only people who can actually communicate with INIS, or the International Protection Office, are an applicant and his or her legal representative.  I ask that we review this.  I hope the Taoiseach will consider it.</p>  <p>  It was good to move responsibility for direct provision to a new Department responsible for integration, whose Minister is Deputy O'Gorman.  Given that this Department is to be responsible for direct provision, surely the International Protection Office and INIS process would be better housed there than in the justice-focused, law-focused, procedure-focused Department of Justice and Equality.  We will have other opportunities to raise that.</p>  <p>  There are a couple of other points I wish to make.  I will give the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond.  With regard to Brexit, there will be a lot more litigation in regard to State aid, competition law and so on.  It is an area in respect of which we need to have much more capacity in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is a matter that the Taoiseach might examine.  I will revert to him on it.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has raised the Louise O'Keefe case.  Since he has done so, I will not overemphasise it now.  The State has expended a lot of money fighting it.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach said he will be meeting representatives from the Department responsible for education on Friday and will subsequently have a timeline for the implementation of redress schemes.  Maybe he will indicate if that is his intention.</p>  <p>  My final point is on the operation of extradition arrangements by the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  As of this minute, thankfully, we have no extradition agreement with China - and we are not likely to have one - but we do have, from last year, an extradition agreement with Hong Kong, specifically the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  I refer to SI 395 of 2019, signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, last year.  Owing to the new national security law now imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing, it is important that the instrument be reviewed.  I ask the Taoiseach to do so.  My time is very limited so I shall give two minutes to the Taoiseach in which he may respond.</p></speech>

What is occurring should not happen.  We should have the facility to make representations on behalf of individuals or, as the Deputy is essentially saying, to have the process subjected to the oversight of this House.</p></speech>

There is a discrete piece around direct provision and integration and, if managed well, it could make a significant difference to people's experience on the ground.</p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about specialist work to give more capacity on Brexit matters and we will certainly look at that.

Overall, the Revised Estimates do not have anything remarkable in them.  The only standout figure is the &euro;20 million for Covid-19 communications, of which &euro;10 million or thereabouts has already been spent.  There has been concern expressed about many of these Revised Estimates in that there are very few metrics to identify where the money is being spent and whether we are getting value for money.  I hope this will be rectified in the remainder of the year so people can make proper assessments.</p>  <p>  I will make a point on communications.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach that they have been good.  There has been much confused and mixed messaging coming from the Government, not least with regard to foreign travel.  Today, I will raise the question of face masks, about which there is a high level of confusion among the public.  On the one hand, masks are supposed to be mandatory in certain circumstances and wearing them is strongly advised but there is no clear guidance on the types of masks to be worn or enforcement of the recommendation.  We are told there are three different types of masks and people in at-risk groups are supposed to be wearing medical-grade masks.  What are medical-grade masks?  Are they blue and white or are they the type that can be bought cheaply in a supermarket?  What about the concern that people will be competing with front-line medical staff, as we are told we should not be using any medical-grade masks for that reason, etc.?  Overall, there is a high level of confusion and no quality standard has been set.  Masks are being sold in all kinds of places and goodness knows where they are coming from or if they do any good at all.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to pay some attention to that and provide a clear message on where masks need to be worn.  Last week, we were told they were mandatory on public transport but that does not seem to be the case.  I was on a bus on Sunday and very few people seemed to be wearing them.  There is a need for a clear message as people's guard has dropped in the past couple of weeks.  If we are mixing more as the economy opens and so on, there must be very clear direction on wearing masks, including what types of masks are to be worn.</p>  <p>  I ask about staffing in the Department of the Taoiseach and specifically the additional offices being set up for the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  What exactly is meant by "office" in this respect with regard to the T&aacute;naiste and the Green Party leader?  I take it this amounts to much more than just an office.  What is the staff complement for the office?  Why is this necessary?  I accept there needs to be a high level of co-operation and co-ordination between the three parties but both the T&aacute;naiste and Green Party leader have departmental offices and offices in the Oireachtas, and they probably have constituency offices.  Why is there a need for these additional offices?  What is the estimated cost of this?  Will the estimated cost of providing these new offices within the Department require a Supplementary Estimate or will it be catered for in the overall current funding envelope?</p>  <p>  My next question relates to political staff.  The Taoiseach already has 200 staff in the Department.  I do not know if he will continue with the position of the previous Taoiseach, who had five special advisers in addition to 17 staff in the Government Information Service.  That seems quite excessive when viewed in addition to a chief of staff, a head of policy, the support of the Secretary General and assistant secretary, etc.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to continue with that level of staffing?</p>  <p>  I do not have anything against advisers and it is important that Ministers have good quality advisers.  Will the Taoiseach at least give us an undertaking that the advisers he will appoint will have expertise?  Could we see an end to this practice of bringing in party hacks to ministerial offices, particularly the Taoiseach's office?  These people need to be properly qualified with expertise relevant to the job.</p>  <p>  We also need clarification on salary scales.  It is important that the salary scales applied to advisers be transparent from the beginning.  Ideally, they should be tied to particular scales in the Civil Service.  I hope there will be early clarification in that regard.</p>  <p>  It also strikes me that there seems to be a large number of specialist staff.  With issues like Brexit or Northern Ireland, one would expect there would be sufficient staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Taoiseach's Department has a complement of 20 staff in the social policy unit, and there is also the &euro;2 million spend on the National Economic and Social Council.  There is a fair bit of overlap and potential duplication.  I hope the Taoiseach will bear that in mind.</p>  <p>  I also raise the undertakings on citizens' assemblies.  I welcome those outlined by the Taoiseach and I presume additional funding will be required over and above the specified &euro;1.8 million.  There is a standout topic that is missing, namely, the need for a citizens' assembly on private property and the provisions relating to private property in the Constitution.  These have been used as an excuse for holding up progress on tackling land issues and how they affect the price of housing.  The other issue with private property is that it is increasingly being used to undermine workers' rights.  Will the Taoiseach give consideration to establishing a citizens' assembly specifically on the topic of private property?</p>  <p>  Finally, will the Taoiseach give us some more detail on the proposals for social dialogue?  I know time is tight but perhaps the Taoiseach will correspond with me on the outstanding matters.</p></speech>

On the &euro;20 million Covid communications Estimate, it is perfectly understandable that communications during the pandemic would be substantial.  However, we know from experience with the Taoiseach's predecessor that a considerable amount of taxpayers' money was put into the strategic communications unit, which came in for strong criticism during the time of Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework.  That episode remains a brazen misuse of State funds to paint the ruling party in government in a positive light.  The Taoiseach will recall the public disquiet, and indeed a D&aacute;il motion supported by his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, that eventually saw the end of the spin unit.  At the time, he spoke of "a huge danger of the blurring of the demarcation lines between bona fide departmental campaigns and full-blooded political campaigns."  My plea to the Taoiseach is that we learn from the mistakes of the past and do not repeat them and that the communications budget should never again be used to present a Government or a party of the Government of the day in any sort of a glorious or positive light.  It should be used to impart actual information to the public.  I am asking the Taoiseach for a commitment from his Government that he will depart from that practice of the past and will not use the budget of communications to advance any Government party or even put the Government in a good light.</p>  <p>  I have two other questions for the Taoiseach.  One is on the budget for commissions of investigation and tribunals of inquiry, for which two figures totalling approximately &euro;8.6 million were given.  If I am not wrong, the Taoiseach mentioned three investigations but did not mention any budget for an independent inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell.  I remember clearly his party campaigning for a motion, which was passed here and voted for by the Taoiseach's party, that there be an independent public inquiry into the death of that young man.  What does the Taoiseach intend to do about this?  Is he now turning his back on Lucia O'Farrell, whom his party met time and again, and the  commitment he gave her in regard to an inquiry into her son's death?</p>  <p>  While I have the floor, I will return to an issue which the State views as a complex and structural question but one which is, in fact, straightforward.  I am referring to the views the Taoiseach expressed this morning in response to a question by Deputy McDonald on extending maternity leave and benefit.  This is an issue of equality for mothers and for children.  Those whose maternity leave was utterly disrupted and damaged by the Covid pandemic need to be looked after.  I cannot understand the reason the Taoiseach and his predecessor seem to be determined to turn this into a most complex and difficult question to address.  The previous Government addressed, and I am sure the Taoiseach's Government will continue to try to address, even more complex matters related to the pandemic, whether payments to businesses, workers or farmers or payments for health.  Why has this become such a convoluted issue given that it is necessary?  I put it to the Taoiseach that his answer to Deputy McDonald earlier was no different from the answers we were given previously by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the previous Ministers for Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have been around the houses on this issue.  I ask the Taoiseach not to do that again and to deliver instead some kind of an answer and show the sense of urgency this matter deserves because the clock is ticking for these mothers and their babies.  It appears to us, to the women outside the gate this morning and to everybody else that the Taoiseach's regime seems to be unable to distinguish itself on this issue.  Is the future of this Government to be that, on key questions, it is unable to distinguish itself from the past?</p></speech>

The staff in the GIS are established civil servants.  I accept the principle, as enunciated by the Deputy, that there is a need to keep the GIS non-party political and that it should not be used to advance a party in government.  In fairness, over the past six months that has not been the agenda in the Covid-19 communications material.  As Deputy Shortall noted, there are metrics on the reach and types of campaigns, for example, on business supports, the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and the advertising around all of that, the lockdown, the community call, business supports, well-being and the reopening roadmap.  All of that took with it extensive advertising.  We have figures on the people reached, the target audience and how high it was and so on.  To be frank, it was also very helpful to the media, both national and local, in terms of their getting through Covid-19 as well.  Fundamentally, however, it was about information.  That is an important point to make in fairness to all concerned over the past number of months, and that will continue to be the case.</p>  <p>  On commissions of investigation, the Estimate relates to those that are up and running and established.  The three mentioned are the Moriarty tribunal, with regard to settling some legal costs; the Cooke report, in respect of Project Eagle; and Mr. Justice Cregan's commission of investigation on Siteserv.  The cost relates to those three commissions of investigation.</p>  <p>  With regard to the death of Shane O'Farrell, that inquiry had not been initiated.  We are one week in government.  We will examine these issues.  There are various Ministers involved but we are very conscious of that case and have been for quite some time, as have a significant number of Deputies.  I have met Lucia O'Farrell and I know the anguish she continues to go through as a result of her son's death.  It is something we will examine and on which we will come back to the House.</p>  <p>  Regarding the extension of maternity benefit, these issues are not as simple as presented.  They merit examination and, as I said earlier, this matter is being examined by the relevant Ministers with responsibility for justice and equality - the outgoing Department - social protection and public expenditure.  It involves policy issues.  Some women's maternity leave would already have expired.  We are looking at a cost of approximately &euro;78 million.  I believe approximately 24,000 women could benefit from this.  That as to be gone through before a final decision can be made in regard to it.  The matter will be brought to Government and we will come back to the House in regard to it, one way or another.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700025#AA00900"><p>On the points the Taoiseach made on the moneys allocated for tribunals, a sum of &euro;4.2 million is allocated in the Revised Estimates by the Taoiseach's office.  There are serious concerns with regard to the expenditure of taxpayers' money with negligible oversight and controls.  Only last week, I got a response from the Taoiseach's office in which it admitted there are no controls over the length of time or costs incurred by the Commission of Investigation into the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  I also asked the Minister for Finance that question.  The Minister did not answer and the Ceann Comhairle informed me that the Minister for Finance had no responsibility in this area.  The Taoiseach knows that the commission of investigation was established in 2015 during a serious political crisis.  The commission was tasked to investigate serious decisions by the IBRC, most notably the sale of Siteserv to Denis O'Brien with a write-down of approximately &euro;119 million.  Other serious questions were discussed at the time around a surge in share dealing that happened just before that sale and the issue of shareholders getting about &euro;5 million in dividends for a company that was basically insolvent.  That commission of investigation was due to deliver the first report on its first module in 2015.</p> <p>It was meant to cost about &euro;4 million in total but in the latter half of 2020 the first of 38 modules has not been completed.  In the last week the commission asked for a further extension of three months.  The cost of this module alone is expected to top out at about &euro;14 million.  The former Taoiseach estimates that the cost of the whole investigation will exceed &euro;30 million.  Several senior analysts reckon this is only half the story.  The cost may exceed &euro;70 million.  The commission is investigating a write-down of &euro;119 million, meaning that its costs are expected to be between 60% and 70% of the value of what it is investigating.  This shows that something is radically wrong with the process.  We have form in this country for tribunals that run way over time and over budget.  We need to see some control over what is happening.</p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; want to see justice.  We want to see the commission get to the heart of what happened with decisions by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We are calling on the Government to get to grips with these runaway costs.  The Taoiseach might not be able to answer now, but perhaps he can send me answers to the following questions.  How many tribunals, public investigations and commissions of investigation are currently in process?  How long has each of these been underway?  When are they expected to conclude, what costs have they incurred so far and what is the expected cost of each one on its conclusion?</p> <p> I would like to touch on the barrister's expenses listed within this document.  There has been a 14% increase in legal costs.  Is that simply because more cases are being taken, or is the State being far too generous with its money?  The Government has spent &euro;8.4 million on trying to stop Apple paying the &euro;13 billion it owes to Irish citizens.  This expenditure by the Government, coming when the country is on the precipice of an economic tidal wave, is two fingers to many people in the State.  Spending that amount of money trying to stop taxes being paid rather than trying to help citizens with the difficulties they have at the moment shows what are the priorities of the Government.  Rather than fiscal prudence, spending &euro;8.4 million trying to stop Apple paying its taxes is a form of fiscal self-harm. </p> <p> In the few minutes I have left I wish to raise the issue of the unit for a shared island.  Irish self-determination should be a critical objective of this Government.  It is one of the most practical elements of the development of this country's future.  Decisions made close to the people are better decisions because people can affect them and hold the people who make them to account.  People in Ireland, North or South, cannot hold the decision-makers in London, Brussels or Berlin to account.  We need more self-determination on the island of Ireland.  We know in practical terms that a lack of self-determination in the North of Ireland has led to economic ruin.  The North was one of the richest and most productive parts of this country for hundreds of years, but with the lack of attention from London since partition the North has become an economic backwater.  It has suffered radically in the last several years.  Self-determination and Irish unity should be practical objectives of this Government.  There is also a justice to Irish unity, justice that was known to many generations of Fianna F&aacute;il members who were not afraid to say out loud that they supported it.  The Taoiseach spoke about the need to reach out to unionists.  I believe that we have to reach out to unionists, but we should not be afraid to make a strong case for self-determination and Irish unity as well.  Instead we see a wishy-washy shared island unit which has yet to be formed and is apparently to function on fresh air. </p> <p> Interestingly, the Taoiseach talks about the dangers of taking the majoritarian approach to constitutional change.  The Good Friday Agreement is based on a foundation of majoritarian decision-making.  If the Taoiseach does not agree with that, he does not agree with the Good Friday Agreement.  In the minute left, I ask the Taoiseach to reaffirm his commitment to the future of Ireland depending on majoritarian democracy.</p></speech>

I am totally self-confident in where I come from.  The people from whom I sprung fought for Irish Independence, understood it and never gloried in it.  We have long gone beyond this business of trying to ask people if they are for it or against it.  The Good Friday Agreement is about relationships.  It has been for a long time.  It is not about declaring that my will is the best will.  I was involved in the negotiations around the Good Friday Agreement.  I was at the heart of Government when the Good Friday Agreement happened.  It was a tremendous achievement for all involved.  I do not believe in a divisive approach.

The Deputy says we need more control.  That is within our hands.  The minute one exercises control one is interfering.  The minute a Taoiseach of the day says to a tribunal that he or she will cut its resources or undermine it, the charge will come from the other side of the House that the Taoiseach is interfering and undermining an independent tribunal.  I say to everybody in the House that we need to be careful when we instinctively call for inquiry after inquiry after inquiry.  There are difficulties.  The Deputy is correct to note that there are real difficulties with the length of time that this has taken.</p></speech>

I see the cost of running the Department of Taoiseach has gone from &euro;34,337,000 to &euro;54 million.  The Vote for the Central Statistics Office has reached &euro;65.6 million, up from &euro;54 million.  This is a runaway train.  The Department of the Taoiseach has been allocated a massive increase of 57%.  I know the Taoiseach has just entered office and I wish him well.  Some &euro;20 million has been allocated to public communications concerning Covid-19, with &euro;10 million already spent on providing the public with information on the various restrictions as they were implemented.  This is crazy.  We all saw them.  I attended a meeting with the then Taoiseach, as did the current Taoiseach, where we were told it was very serious and sympathies were expressed for everyone who died.  We cannot pay the nurses but we can afford this kind of spin.  This is outrageous money as far as I am concerned.  It is reckless and it should be seen as such.  The communications team recommended providing the public with clear information.  We did not get clear information on some things and we still have not got it.</p>  <p>  For example, I refer to rates.  With great fanfare it was announced that rates on small businesses would be parked or put to one side.  These businesses were forced to shut down by the actions of the Government.  That was necessary and we supported it.  The measure was called a "rates holiday".  Now the county councils are sending out the July moieties, having sent moieties out for June.  The councils have not received a shilling from the relevant Department, nor have they received any clear guidance on how to deal with this.  Businesses that are still closed are getting huge demands for the next moiety of rates.  They do not have any information about the break they were supposed to get.  Those rates must be paid as well.  The councils do not have a cent, but there is plenty to pay the spin masters. </p>  <p>  I refer to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  When the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, God rest him, set up NAMA I said in this House that it was like releasing a wild animal in the woods.  No-one knew where it would end up.  A decade later it is still out there and it cannot be reined in.  What is going on?</p> <p>We do not know the costs involved and there will be another extension in September.  It is like a wild animal.  At least the rangers can get the deer, but we cannot get anybody to take control of this vehicle.  There will be demands and statements about NAMA and inquiries into it, as sure as the Taoiseach is sitting in that cathaoir.  Will he answer those questions?  The runaway train of waste is not acceptable and I would love to know what the Taoiseach is going to do about it during his term in office.</p></speech>

That has to be accepted because in a pandemic, particularly a global pandemic of an unprecedented kind, comprehensive communications are vital at every step along the way.  That was done and I think it worked.  It needs to continue as long as we have the pandemic with us and as long as we have a need to communicate comprehensively with the public.</p></speech>

Once a chairman is appointed, an inquiry is independent of the Taoiseach's office in terms of the conduct of its work, but it is open to the Oireachtas or the Government, at any time, to put forward proposals to terminate that inquiry or give it a final deadline.  The reluctance to do that historically has always been because people would then accuse the Government of trying to undermine or interfere with the inquiry.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to urge that a closer scrutiny be made of how moneys are spent in various Departments to ensure they are not wasted, as we have seen happen with projects such as the children's hospital.  That is one of many instances where massive amounts of money have been paid out.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;58 million has been allocated to the Department of Health to support greater access to services for patients, particularly during the very challenging winter period.  The Minister said this funding will be used to open additional hospital beds and provide transitional and residential nursing home scheme spaces.  There is no doubt as to the importance of this additional funding, as long as it is spent in the parts of our health system that urgently need funding.  One facility where spending is needed is Bantry General Hospital, and I hope the Taoiseach may be able to tell me if funding has been allocated to it.  In 2008, the then Minister came to Bantry will all the usual glorious trappings to announce an endoscopy unit for the hospital.  To date, nothing has been delivered.  The most important money that could be spent for the benefit of the more than 80,000 people in west Cork who use the hospital is for the hiring of a full-time anaesthetist.  We were told over and over again by the previous Minister for Health that services at the hospital would not be reduced.  However, for those services to be retained, we need a full-time anaesthetist to be hired immediately.  The programme for Government refers to a large number of hospitals where investment and improvements are to be made but there is nothing in it about Bantry General Hospital.  This leaves me and many other people with serious questions to ask.  Will the Taoiseach tell me today that funding for an anaesthetist for the hospital is included in that funding?</p>  <p>  I have a question concerning the statutory instrument that was signed by the then Minister in 2016 putting off until 2021 the bringing of our community hospitals up to standard.  In recent weeks, I have noticed at meetings of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that there seems now to be an acceptance that these hospitals will not meet the new deadline that was pushed out in 2016.  Will the works promised for community hospitals such as Clonakilty be delivered or will they, once again, be put on the long finger?  Announcements of funding always sound good but the question will always be about where that funding goes.</p>  <p>  I am concerned as to whether the hard-working taxpayers are getting value for money in all of this.  Coronavirus testing is an area where significant savings can be made.  The previous Government used the new PC-12 aircraft to take swabs to laboratories in Germany.  When I asked the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, how much it was costing to get a test result, he said it was &euro;200.  We have since found out that the tests can be done for less than &euro;50 in west Cork and elsewhere in Ireland.  Why are we wasting such huge amounts of the health budget flying test samples abroad when, with a little investment in Irish laboratories, we could have same-day results for a fraction of the cost?</p>  <p>  There are many more issues I would like to raise but there is only a minute remaining for the Taoiseach to respond.</p></speech>

However, I am well aware of Bantry General Hospital and, as Minister for Health, I was very supportive of it.  It performs a critical role for a wide rural hinterland.  In regard to the appointment of an anaesthetist, the issue is not funding, as the Deputy knows.  The HSE is saying that it is facing a challenge in recruiting somebody to locate permanently to the hospital, but it is committed to getting a resolution to the issue.  It is also looking at what additional services can be provided at Bantry General Hospital as part of the wider South/South West hospital group.  I will be keeping a close eye on that and working with the HSE on it.  Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and Cairns, among others, have also been in touch with me to convey their concerns in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700027#CC00800"><p>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate the Taoiseach on his appointment.  I wish him and his Government well because good government is good for the people.</p>  <p>  We are debating the Revised Estimates today.  When we vote on them, as Members of this House and representatives of the people, we will be deciding how our constituents' tax moneys are spent.  We know these moneys are required because of the Covid-19 crisis and because we want to be better prepared for Brexit, which certainly is something we need to do.  However, the question many people watching this discussion today will be asking is whether these Revised Estimates represent value for money and if they will contribute in a positive and tangible way to improving services and protecting our economy.  I am somewhat new to this House but in the previous parliament in which I had the privilege to serve, the European Court of Auditors would assess the spending set out in our budget.  The Comptroller and Auditor General performs that function in respect of the Oireachtas.  My first question is whether the Comptroller and Auditor General will review these Revised Estimates in three months, six months or whenever.  Is there an automatic review process or does it only happen in certain circumstances?  I am thinking of the ordinary people watching this debate on the television, seeing that we men and women in Leinster House are deciding how to spend their money and wondering whether they will get value for it.  The Taoiseach has made some good points in this regard but my question is specifically about whether the Comptroller and Auditor General will review these particular Estimates and come back to the Oireachtas with that review.  Is such a review process automatic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700027#CC00900"><p>The Deputy has asked a good question.  It is, of course, within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to review these Estimates.  We have no difficulty with that and we would welcome it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reviews all Government expenditure, both by Departments and by Government agencies.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach, there are different Votes, including for the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Central Statistics Office and the Office of the President.  It is a smaller Department in terms of overall public expenditure and I think it is fair to say there is good value in terms of how it spends its money.  This has been an exceptional year because of the Covid-19 crisis.  As I said, evaluating the cost of the communications response and so on is something that will happen in the course of time.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to join others in paying tribute to Dr. Tony Holohan and his work.  He has stepped back now and I know that the good wishes of the entire country go with him.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach talked about the co-ordinated response from his office.  People want to hear that because it gives them confidence.  He also spoke about public awareness campaigns around Covid-19.  I would reiterate the importance of making sure we have a proper regional spread when it comes to giving out that message by using local newspapers and radio stations.  That will be some help in supporting local media but, more importantly, it will ensure that good public information reaches all parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Several Deputies raised the issue of the wearing of masks.  It is my fourth time to raise it and, in doing so, I am not being critical for the sake of it.</p> <p>The messaging in respect of masks has not been clear.  I know many people who are more than willing to follow the guidance they are given, but many of them consider that there is no clarity regarding the wearing of masks.  We run the risk of letting the perfect become the enemy of the good.  It is not perfect if I wear a mask, but it makes a difference.  The message on this issue has been sent clearly and concisely to people.  Further effort is needed, however.</p> <p> The Taoiseach referred to an investment-led jobs and recovery initiative.  I addressed the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, a few times on this issue and I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise it with the current Taoiseach.  I acknowledge that the July stimulus is yet to come.  I refer to the idea that we attempt to rebalance grant aid and loans for businesses and SMEs.  The restart grant of &euro;3,000 is quite small when compared with the grants available in the UK, Germany and several other countries.  The average grant in the UK is approximately &pound;10,000, while in Germany a company employing up to ten people can avail of a grant up to a maximum of &euro;15,000.  We need to consider the level of grant aid that is available.  Of course, the grants are connected to the rates paid by the business last year.  The average grant is approximately &euro;3,000, with a maximum of &euro;10,000.  However, many businesses do not pay rates.  Before she left office, the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and current Senator, Regina Doherty, announced a new scheme of &euro;1,000 for such businesses.  It is a very small scheme.  Many of the businesses have incurred significant costs.</p> <p> I wish to raise the specific issue of community and voluntary groups which run their local community centre as a business.  The centre may offer language or Irish dancing classes or other activities to bring in a bit of revenue to keep the place open.  Unless such groups were specifically involved in Covid-related activities, for which the former Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, allocated funding, they are not getting any money.  I have sought clarity on whether the grant of &euro;1,000 will be available to these groups, but I have not found it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will enlighten me.  If he cannot, I wish to make the point that these groups need support.   They do not need not huge sums of money, but they have a level of debt that they wish to clear before opening their doors.  I ask him to keep that in mind.</p></speech>

The CSO collects data about our people and society.  Those data are essential to informed decision-making in many industries, such as construction, healthcare and finance. as well as for European governing bodies.  The data provide essential information on employment and unemployment, providing accurate quarterly labour force estimates and information on household income and expenditure.  The nationwide shutdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the suspension of face-to-face surveys by the CSO and that has made its job very difficult.  It now relies entirely on the goodwill of the public in the context of replies to written requests for information.  Those replies will be crucial in recalling the effects of the pandemic on society and the economy as well as informing decision-making and policy to guide our recovery.  The CSO also commissions the census, an important routine data collection service which involves a form being issued to every household.  In light of the importance of these essential services, will the Government increase the amount of funding available for the advertising of these services?  Doing so would inform the public on the important work of the CSO and educate us all regarding why the services it provides are imperative to the formation of public policy that affects our everyday lives.</p></speech>

Its agenda for the coming year includes a census on agriculture and a population census.  I will examine the Deputy's proposal that, if I understand it correctly, the Government should consider increasing the level of funding available to the CSO in respect of advertising its role, sending its message to the public and getting the public to respond.  I will revert to the Deputy on that issue.  It is a good idea.  Resources should be available within the Department to see whether we can do more to help the CSO, particularly in the context of Covid-19 and the limitations it has placed on its work and its capacity to undertake research.</p></speech>

I wish to address insolvency and free legal aid.  On insolvency, Covid-19 has brought about an informed truce between creditors and debtors.  Many of those paying rent or mortgages have been given a temporary reprieve while they unable to work as a result of the current situation.  However, this truce will soon end as income support measures and rent moratoriums are gradually lifted.  Even though the economy was doing well in the lead-up to Covid, many people were still recovering financially from the recession.  More than 26,000 mortgage accounts were in arrears before the pandemic.  That figure is now likely to rise.  This situation needs to be acknowledged and addressed.</p>  <p>  The Government has recognised the clear need for an extension of rent freezes for those who have been economically hit by Covid-19, but there have been legal challenges to extending such freezes for longer than three months.  Similarly, according to the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, several protections have been put in place to assist borrowers, such as the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, but there have been delays in the implementation of the legislation and its benefit has yet to be felt by the public.</p>  <p>  There is much uncertainty among members of the business community.  Given the current climate, many business owners do not know when they will be able to start planning and recovering their livelihoods.  This, in turn, creates the risk that many employers will be forced to make redundant the unprecedented number of staff who have been temporarily laid off.  Although these are uncertain times, this stable Government must mitigate to the greatest extent possible the uncertainty faced by Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the State infrastructure for dealing with over-indebtedness, especially with regard to those who are still recovering from the previous recession.  What will the State do to help prepare for the coming situation?  What action will the Government take to streamline legislation and implement measures that would lessen uncertainty for most renters, those in mortgage arrears and business owners experiencing difficulty?</p></speech>

It will be continued.  The Government has made clear that there will not be a sudden cliff edge for those coming off the subsidy.  Work on the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment is under way n the context of the job stimulus package to be decided upon by the Government and published later this month.</p>  <p>  On the insolvency truce, as the Deputy described it, analysis is being carried out with regard to protections that could be put in place for ordinarily viable businesses that may be in difficulty and vulnerable to exploitation as a result of Covid.</p> <p>That is being looked at.  The ESRI is publishing work and research about the impact of Covid on those with mortgage arrears.  That work will inform subsequent responses from the Minister and the Government about how we can help and protect those in arrears.  Fundamentally, the job stimulus programme will be about trying to protect workers from being laid off and reskilling and retraining.  It is an immediate response and an economic recovery plan has been developed because we have to look at different sectors of the economy.  What sectors can create employment more quickly than others in the context of Covid-19?  In that respect, can the retrofitting initiatives, which will take some time, become an avenue for greater employment?  Do we need programmes in our institutes of technology and education and training board schools of further education to ramp up the number of people who can be trained and then allocated to sectors where employment would be provided as a result of increased State intervention in some programmes?  That is the approach that we will take.</p></speech>

The pandemic has brought about many unprecedented changes to life in Ireland and nobody has been untouched by the efforts to combat the spread of the disease and flatten the curve.  As we settle into our new normal, the need for stability is paramount.  One of the biggest worries for many in the months ahead will be housing.  This was the case prior to Covid but housing has taken on a whole new dimension since.  With the moratorium on evictions, those who have had a stay on their eviction are uncertain of their future status.  Many more are worried that they will be unable to pay rent in the coming months and will be forced into similar situations.  The public needs to know where to turn for legal advice.  Will the Taoiseach speak about the difficulty that many people have faced in seeking civil or legal aid or advice for home repossession cases?  Will he indicate how hangover repossession cases will be dealt with in the aftermath of Covid?  Will more information on timing of these cases or aid be available to the public?</p></speech>

There is currently a moratorium on evictions and a freeze on rents.  As restrictions have been lifted, issues with those will arise.  As I said earlier, the ESRI report will be important in that regard and we need to work with all concerned.  Much work has been done in recent years.  The numbers did not turn out to be as high as people thought.  We have one of the better records in Europe with regard to the number of repossessions.  In my experience, if people engage early with either the banks or Members, we can often intervene to try to create and find resolutions.  When people leave it too late, one ends up with a court case from which it can often be difficult to pull back.  Early engagement with agencies and various non-governmental organisations that have been supportive in this field is critical.  We have to make sure they have the capacity to deal with whatever challenges emerge.</p>  <p>  Deputies raised a number of points.  Regarding the tribunal of inquiry and various Estimates, there is concern about continuing escalating costs.  To be fair to Mr. Justice Cregan's Irish Bank Resolution Corporation inquiry, the inquiry will cost between &euro;11 million and &euro;14 million.  Department officials believe it could go to &euro;30 million.  It is important to point out that once the Oireachtas decides to establish an inquiry, it is then totally independent.  I recall all the leaders in the D&aacute;il looking for this inquiry in 2015 and agreeing on a bespoke Act in 2017 to facilitate the establishment of the IBRC inquiry, yet it is now 2020 and it will go to the end of the year.  It is unclear whether a conclusion will be arrived at by the end of the year.  That means that the Oireachtas must give far greater deliberation to the establishment of inquiries and commissions of investigation in the future.  We have to be clear-minded about it because once we do so, there is no point in complaining later about the costs and how long an inquiry has been going on, or saying somebody should be in control.  The minute any Government Minister or the Taoiseach tries to intervene, there will be an accusation that it is an attempt to undermine the objectivity and independence of the inquiry.</p>  <p>  A point to take away from this Estimate is about the communications spend of &euro;20 million more than was expected at the beginning of the year.  The Government Information Service in the Department has 16 or 17 staff.  They are civil servants who have been extremely busy over the past six months.  They deserve credit for the amount of work they have put in and the logistical operation they have engineered, including all the press conferences they have organised and their co-ordination of communications.  I was going to bring in some posters and such to demonstrate the non-party political nature of the GIS, which would be a concern of some Deputies.  Some Deputies have articulated that about the roadmap and so on, and it is an important point.</p>  <p>  I would like people to give the shared unit a fair shake, irrespective of their particular positions, which they are entitled to.  We want to develop good background work and research on the issue of how we develop a shared island in the future, and to look at it in a considered way with detailed policy, as opposed to all having rhetoric that we like to engage in from time to time.  There is an opportunity to move things on in a consensual way as well as we can.  That depends on others too.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700030#HH00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to bring forward the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020.  This is the first Bill introduced into this House by the new Government.  It is important legislation and forms part of the Government's efforts to help our smaller enterprises meet the enormous challenge presented by Covid-19.  The purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments to the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, as amended, and the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018 to help businesses access additional finance.</p>  <p>  Let me start by explaining why the Bill is necessary.  As we all know, Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on our society and economy.  Lives have been lost and livelihoods ruined.  Our small and medium-sized enterprises have been dealt an enormous blow.  Many have had to close their doors for months with revenues drying up overnight.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of people are out of work and many people have seen their wages or hours reduced.  Therefore, we must act now to avoid mass unemployment and a wave of insolvencies.</p>  <p>  While the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment is falling week-on-week, the scale of the crisis is unprecedented.  Despite the challenges we have faced to date and those that are yet to come, with returning customers comes renewed hope for our small businesses and their staff.  Like so many others, last week I enjoyed the simple pleasure of getting my hair cut and going out for a meal for the first time in four months.  Getting small businesses like hairdressers, barbers, caf&eacute;s, restaurants and gyms back open is not just vital for our economy, it is also important for the emotional well-being of our people.</p>  <p>  Since I took up the role of Minister with responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment ten days ago, my focus has been on preparing the July stimulus package.  As I said on the floor of this House last week, it will be radical of scale and speed.  While no final decisions have been taken and the Cabinet sub-committee will meet for the first time next week, we are looking at a range of possible actions such as an enhanced restart grant to help businesses reopening, lower-cost long-term loans, reductions in some business taxes and extending the wage-subsidy scheme.</p>  <p>  I have previously expressed my concern about the very high level of youth unemployment and the inequality that could emerge as a result between younger people and older people, those working in the public sector and big businesses and those in the private sector and small businesses.  Poverty and deprivation rates have been falling in Ireland for more than five years.  We are one of the few countries in which income inequality has reduced in recent years.  We do not want it to go in reverse.</p>  <p>  The July stimulus package will have a particular focus on sectors which employ large numbers of younger people, such as hospitality, retail, tourism and leisure and perhaps construction as well.  Radical and immediate action is required if we want youth unemployment and unemployment generally to fall.</p>  <p>  I would be happy to hear, as part of this debate, Members' ideas and proposals for the July stimulus package, or for the longer-term national economic plan that will be published alongside budget 2021 in October.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies have worked hard since the arrival of Covid-19 to help businesses and employers overcome the challenge presented by the pandemic.  The impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in particular, has been enormous.  In many ways an economic pandemic followed the health pandemic.  In May 2019, there were 238,000 SMEs in Ireland, employing more than 1.3 million people, out of a total workforce of 2.3 million.  Groups representing the SMEs and microenterprises explained the need for assistance early in the crisis, with a particular focus on liquidity.  This was backed up by research from the Central Bank, which indicated the likely need for some form of external liquidity for firms if they were to reopen once the Covid restrictions were eventually relaxed.  My Department had already begun expanding existing schemes and developing new actions to help SMEs and microenterprises to access that crisis liquidity.</p>  <p>  As part of the initial response, we reprioritised and repurposed existing programmes.  This has included repurposing the Enterprise Ireland online retail, continuity voucher and financial planning grant schemes; the local enterprise offices' business continuity and trading online voucher schemes; InterTradeIreland's e-merge and emergency solution schemes; the credit guarantee scheme; the working loan capital scheme; and the microfinance loan scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department has been focused on coming up with practical solutions to help businesses.  For example, in addition to the existing credit guarantee scheme, a new Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme was developed using the flexibilities allowed by the European Commission.  This allowed for credit guarantee schemes to include small mid-caps and primary producers as well as SMEs, but the temporary framework is due to expire on 31 December 2020, meaning that any loan guarantees, underwriting lending to enterprises from the financial institutions, must be in place by the end of the year in order to qualify.  It is vital, therefore, that it is put in place as soon as possible to help as many businesses as possible in the timeframe available.  Amending legislation is necessary and I look forward to returning to the House to talk about that very soon.</p>  <p>  Today we are here to talk specifically about Microfinance Ireland and expanding its capacity to extend loans for microenterprises - businesses with nine or fewer employees - which cannot access bank finance.  It has a high risk tolerance and provides essential funding to start-ups and other small businesses.  Just under 80% of its loans were made to businesses outside of Dublin.  Therefore, this Bill is also of real importance to rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The nature of Microfinance Ireland lending changed significantly with the onset of the Covid-19 crisis in March.  In response to an urgent need for liquidity in the face of an unprecedented collapse in economic activity, my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced a &euro;20 million Microfinance Ireland fund for affected microenterprises, which would make loans of up to &euro;50,000 available, with reduced interest rates of 4.5% to 5.5% following a six-month interest-free period.  Microfinance Ireland has experienced significant and growing demand since this loan was launched on 13 March 2020.  As of 26 June, 581 loans have been approved amounting to a total of just under &euro;16 million.  I expect this demand will continue to accelerate as our economy reopens.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments to the Microenterprise Loan Fund provide a legislative basis for increased funding for Microfinance Ireland.  This will ensure it can continue to lend to small businesses and help people get back to work.  Given the exceptional circumstances that have ensued from the Covid-19 crisis, it is reasonable to increase the legislative ceilings so Microfinance Ireland can continue to fund very small businesses for as long as may be required.  Given the urgency of this Bill, these increases have been included as amendments in the Bill as presented for publication.</p>  <p>  The amendments to existing sections and the addition of one new section to the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 will make increased funding available to Microfinance Ireland, MFI, so it can continue to provide short-term credit facilities to businesses.  In addition to increasing grant aid to Microfinance Ireland, the amendments will allow it to source efficient and affordable financing through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  The unprecedented nature of the shock caused by Covid-19 makes the need for these changes even more imperative, and even more time-critical.  This is particularly important as our society and economy continue to reopen.  The level of demand for funding from microenterprises has been so large that MFI had to pause its lending from the beginning of last week.  Lending will resume when increased funding can be made available, once this Bill has been enacted.</p>  <p>  The Bill also amends the European Investment Agreement Act 2018 to allow the Department to enter into new arrangements with the European Investment Bank, EIB, group to underpin financing schemes for SMEs and small mid-caps.  The European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018 allows relevant Ministers to enter into agreements with the European Investment Fund, which have a cumulative contribution committed up to a limit of &euro;75 million.  The amendment included in section 8 of this Bill will increase that limit to &euro;500 million.</p>  <p>  We want to be in a position to enter new agreements with the European Investment Fund for the benefit of small, medium and microenterprises.  Increasing the Irish limit is necessary to allow expansion of schemes such as the &euro;500 million future growth loan scheme which will provide for the longer-term lending needs of SMEs such as farmers and fishermen who are exiting emergency liquidity and want to reinvest in their businesses.</p>  <p>  Given the significant demands on the resources of the EIB group, this funding may not be available to Ireland at a later date.  Therefore, it is prudent to put this legislation in place to facilitate negotiations with the EIB group on this &euro;500 million expansion of the future growth loan scheme as quickly as possible.  Amendment of the European Investment Fund Act will enable Ireland to draw down further funding from the EIB.  This would include schemes which facilitate business investment in climate action.  Ireland is committed to the European Green Deal.  As our economy begins to recover, we must take advantage of the opportunities presented by moving to a low-carbon future.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was very active in her efforts to help businesses respond to the pandemic.</p> <p>This included the urgent drafting of the Bill that we are considering today, the publication of which was approved by the outgoing Government on 29 May.</p> <p> I am pleased to take this Bill through the Oireachtas so we can put in place the necessary measures for this vital cohort of the economy.  In the past, SMEs in Ireland have proved themselves to be resilient, and their responses to this crisis have shown businesses are determined to adapt, revive and thrive.  This Bill will help small businesses to bounce back, retain their staff and serve their communities.  I hope that all of us across the House agree on the importance of the SME and microenterprise sector in Ireland and approve this Bill without delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700031#JJ00200"><p>I will be sharing time with Deputies Pa Daly and Pearse Doherty.  I will take this opportunity to wish An T&aacute;naiste all the best and good luck in his new role.</p><p>I welcome the Bill that is before us.  I have spoken to people such as hairdressers, mechanics, tattoo artists and others who run microenterprises in my area.  I know that those people are going to be eagerly watching proceedings here this evening.  They face, and have faced, unprecedented challenges as a result of Covid-19 and the extraordinary public health measures that were undertaken to protect us from the virus.  As a result, microenterprises have experienced losses which threaten their very survival.  Those losses, in conjunction with domestic and European economic contraction, have created a daunting and almost insurmountable challenge for these businesses.  As a result, firms have faced substantial cash flow problems, the resolution of which will determine their capacity to withstand the current crisis and operate successfully as they reopen.  Liquidity supports and access to credit lines are essential in assisting microbusinesses and SMEs in the coming months.</p><p>In the weeks and months since Covid-19 brought society and the economy to a standstill, attempts were made by the caretaker Government to provide liquidity supports and credit lines.  Unfortunately, those supports have proven to be generally inaccessible and ineffective to microenterprises and SMEs.  The supports did not meet their needs.  It is incredibly important that credit and working capital are made available to SMEs but it is equally important that such supports are accessible.  While a significant amount of money has been made available, and more will be available if this Bill is passed, the application of commercial level interest rates to Government loans has made many of the loan schemes unattractive to microenterprises and SMEs.</p><p>I have submitted an amendment to ensure that moneys loaned to microenterprises will be interest free and with zero repayments for the first 12 months of the loan, and that interest rates on such loans be capped at 2%, with interest only being applied to cover the overheads of administering the scheme.  Obviously, there is a provision of limitation on time there as well, which is important.  However, the T&aacute;naiste can change this through secondary legislation and deliver lower interest rates.  The page regarding interest rates for Covid-19 business loans on the Microfinance Ireland website has today been taken down.  I hope that is an indication that the T&aacute;naiste is going to lower those interest rates.</p><p>If we look across the sea to Britain, we can see positive elements of their loan schemes.  There are no repayments for the first 12 months under the British scheme, not six months as is the case in Ireland.  Additionally, the British Government covers interest payable to the lender for the first 12 months, not six months as is the case here.  Interest rates in the UK are set at 2.5% per annum, not the 4.5% to 5.5% that is charged on loans under the Government loan scheme in Ireland.  It is little wonder that data published today show that more than 1 million bounce back loans, worth &pound;30.9 billion, were released to microenterprises and small businesses in Britain.  There is no doubt that aspects of it could be improved but the positive aspects of the British scheme should be replicated for schemes in Ireland.</p><p>Mr. Frank O'Connor, director of funding and debt management at the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, was before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response this morning.  He stated that his belief and that of the NTMA is that borrowing rates for sovereign nations in the eurozone area will remain low for the foreseeable future and that he is comfortable with the outlook over the coming years.  Therefore, I call on the T&aacute;naiste to pass the low interest rates at which we can borrow on to microenterprises and SMEs.</p><p>The eurozone area has had an interest rate of 1% or lower since around 2012, moving towards 0% interest rates and negative interest since around 2014.  Surely, these low interest rates can be passed on to those accessing Government-backed loans through the variety of available schemes.</p><p>Furthermore, microenterprises and SMEs have stated that there are significant issues surrounding banks using the same risk assessment for loans as if the Government was not guaranteeing those loans, thus leaving thousands of SMEs unable to access loans or credit.  These stories have tallied with work carried out by Mr. Sean Pollock in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  The newspaper spoke to several businesses and advisers who shared concerns over the State's Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland scheme.  A litany of problems were listed, including long processing times for applications, an overly complicated process, repayment terms charged by the banks, some companies being rejected and some being told that the scheme was already fully allocated.</p><p>There is no doubt that these issues are a result of the Department that funds the scheme playing no role in the application or decision-making process which is fully delegated to the participating lenders.  As the Unite union outlined in its paper Hope or Austerity, we have a situation where the banks that administer the scheme also make the decisions as to whether to issue loans based on their own criteria for loan issuance and not those of a Department trying to keep microenterprises and SMEs afloat during a global pandemic.  Therefore, there is little wonder that microenterprises and SMEs have accused these schemes of having been designed with the interests of banks in mind and not those of the wider economy and its employment levels.</p><p>There is significant disquiet among microbusinesses and SMEs over the early stages of the response by the State to the challenges that they face.  They feel that their voices are not being heard.  They feel that the Department is not listening to them or responding to their needs.  They want to be able to reopen and restart their businesses.  They want to be able to plan for the future but they need the assistance of the Department to be able to do that.  All the indicators we have and the research from the representative bodies of microbusinesses and SMEs suggest that if the response by the State and Department does not pick up, there will be significant implications for employment levels now and into the short, medium and long term.  This is worrying, given the enormous challenges that lie ahead as the country emerges from the shutdown.</p><p>These and many other issues surrounding the working of different Government schemes have been pointed out by Sinn F&eacute;in, SMEs and their representative groups.  The longer the issues go unaddressed, the more it looks as if it is Government policy to state that it is providing funding for microenterprises and SMEs while making that funding almost impossible to access.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill to expand the Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme.  We will work to ensure that the Bill is passed quickly.  I know that the T&aacute;naiste will tomorrow meet with his colleagues on the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  I reiterate that rectifying the issues with Government schemes that microenterprises and SMEs have outlined, streamlining access to working capital and delivering a fair and sustainable economic recovery for workers and SMEs must be top of the agenda for that Cabinet committee meeting tomorrow.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the issue of youth unemployment.  In the immediate aftermath of the most recent recession, we saw that as people went back to work, youth unemployment remained persistently high.  Very often, what was on offer for young people were jobs at very low rates of pay, on precarious contracts or in the so-called gig economy.  That is a term I cannot abide.  The gig economy sounds like the kind of place one would love to be but it is an awful place to work.  It is awful for people to be in that precarious situation, and as everyone emerges from the shutdown, there will be people with significant debt who have just about managed to maintain themselves.  When we talk about job creation and investment, we must invest in decent jobs that are sustainable and will provide futures for those young people to be able to build, grow and plan for a sustainable future.</p> <p>They cannot do that on week-to-week contracts.  They cannot do that when they are on precarious, hour-to-hour or if-and-when-required contracts.  They need decent contracts and to be able to plan.  As we emerge, this is not just about supporting business but has to be also about supporting decent work that young people can access.  While young people are not the only people going to be impacted by this, we need to be mindful of the lessons from the previous recession and to know that youth unemployment remained stubbornly high.  That cannot happen this time around.  We have to be able to ensure that we can do better than that.  When we talk about investment, it must be investment in decent work, decent jobs and a proper, decent future for these young people.</p></speech>

I support the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Reilly.  Although the Bill is somewhat welcome for the expansion it will bring in the credit available to small enterprises, it remains only a smaller part of the wider picture for businesses in these difficult times.  It has limitations for a number of reasons which have been raised with me by constituents in Kerry over recent weeks and months.  I have heard from people in bed and breakfast establishments, family-run restaurants, hotels, and tourism-related transportation businesses across the county who are desperate for assistance to reopen their businesses.  The concerns centre on three main areas.  First is the fact that what is being offered is in fact a loan that must at some point be paid back.  The Bill may be intended to offer an outlet for those businesses that cannot pass some of the credit risk checks of traditional lenders, but we must acknowledge that businesses are leveraging all available sources of credit and cash.  A loan under the terms of this Act is unlikely to be their first source of debt as a result of the crisis.  In many cases owing to the size of these businesses and the fact that many will be small traders, these are likely to be debts personally guaranteed by the business owners and operators.  Many business owners in Kerry in particular have expressed anxiety and hesitancy about applying for the credit available as a result.</p>  <p>  Second, the requirements to access Covid business supports in many cases have had the effect of excluding the seasonal businesses.  Established areas particularly in south and west Kerry which rely on tourism such as Annascaul, Dingle, Waterville and Killarney are feeling the brunt of the pandemic, with some being forced to remain closed for 2020 because they cannot afford to open.  Others are effectively excluded from the wage subsidy scheme owing to the seasonal nature of their businesses, where workers were to commence work at the exact time or shortly after the restrictions began.  More effective and flexible conditions for these businesses in terms of other supports may help them to avoid having to turn to loans such as the one the Bill provides.</p>  <p>  Third is the uncertainty surrounding the present crisis and its duration.  This year, 2020, is less than half a season for many tourism operators.  Revenue will be down by up to 80% for many I have spoken to, and the outlook, unfortunately, for 2021 is increasingly uncertain.  Although we have seen welcome calls for Irish people to holiday at home this year, Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal for a &euro;200 voucher to be spent on hospitality would do much to assist those wishing so to do.  There will continue to be losses for businesses on the island and particularly in Kerry, the county most negatively affected by the pandemic.  As we know, the total tourism loss to the county will be up to &euro;400 million.  It affects thousands of jobs, particularly for seasonal workers.  Applying for loans from Microfinance Ireland requires a projection of cash flow for the next 12 months, a daunting task for anyone at the present time and doubly so for those in the tourism and hospitality sector.  Accordingly, we must consider the Bill within this context and not shy away from going as far as we can in supporting small businesses.  Merely expanding the amount of credit available, as the existing Bill provides, does not go far enough.  As a result, I will be supporting Deputy O'Reilly's amendment which should be supported by all Members of this House who wish to provide some form of relief to the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700032#KK00300"><p>I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on his appointment and look forward to working with him over the coming period.  His remarks are welcome for the emphasis he has placed on young people.  I am glad the Government is aware of this.  We have only just in recent memory come out of the last economic collapse, which was quite painful and bruising.  Many small business owners will have just begun to look forward to the next period of their lives and their businesses' lives.  They may have extended themselves on the feeling that things were improving economically and now they have been hit with this Covid disaster.  It is much easier to retain a job than to create a new one.</p>  <p>  While we welcome this Bill and note that it is enabling legislation, there are elements to the microfinancing project that could be enhanced and improved.  Comparisons have been made with the bounce back microfinance operation in the UK.  The bounce back scheme makes loans available at 2.5% with no repayment for a year.  The Government pays the first year's interest.  The loans are 100% State guaranteed.  Loans of up to 25% of turnover are available with a term limit of six years and a maximum of &pound;50,000.  In the Republic, Microfinance Ireland offers a six-month interest fee repayment holiday, a term limit of three years and a maximum of &euro;50,000.  The Labour Party's suggestion is that &euro;50,000 is inadequate and could be increased to &euro;100,000.  The interest rate of 4% is considered to be too expensive.  In previous times, when the State was getting financing at somewhere similar to that rate, it could be in some way justified, but finance is available to the State now at a much-reduced rate and it would follow that a much-reduced interest rate should be applicable here.  The term limit of three years is quite short compared with the UK bounce back scheme term of six years.  We would like to give businesses a sense that they have five or seven years or maybe longer ahead of them to recoup and start afresh.</p>  <p>  Before Covid, we had very encouraging employment statistics and the economy appeared to be going in the right direction.  However, the statistics and economic analysis have clouded the reality of being a low-pay economy.  About 23% of Irish workers pre-Covid were in low pay according to OECD statistics.  That is a very large figure, as the T&aacute;naiste can appreciate.  As has been said, about 40% of young people were in insecure work.  Those sectors of low-paid and insecure work were the ones most affected by Covid.  We in the Labour Party feel that we cannot return to that type of economic model which is so dependent on low pay and insecure work.  We want to work with the Government to provide a better and more secure model for workers.</p>  <p>  It is much appreciated that the T&aacute;naiste outlined the youth unemployment element in his address.  We feel that this will at least be a significant part of the July stimulus.  James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland gave a statistic over the weekend that 45% of young people under 30 years are currently in unemployment.  That is a staggering and incredibly worrying figure.  We have all seen the damage the last economic collapse caused.  We have potential now with support from lenders not to make the same entrenched and damaging mistakes that many of us made ten years ago and in the years after that.  We appreciate and support the Bill, but if we look at what is happening in other European states and the UK, there are other models that are probably more generous.  We could make this much more generous.</p>  <p>  I have spoken about the interest rate, term limits and amounts involved.</p> <p>Unemployment is not just an economic cost or a statistic that we try to bring down, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, it is a real human cost to the person's sense of worth to his or her family and to society.  We cannot reduce it to economic terminology.</p> <p> We will support the Bill but we feel it must be more flexible and give voice to the fact that we are in a very precarious economic situation, and that is without mentioning Brexit.  The debate until now has focused on Covid, and justifiably so.  Covid has given rise to a health crisis that has caused economic collapse.  While, Brexit has an influence on identity, security and other matters, including the Good Friday Agreement, it is also an economic threat.  With both of those things, we also have an unemployment crisis.  That is why we feel that Microfinance Ireland requires a greater capacity to lend larger amounts at lower rates over a longer period to those businesses which probably only turned the corner a few years ago in order that they can stand on their own two feet.  I emphasise that we cannot return to the model of low pay and the grinding, humiliating existence that too many of our workers endure.  That 23% of workers are on low pay is a damning statistic.  It is not something over which we can stand or to which we would want to return.  If, as my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly said, so many people are in insecure work, that must also be challenged.  There are many mechanisms we can use to challenge that but it is an economic model to which we do not want to return.  I want something that is better not only for the economy but also for society in general.  The Labour Party will support the Bill and I look forward to the T&aacute;naiste's response to the points which have been raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700033#LL00200"><p>I also wish the T&aacute;naiste well with his new Ministry.  It will be one of the very important offices if we are to stabilise the level of unemployment and grow in a different way that is more sustainable for our environment, the well-being of people employed here and the businesses themselves.</p>  <p>  The small-to-medium business sector is a huge employer.  If we are to avoid high levels of unemployment after the Covid pandemic, it is essential that supports are put in place to retain as large a number of people as possible in employment.  Some sectors have been later to reopen and the lockdown has had a more extreme impact on some areas.  There will have to be a targeted approach with some of the supports put in place.  Some businesses exist on very tight margins.  Taking on debt will be the difference between businesses surviving or not.  Vibrant towns and villages require a small-to-medium sized sector not only to survive but also to thrive.  Digital platforms for the sale of goods and services were rolled out during the crisis and are very welcome but shops, caf&eacute;s and restaurants add to the vibrancy of our towns, as well as collecting and contributing vital taxes to run our public services. Nor is it only the businesses themselves at stake, but also their suppliers when it comes to job protection.</p>  <p>  The nature of the SME sector varies and includes very many employees.  Investment in the sector must be used to ensure that there is a job-rich recovery, and quality employment should be at the heart of the investment package.  Figures published last week show that 80% of income tax is being collected, with some &euro;650 million, or 2%, being warehoused.  Particularly in the case of companies that do not survive, there may be tax revenue that is not paid over, in which case it is essential that those from whom the deductions have been taken do not lose their entitlements.  Better paid workers pay more tax.  Our aim should not only be to recover but to ensure that the recovery can deliver well-paid and secure jobs.</p>  <p>  The additional money being provided through the microfinance fund is welcome.  The interest rate is key for those availing of the fund.  There are two levels, with a zero rate for a period, which may be the difference between people taking on debt or not.  We need to examine how it matches against some of our European counterparts.  What we do now is important in avoiding, as much as possible, the cost of creating new jobs, including training, supporting people on social welfare with the ancillary costs of medical cards, housing assistance payments and other supports.  Young people will be disproportionately impacted.  With the safety valve of emigration absent, they could pay a very high price.  It is important that they are front and centre when it comes to the recovery.  For some firms, including sole traders, taking on more debt is not an option.  They will require support in other ways.  I am thinking of the sound engineer who contacted me.  He had a very viable income built up over many years but losing big events has meant that when he returns to work, it will be very gradual.  I also think of the tour operator who specialised in bands, etc., coming here and who delivered significantly to the local economy.  We want those types of business to return but they will have to be warehoused for a time because they will not be viable.  There is a great variety among those affected.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response heard from representatives of the small-to-medium sector.  They were highly critical of landlords who are seeking the full rent for the entire period of the lockdown.  They were also very critical of utility companies.  It is not all about the State.  Some of the burden must be shared.  It would be awful to see firms borrowing to pay a vulture fund, for instance, which might have no interest in sustaining our economy but only in putting its shareholders front and centre.  How this fund is used will be important.  There is no balance when a utility company can cut off a business.  Pressure must be put on these companies to bring about some level of sharing the burden.</p>  <p>  The recovery must be fair and also reduce the damage to the environment.  I hope that the green new deal will support this.</p>  <p>  I have looked at the profile of the microfinance fund which was introduced in 2012.  It provides for an increase in the ceiling of Exchequer funding to Microfinance Ireland.  That is welcome and the Social Democrats will support that.  The Bill also provides that borrowing can come from other lenders but there may be different interest rates, depending on the source of the money.  Firm with between one and nine employees and a turnover of &euro;2 million per annum constitute 90% of Irish business which employ 400,000 people.  A very large number of people are involved and microenterprises contribute nearly 20% of gross value added in the business economy.</p> <p>Most microenterprises are mature businesses, which probably comes as a surprise, with the average firm operating for 25 years.  Two thirds are family-owned and half of those are home-based.  While we tend to think of the medium-sized sector as being the exporter, it is impressive to note that more than 40% of microenterprises export.  More than 70% of owners wish to keep their businesses at their current size.  While they do not have an ambition to grow larger, they have an obvious desire to survive.</p> <p> Some 47% of microbusinesses in Ireland use external finance from banks and other lenders.  The interest rate differential will be a key issue.  In pre-Covid times, the microenterprise loan fund scheme reported a 44% approval rate in its seven years of operation.  The approval rate will be an issue if people are marginal as regards being approved or not being approved.  This needs to be looked at thoroughly because it could be the difference between some businesses surviving and not surviving.  </p> <p>  Only 55 loans, comprising 2% of all applications, have been approved to young entrepreneurs.  Businesses are often excluded from loans because they do not have a track record.  They may be viable businesses providing employment.  Some 59% of all applications were made directly to Microfinance Ireland.  The approval rate was 38% and the interest rate was 5.5%.  However, the approval rate for those who applied to the local enterprise offices, LEOs, was 41%.  It may well be that the LEOs are better at taking people through the process.  We need to examine the reason for this differential in approval rates, even if it is not huge, because it is important.  Given that the local enterprise offices offer lower interest rates, why would people not apply to them in the first instance?  Some LEOs are better than others.  When someone in a local enterprise office is very good, that LEO can become a reference point for other people as to the kind of support available.  We all want to be in a position to encourage people to go their local enterprise office and advise them where to go because this is the kind of issue that is raised with all Deputies from time to time.</p> <p> The 5.7% interest rate for non-financial corporation loans of less than &euro;250,000 compares with an EU average interest rate of 2.5%.  If we are to compete and survive, we must accept that a level of investment is needed.  If we can borrow for less, we should not be imposing higher interest rates on businesses that are struggling.  </p> <p> Demand for financing was most common among small firms and lowest among microfirms, which may not be able to sustain additional borrowings.  Some 48% of microfirms made credit applications for the purpose of working capital.  This would be of great importance for liquidity.  These may well be very good businesses that could sustain themselves but need working capital to do so.  Microfirms have experienced high rejection rates for financing.  In September 2018, that rate stood at 22.9%.  We need to look at that profile to understand what might happen.  This contrasted with rejection rates for bank loan applications for small and medium companies, which stood at 15% for small firms and 6.25% for medium firms.  The size of the firm matters with regard to approval rates.  This will need to be looked at given the level of employment in the microenterprise sector.  </p> <p> When we consider the post-Covid environment, a recent Central Bank study estimated that SMEs in the Republic may need up to &euro;5.7 billion in emergency liquidity to help them through the Covid crisis.  I do not know where that money will come from but it seems like an enormous challenge, which will certainly not be met through this fund alone.  In a risk averse lending environment, credit is restricted for all businesses but SMEs are most affected.  Sometimes this is about having a cohort of people in a company who have expertise in applying for funding and putting proposals together.</p> <p> The economic epicentre of the pandemic has been SMEs, with 85% of businesses in the sector having closed to some degree and 34% having shut completely during the lockdown.  Companies could not have factored in the coronavirus because it came out of the blue.  As such, they could not have prepared to any degree.  </p> <p> Interest rates will be a significant issue.  Given that we can borrow very cheaply at the moment, we have to match that borrowing against the cost we would have to sustain supporting people on social welfare.  I reiterate that we need job-rich growth but these must be quality jobs.  This must be a central principle guiding the various supports that will be given to the business sector because there are many layers to this, including employees and also suppliers.</p></speech>

I will focus on a few specific groups.  The pandemic and the lockdown affected huge numbers of people in terms of their income, employment and livelihoods but particular groups have been hard hit and are likely to be hard hit for the foreseeable future as long as Covid-19 remains with us.  As well as big, broad measures and schemes, such as the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 before us, we need to be specific in looking at sectors that are particularly hard hit and which are not specifically captured by big, broad policy moves.  </p>  <p>  It is even more important to make that point on the day that is in it because I have been receiving calls from individuals in two of these sectors all day.  I raised repeatedly with the Minister in his previous Government role - he is still in government but it has been in slightly different form since the establishment of the new Government - the position of taxi drivers and people in the arts, light entertainment, music and the gig economy.  Today, many of them found that their pandemic unemployment payment had been cut from &euro;350 to the &euro;203 rate.  This was due to a failure to recognise the specifics of their particular situation.  I warned the Government that this was coming.  People whose incomes, livelihood and future have been devastated for the foreseeable future as a result of the Covid pandemic are being kicked while they are down.  There is no other way to describe it.  They were kicked this morning when they received letters informing them that their pandemic unemployment payments were being cut.  More of this is likely to happen next week when people who do not jump through a number of other hoops will also have their payment cut.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I will be more specific in this regard.  Taxi drivers whose income was deemed to be less than &euro;200 face a cut in their payment.  This will affect a huge cohort of taxi drivers, in part because the income is based on the figures for 2018, which is a random selection in its itself, but also because taxi drivers have very significant outgoings that reduce their income, which outgoings continued during Covid when their income disappeared and against a background where if they do return to work - there is pressure on them to do because their payment is being cut and some of them might not want to do because they are still concerned about the health situation - they will be returning to an employment where their income is not likely to cover to anything even close to pre-Covid levels for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

Taxi drivers cannot return to work because there is little demand for taxis and also to do so they would need to install screens and the National Transport Authority, NTA, has not clarified what type of screen would pass muster in terms of insurance and so on.  There has been no clear direction on this issue.  Even though they have not been working throughout the pandemic, taxi drivers still face continued costs such as car loan repayments, maintenance charges and insurance costs.  If they return to work, which they are under pressure to do because their payments are being cut, they will find that their income is insufficient to cover those costs.  They will not be able to pay their insurance costs.  Those taxi drivers who are lucky will be paying &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 for insurance.  Those who are not so lucky will be paying &euro;4,000, &euro;5,000 or, in some cases, up to &euro;10,000 for insurance.  A taxi driver might also have to pay &euro;600 per month on car loan repayments and maintenance costs of approximately &euro;2,000 per annum and a taxi driver who returns to work will for the foreseeable future be paying about &euro;7,000 per annum in fuel costs while driving the streets looking for customers but not able to find any.</p></speech>

That is the point I am making.  I am appealing to the Government to do that and, in the mean time, I am appealing to the Government not to cut their payments but to maintain those payments as income subsidies.  Taxi drivers do not want to remain unemployed.  They do not particularly want an unemployment payment.  They want to be able to work but there has to be a recognition on the part of the Government that for them, particularly those who are worst hit - this is true of other microenterprises - there is no likelihood of a full recovery any time soon.  We need to maintain income subsidies to them and also allow them to earn on top of that until they reach the point where they stand on their own two feet because there is a genuine recovery.  That is the point I am making.</p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned sound engineers.  People in the arts, live entertainment and music industry also will not benefit from this Bill as they will not be able to access these loans.  They would not pass muster or even be considered for many of these schemes even though they are freelancers or lone traders.  For the benefit of the Minister I will elaborate further.  Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic a person who played music in the pubs and clubs in Temple Bar would have been paid &euro;130 for two hours work.  A person lucky enough to get a gig in Temple Bar now would be offered &euro;30 for two hours work.  This is not viable.  People in this sector have also had their payments cut.  What are they to do now?  How do we help them?</p>  <p>  People involved in organising live music events and so on and who, like taxi drivers, have ongoing costs in terms of insurance, equipment storage and repayments on loans for equipment they purchased, also have no income.  Even if there is some recovery, and there is no likelihood that any time in the near future there will be a significant recovery, those costs continue for them.  Many of the supports that are being designed are not available to them, but many of them are having their payments cut.  Those are two particular groups I wanted to speak up for.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the Bill, yesterday I had a conversation with a person who owns a business that is the definition of a business that is supposed to be covered by this Bill.  The company makes sofas and it has eight employees, which is just below the threshold of nine required.  This business is being told that it does not meet the eligibility criteria to access these loans and it is also concerned about taking on extra debt in terms of interest and so on.  We need a scheme which works with microenterprises, taking account of the particular difficulties they are facing and tailoring the supports in that direction rather than rigid criteria, excessive interest rates and a debt burden that will result in the supports not being sustainable for those particular businesses.</p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700036#OO00200"><p>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; chun mo chomhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il don Taoiseach, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe anois is trua.</p>  <p>  An economic tidal wave is starting to hit the State.  There is likely to be a budget deficit of approximately &euro;30 billion this year and a continuing deficit over the coming years.  Tens of thousands of individual businesses are in significant danger of closing.  Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost over the next few years.  We have an opportunity to prevent that happening.  Currently in the State, foreign direct investment, FDI, is the glamorous domain of State enterprise policy.  Unfortunately, SMEs throughout the country have in recent decades, from Fianna F&aacute;il's and Fine Gael's perspective, been the poor relative in enterprise terms but they should not be.  The SME sector is the bedrock and backbone of Irish enterprises.  It is where most jobs are located and most taxes paid, yet it does not receive any of the same focus or help that the FDI sector does.  The FDI sector is very welcome but it cannot be the primary objective of the Government.</p>  <p>  SMEs are at the sharp end of this crisis, and most at risk in this crisis are the businesses that have been shuttered the longest.  I refer to hands-on businesses, such as hospitality businesses, hairdressers' businesses, dentists' clinics and so on.  Such businesses need direct liquidity support now - plain and simple.  If direct liquidity support is not provided now, a chain of debt will simply crystallise.  If a business needs &euro;70,000 today, it needs that &euro;70,000 because it owes it to another business.  There will be a debt domino effect unless these companies and small businesses receive funding now.  The average small business, according to current estimates, owes &euro;75,000 in trade credit.  Microfinance Ireland will not solve this debt and most businesses will not be able to trade out of that debt any time soon.</p>  <p>  From what I have heard, I understand that credit lines to businesses from suppliers are starting to dry up.  Suppliers are saying that rather than have a 30, 60 or 90-day credit line, they want cash on delivery.  That means that businesses need that money now.  The Government needs to do far more than the Bill provides for, and we need to go back to the idea of examining all the tools we have for getting cash into businesses.  Our constituency offices throughout the country have been inundated with appeals from small businesses that are having problems with the Covid-19 working capital lending that the State has provided.  These businesses have applied for that working capital scheme but many of them have been refused, albeit in some cases because of long processing times.</p>  <p>  I have called the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Central Bank to discuss the matter.  One reason that money is not being lent on that provision is that the Central Bank is still using normal SME regulations to determine how banks can lend.  If banks are being told they can lend only on the basis of pre-Covid SME regulations, that is akin to a doctor saying a patient can have the medicine only if he or she is healthy.  What we need is to change those regulations to reflect the fact that we live in completely different circumstances where businesses are not able to show the same balance sheets or the same level of working capital that they were previously.  It is absolutely bonkers.</p>  <p>  Months after that scheme was announced, only &euro;70 million of the fund, or about 15%, has been lent.  Having spoken to those in the industry and even those in the banks, I know that that money will stay in the banks until the Central Bank SME regulation is changed to take consideration of the new reality.  These loans, like the Microfinance Ireland loans, are too dear.  There is a significant differential between the lending rates in Ireland and the rest of the EU.  The issue has raised its head politically a number of times with regard to mortgage rates but it is also the case for small businesses.  That banks are making a profit from emergency lending to be given due to Covid simply does not make sense at this stage, especially given that they are Government-guaranteed loans.  The State is guaranteeing these loans for 85% of their worth, as far as I understand, and yet the banks are making a profit as a result of that.</p>  <p>  I would like to see in the Bill a focus on the Central Bank and its regulations, but I also believe that the Government needs to talk about grant funding.  It needs to find a process by which significant grants can be given to businesses so they can function.  In the US, there are soft loans, whereby loans are given out and, if the business maintains its payroll for a couple of years, the loan disappears.  It simply turns into a grant if the business fulfils its responsibility.  The Netherlands and Germany, the so-called fiscal hawks of the EU, are pumping money into businesses to keep them afloat because they know there is a debt chain and that once debt is crystallised somewhere in that chain, it has a domino effect on the rest of the economy.  The failure to provide grant funding will have a significant effect, not just on jobs and the closure of businesses but also on end-of-year VAT returns, income tax returns and PRSI returns.</p>  <p>  While the Bill should address the differential between Irish and European rates, it should also be a little more ambitious and examine the whole credit system for the SME sector.  A predecessor to the T&aacute;naiste's Ministry, Michael Noonan, created a two-pillar banking system.  Anyone who has studied leaving certificate economics will know that is a duopoly, where two large firms control virtually all aspects of the market, from where business is done to the terms and the cost of the credit.  If the Government really wanted to allow for a better stream of credit into SMEs, it should have done what I would have thought was the Fine Gael instinct, namely, to create a functioning market with real competition.  As for how that can be done, it would involve starting to free up the credit union system, which has access to significant chunks of money and to which the State has for years paid platitudes, saying that while it is a great organisation, the State does not really trust it when it comes to lending to the business sector.</p>  <p>  The Government could also have taken a leaf out of Germany's book in respect of public banking.  With the Sparkasse system, smaller banks, which are not systemically important if one of them does not survive, pour money back into their local enterprise system.  I can never understand why such a successful banking and credit model as exists in Germany is such an anathema to Fine Gael's economic policy and why it does not allow that at least to become a component in getting credit into the system.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned online vouchers.  Ireland is one of the highest online spending nations on the planet.  Much more money has migrated online in just the past few months than ever existed before.  Much of that money leaves and is lost to the country.  The T&aacute;naiste needs to be far more aggressive and ambitious about getting SMEs online, either in a marketing or e-commerce fashion.  Whole towns and villages should be online so that when a person wants to buy a book, he or she does not go to Amazon but rather to a small to medium-sized bookseller in the local town.</p></speech>

The life-support employment packages announced by the Government in response to Covid-19 have cushioned circumstances for many employees and employers but these supports will have to have an expiry date, as we know.</p> <p> The overarching requirements in managing this disease outbreak in Ireland are getting disease transmission under control and adjusting future activity to the new norms of adherence to hand hygiene and social distancing infection controls.  With the easing of restrictions, some positive developments have been seen, with enterprises beginning to open since May and a small number reporting an increase in turnover.  For many businesses, specifically those in the areas of tourism, hospitality and the arts, a different reality awaits, however.  Along with the new and required capacity constraints in the business offering, demand for the products of many businesses, particularly in tourism and hospitality, has fallen off a cliff edge.  Many businesses in this sector depend on the flow of international travellers.  Without their return, some businesses may never recover.  In addition, the regions will be more adversely affected by the economic shock of Covid in light of the interdependency of many businesses within the regional economic network and the lack of a significant internal economy.</p> <p> The Bill, the purpose of which is to expand the availability and supply of microfinance loans to the SME sector in particular, is welcome.  In essence, the July stimulus package will signal whether the Government has fully understood the challenges faced by over 1 million workers in the State and the companies that employ them.</p> <p> As a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I have sat through several sessions dealing with the Government's response to the challenges facing the SME sector.  The overwhelming takeaway for me was the lack of access for SME group representatives to senior Department of Finance officials over a sustained period.  The message to the representatives seems to be that big government in Ireland has no interest in small business.  This was fully captured in the comments of the senior departmental officials to an SME representative head, who at their meeting described those in the SME sector as only being interested in fiddling their taxes.  Likewise, stakeholders representing the tourism and hospitality industry told us at a meeting of the Covid committee that they received ready access to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation but none to the Department of Finance.  Is it the case that senior highly-paid civil servants, some earning many multiples of an average SME employee wage, are unaware of who actually creates the profits and taxes that fund their gold-plated remuneration packages?</p> <p> I question why SME groupings that represent the vast majority of small business owners have no direct seat at the Government's labour employer economic forum, despite resulting employee agreements being legislated for in respect of their businesses.  Regional regeneration aspirations flagged in the programme for Government cannot come to fruition without the direct and sustained support of the SME sector.  The sector, employing over 1 million people, will ultimately carry the heaviest load for any shortfalls we see in economic recovery after Covid-19.  A vaccine may come to our economic rescue but, in the interim, we must deal with the present.  The aspirations to apply liquidity to the business sector with devices such as expanding microfinance enterprise follow conventional economic planning but the range and rate of stimuli required have not yet been realised, according to most commentators.  In addition, negative cost factors that were well flagged before Covid-19 still feature and still need to be addressed.  I hope to see, as part of the July stimulus initiative, redress in these areas.  Re-employment is the main measure of health and equity in the economy.  Stimulus finance must find its way into and through the business sector as quickly as possible.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste asked for some initiatives.  I offer to him the following proposals for his consideration.  Based on the example of France, immediate Government-backed loan funding could be made available to SMEs based on previous tax paid or previous payroll expenditure.  At the year's end, the receiving company would audit its losses due to Covid-19, and such losses would be offset against the loan finance provided.  For companies still operating at a deficit, continuing support should be provided to allow innovative business initiatives to be explored.  A commitment to employment numbers would be required in that instance.  Forbearance and restructuring, such as an administration lite process, should be allowed so viable restructured companies can continue to trade without having the liability of seeking High Court protections and the unwelcome attention of fire-sale liquidators.</p> <p> Insurance remains a bugbear for every business in this country.  Surely it is now possible to produce a book of quantum that describes a reliable claims environment which can be established and which can offer transparency to both the insurer and insured.  I hope this will be an immediate priority of the Government.</p> <p> The treatment of people by landlords and utility companies must be reviewed.  Some legal mechanism must be provided to ensure fair dealing and a process for managed legal redress or arbitration for those who have suffered in the Covid period.</p> <p> For businesses operating specifically in the tourism, hospitality and arts sectors, VAT modifications must be considered.  A 5% VAT rate until 2021, which would revert to 9% thereafter, should be considered for the sectors.  In addition, the commercial rates waiver must be extended until the end of 2021, and then the waivers must be reintroduced on a tapering scale.</p> <p> Commentary on the July stimulus is increasing but if we surround the July stimulus with red tape, the money will not find its way into local economies to mitigate the worst economic damage of Covid-19.</p> <p> We stand at a crossroads with the Government now, but we have the benefit of hindsight.  Another bailout is required but this time the decision is to bail out the Irish people and the economy.  The issue is not whether we should do it but, rather, how we do it.  The Bill comprises a welcome step along the road but far greater strides will be required to complete the journey before us.  I hope, for the sake of our country, that ongoing financial planning is rooted in equitable treatment for every business sector and region.  A large number of our previously working population are waiting to see whether their sacrifices and political choices will be vindicated.  The answers to their questions lie primarily in the fiscal measures that the Government is considering.</p></speech>

I will allow the T&aacute;naiste a few minutes.  He might be able to respond to some of the questions I ask.  Businesses are in serious trouble all over west Cork and the rest of Ireland.  Representatives of SMEs, to whom I speak every day, ask the same question, that is, how they are going to survive.  The T&aacute;naiste is not a miracle man with all the answers for me tonight but I sincerely hope that he has some.</p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on the tourism sector.  The hotel sector is struggling to hang on.  Many hotels opened their doors recently but others in west Cork, and even some up here in Dublin, have remained closed for a number reasons.  In order for hotels located in rural Ireland to survive a difficult winter, they will have to see changes made in order to ensure that the wage subsidy scheme continues.  It was announced last weekend that the scheme may include seasonal workers.  This would be most welcome.  What are hotels being promised in the context of the July stimulus package?  The T&aacute;naiste should remember that he will get one chance to save hotels in west Cork and throughout the rest of the country.  I ask him them to give them a lifeline.</p>  <p>  Hotels are desperate to find out now, but not in six months when they might be out of business, whether the rate of VAT will be, or can be, lowered to 0%.  At the start of the Covid pandemic, I called for that, and many Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have called for it since.  Am I standing on my own or will this Fianna F&aacute;il Government deliver for the tourism sector?</p>  <p>  The publicans are being given a raw deal.  For many, the compensation package through the council has been worth a couple of thousand euro to date.  What does the T&aacute;naiste have in mind for these honest, hard-working people who provide 50,000 jobs in this country?  The Taoiseach said on Monday that he is considering extending the closure of pubs throughout the country due to the carry-on of some pub owners, mainly in Dublin.  This is totally wrong .  He should not tar everyone with the same brush.  Admittedly, there are a few publicans who believe that they can do anything they want but most genuine publicans throughout west Cork and the rest of the State are honest-to-God employers.  Most of the pubs in question, being family run and without mortgages, say they face ruin and closure if they are not allowed to reopen and if the 2 m social distancing requirement is not reduced to 1 m in a way that is safe for them and their customers.  What has the T&aacute;naiste planned for these businesspeople in order that they can reopen their doors, although they are expecting a downturn in their business?</p>  <p>  The VAT rate pertaining to the sale of alcohol could also be considered.  Publicans are struggling in these times and they need assistance.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to step in and basically save the businesses.  This also applies to caf&eacute; and restaurant owners, whose sector is also struggling in a major way.  They have to take on extra staff but they have fewer customers.</p> <p>Whether it is a caf&eacute; owner in Schull or Castletownbere through to businesses in Innishannon, these people are struggling and need some kind of survival package quickly.  Will the Minister give them any hope tonight?</p> <p> Bus operators are barely hanging in there and are unable to operate in any fair way.  I am thinking about those people who own or have bought their own buses and run routes where Bus &Eacute;ireann does not.  We should remember that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been funded by the Government through this crisis but these operators did not have such funding.  Has the Government looked at the case of these bus operators and what has it planned for them?  The same point applies to taxi and chauffeur operations, as those businesses are hanging by a thread.  What is planned for these businesses?  I know they do not pay rates, but along with many other businesses that do not pay rates, they are severely affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  Many of these businesses are asking the same question as to what the Government has in mind for their sectors.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could lay out his plans for those businesses now.  It seems my questions will not be answered, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I hope he gets down and dirty and understands business.  As Deputy Collins has said, it is not all about the capital city, spin, Facebook and all the other platforms that the T&aacute;naiste likes.  Earlier I criticised the &euro;20 million increase in spending for the Department of the Taoiseach, much of which is going on spin doctors to tell us what we already know.  We are not fools in the country and we understand plain English.  We did not need the former Taoiseach and his quotes from this and that writer or actor to tell us what we should do.  It is patronising and insulting to the people in the country.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 is to increase the maximum amount that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation may grant to Microfinance Ireland and extend the powers of that body, which is very welcome.  It would also increase the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings to Microfinance Ireland and amend the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018 to increase the maximum aggregate liability in respect of contributions committed by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are very important actions.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach asked if we could give him ideas and we in the Rural Independent Group can give him plenty.  We represent rural counties.  I wish the Minister of State well in his new role and thank him for his engagement when he was a Minister of State dealing with housing matters.</p>  <p>  We have seen great success already in Tipperary because of Microfinance Ireland.  Loans are granted for working capital, which is vital to any small business, and start-up businesses in particular.  They are also used for the fit-out of premises and purchasing of equipment, which is a major concern because of the cost of purchasing equipment and the standards that must be adhered to.  Finance can also be used for information and communications technology, and this is one aspect where the T&aacute;naiste knows what he is talking about.  It is what he loves.  Finance can also be used for promoting and marketing, and we could throw that aspect in for him as well as he might be good at it.  It did not bring the benefits he expected in the election.</p>  <p>  I will speak about my own county of Tipperary.  Since 2012, there were 234 applicants to Microfinance Ireland funding, with 105 being successful and accounting for &euro;1.29 million in funding for Tipperary businesses.  Tipperary has the sixth highest number of successful applicants across the country behind Dublin, Cork, the Minister of State's own county of Meath, Galway and Limerick.  I am proud of that and we have good support and business acumen.  We are talking about small and microbusinesses.</p>  <p>  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are Microfinance Ireland's main referral partners.  These LEOs should not be confused with the T&aacute;naiste, who has just left the Chamber.  There is an approval rate of 51% of applicants coming from LEOs, and these offices support applicants with relevant business training both before and after the application stage.  The mentoring and assistance is very important.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the office in Tipperary, including Mr. Anthony Fitzgerald, Ms Ita Horan, Mr. Michael Begley and Ms Mary Ryan, as well as the entire team at the Tipperary local enterprise office for the fantastic work they are doing to support businesses.  This support is essential now more than ever as we face a very difficult period and uncertain future.  Increased supports from Microfinance Ireland are very important and enterprise offices are essential in helping our businesses.  They are standing ready and they are dealing with numerous calls.</p>  <p>  There have been 2,403 loans approved, and of these, 1,304 were for start-up businesses.  We must nurture and support such operations.  N&iacute; neart go chur le ch&eacute;ile.  Is t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre gach l&aacute;.  I support start-ups, which are extremely important, but existing businesses must also have strong supports in recovering during this very difficult period.</p>  <p>  I addressed a point in the earlier debate on the Revised Estimate.  The Taoiseach used the spin machine to indicate there would be a rates holiday, but my county, along with others, are compelled to send out the demand for rates for July onwards.  It should not have been called a holiday but that was the title put on it by the Government.  Not a red cent or shilling has gone to the coffers of Tipperary County Council to offset that initiative.  It is a typical example of spin.</p>  <p>  There is a major problem with standing charges and the Government should tackle it.  There are 102 commissions, reports and bodies to be set up in this programme for Government.  The Government loves these quangos as they are jobs for the boys and girls who can kick the can down the road.  The Government does not deal with the ever-increasing charges forced on people.  In reality, people are being robbed.  Imagine that a hotel in Tipperary pays &euro;30,000 in standing charges now but it is closed, d&uacute;nta, with nothing on except the lights on the reception.  We have regulators for this, that and the other, and as I have said countless times, they are useless, toothless and fruitless.  They have jobs for the boys.  Money is being taken from people with no businesses.  They are being forced to close but they have to pay these, what I call, cowboys.  They provide no services.  People are at the beck and call of utility companies, which can charge what they like.  If people do not pay, they are switched off.</p>  <p>  Insurance has been referred to by previous Deputies and it is a scandal the way insurance companies are blackguarding people.  The former Taoiseach is partly guilty in this respect.  We had meetings in Government Buildings when the crisis arose and I challenged the then Taoiseach on the refusal by insurance companies to pay out or even engage with customers about supports for businesses that closed because of the arrival of this so-called pandemic.  The former Taoiseach said insurance companies are in the business of making money and operate on the basis that they pay out to one customer in ten.  They have had enough good years and are making millions of euro in profit from the Irish people who are sweating blood.  They must be held accountable.</p>  <p>  There is a lack of finance from banks, which are d&uacute;nta.  The doors might be open in some of them but the operations are not working.  I have people ringing from all around the country, and particularly Tipperary, who had loan approvals and mortgages to build houses.  We are talking about kick-starting the housing industry.  These people have incomes.  I know one couple where the mother of two children is a civil servant and her work has been unaffected, thankfully.  The husband is a farmer but the bank will not give the loan to build a house.  That is pure blackguarding and the banks are effectively closed.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shanahan stated earlier that there has been a bailout for banks and it is now time to bail out the people who bailed out the banks.  Their children and grandchildren will be bailing out banks for decades to come.  The local authorities are penniless because of the rates holiday and there is nobody to back them up.  They expected to get money from the Government but they have not got a penny.</p>  <p>  We must also consider the arts sector, including country and Irish music.  This includes people like sound engineers and promoters.</p> <p>All of that suddenly stopped.  They must be supported.  They are one of the sources of entertainment and solace for people who go out to a c&eacute;il&iacute; or country music dance.  I always mention Big Tom, Lord have mercy on him, and I refer to his song, "Four Country Roads".  These people operate on the four country roads.  They have had the rug pulled from under them.  They have huge equipment, insurance and transport costs.  </p> <p> As I said, the man with the van - the salesman on the road - does not pay rates so he is not getting any support.  He cannot even apply for support.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the taxi and hackney drivers.  I refer to the people running the small community private cr&egrave;ches, and all the shopkeepers.  The pubs are being blackguarded because of the distasteful carry-on the other night in Dame Street, here in Dublin.  The vast majority of publicans in Tipperary are respectable.  The previous Government tried to close them down, which the Minister of State, Deputy English, supported.  They want to be allowed to open but now they are to be punished, according to our new Taoiseach, who drives from the country to come to Dublin and should know a bit more about it.  He said he might not allow them open on 20 July because of the behaviour of people in Dublin.  We are suffering in rural Ireland because of Dublin.  We get the crumbs all the time.  We get nothing other than the problems.  When the Government wants to send down people to us that we do not want or introduce legislation, no impact analysis is done of its effect on us.  We do not want that kind of blackguarding.  I can give a guarantee, as can Deputy Michael Collins, that the vast majority of publicans in Tipperary, west Cork and everywhere else run their pubs correctly.</p> <p> I was delighted to see the bar was open here this evening for food.  I thank the staff here for the way they have managed our movement around the building in an orderly and careful fashion.  We do not want to be punished because of what was done by people here in Dublin.  We are seeing the different parties that are here.  We are seeing the people on the Black Lives Matter marches give two fingers to all the health advice.  With this new brand of neoliberalism, they can do what they like and to hell with the rest of us.  "Let croppies lie down" is their attitude now; they are in charge.  They can do what they want.</p> <p> We need to increase the proportion of IDA Ireland supports given to the regions.  We get nothing in Tipperary.  We have had some good foreign direct investment in the past 50 years in terms of Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme, Boston Scientific and Abbott in Clonmel, and we are delighted to have that.  I want to support the regime but we need to deliver more resources to the country because we have seen it in Tipperary.  The county has the fifth highest take-up of Microfinance Ireland funding since 2012.  We are willing to do it.  We want to be unshackled.  The Government should take off the baggage and the red tape.  We need schemes that are operating but we need cashflow right now.  The Government will not deal with the banks.  It failed spectacularly to deal with them in the past nine years because it is in hock to them.  I do not know what it is but it is fazed and intimidated by them.  The banks will not lend and they give two fingers to everybody else.  We also need to get more support into Enterprise Ireland and also to the local employment offices in Tipperary.</p> <p> Big businesses come and go.  The small business owners are the backbone of any village, town or county, from Carrick-on-Suir through Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel, Tipperary, Nenagh, Thurles and up to Moneygall.  They are businesspeople.  They employ three, four or five people.  They endure sleepless nights trying to ensure they have the workforce to meet their needs.  I will conclude to allow the Minister of State time to answer some of the questions asked by Deputy Collins.</p></speech>

That is okay.  Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  I think Deputy Collins was misinformed on that and my office might have been to blame for that.  I am sorry.  One learns something every day.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is from a rural county.  He knows what is needed.  It is not the red tape and the l&aacute;mh m&oacute;r around money and finance.  The banks are closed.  We might as well forget about them.  They will not look after anyone so it is up to the Government in terms of what it can deliver directly.  It should not let the greasy paws of the bankers charge interest for it and for people to be forced to get the money from the banks.  I have bank statements in my hand from today.  There was nothing going on in my bank.  I brought them in by accident and was looking through them earlier.  They have standing charges for this and direct debit charges for that.  The number of charges is scandalous.  How can any ordinary businessman deal with that?  The banks are getting away with this.  Where are the regulators?  What are they doing?  They are not there, and they should not be paid.  We need to deregulate and get rid of many of them.</p>  <p>  Under the programme for Government, 102 new bodies are to be set up, various actions are to be taken, and quangos, citizens' assemblies, review boards - you name it - are to be appointed.  That is the merry-go-round that is crippling this country and, quite frankly, the people of rural Ireland, and the people of Tipperary, are sick and tired of it.  The Minister of State knows that.  He saw that in the election.  They are sick of the red tape, spin and promises.  The saying is "Live horse and you will get grass" but all the horses are nearly gone, and the people who worked the horses are dead.  It is time that reality was brought home to the quangos and senior public servants.  They have their hands on the handlebars of power here.  We should take them off them, with force if necessary, and let the people who want to do so work.  Let the taxi drivers back to work.  We should support them and not stifle them.</p>  <p>  I thank all the businesses for opening.  I thank the Government for allowing the barbers that shut and obeyed the rules to open again.  I have no time for the people who flouted the laws during the lockdown.  They were a minority but they did it.  The black market was thriving but the people who used that are worse.  I have great admiration for the ordinary small business owners.  They want to pick themselves up and get off the ground, but they are facing huge costs.  Bord F&aacute;ilte issued a 22-page document on how the pubs should operate.  Bord F&aacute;ilte is a tourism organisation.  Tourism is very important but why did it get that job?  Was it simply that it came in to be handy?  We want practical support.</p>  <p>  The people of Ireland will be careful and will behave respectably but they want to be treated with respect and given support.  We should let out the publicans, undertakers, butchers, barbers, small bus operators, taxi and hackney owners, small farmers, forge workers and all those people.  They will do their business without the need for over-regulation and overreach.  A one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable.  I am shocked that the Taoiseach made a statement in which he said the reopening of all the pubs might be threatened because of the behaviour of people here in central Dublin where one might pay twice the price for beverages that one would pay in the country, and one would not get half the personal service.  I like to have a beverage in some places in Dublin.  I am knocking that but I am knocking the behaviour, and it appears we have to be punished for it.</p></speech>

On a personal note, for me it shows a real connection between the EU and what goes on here because nearly ten years ago I was one of the rapporteurs in the European Parliament on the microfinance fund when we set it up to help microbusinesses.  It was an Irishwoman, Marie Donnelly, who led for the Commission in those discussions and we managed to pull together a fund that helped us support microbusinesses.  The reason was that we wanted to send a clear message that the EU would help to support small business.  It is very important, therefore, that this fund delivers.</p>  <p>  Everyone in this House will agree that SMEs are the backbone of the economy.  I believe 99% of companies are SMEs but most people might not be aware that 90% of businesses in Ireland are microbusinesses so they employ fewer than ten people.  If we want to see those microbusinesses grow to become medium-sized businesses or larger companies, we have to make sure that they can survive for this length of time.  All around us we see the devastation that is caused by Covid-19 so it is crucial that these microbusinesses can access the liquidity they need and sufficient grant aid.  I will not raise that issue now.  I have raised many times the fact that we need a much better balance between grant aid and loans but today we are talking about microfinance.</p>  <p>  I discussed with the former Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the floor of this House the terms that are in place for the microfinance loans.  I think the interest rate is 4.5% or 5%, and there is a moratorium or a holiday for interest for six months.  I told the Minister about many European countries and used the example of the Netherlands where the interest rate on microfinance is 2%.  I did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation which will not be a million miles out.  I refer to a company borrowing &euro;10,000 over three years, and that is accepting the six-month interest holiday.</p> <p>The difference between repayments owed by a company here and those owed by one in the Netherlands is between &euro;400 and &euro;500.  However, a loan of &euro;20,000 repaid over five years would see a much more significant difference, around &euro;1,500.  That is a rough estimate.  Many micro-businesses may not be able to make that kind of money and thus repay their loans.  In that context I was pleased to see the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment which would introduce a 2% interest rate and a 12 month moratorium on interest.  Perhaps I am not supposed to discuss that now.  I do not know what Stage we are at but I am in the middle of making the point.  I suggest looking at either one of those two initiatives.  The Government should cap the interest rate at 2%, the rate charged in the Netherlands.  If it cannot do that, it should look at the possibility of allowing an interest-free period of 12 months instead of six months.  That would be very welcome news to a lot of companies. </p> <p> Like a lot of Deputies here I am looking forward to seeing what is in the July stimulus.  I am hoping to see big things.  However, this microfinance fund does not respond to the real needs of some of our micro-businesses.  We need lower interest rates or a longer period before interest is paid.  This would make a huge difference to micro-businesses.  It would give them hope.  A lot of business owners are wondering whether to apply for this loan.  The answer will partly depend on whether they can afford to make the repayments.  They are wondering if they will make enough money to cover their costs, pay their staff, meet the costs of pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions, tax etc. and also make the repayments.  A lot of businesses would look on this more favourably if we could lower those repayments by lowering the interest rate, allow a longer period without interest or both.</p> <p> There is another important point.  The Minister obviously wants these loans to be paid back.  If the interest rate was lower, repayments would be easier and companies would be more likely to repay their loans.  I am not suggesting that companies will not repay their loans, but lower rates would make it easier to do so.  I will finish by calling once again for lower interest rates, a longer period of time without interest or both.  Many micro-business owners would thank the Minister for this change because it would make a real difference to their chances of recovery.  They know that when they start trading it will take a significant period of time to get back to where they were.  Their costs are mounting all the time, including utility bills, insurance and so on.  They are borrowing to cover that and they know their businesses will not start back where they left off.  A little bit of hope will go a long way for a lot of people out there who want to start working again and get their companies up and running.  That is why I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700040#SS00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  I do so in the context of 2.46 million cases of Covid-19 in Europe alone as of 2 April.  Businesses are going under on a daily basis.  I support the Bill.  It is a positive Bill, but the amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in has great merit.  The points made previously by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on credit unions and a public banking system must be considered by any Government that considers itself progressive.  By way of background I note that in the last D&aacute;il we utterly failed to convince the Minister of the relevance and importance of a public banking system.</p>  <p>  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its excellent Bills digest.  I have also looked at the Microfinance Ireland report examining the fund over the seven-year period from when it was started in 2012 to 2019.  It is worth looking at.  There have been many good initiatives from the Government to assist businesses.  The failure is in analysing the difficulties in accessing them.  There is a lack of evidence and data on how these initiatives succeed.  Small businesses account for well over 1 million employees.  Most of this funding will go to small employers with fewer than three employees.</p>  <p>  This report is very interesting.  The lack of proper analysis jumps out.  For example, on page 11 the report states that three complaints were received by the business in the fourth quarter of 2019.  That seems very small.  Moreover, the number of complaints received since 2012 is 46.  There are only two lines on this.  The report does not tell us the nature of these complaints, the reason the number is so small or what Microfinance Ireland has learned from them.  That seems crucial to me.</p>  <p>  I refer also to appeals.  There have only been 48 successful appeals out of 297.  Again, we do not know what was learned from those appeals, why such a small number of appeals was lodged or why so few were successful.  I say that in the context of other facts that jump out of the report.  There is a gender issue.  Of those accessing support under this scheme since it was introduced, 74% have been men and 26% have been women.  Regarding the self-employed, I note that people on the back to work enterprise allowance accounted for only 290 applications in seven years.  There is no analysis of what led to that.  Some 346 businesses out of 2,085 failed, a failure rate of one in six.  There is no analysis of why they failed, what the problems were, the total cost to the Exchequer or the loss of employment.  The figures seem to show an extremely high refusal rate.  Some 2,102 were declined.  A certain number of applications were withdrawn and 2,403 were approved.  Almost half were refused.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste made an interesting point, noting that there was a wide geographical spread.  On the face of it that is true.  Only 21% of approved loans were in Dublin and the rest were in other parts the country.  However, the west of Ireland only got an 11% share.  Other trends emerge when one looks at the figures.  Throughout the seven years, only 128 applications from Galway were approved out of 275.  It is worth looking at that trend to see how the scheme can be improved.  Who are we meeting?  What is the target group and are we reaching them?  It seems that we are not.</p>  <p>  The purpose for which the loans are given is also interesting.  For example the arts sector accounts for just 7% of loans.  The breakdown by sector shows that manufacturing accounts for 10% of loans and construction is at 9%.  Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles account for 22% of loans.  However, arts, entertainment and recreation account for just 7%.  Education is at 3%.  There is a huge imbalance in the figures.  I do not have enough information to examine that.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I can only look at the information that is there and it seems to me that it really needs further examination so that we can learn from it.</p> <p> The interest being charged is totally unacceptable.  I know there is a moratorium for a certain period, but rates of 4.5% and 5.5% are simply unacceptable.  It is important to look at the background to what is happening here.  The recent report by the regional assemblies highlighted that the west and the north west will come worst out of the Covid crisis.  Furthermore, of the five cities the report looked at, it found Galway to be the most exposed.  The report states: "Galway city and its suburbs have an exposure rate of 46.1%."  That is higher - not by much, but still higher - than the rate for Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Dublin.  In total, 1,532 businesses in Galway are in sectors that are faring the worst in the Covid crisis.  That is just the cities.  Social Justice Ireland has pointed out that rural areas have an older population, higher rates of part-time employment, lower medium incomes, higher dependency ratios and higher poverty rates than the national average.  There are many more bullet points of information.  An interesting one is that the driver of the rural economy has moved from the primarily agricultural to a more diverse space involving services, manufacturing, tourism and others.  The document goes on to show that incomes for workers in these sectors are much lower than in others.  I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of these facts.  If the evidence is all there and the various organisations are telling us this, then we must tailor the supports we are giving to ensure they are picked up by those businesses that need them and where they will be most effective.</p> <p> Finally, this scheme goes back to 2012.  It seems to me that if we are going to learn anything from Covid, it is that we cannot go backwards.  Urgent and short-term help must be aligned with long-term sustainable goals.  However, it is not coming across in any speech by any member of the Government that there is a recognition that our efforts must be aligned with the reality that we have declared a climate emergency and that it is always the most vulnerable who suffer in a crisis.  If we really are interested in justice and equality, now is the time to achieve it.  We have the money and we are giving it out.  Let us give it out in a way that leads to a better, more sustainable life, rather than giving money for the sake of money.  I am 100% behind rural areas and small industries but the figures speak for themselves that the money is not getting to them and, when it does, there is a high failure rate and we are not learning from it.  I see no evidence that we are aligning our financial assistance to the goal of a sustainable economy.  Instead of growth for growth's sake, we should be aiming for growth for all and a much fairer and more just economy.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Before doing so, I wish the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, success in their new portfolios, which will undoubtedly play a crucial role in Ireland's economic recovery.  It is fortunate that we have such a skilled Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment, both of whom have relevant previous experience in Departments.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste can replicate successes such as The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way as we will require similar ingenuity in the period ahead.  Both of those innovations provided a significant economic boost to the western region, and the Wild Atlantic Way continues to be a strong beating heart for tourism-related enterprises.</p>  <p>  In terms of a regional focus, a new Action Plan for Jobs is something that must be given serious consideration.  Despite the widespread economic uncertainty over the past few months, I am happy to report some good news regarding the advanced technology facility in Castlebar that was initiated by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.  As the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State may be aware, that building has been occupied by Meissner Filtration Products and it went into operation in May.  This was a real success story for IDA Ireland in Mayo which I hope can be repeated in the near future.</p>  <p>  Agencies such as Microfinance Ireland will have an important role to play in our economic stimulus efforts.  I noted the information in its most recent quarterly progress report that more than &euro;1.1 million was lent to Mayo businesses since 2012 via 78 loan approvals.  I was also interested to note that 79% of its loans were issued outside Dublin, which demonstrates the ability of Microfinance Ireland to contribute to balanced regional development.  I am hopeful that this Bill will serve as an additional mechanism for small business owners to access credit, which has been a much-needed resource in recent months.</p>  <p>  I have two suggestions for the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State in respect of the legislation, beyond increasing the funding available to Microfinance Ireland for lending.  The first is that consideration be given to a credit policy that would increase the loan approval rate of 44%.  I am conscious of the need to be cautious with public moneys and to manage risks within any loan portfolio.  However, if every small business throughout Ireland employed one extra person, it would result in significant job creation.  My second suggestion is to build on the channels of loan referral to Microfinance Ireland.  The local enterprise office structure remains the primary referral structure but efforts should be undertaken to increase the applications received via the bank channels and the Irish Local Development Network.  Microfinance Ireland should consider holding roadshows, directly or in partnership with enterprise roadshows undertaken by commercial banks, to highlight the available finance options and potentially increase the number of loan applications.  Some budding entrepreneurs may be unwilling to visit their local enterprise office or engage in formal settings but they may be willing to attend a roadshow or more informal event which could help them to build on their ideas and spark their entrepreneurial flair.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead.</p>  <p>  In many ways, microfinance loans have been transformative for rural Ireland.  Small and medium enterprises provide the backbone of employment opportunities in counties like Clare.  It is true that we have Shannon Airport and one of the largest industrial clusters outside the capital, but the adult population of Clare, made up of people who are all available and willing to work, depends hugely on the county's 8,700 small and medium enterprises.  Most of those businesses employ fewer than ten people but, collectively, they have major firepower, providing approximately 35,000 jobs in the county.  Given their considerable share of the labour market, it is right that these businesses should be supported by the Government as the country tries to get back on its feet and back to normal operations.</p>  <p>  Small and medium enterprises, along with microenterprises, urgently need access to liquidity to ensure they can function, remain solvent and, we hope, emerge in a stronger position at the end of this economic crisis.  While direct grants are always desired, access to loan finance forms an integral part of the solution.  The key factors for business owners are the cost, by way of interest rate, and the term, that is, the length of time in which the loan must be repaid.  In recent weeks, County Clare has seen a marked increase in applications to Microfinance Ireland as businesses seek liquidity to recommence operations.  Some approved applications have enabled companies to keep their head above water and remain solvent.  Others have enabled businesses to repurpose their operations in a new health-restrictive environment.  Many business owners have successfully availed of loans but others, including a self-employed fisherman in the western part of my county whom I spoke with earlier today, have been told the money has run out.  It is of urgent importance that we pass this legislation so that he and many others like him can continue to have access to money for their businesses.  I pay tribute to Padraic McEllwee and his staff in the local enterprise office in County Clare.  They have been an amazing source of support to fledgling businesses and to the business owners who have needed a great deal of advice in recent months.</p>  <p>  I ask the Acting Chairman to indulge me in speaking very briefly on a pressing issue regarding Shannon Airport.  It is hard to raise such issues because of the way business flows in the D&aacute;il.  I just came from the Department of the Taoiseach where the matter was under discussion.  More than 230 people are directly employed at the airport and, as of yesterday, they are hearing talk of lay-offs, career breaks, redundancies and pay cuts.  It is hugely devastating for them.  Shannon is Ireland's second international airport but it is ailing and will need Government support.  We have a task force reporting in about a week's time and we must have an intervention soon.  I hope the Government will step up as far as Shannon Airport is concerned.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on his appointment to his new portfolio.  I wish him and his Cabinet colleagues well on the job ahead.  They will face many challenges that are not new to us; we have experienced them in the recent past.  However, there is a difference.  The current situation was unexpected and without warning.  We had no control over the tsunami that came ashore and washed everything before it.  It remains a serious threat.</p>  <p>  The microenterprise sector is of great importance because it affects every town, village and district in the country.  The Bill offers a great opportunity to take a microscopic look at the way businesses, particularly small businesses, are operating and the challenges they face.  Many small businesses are still recovering from the economic crash and will continue to feel its effects for some time to come.  That is why the emergence of the virus has been particularly unfortunate and untimely.</p>  <p>  Local enterprise offices,are to be complimented on the way they do business.  They are on the ground with those most directly affected by the pandemic and who require the assistance that is likely to be made available to them through this legislation.  The LEOs are in a very good position to be able to assess the effect and efficacy of legislation and the loans that will be provided under it.  It is one thing to look at things from a distance, but the LEOs are in a totally different situation because their staff are well equipped with the knowledge and expertise to make a determination on how the scheme is working, whether it is meeting requirements and any deficiencies it may have.  That is one of the things that will need to be carefully considered.  The Bill may be perfect, but if it is not and snags arise, they must be dealt with as soon as they become obvious, rather than that being postponed until some later stage.</p>  <p>  Nobody knows better than small businesses themselves how things work and what is needed at a particular time.  There has been much debate on the preference for grants over loans.  However, a well targeted loan can be as effective as a grant, so long as it is not too costly or burdensome or subject to excessive penalties and so on.  I hope it will be recognised that we are still suffering the fallout of the economic crash and that some companies, including some small businesses, are still being impacted by the domino effect of that era.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind as this loan fund is progressed.  Its success will be determined by its uptake.  It is to be hoped that it will be taken up completely.  That will be the acid test.  If it is attractive, viable and valuable, those who are working on the ground in the community will access the credit as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the interest rate that will be charged.  It is worth bearing in mind that Covid has affected all of Europe, although some parts have been more severely affected than others.  Not every country has comparable interest rates.  That is a disadvantage about which I have spoken previously in the House, as have many other Deputies.  I am not sure whether it is the answer to this issue, but one thing that is certain is that as a member of the European Union and the eurozone, Ireland is as entitled as any other member state to any concession that can be gleaned.  There are plenty of excuses in the context of why that should not be the case, but the fact is that we are supposed to have a level playing pitch in the Single Market and enjoy the same access as other countries.  We need equal access on these matters and the degree to which we can avail of them.</p>  <p>  At the height of the economic crisis, confidence was lacking across Europe.  A pivotal governor of the European Central Bank was asked for how long the supports would continue.  He famously responded that they would continue for as long as it took.  That is one of the lessons we learned.  We need to take that approach now and ensure that confidence remains strong among the small business sector because any interruption of confidence could have serious and widespread consequences.</p>  <p>  Simplification is important.  Various Deputies referred to the importance of accessibility.  That does not mean that people should borrow on the basis that they do not have to repay the loan.  Everything must be paid back.  We must recognise that nothing comes for free.  A borrower who knows of opportunities of which he or she can avail should have no hesitation in borrowing for that purpose.  The important thing is that the finance is available.  If the scheme is too laborious, difficult or time-consuming, or involves such an amount of administration that the returns do not compensate for the effort made - I know that will not be the case initially, but it may occur in the future - it will be necessary to realise and recognise that we live in rapidly changing times.  In changing times, one must be competitive in an increasingly competitive marketplace.  By that, I mean that it is essential that whatever is available across Europe, and particularly in the eurozone, be made equally accessible to businesses here in a way that is likely to have the maximum positive impact on those businesses.</p>  <p>  When we review the progress of the scheme, as we may have to do, it may be necessary to intervene, monitor its progress and try to ensure that its benefits are made equally available.  Several Deputies made reference to rural Ireland being denied a fair chance.  I hope that is not the case.  I do not believe it is.  Rather, the assistance is equally available, as it should be.  There should be no difference whatsoever in the benefit to companies in different parts of the country.  The scheme is more likely to have a positive impact on the smaller village, town and parish businesses that are dotted all over the country than any other legislation with which the House has dealt in recent times.  </p>  <p>  I wish to mention the part being played by the banks, whether that be positive or negative.  I said some very harsh things about various lending institutions in the past.  I hope I do not have to repeat them.  When one has been a Member of the Oireachtas for a long time, one tends to see things repeat themselves.  One says the same things about the same issues one addressed several years previously.  I hope that is not the case in this instance.  We have an opportunity to make a quick and positive injection at the right time and in the right place.</p>  <p>  We must be conscious that this country recovered fairly quickly from the economic crash.  I am not certain that will be the case in this situation because we do not know for how long this tsunami will go on.  It may still be negatively affecting the economic development of our country in two or three years' time.  As such, we need to realise the difference between the economic and other impacts of the virus and what happened in the crash.</p> <p>We recovered from it relatively quickly.  We need to be mindful that in this particular case, our people have nowhere to go.  There was always a possibility of emigration in the previous era.  That was not a good thing and not one we want to go back to again but it was a possibility.  It is not possible any more and nor will it be because the virus is everywhere.  One only has to look at the United States at present to see the havoc that has been wrought on that country.  It is a big country with powerful resources and the virus continues to ravage it with an obvious impact.  As well as that, it undermines public confidence in the ability of the system to withstand the shock.  People are still thinking of a second wave and what that might do.</p> <p> We all support this fund for the microenterprise sector.  It is timely to say that again.  I do not intend to go on for the full 20 minutes, the Acting Chairman will be glad to know, but I could do so if he wants.</p></speech>

I threw that remark in for a bit of levity, as the former Ceann Comhairle used to say.</p><p>This support can breathe new life into a sector that is suffering badly at present.  It is timely.  In the aftermath of the general election, we did not have a Government formed for quite a long time.  Everybody in the country is glad to see that a Government has been formed at last.  It is crucially important that we retain and maintain the confidence of the people and the business sector.</p><p>The last point I want to make is about how long this should go on.

That puts one at a disadvantage because one cannot see the nuances one would normally expect.  The key is that it should go on for as long as it takes.  That does not refer to the speech but that might be useful some time too.  The point to be made about the fund is its accessibility, workability and cost.  By cost, I mean the costs of the loans to the businesses concerned.  It is no good saying we have to take our handling fee out of it.  We are in the European Union, the same as everybody else, and we are in the middle of the eurozone.  We need to be able to say to our people that we have access for them to a loan system that is very cost-effective.  It is the best there is and that is the way it should be because of the Europe-wide situation.</p>  <p>  One should not pass the occasion without mentioning that all of the problems in society have not surfaced just yet.  Brexit will be with us for a long time.  In the next 12 months, and especially in the next six months, it will emerge in some way that will tell us the extent to which it will be negative.  No matter what we do about it, it will not be positive.  On this occasion, unlike the economic crash, we do not have all the countries in Europe pulling together.  Some countries are gone and some are indulging in a little bit of nationalism.  That is a sad, unfortunate fact, but it is a fact of life.  I ask the Minister and Government to bear in mind that as the months roll by, we need to be able to find out at the earliest possible stage what Brexit will do to the small business sector across the length and breadth of this country, and to try to minimise and provide for it before it happens.  As our friend in the European Central Bank said, we need to do that for as long as it takes.  Nobody will come to our aid if we are docile and go under.  We need to shoulder the burden of this no matter what it takes.  We are part of that Union and will be affected more than any other country in Europe by Brexit.  That will make itself obvious as time goes by.</p>  <p>  I thank the Acting Chairman.  I can see him getting a bit uneasy.  I could go on for another 20 minutes or so but there are only four minutes left.</p></speech>

It is good to hit the ground running.  This is essential legislation, as my colleague has just said.  We have all received many calls from businesses across the country which are in need of a roadmap.  There are roadmaps for health and schools, as we discussed earlier, and now there is a roadmap for business.  This is an ambitious plan and the Bill will hopefully pass within the week.  I urge my colleagues in the House to support this suite of measures.  It is essential that we see it passed through this House and the Upper House.</p>  <p>  The Bill is ambitious and has a broad scope.  It will be welcomed.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the future growth loan scheme are essential tools in recovering Ireland's economic prospects.  This legislation is significant because it will see the expansion of the future growth loan scheme which has proven to be extremely popular among small and medium enterprises.  For example, &euro;11 million in lending was approved from the loan fund at the end of March for almost 400 small businesses across the economy.  That is the first step.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, we are looking at a July stimulus which we hope will be in place by the end of July.  It is essential that it is.  We need to ensure that businesses have certainty.  In a pandemic, as we know, many people feel uncertain about their future.  Sadly, there are people who have lost their jobs.  Businesses want to reopen but cannot do so.  There are challenges there.  There are many other minute issues, some of which date to before Covid and some have arisen because of Covid.  This Bill will go a long way to assisting those businesses and giving them the certainty they require.</p>  <p>  The future growth loan scheme which was launched in 2019 provides loans of up to &euro;3 million with terms of up to ten years to SMEs, including farmers and fishers.  There was a rapid uptake of this &euro;300 million scheme by SMEs with a broad reach across all sectors and regions, including for local family businesses, which is essential.  The Government recently announced &euro;200 million in lending, which was made available through the future growth loan scheme.  This is a proven scheme that has worked.  This Bill will see its expansion and it is essential that that happens.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier about the July stimulus package, we will hear about the many measures contained in it from the Minister and his colleagues.  It is essential, however, that we see a green light for this Bill, which we will hopefully be discussing tomorrow and over the next few days.  I welcome any further clarification the Minister might have but it is essential that we see it passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700043#VV00800"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  If businesses cannot access funds in the traditional way, it says something about our banking system that these companies fail to get accepted by our pillar banks and have to turn elsewhere for funding.  Reading the documentation that we have received, the success rate of these companies and the small number of failures show the importance of having such funds available to companies.</p> <p>They have failed to get money through the traditional sources.  Only 308 companies out of 2,174 that qualified for assistance have failed.  For companies like these, that is an extremely small percentage and it shows that companies with proper help can succeed.  There is not an enormous amount of money involved here, but to get a leg up on the ladder can make a significant difference to these smaller companies.  It just shows what can be done for companies like this.</p> <p> I wish to focus on the interest rate being charged.  We hear that the Government at the moment with the Covid problems is able to access money at 0.2% or 0.3% interest.  However, interest of 4.5% to 5.5% is being charged under this scheme.  That needs to be looked at and improved on.  These companies deserve better than that.  This level of interest in the modern economy is far too high and that needs to be examined.</p> <p> My county, Tipperary, had 220 applicants, 102 of which were accepted, an acceptance rate of only a little over 40%.  We need to look at the parameters of the scheme.  Thankfully, the scheme has only a small percentage of failures, but a very high percentage of unsuccessful applicants.  If we have that level of unsuccessful applicants, the parameters of the scheme need to be looked at.  The ones that sourced the money showed themselves to be successful and to be able to grow and survive.</p> <p> This scheme has a very important part to play.  With a few minor tweaks, it could be even more successful.  The ceiling of help should also be looked at.  There also needs to be more flexibility in interest-free repayments and even a freeze on repayments which is needed by companies.  I know there is some scope for that.  All those parameters could be looked at to make the scheme more flexible.  We are dealing with small companies with a limited turnover.  With help, these companies could play an important part in our economic recovery post Covid.  Access to capital like this was never more important for these smaller companies.</p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is definitely an initiative that has to be fully supported.  As I said, I have concerns about the rate of interest being charged.  With more flexibility on the terms of repayment, if that is needed by these companies, we could reduce the failure rate even further.</p></speech>

While I have co-operated with print and broadcast media inquiries since the issue emerged last Friday, I felt it was necessary and important as a matter of courtesy and respect to offer the Ceann Comhairle and all my peers in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann an explanation.</p>  <p>  On 18 September 2016, I travelled to attend the All-Ireland football final with a friend.  Before the match, I consumed two drinks and following the game, had a light meal before driving home to Offaly.  On the way to drop my friend home, I was stopped by garda&iacute; and asked to participate in a breathalyser test.  I did so and both this test and a subsequent test at the local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.  At the time, I held a learner driving permit because my previous provisional licence had lapsed.  As such, the penalty for my offence was a &euro;200 fine and a three-month driving ban.  I subsequently secured and now hold a full, clean driving licence.</p>  <p>  There has been some speculation about how someone of my age could have been driving on either a learner permit or provisional licence.  The fact is that before the recent and proper reforms of the system, it was not uncommon for people of all ages and levels of experience to drive with either a provisional licence or learner permit.  However, this was bad practice and I clearly should have regularised my position much sooner.</p>  <p>  Discussion surrounding this incident has now extended to include reporting of various parking and speeding fines that I have incurred over the years.  I am conscious that a constant drip feed of new information can be damaging and destabilising and it is for that reason that I conducted a full examination of all records that I could obtain.  The only additional event that I have been able to identify that was not reported this morning was a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago, for which I paid a fine.  While I absolutely respect the right of media outlets to do their jobs, I would genuinely hope that such infractions which I suspect many of us in this House have had to deal with in our lives would not be conflated with the altogether different offence of drink-driving for which I am responsible.</p>  <p>  My decision in September 2016 to drive home after consuming any alcohol was a stupid, stupid mistake.  It never happened before 18 September 2016 and it has never happened since.  It is a mistake for which I am profoundly sorry.  The emergence of this issue into the public domain has put an intense spotlight on me and on the shame, more importantly the shame, of drink-driving.  The criticism that I have attracted for such a serious lack and lapse of judgment is fully deserved.  This grave error and my subsequent humiliation will hopefully serve to highlight the terrible dangers and consequences of drink-driving.</p>  <p>  I have apologised to my family, the Taoiseach, the Government, my constituents and the general public.  Earlier today, I spoke with Susan Gray of Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care, PARC, road safety group and Donna Price of the Irish Road Victims Association, offering them an apology for the impact and hurt that this event has obviously had on many victims.  I also offered to help and assist insofar as I can, or others should, to help rid us of the scourge of drunk driving and the example that I set.</p>  <p>  I now formally, on the record of the House, sincerely apologise to my peers and colleagues.  It is a source of deep regret that my actions have reflected poorly on the work of elected representatives and on my party.  I assure the House that I will invest my full energy and focus on the responsibility I have been given as a Deputy and a Minister.  Today, for example, and I do not think it is wrong that I say so in relation to this deliberation, I have had separate meetings with EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots, ensuring Ireland's agriculture, food and fishery sectors and their interests remain best served in advance of or after an EU-UK trade deal and ensuring the structures provided and foreseen by previous Governments and patriots within it, enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement which maximises the potential economic benefit of an all-island economy and manifested, thankfully, in the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit withdrawal deal.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> This evening I met Coillte and the forestry officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, agreeing short-term measures to overcome a potential crisis in the timber harvesting industry which could gravely and severely affect our capacity to respond as promised to the ongoing housing crisis.  It is the likes of that work and future work of its kind that I would rather be remembered for.  I will continue to represent the people of Laois and Offaly, loyal and faithful people, to the best of my ability.  I will dedicate myself to deliver on the promise that is contained in the programme for Government.  That is a programme for Government that I worked arduously, hard and effectively with others and with new colleagues to finalise and eventually to allow it to be put before this House after five months of hard work.  I commend it to the House and hope it is successful and that this country gets what it deserves in respect of a stable Government.  That is politics for another day.  Today is about informing this House and my peers of my misdemeanour.</p></speech>

A Cheann Comhairle, hundreds of thousands of working people are unable to afford a home.  Too many are paying sky-high rents and others are forced to live at home while saving for a deposit.  Average rents are now &euro;1,400 per month and, in Dublin, &euro;2,000 per month.  Buying a home here in the capital will cost on average &euro;370,000 and in many cases much more.  Even couples with two good jobs are struggling to rent or buy.  Single people and those on modest incomes are completely locked out.  It does not have to be this way.  There are solutions to the affordable housing crisis.  Unfortunately, the people responsible for this crisis are back in charge.  For years, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were in government together.  During that time, not a single affordable home to rent or buy was delivered through any central government scheme.  The former Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Eoghan Murphy, threw money at private developers - a &euro;200 million infrastructure fund, a &euro;300 million serviced sites fund, and a &euro;750 million home building fund, all eagerly supported by Deputies Cowen and Darragh O'Brien.  Despite this, not a single affordable home has been built, bought or let with these funds.  Sure, a few are in the pipeline but they are nowhere close to being affordable.  For example, an apartment in O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin city, whenever the scheme is finished, will set a first-time buyer back an astonishing &euro;360,000.  Not content with this debacle, Fianna F&aacute;il wanted the scheme to include so-called cost rental homes costing &euro;1,600 per month.  Anybody who thinks these prices are affordable is not living in the real world.</p><p>Now we have a new Government, a new programme for Government and a new housing Minister.  I would genuinely like to be able to wish the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, well.  More importantly, the thousands of people in housing need whom I and other Deputies represent do not just want the Minister to succeed, they need him to succeed.  Unfortunately, the programme for Government offers little hope.  It is a reheated version of the failed Rebuilding Ireland policy of Fine Gael.  It is more of the same policy that Fianna F&aacute;il both supported and opposed during confidence and supply.  There are no targets for the delivery of affordable housing and no definitions, prices or capital commitments.  Despite having had four years to come up with a plan, neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor Fine Gael can actually tell people what they will deliver, when they will do so and for how much.  Just like their countermotion presented here tonight, there are lots of vague words but no firm commitments.  I have to say this simply is not good enough.</p><p>Last month, Sinn F&eacute;in published a draft affordable housing circular.  It outlined what we believe a Government serious about affordable housing should do.  It shows how we can deliver affordable homes for &euro;230,000 and less with no hidden equity charge; and how we can deliver affordable rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month.  It provides the kind of detail we should be hearing from the Government on how to finance and deliver an ambitious programme of affordable housing by building mixed income public housing on public land, delivering social, affordable rental and affordable leasehold homes and, crucially, doubling capital expenditure to &euro;2.3 billion annually to deliver 20,000 homes every year and 100,000 social and affordable homes in the lifetime of a Government.  This is in our view the only way to get a grip on our housing crisis.</p><p>If the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is serious about public housing, Sinn F&eacute;in will work with him.  If he is willing to abandon the failed policies of the past four years, including the controversial Land Development Agency, and embrace new ideas, he will have a willing partner in Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, he and his Government will be judged by their record, that is, by the number, cost and quality of the homes they deliver.  The time for empty promises is over.  The time for affordable housing is now.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1476" speakername="Paul Donnelly" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700046#ZZ00400"><p>I commend Deputy &Oacute; Broin and thank him for bringing forward this motion.  The housing crisis has gone on for far too long.  There have been too many promises, too many broken homes, broken lives and broken families.  As a councillor and now as a Deputy for Dublin West, I have come across hundreds of families who have been on social housing lists for more than 12 years.  I am sure the Minister has as well.  It is absolutely shocking and unfortunately it is not getting any better.  I have come across hundreds of families and individuals who are stuck in the rent trap paying unaffordable rents and unable to escape because they cannot afford to save for a mortgage.  Many hundreds of others have moved back into their parents' homes and have saved tens of thousands.  However, they are saying to me that the more they save, the more the cost of housing becomes unaffordable and the more the prices are getting out of their reach.  I had a look on <i>daft.ie</i>this week at current prices for sale and rent in Dublin West.  An average three-bedroom house in Dublin 15 costs &euro;1,800 per month to rent and an average new house costs &euro;400,000.</p><p>The Minister might let me tell him about 25 ha of land in Dublin 15 called Churchfields.  It was proposed that this would become a wonderful new community of over 1,100 houses and apartments, a new park and community youth facilities.  That was way back in January 2018.  To date, about 60 social housing units have been built.  I commend Fingal County Council on the work it has put in to try to deliver this project.  However, there is a serious problem with the substantial delivery because central government, including the previous Government, does not have a funding model.  The land for the 1,100 units is there.  The services are in place and the road infrastructure is about to be put in place in the next months.  We need the Minister to do three things: provide funding to build social housing for people on the housing list, those on the transfer list and people in homelessness; provide funding to build cost rental accommodation that would cost between &euro;700 and &euro;900; and provide funding to provide genuinely affordable houses for &euro;230,000 or less.  We now have a chance to give people a real hope that things are going to change.  I ask the Minister to guarantee that there will not be a single inch of that land sold to a private developer for profit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700046#ZZ00500"><p>I stand across the Chamber from the Government party that gave us austerity and billions lost and owed.  The Minister might need reminding about the smaller figures, those living month to month and week to week, those who on a Thursday night might be checking their coat pockets for the surprise fiver or checking down the side of the sofa for the extra couple of euro because they are desperately saving for a home of their own.  In north Kildare, a modest three-bedroom house costs between &euro;350,000 and &euro;380,000.  One would be very lucky to find a three-bedroom house to rent for anything around &euro;1,500.  It is massive money for a home.</p> <p>I use the word "home" because hubs pertain to travel and shelter is something we use for livestock.  Humans need homes.  Paying &euro;380,000 for a home is too much for too many.  Saving while paying &euro;1,500 rent is impossible.  It is crippling for young people who are trying to save for their first home.  What does it say about how we value our workers and their children when they cannot afford a home of their own?  What does it say about our belief in the right to a home?  Do we believe that only the successful, the well-off, those with a partner and those with access to the bank of mammy and daddy can have a place to call home or do we believe that a home is not a consumer luxury available only to the lucky few but a public right to be believed in, fought for and established for all?  I believe it is such a right because a home is not just a building or something to bequeath in a will.  A home gives us agency and authority in our lives.  It is about stability and putting down roots in ones community.  Above all, an affordable home gives single people, families and people with disabilities privacy, hope and dignity.  With Sinn F&eacute;in, change is coming.  For now, the Government has political power.  I hope it takes on board Sinn F&eacute;in's practical plan.  We must beautiful build public housing that is worthy of our people and their ambitions.</p></speech>

It has been years since there has been any such policy that would work for them.  Having one's own home, a permanent place to live securely, is instrumental in people's lives.  Without it, many things suffer.  Countless life decisions are put off and other things are held up.  There is a lack of security and employment and other issues are affected.  People cannot wait any longer.  Every week, I am contacted by people who cannot afford a mortgage from a bank but do not qualify for social housing or any other scheme.For those people, there are very few solutions or options.  This must be an urgent priority.  It is impossible for many to save for a mortgage while renting in Cork city.  I looked at the <i>daft.ie </i>website this afternoon.  The average rent is &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 but rents are much higher than that for average three-bedroom houses.  N&iacute;l aon pholasai ag na daoine seo.  They cannot afford to pay that kind of rent and save at the same time.</p><p>Now we have a Fianna F&aacute;il housing Minister.  He promises affordable housing at long last but with a programme for Government that has no detail or costing or that even tells us what affordable means.  Every year during the previous Government, Fianna F&aacute;il promised it would extract a housing budget from Fine Gael and each year it failed to do so.  The previous Government failed to deliver a single affordable house under any Government scheme.</p><p>This motion outlines what is plainly necessary.  Affordable cannot be just a label; it must be meaningful.  It cannot mean a home is just marginally cheaper than it would be if it was delivered through the private sector.  It must bring housing within the reach of those who cannot afford it now.  Recent Governments have completely failed to do that and people are beginning to lose hope.  The motion before us shows how this can be done, how we can deliver homes for people who are currently locked out of the housing market through cost rental and cost purchase.  I urge the new Minister to take the opportunities before him alongside significant challenges.  I urge him to take on board the policy in the draft circular, and not oppose it for party political reasons.  He should take on board good constructive proposals from the Opposition and implement them.  People cannot wait any longer for the chance of a permanent home and the security it offers. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700047#AAA00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  The housing crisis is not confined to Dublin.  There is a housing crisis across the country.  In the midlands, including Laois-Offaly, thousands of families are trapped in the rental market often at the mercy of rack-renting landlords.  This is causing huge stress.  Unfortunately for many of these families, their income is just above the very low threshold above which they cannot get on the council housing waiting list.  At the same time, they have no hope of securing a mortgage from a bank.  I know one family where the sole earner is a labourer with the county council and the family cannot get on the council housing list.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals aim to provide a solution for workers and families, the real squeezed middle, who have no access to affordable or cost rental housing.  There has been a lack of ambition or urgency from the conservative coalition over the past four years.  I find that difficult to understand.  In County Laois, rents have increased by 7.3% in the past year to an average of &euro;1,002.  There has been a similar increase in Offaly, at 5.7%, with average rents now standing at &euro;935 a month.  A family of four cannot get on the housing waiting list in either county if their income is more than &euro;528 a week.  A couple cannot get on the housing waiting list if they have an income of more than &euro;504.  They will also be unable to get a loan from a bank or building society, which means they will be trapped forever in private rental accommodation without rent control.  This is totally unfair and unsustainable.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is putting forward solutions for these workers and families.  We want a minimum of 100,000 public homes to be delivered over five years.  We set out a plan for that with social, cost rental and affordable purchase housing.  No family should pay more than 30% of its income on housing.  Housing should be accessible for couples whose income is below &euro;75,000 and single people on an income below &euro;50,000.  We make our proposal in good faith.  It offers an alternative housing model led by the State to deal with the housing and rental crises.  The market model has failed.  The new Government has an opportunity to show whether it is on the side of workers and families or on the side of landlords and developers.  For a long time, this House was told we could not have rent controls.  Now we have rent controls on a temporary basis.  We need them to be applied permanently.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;acknowledges the extensive range of measures included in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, building on the initiatives already undertaken and in progress, which will be brought forward to support individuals and families to access affordable housing and, in particular, notes that:  	&mdash; this Government has confirmed its overarching housing policy principle that everybody should have access to good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life;<br /><br />&mdash; this Government believes that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically, and that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that best use is made of existing stock;<br /><br />&mdash; building on the progress made to date, this Government is also committed to supporting the delivery of homes through the Serviced Site Fund, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Help to Buy scheme;<br /><br />&mdash; under the Serviced Site Fund, local authorities have indicated they will deliver 3,200 new affordable homes across 35 projects already approved;<br /><br />&mdash; consistent with the National Planning Framework and the Building Control Reform agenda, this Government is committed to the delivery of quality homes and a planning<br /><br />system that delivers homes in a strategic manner to meet the demands of a modern society; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Residential Tenancies Board published a report in June 2019, prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which shows that Rent Pressure Zones are having a moderating effect on rent price inflation to the magnitude of 2-3 per cent per annum; and further notes the Government&rsquo;s intention to:  	&mdash; embed affordability at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s housing system; <br /><br />&mdash; prioritise the increased supply of social and affordable homes;<br /><br />&mdash; finalise and open a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote home ownership for households that would otherwise be frozen out of the market;<br /><br />&mdash; increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000 homes, with an emphasis on new builds, to ensure that those in the greatest need can access quality housing and to take pressure off other areas of the housing system thus ensuring more affordable supply for first-time buyers and renters;<br /><br />&mdash; create the conditions for the delivery of the greatest number of affordable homes possible, including setting a target for the delivery of affordable homes over the lifetime of the Government, to be available for qualifying purchasers as a matter of priority;<br /><br />&mdash; accelerate delivery of affordable homes by local authorities under the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund, to deliver 6,200 new affordable homes and expand the projects under the Fund and examine opportunities to expand the scope and potential of the Fund;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that local authorities remain central to delivering public social and affordable housing working with approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and other state and private sector partners; <br /><br />&mdash; work with the private sector, through the planning and regulatory regimes, to ensure that an appropriate mix and type of housing is provided nationally and locally;<br /><br />&mdash; monitor and work to address, with key stakeholders and industry, issues arising in the area of construction costs, viability and productivity, particularly against a background of Covid-19 and Brexit;<br /><br />&mdash; improve the supply and affordability of quality rental accommodation and the security of tenure for renters;<br /><br />&mdash; recognise the need to re-invigorate our towns, put in place a new scheme to provide seed capital to local authorities to provide affordable serviced sites in towns and villages to allow individuals and families build homes; <br /><br />&mdash; retain and expand the Help to Buy scheme for new properties and self-build properties;<br /><br />&mdash; expand the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan;<br /><br />&mdash; expand Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to encompass affordable as well as social housing;<br /><br />&mdash; roll out the cost rental model for the delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for the financing, construction and management of homes;<br /><br />&mdash; complete the audit of State lands, identifying land banks in public ownership that are suitable for housing and other purposes;<br /><br />&mdash; mandate the LDA to work with local authorities, State agencies and other stakeholders to develop masterplans for strategic sites; and<br /><br />&mdash; avoid over-concentration of particular housing types in areas, by requiring local authorities to complete Housing Need Demand Assessments to inform the delivery of an appropriate mix of housing typologies to cater for the needs of disparate household types and sizes.&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>I thank colleagues for tabling this motion as it affords me an opportunity to outline my plans to deliver affordable and public housing.  The Government is opposing the motion as it is flawed, poorly constructed and ill-thought out.  In the amendment, the Government makes clear, at we have laid out in Our Shared Future, the programme for Government, that its actions will be guided by the core principle that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price in sustainable communities that offer a high quality of life.</p><p>Tackling homelessness remains a key objective.  I met the incredible team in the Department today to reinforce that message and offer any support I can.  Accelerating the delivery of social housing, with an increased emphasis on direct build, is a key objective in the programme for Government, which contains an ambitious target of delivering at least 50,000 social housing homes over the term of the Government.  Another key objective is to deliver affordable homes for people and families to be able to purchase or rent.  In particular, I will bring forward measures to give hope back to our young people that they can aspire to own their own home at an affordable price.</p><p>I have spent my first ten days in office meeting key stakeholders and gaining further insights into the challenges that lie ahead.  I have outlined the ambitions of the Government in the key areas of housing and homelessness and I have asked them to be as ambitious in their pursuit of delivering the homes that we badly need.  I am meeting key delivery partners weekly, initially to target delivery this year, taking account of the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.  I will also work closely in partnership with local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency to plot the course ahead and to agree output targets.</p><p>Affordable homes will be delivered through a number of channels.  To this end, my intention is to extend the serviced sites fund, SSF; expand Part V to encompass affordable purchase as well as social housing while protecting the 10% social housing provision; and to provide seed capital to local authorities to provide serviced sites at cost in towns and villages to allow individuals and families build homes.  </p> <p>I want to expand the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, strengthen the mortgage-to-rent scheme and ensure it is helping those who need it and those who are in systemic mortgage arrears.  I want to retain and expand the help-to-buy scheme for new properties and for self-build properties.  </p> <p> I am going to accelerate and expand the serviced sites fund.  Under the fund &euro;310 million is already available to provide enabling infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  A maximum funding amount of &euro;50,000 is available per home and on this basis and under the existing budget at least 6,200 affordable homes to buy or rent can be delivered.  The funding is made available in those areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for more affordable housing and that the viability for delivering such housing on their sites exists.  Some &euro;127 million of the serviced sites fund has already been allocated in support of 35 projects.  I will ensure that these projects are expedited so that these homes will be delivered.  This will provide for critical infrastructure work that will support delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes across 14 local authority areas, including the greater Dublin area, Cork, Limerick and Galway, seeing good a firm commitment outlined in the programme for Government.</p> <p> Importantly, the majority of these homes are being developed across mixed tenure sustainable sites.  The bulk of these projects, approved for funding under the serviced sites fund, are currently in the planning and design phase.  The final sales prices of these affordable homes will be fully determined after the necessary planning permission has been obtained and the procurement process for the construction of the development in question has been completed.  Local authorities have, however, projected indicative reductions of between 10% and 40% on open market values.  I am determined to work with them and support local authorities and other delivery partners to ensure that these homes are affordable for the people and families that need them.  </p> <p> For example, in early 2021, a development in Boherboy, County Cork, is scheduled to be the first serviced sites fund scheme to deliver homes.  It will deliver 116,000 badly needed affordable homes and Cork County Council has confirmed that these two and three-bedroomed homes are expected to be made available to first-time buyers between the price range of &euro;198,000 and &euro;223,000.  </p> <p> Just yesterday, South Dublin County Council issued an invitation to tender for the development of a supported project in Killinarden in Tallaght.  The development site has an estimated capacity for 500 units with an anticipated tenure mix of 60% affordable and 20% social.  Fingal County Council will shortly award a contract and commence construction on a housing project in Dun Emer in Lusk comprising two and three-bedroom houses and apartments which will be offered to the local authority with an average reduction of 20% on market values.  Indeed, I have met Fingal County Council specifically about those 51 homes where the prices will range on or about &euro;200,000.  </p> <p> We need local authorities to bring forward many more of these type of projects and this is the message I have given in my letter to chief executives late last week.  For my part, as Minister, I will ensure that the necessary budgetary and statutory supports are in place.  I intend to continue to use the finance provided by the serviced sites fund to support the delivery of more affordable homes on public land.  I also intend to extend the use of the serviced sites fund and will be working with local authorities to that end.  I am also looking at other potential ways to expand this fund to deliver more affordable homes in the shortest possible time.</p> <p> Another important way in which I will be encouraging the development more affordable homes is through the expansion of Part V planning provisions.  I intend to extend Part V to encompass affordable purchase in addition to its current important role in providing social homes.  This commitment will not only add to the number of homes available in these areas but will increase the tenure options for people and will assist in providing a good tenure mix within our communities.</p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in motion calls for absolute limits on the selling of affordable homes.  It also places limits on the gross incomes of those who will be eligible to buy those affordable homes.  These ideas, while well-intentioned, are flawed and not ambitious enough.  On selling prices, the price of the homes that will be made available for purchase under the affordable scheme will be influenced by a range of factors which will vary from scheme to scheme.  I will be working to make them affordable and attractive for people who need them, particularly in major of urban areas where people are facing the greatest access and affordability challenge.</p> <p> Placing absolute and uninformed limits on the prices of as yet to be planned, procured and constructed homes could easily become a barrier to delivery.  This could prevent the development of viable housing in areas of most need or prevent households identified as having a particular housing need from accessing the type of house in the location in which the house is needed.</p> <p> The Government will not support the Sinn F&eacute;in position that households on gross income of more than &euro;75,000 would be deemed unworthy of State support.  This would represent something in the region of 40% of dual income households nationally and a significantly greater number of dual income couples in our urban centres.  The approach this Government favours is proportionality.  We do not intend to define affordability, as the Sinn F&eacute;in motion suggests, by reference to single points of income or price.  If one takes the example of the median price of a first-time buyer home in 2019 in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown which was &euro;465,000, or Dublin city where it was &euro;343,000, is Sinn F&eacute;in really saying that a dual income working couple earning average wages just over the threshold of &euro;75,000 and unable to buy a more affordable home in their own community would be excluded from availing of support to purchase a more affordable home under any Government scheme?  </p> <p> Affordability is not simply a question of how much is too much to pay on a mortgage but of how much is too much for whom and in what circumstance?  That is why this Government would rather seek to try to accommodate each household&rsquo;s particular family need and financial circumstance.  It is why, in the first part, we will assess eligibility on the proportion of the net income a household would need to buy a house on the open market to meet their needs.  The Government will ensure a balanced allocation of State supports both in terms of fairness regarding those who are eligible to avail of it, and on the amount of financial support they receive.  </p> <p> In addition to ensuring that local authorities will be central to delivering housing, the Government has also confirmed that the Land Development Agency, LDA, will have a crucially important and increasing role in the delivery of more affordable homes on State-owned land.  This will include homes for affordable purchase, cost rental and social housing.  As stated in the programme for Government, we will legislate as a matter of urgency to establish the LDA on a statutory basis to ensure State-owned lands are properly managed and utilised.  The LDA will be tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas, and to ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.  We intend that State lands being offered for sale, whether owned by a local authority, Government Department, commercial or non-commercial State agency, or any other agency, would automatically be offered first to the LDA. </p> <p> I will also continue to encourage housing delivery supported by the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  LIHAF was designed to fund the provision of large-scale public infrastructure to relieve critical blockages and enable housing developments to be built.  Funding of &euro;200 million has already been allocated under LIHAF and the projects will support the delivery of up to 20,000 homes.  Construction of infrastructure and housing has started on many projects and more than 2,000 homes were completed to the end of 2019.  About 40% of homes delivered under LIHAF will be sold at rates which provide a discount on market price.  Up to 3,000 will be social housing homes and the remainder will be sold at market rates.</p> <p> I have committed to introducing an affordable purchase scheme as a matter of absolute priority.  It was with some interest that I read this Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for the introduction of such an affordable housing scheme.   I remind the House that Sinn Fein opposed and voted against a Fianna F&aacute;il motion to build affordable housing on State and local authority lands in the last D&aacute;il.   It is a late convert to the principle of affordable purchase.  I welcome the party&rsquo;s conversion to affordable purchase.</p> <p> I intend to announce the details of the new scheme in September, when I will confirm the arrangements under which discounted homes will be sold to eligible purchasers by local authorities.  The underlying provisions for affordable purchase are set out in Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provision) Act 2009.</p> <p>In finalising the details of this scheme, I am first taking a short amount of time to engage with the various sectoral interests to ensure the scheme is as I envisage and as envisaged by Government.  I have instructed my officials to undertake a short and focused review of the 2009 provisions to ensure they meet those requirements and to identify the changes that will be necessary to reflect the priorities of this Government.  Key eligibility criteria for an affordable dwelling purchase arrangement under Part V include that the applicant be a first-time buyer, with exceptions, that the net household income is such that the repayments on a 90% mortgage for the purchase of a suitable unit at market value would not exceed 35% of that net income.  Net income here means income net of income tax and PRSI.  In addition, a charge will be placed on the property equal to the percentage discount from market value, giving the housing authority an equity stake in the property.  This is important to ensure that more homes can be delivered over time, helping more people to access affordable homes.</p> <p> While I consider that 35% is a reasonable threshold, as I have indicated earlier, I intend to scrutinise the eligibility criteria as it relates to income level to ensure it reflects this Government's priorities and delivers the outcomes we need.  Broadly, I consider that determining eligibility by reference to net income is fairer than doing so by reference to gross income.  Take, for instance, two couples with the same net income, the first couple with one income and the second couple with two incomes.  The couple with one income in this case will have a higher gross income.  I do not believe two households with the same net income, which influences the ability to repay a mortgage, should necessarily be treated differently because their gross incomes may be different.  However, as I have said, I intend to take a close look at this area before finalising the scheme.  I further intend to publish that scheme in September, along with any amending legislation that would be required.</p> <p> As Members will know, we are also preparing a cost rental model, a national cost rental scheme in respect of which a working group is finalising options for Government.  This will also be published this year and brought before this House.</p> <p> My tenure as Minister will see affordability at the heart of the housing system.  My immediate priority in this area will be concentrated on introducing an affordable purchase scheme that will help struggling households access affordable homes.  I am very much aware of the breadth of the task that is facing us in this area and I am determined to take on this challenge.  I am confident the extensive range of commitments our three parties have made in the programme for Government will prove to be an excellent starting point for our collective ambition to make housing more affordable for people across Ireland, and as such I reiterate our proposed revisions to the motion before us.</p></speech>

During the general election held a few short months ago housing was the biggest issue arising on the doorsteps.  In terms of affordability, it was far too common to come across a number of generations of one family living under the same roof, with people priced out of starting a life, with relationship break-up putting a huge strain on families and with people wondering what life chance they had to live in the area I represent, although this is a national issue as well.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing this evening.  The Labour Party Private Members' time tomorrow evening will focus on housing as well.  This evening, we are focused on the issue of affordable housing.  The Minister mentioned in his contribution that he proposes to initiate an affordable purchase scheme and he mentioned that he would welcome practical and positive suggestions.  In this regard, I refer the Minister to the former rent-to-buy scheme.  The Minister will recall that prior to the crash a number of housing schemes were in place during the late 2008 to 2010 period in particular, which afforded people an opportunity to get on the property ladder but these schemes were disbanded when the crash happened.  The rent-to-buy scheme was operated by Dublin City Council and Louth County Council.  A similar scheme operated in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I would like to speak to the scheme operated by Dublin City Council.  Under this scheme a person entered into a three-year agreement with the council to rent at an agreed monthly rent of up to 20% less than the market rate in a particular area.  If the person decided to purchase the property, 80% of the rent paid over the three years, or a shorter term but up to a maximum of three years, was offset against the purchase price, this price having been agreed before the tenant moved into the accommodation.  One of the benefits of the rent-to-buy scheme was that a person had three years to decide if he or she wanted to buy the property, to continue to rent it or to walk away.  This gave people an opportunity not to have to rent and save simultaneously.  These are the couples and individuals all of us meet who cannot afford to rent and save for a deposit at the same time and so they feel completely locked out.  What we need now is a scheme such that people do not have to rent and save at the same time.  Such a scheme existed pre-2010.  The Labour Party is suggesting that the Minister recommence that scheme, but nationally rather than in any one local authority area.</p>  <p>  As I said, a similar scheme is operated in Northern Ireland, known as the rent-to-own scheme.  Under this scheme a person signs a tenancy agreement, the rent-to-own co-operative buys the property selected by the rent-to-own applicant and it rents it to the tenant at market rent.  The tenant then has an option to buy at the end of three-year fixed term.  To qualify, a person must be able to show that he or she can make the repayments and does not have an alternative route into home ownership.  The Labour Party proposal is practical and it should be taken on board to address the situation for the locked out generation.  It is a proposal we could work on collectively across the House.  As I said, schemes of this type were in place prior to the crash.  When the crash came, over a short period a huge amount of property became much more affordable to people of a certain income stream if they were still in employment.  </p>  <p>  These are the types of schemes we need to revert to.  The State should be happy to get involved.  I do not understand the reluctance of successive Governments to have the hand of the State hugely, if not solely, involved in the provision of housing.  The State does not have a profit motive.  The issue with housing when it is left to the market is that the market has no conscience and it has a profit motive.  If the State is involved it does not have a profit motive and there are standards that we can expect from the State and those who oversee the agencies of the State, be they local authorities or Departments.  We would have more faith in councils, local authorities or direct funding from Departments to drive these schemes.  Those who could avail of these schemes would have much more faith in them because they would know that in a private rented market situation they would not end up on the rough end of a tenancy agreement if things did not go their way.  People can trust the State more than the market economy.</p>  <p>  On that basis, tomorrow night we will flesh out other issues the Labour Party has in terms of the housing situation.  As I said, when I was canvassing a rent-to-buy scheme was a measure many couples said they could potentially buy into.  People should not have to rent and save at the same time.  The two can happen simultaneously with tenants being given a three-year timeframe within which to make a decision.  This would give people a level of comfort for a set timeframe.  It also would not put a huge emotional strain on a relationship or an emotional strain on a family that just wants to move on and live their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700049#CCC00300"><p>We have a fundamental choice as to the direction we want to go on housing affordability.  We can continue with the current model of private provision, turning homes into financial assets and pushing up prices.</p> <p>The Government is proposing to introduce more and more subsidies and discounts to the model but it is essentially continuing with the same model that has failed in recent decades.</p> <p> The alternative model is to try to tackle land costs, land speculation and building costs, and to bring in affordability throughout the housing system, which will benefit everyone.  If that is the approach we take, we will not have to get into a debate about cut-off points and income limits because the proposals will take some of the speculation costs out of housing and make it more affordable for everyone.  That is the kind of approach I favour.</p> <p> If the Government is serious about housing, one step it could take tonight to indicate its seriousness is to state it will accept in full Article 31 of the European Social Charter on housing, which is not a radical demand or anything like it.  It commits the State to promoting access to housing of an adequate standard, to preventing and reducing homelessness with a view to its elimination and to making the price of housing accessible to those without adequate resources.  The ambitions set out in Article 31 are not radical.  It is incredible that the Government and the State signed up to the European Social Charter 20 years ago but to this day will not commit in full to Article 31.  The Minister should show a bit of ambition and commit the State to Article 31.  It would be a good signal of intent and I ask him to do that.</p> <p> On affordability and the changes that have been happening in recent years, levels of home ownership have fallen, especially for younger people, and the growth in house prices has substantially outstripped the growth in incomes, resulting in intergenerational divides in terms of access to housing, deepening inequality, social exclusion, housing insecurity and homelessness.  This is part of an overall trend of commodifying and financialising housing, turning homes into financial instruments and assets for investment.  Much of this happened originally with the deregulation of the mortgage market in the 1980s, which led to a flood of cheap credit into housing, as well as when we joined the euro, which exacerbated that problem.  There was a lack of regulation and control over the banks at the time, which inflated prices.  Land hoarding and speculation has also contributed to house price inflation and unaffordability.  More recently, the previous Government accelerated many of these policies, including favourable tax treatment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, encouraging arrangements such as short-term lets, reducing standards and even going as far as privatising the provision of homelessness services and hostels.  There are significant negative consequences of that and we need a change of direction.</p> <p> Internationally, there are good examples of housing affordability.  In South Korea, for example, housing is becoming more affordable over time, the opposite to what is happening in Ireland, and that is where the state plays a large role in the provision and development of housing.  Affordability in terms of people's incomes is becoming less of a burden over time, which shows that when a state gets involved and is serious about it, it can be very effective.  In countries such as Germany, municipalities and local authorities can freeze the existing land use values and acquire land at the existing land value.  There is nothing new in that idea; it was proposed in Ireland, as everyone in the House will know, some 47 years ago in the Kenny report.  The current Taoiseach stated two years ago that he was examining whether the Kenny report could be implemented but there has been silence on that since.</p> <p> That is what we should be looking at.  One factor that creates housing unaffordability and drives up the price of housing and land is the public investment we make in infrastructure and our zoning process.  There is no reason we should be gifting that uplift in land values to private developers.  In effect we are using public resources to make landowners rich while, at the same time, making housing unaffordable for people.  That is something we need to tackle and, if we are serious about affordability, it is something we should be doing.  One of the arguments often raised against that relates to constitutionality.  When the 2004 Oireachtas all-party group, which included representatives from the Government parties, examined the Constitution, its recommendation was that the Kenny report would be constitutional to implement.  It noted that the Supreme Court had found that Part V provisions were constitutional and that the Kenny report had argued strongly that the legislation should be passed and referred to the Supreme Court in order that it could be tested beyond doubt.  That would have an impact on housing affordability.</p> <p> We need a systemic change rather than just initiatives that seek to subsidise and provide discounts, some of which, unfortunately, are modest.  The LIHAF funding has not been entirely successful.  Some of the discounts are very small and there is also an issue with the uptake of the LIHAF funding.  In my constituency, funding awarded years ago has still not been drawn down and the infrastructure has not been built.  We need more systemic reform than simply expanding some of the current schemes.</p> <p> We have a fundamental choice as to what direction we go in.  Are we looking at providing more homes or more commodities?  Are we looking to provide places for families to be secure and in which to flourish or are we looking to provide more investment opportunities?  Government policy dictates this.  Will we be having more build-to-rent schemes or will we be looking for strong, stable and thriving communities?  Will we be looking to subsidise affordable housing and land speculation or to implement policies that will make housing affordable across the board?  What do we want to build and what kind of society do we want to live in?  Do we want to live in a society or simply a market?</p> <p> This is a political choice.  The policies the Government takes will determine in which direction we go in the coming years.  While its various initiatives are welcome, I urge it to go much further and consider systemic change and cutting out speculation.  There is no reason, if that has been done successfully in other countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea, that we should not avail of the same policies to make housing affordable, get rid of land speculation and improve the quality of people's lives.</p></speech>

I am talking about Cork city centre but I could be talking about other places too.  A new hotel with 120 beds at Kent Station is now on the way, as well as a new hotel with 171 beds in MacCurtain Street, a new hotel with 183 beds at Morrison's Quay and a new hotel with 58 beds in South Mall.  Overpriced student accommodation is on the way in Washington Street, Carrigrohane Road, the Lough and North Main Street, on top of the overpriced student accommodation built on the Western Road and the South Main Street.</p>  <p>  Where is the social and affordable housing?  There is very little of it.  Some 43 units are on the way in White Street, 25 units in Miller Street, 17 units in Lower John Street and 33 in Grattan Street.  I might be missing one or two but that is the bulk of it.  If it is all added up, it is fewer than the number of beds in one of the new hotels.  The gentrification of Cork city centre is a big mistake.  Working people are being forced out of the city centre, forced to move miles out into the county to find affordable housing, and they become commuters.  We will see what happens with the Government's proposals for public transport, but at the moment being a commuter, more often than not, means travelling to work by car.</p> <p>The next big crisis, the climate change crisis, which we are already facing, is bad news.  What is being done involves bad planning and it is the wrong way to go.  In May of last year, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, went to Cork and told the <i>Evening Echo</i>he looked forward to the prospect of the first co-living development in Cork.  It was a crazy idea at the time.  One of the co-living developments in Dublin involved one kitchen for 42 people, which means overcrowding.  If the idea was crazy in 2019 because of overcrowding, it is super-crazy in 2020, in the age of Covid.  I hope I never see a co-living development in Cork city centre.  The previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said in May that he did not have any plans for scrapping the provisions for co-living developments so I am asking the new Minister tonight whether he will take a different approach to this issue.<br/><br/>The motion correctly criticises the absence in the programme of Government of targets for the delivery of affordable housing, the absence of a definition of &quot;affordable housing&quot; and the absence of price points for affordable housing.  The programme claims &euro;230,000 is affordable in an urban area or the commuter belt and that &euro;220,000 is affordable in non-urban areas.  In 2016, Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland said a three-bedroom semi-detached house could be built for &euro;150,000.  Mr. Mel Reynolds, who is obviously our foremost expert in the field, was asked his opinion and he said he believed that figure was slightly off.  He cited &euro;165,000 &ndash; in other words, 50% of the average price of a house on the market at the time, &euro;330,000, when VAT, development profit, builder's profit, banker's profit and the price of land were stripped out.  This shows why we need public housing on public land.  We can eliminate most of these costs and cut some of the others.  We have enough public land to build 100,000 social and affordable homes.  I accept the quoted figures and prices are four years old but if the cost of building was &euro;165,000 four years ago, it is certainly less than &euro;200,000 now.  That is what an affordable home should be.<br/><br/>I have some concerns about the motion pegging affordable rent as between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month.  That is in contradiction to the motion's target of 30% of net disposable income for a loan.  For the majority of working people, 30% of their net disposable income is less than &euro;700 to &euro;900 per month in terms of rent.  Despite that criticism, I support the motion and will be voting for it on Thursday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700051#EEE00200"><p>This Government, as with the previous two, will be judged on its response to the housing crisis.  All the now-governing parties &ndash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party &ndash; had a hand in the creation of the circumstances we are currently in.  I refer to the unprecedented level of homelessness and to the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the housing crisis.  Political choices, particularly by the last couple of Governments, have allowed the crisis to worsen further to protect the soaring profits of the big landlords and developers whom they represent.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis is and always has been avoidable.  An interesting figure from the last month illustrates that point in a small way: there was a drop of 500 people registered as homeless by comparison with the month before.  There is no mystery there.  The number has fallen because evictions have been banned.  The socialist left has argued for a long time that we should ban evictions but Fine Gael fought the evictions ban and it fought the rent freeze tooth and nail.  It denounced it as unconstitutional and impossible to achieve.  It took a global pandemic to implement a temporary ban on evictions and a rent freeze.  Even then, the measures were taken extremely reluctantly.  Unfortunately, all the indications are that this Government is going to offer more of the same.</p>  <p>  We should examine the promises concerning new public housing builds.  Somehow Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have managed to negotiate a programme for Government and collectively come up with a commitment to build less public housing than was referred to in the Green Party manifesto, the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto and even the Fine Gael manifesto.  Perhaps the Minister can explain how the parties all managed to negotiate each other downwards to a point below where each started.  The programme for Government refers to increasing "the social housing stock by over 50,000 over the next five-years, the majority of which are to be built by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and State agencies".  That is actually a commitment to build 25,001 houses, with all the rest potentially being acquisitions.  A majority of the 50,000 is to be built by some of the bodies in question, and this indicates the same sort of tricking around with the figures as practised by the last Government and the pretence that HAP houses or long-term leases by councils and big handouts to developers and landlords represent social housing.  It simply will not work, except to further enrich the landlords and developers.</p>  <p>  I will be supporting Sinn F&eacute;in's motion.  In saying that, I do not believe it goes far enough.  Some 20,000 homes per year is still short of what is possible and what has been achieved in the past.  It is short of what is necessary.  We need to build at least 33,000 new homes per year for the next three years.</p>  <p>  There is an important omission in the motion.  When we are campaigning for the building of public housing, we must always say we want the houses to be of passive-housing standard.  A public housing programme is part of a green new deal.  In addition to having retrofitting programmes, we must say when building houses that they should be built to passive-housing standards.  This should be seen as providing potentially hundreds of thousands of green jobs.</p>  <p>  Who should be doing this?  It is not enough to say local authorities should be designated to lead.  The essence of a left-wing housing policy is to decommodify housing.  Housing should not be something from which landlords and developers make profits; it should be provided so people can have a decent place to live.  That means taking the profit motive out entirely and nationalising the construction companies, big corporate landlords, land banks and vulture funds.  It means developing a State construction company given a mandate to truly resolve the housing crisis through the mass building of public housing and making public housing accessible for all, with enough public housing built to allow for the removal of the income caps and to decommodify housing.</p></speech>

It is refreshing for a change to be talking about an issue that came up on the doorsteps and in the House during the general election campaign instead of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the new Aire and wish him the very best of luck.  If I can give him one small piece of advice, it is that he should take on board the constructive suggestions that come from the House.  It should not be about opposition and government.  The D&aacute;il should not be treated as a dunce.  Good ideas do come from here.  They came from the Opposition benches during the last D&aacute;il.  Some of those ideas were implemented over recent weeks because of the Covid crisis.  Ministers were told that they could not be implemented and that the Constitution would not allow it, yet we could find a solution when there was a need.  I urge the Minister to steer away from the temptation that will be whispered into his ear to shoehorn through a particular proposal on the basis that the Government has a majority.  He should take on board the good ideas.  They may be amended and altered and we may not agree with the amendments and alterations but the Parliament should be used as a vehicle to bring about change, not just to rubber-stamp proposals coming from the Government.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The problem of affordable housing is complex and there is no single measure that can promise a comprehensive solution.  There are certain risks with some proposals and there will be unintended consequences but we must take those risks in the interests of the thousands of families across the country that do not own their own home or do not have a roof over their heads tonight.</p> <p> If we are going to deal with the challenges of housing in our cities, in particular in Dublin, as well as the challenges of congestion, we must recognise that we cannot just keep building houses in Dublin to solve our problem.  We need to bring about regional balance, so as well as building housing in high-demand areas, we must take other immediate steps, including bringing families into new communities where the taxpayer has already paid for infrastructure such as schools, roads, water and sewerage treatment facilities.  Infrastructure like schools is already in place in many parts of our country but we still have a problem in locations because of depopulation.  We need to address that imbalance.</p> <p> The Minister's Department deals with housing and every serviced site in this country costs that Department an average of &euro;30,714 arising from infrastructure that has been put in place.  It is not just about the serviced site on its own but it is about putting the infrastructure in place right across the country.  If we can get somebody to move out of an urban area, which has a high demand for housing, into a vacant home, it would in itself save the Exchequer more than &euro;30,000 while leaving one fewer serviced site required.</p> <p> In the current housing crisis one of our key actions must be to maximise the use of our existing housing stock.  There are 1.75 million houses in this country and a conservative estimate sees approximately 50,000 of them vacant at any one time.  Some of these are in areas of high demand but some are in regional locations, including my constituency.  We need to target those regional vacant homes immediately.  As I stated, it is costing the Minister's Department more than &euro;30,000 to put a serviced site in place in this country.  We should introduce a regional home regeneration grant.  If a first-time buyer purchases an existing property in a town or village with a significant residential vacancy rate, that buyer should be eligible for a grant of &euro;15,000 that could be offset against mortgage deposit requirements.</p> <p> I am thankful we are putting major investment into broadband infrastructure after a long struggle within previous Governments and this will transform the country both in urban and rural areas.  Major investment is being put in place and as a basic and standard offering across rural Ireland, 500 Mbps broadband will be available to rural homes from the end of this year.  We need to encourage people to move out of our cities and utilise this infrastructure.</p> <p> The big difficulty in my constituency and many other parts of regional and rural Ireland is that people are commuting long distances to work.  People in my constituency must travel long distances and they are commuting to Dublin, Galway and Sligo to obtain employment.  There will be major benefits to the economy, society and our environment if we can get people to work remotely.</p> <p> I know that until now it was like banging one's head on a brick wall to speak about remote working.  I am thankful that Covid-19 has changed that attitude.  As well as bringing life into communities where there has been a drop in population, remote working would take pressure from existing infrastructure in our urban areas and use existing infrastructure, including housing, roads and schools in many provincial or rural locations.  It is important to really consider this now.  If we encouraged one person in rural Ireland to reduce his or her weekly car travel by up to 300 km per week, it would diminish carbon emissions by 1.7 tonnes per annum.</p> <p> If we are to do this, the Government must take the lead and set a target within the public sector that within the next 18 months, 30% of all staff would work remotely.  If the public sector and the Government leads by example, others will follow.  We must develop a policy right across society, not just to deal with Covid-19 but to deal with the environmental challenges arising from commuting, regional imbalance and congestion and housing issues, particularly in this city.  We must develop a remote-first policy.</p> <p> This means that when meetings take place in Dublin, whether in Leinster House or any other business in the city, people sit down in front of a computer screen.  They may be speaking to two or three colleagues across the table but they may also be speaking remotely to two or three more colleagues.  A simple remote-first policy would allow people to work far more constructively from rural areas and regional locations.  It is a mindset change that must happen.  We are now moving from a position of working remotely in a complete way to some type of hybrid system but we cannot allow this to go back to how things were.</p> <p> It is imperative that we start with a remote-first policy.  It makes far more sense to try to encourage people to think about moving to a rural locations.  We will not get people who were born, bred and reared in Dublin to move to rural Ireland.  However, in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway, we have the highest third level participation rate in the country but we have the lowest level of graduate employees working within that constituency.  If we can get a proportion of those people who are from east Galway or County Roscommon and who are working in different parts of Ireland or the globe to come back and work from a remote site in my constituency, where some parts have issues with depopulation, there would be a major benefit for everyone.  We must change our thinking and attitude in how we work and have worked to date.</p></speech>

Affordable housing is every family's dream but, sadly, it is not the reality for many families.  Over the past four years, I have seen a large amount of lip service but no delivery on the ground.  Housing and planning in this country is a total mess.  It goes against families, building and local communities; it is basically anti-everything and it has left us a mess that will take us years, if not decades, to clean up.</p>  <p>  I urge the new Government to look at models that have worked throughout the world.  I met a Norwegian native living in west Cork over the weekend.  He came to Ireland to live and has bought some ground.  He loves our country, our culture and that he can farm his land; due to ridiculous planning regulations, however, he is unable to build on that land.  Looking at the new Cork county development plan, I can see nothing will change, and if anything things will get worse.  Anybody who wants to live permanently in a place could prove it but every obstacle is put before such people to ensure they cannot set up a home even if they have fallen in love with the land.  This man tells me it is different in Norway, where everything is done to accommodate people who want to reside in rural communities.  Instead of obstacles being put in families' way, they are encouraged to get the application across the line.</p>  <p>  Affordable housing sounds like a good deal but one "affordable" site among many was sold in west Cork for lottery money a number of years ago, taking it from the hands of local families who wanted to purchase it.</p> <p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme could have made a major difference to people who are unable to get loans from banks.  Figures indicate, however, that more than 50% of applicants have failed to secure funding under the scheme, leaving many dreams in tatters. </p> <p> During discussions on a programme for Government for the previous Government &ndash; I was around the table at the time &ndash; a promise was made to look seriously at a rural resettlement scheme.  Falling populations have completely devastated rural communities and such a scheme would have been a way of turning this around, as was done in County Clare many years ago.  Instead, we read week after week and month after month of rising numbers in emergency housing in our cities.  A living over the shop type scheme in rural towns and villages could have tackled the housing crisis and would have been a main charge going forward for genuine applicants.  However, rural Ireland was not on the radar of the previous Government.  I hope we will not the same again this time around but time will tell.</p> <p> Every day, single people and families plead with me for houses in west Cork.  Most of them cannot afford to purchase through housing schemes in west Cork.  In my time on the council, I remember a big launch being held in 2014 for a scheme in Clonakilty, an area that is desperately in need of affordable housing.  It is now 2020 and the scheme has still not been delivered.  This is a cause of great concern locally.  While Clonakilty is doing well as regards employment, the area needs social and affordable homes to be made available.  The same applies in Kinsale.  Last night, a young man called me to plead for accommodation.  There is little difference in Dunmanway, although I will admit that a number of houses have been allocated to people in Rosscarbery in the past two weeks.  I thank Ellen in my office who has helped people to get homes and settle in.  We have had cases in Skibbereen, Bandon, Bantry, Castletownbere and Goleen.  The story is always the same.  Every day, the phones in my office are jammed with calls from people pleading for homes.</p> <p> I sincerely hope that affordable homes will be made available to those who desperately need them in the weeks and months ahead.  I also hope the new Minister tackles head on the planning policy units and stops this nonsense that prevents families from building on their own lands.  Decisions preventing people from building have resulted in the loss to communities of great families over the years. </p></speech>

I want to issue my comhghairdeachas to the new Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, who is from Kilkenny in the south east, where I am from.  I wish both the Minister and Minister of State all the best.  I worked with the Minister when he was a member of the housing committee.  Some people have criticised me for my attendance at that committee.  If words and paper could build houses, no one in this country would be homeless.  That was my experience of the committee and I became pure frustrated with it.</p><p>We need real action.  Members of my family were among the founding members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which has a history of building houses, especially local authority houses.  I hope the party has the say on housing in this Government.  The Minister with responsibility for housing is a member of the party and I wish him well in that regard as I know he is capable.  Fianna F&aacute;il must build ordinary local authority housing for ordinary people.  It must build schemes as it did in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 2000s.  People travelled in the backs of lorries and had no equipment.  They dug foundations by hand.  Now we have cranes, equipment and earth moving machinery and we still cannot build homes. </p><p>Planning is a disaster.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will not make matters worse.  He has a track record of objecting to planning applications for forestry felling licences and to many other planning applications.  Green Party members are top class at objecting.  They are serial objectors and we do not need those.  We must have balance and good planning laws but we do not have either. </p><p>Deputy Michael Collins mentioned this issue.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who was here earlier, is always talking about the rural cottage.  Councils always built rural homes but they are no longer building them.  Deputy Alan Kelly was the Minister with responsibility for housing for several years.  There have been more housing Ministers than I have had hot dinners but we cannot build houses. </p><p>Planning has a major role to play.  I spoke to the Minister earlier about a planning case in my town of Cahir in County Tipperary.  There is a lovely family and community in the area in question.  They built their own homes, which are private houses.  They are not snobs and it is not a case of NIMBY.  The county development plan is about to expire and a new one is to be developed.  A planning permission for a large number of houses was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la with many conditions and expires on 29 July.  Last Saturday, cowboy builders arrived on the scene before anyone got up.  They continued to build on the site despite a warning notice being issued by the county council.  No commencement notice was sent in to the building control authority either.  The county council officials are aware of the matter and have issued notices but that is not good enough.  These people want to plough on and this evening they dug foundations for houses right up on top of other sites for which An Bord Plean&aacute;la had denied permission to build.  This land is deemed to be dezoned in the new plan because there is too much land zoned in Cahir.  These people want others to get affordable, local authority and private houses but they want to be consulted and respected.</p><p>Above all, we cannot allow the planning laws of the land to be flouted by this company, which is apparently from this town and in which celebrities are supposedly involved.  It cannot ride roughshod over the planning laws and especially over the people.  I stand with those people who have housed themselves and their families.  All they want is that the same law is applied to developers as is applied to individuals.  If someone built an extension or a downstairs bathroom for a disabled person or someone who had a stroke without issuing a commencement notice, adhering to planning requirements or within weeks of a planning permission expiring, that person would be stopped in his tracks by the council.  This company seems to think it is all-powerful and can ride roughshod.  It broke every health and safety law in the book last Saturday morning.  I called to the site and there was not one sign, yellow jacket or hard hat in sight.  They had a hard mix alright and they disrespected the people.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had to be called.</p><p>I want Tipperary County Council to go to the courts if necessary.  One might as well send a copy of <i>The Irish Times</i>or another newspaper as send a warning notice because the company does not respect warning notices.  This is the culture that has grown up around some of the big developers.  I know some very good developers who build houses and want to be unshackled and allowed to build.  This kind of carry-on by rogue developers and landowners cannot be allowed to continue in 2020.  Rogue landowners want to sell their land in a slipshod way without plans for cr&egrave;ches or community facilities.  We wanted to build a scouts hall back in the day when the planning was done first.  The previous owners did a good job and talked to people.  We want engagement with people, from whatever communities they come.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We want good will and support.  We want people to live in harmony, whether they live in private, social or affordable homes.</p><p>We need to get a building campaign going for social housing.  The Government must give the county councils money.  Councils will send a report to the Department which will be sent back six months later.  They will then send it up to the Department again six months after that and it then goes up and down again.  Instead of building homes, we have paper being pushed around the country. </p><p>The banks are not functioning.  What sickens me altogether is that I have at least 20 farm families in Tipperary on my books where the son or daughter is helping the farmer and wants to get married.  These people have the money and wherewithal to build their own houses but they cannot get planning permission.  It is bizarre.  Rural Ireland is being denuded of its population.  It must be allowed to thrive.  We must have living towns and villages.  We cannot herd everyone into Dublin and Cork where all the menaces are.  There will be no one in the west.  We used to sing that the west was awake but the west has been forgotten and written off.  It has been cut off into the Atlantic.  We must have supports for ordinary people.  The Government should build houses for the people who want them. </p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their appointments and wish them well in their jobs.  I would love to be able to say in five years&rsquo; time, if the Government lasts that long, that we are well on the way to solving the housing problem.  Unfortunately, I believe this issue will not be solved in that time and we will be discussing motions similar to this one when that time comes.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, when discussing the committee on housing, that if words and paper could build houses, everything would have been fantastic as all the houses would have been built.  The final paragraph of the amendment to the motion jumps out and deserves to be read out.  It refers to avoiding &ldquo;over-concentration of particular housing types in areas, by requiring local authorities to complete Housing Need Demand Assessments to inform the delivery of an appropriate mix of housing typologies to cater for the needs of disparate household types and sizes."  That statement certainly lives up to the description of the committee as it is rubbish.</p> <p>Every local authority already carries out an assessment of housing needs.  Why would they do another one, except to delay and ensure that things do not happen?  Every local authority assesses the type of houses it needs.  Donegal County Council, like every other council, can say how many two-bedroom houses, three-bedroom houses and four-bedroom houses it needs and in what part of the county it needs them.  Why do we need all this?  It can only be to delay, delay and delay.<br/><br/>It is a pretty serious situation.  There are 1,600 people on the waiting list for two-bedroom houses in Donegal town.  Donegal County Council is building 20 houses at the moment.  At that rate it will take 80 or 90 years to deal with the list.  That is an appalling reflection on the way housing has been dealt with in this country in recent years and, unfortunately, on the way it probably will be dealt with in the future.  That can be repeated throughout County Donegal.  I imagine it could probably be repeated throughout the country.  That is an appalling and sad indictment. <br/><br/>Several Members have spoken about the properties available to rent on <i>daft.ie</i>as a way of dealing with the housing list.  I tried that as well.  There are no properties in Donegal town for rent on <i>daft.ie.  </i>There are no properties for rent in Killybegs.  In the entire county of Donegal there are 80 properties on <i>daft.ie</i>that are available to rent for less than &euro;2,000 per month and 12 of those properties are outside Letterkenny.  That is a county of 138,000 people.  This is a huge crisis.  It is not just a crisis in Dublin, Cork and Galway, but right across the country.  Everywhere has been left behind.  I do not believe that what the Government is doing will deal with it.  That is the sad thing about it.  The Minister can prove me wrong in the next five years.  I hope he will.  That would be powerful.  <br/><br/>Tonight's motion is about affordable housing.  There is a motion tomorrow night that concerns housing lists.  That is unfortunate.  We should have started with houses and the need to make sure that council houses are developed and delivered right throughout the country. <br/><br/>The Minister has laid out his plan without any idea of what will be delivered.  Earlier he said he would be launching some sort of housing programme in September.  We will then see plans against which we can measure his actual success.  Then we will see how he delivers for the people.  As I said already, I do not have much confidence.  The situation is very stark right across the board.  While 1,600 people are waiting for houses in Donegal town, unfortunately they will still be waiting in five years. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="21:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700054#HHH00200"><p>I wish the two Ministers the best.  When the Minister is finished with his phone, I will mention someone who was on the phone to me in my office.  This person has been on the waiting list in Galway city for 15 years.  Earlier today the woman who works with me in Galway told me about a call from a woman with six children who is pregnant with a seventh child.  She has been in a bed and breakfast in Galway city for the last 15 months.  The Simon Community has been producing its periodic Locked Out of the Market reports to provide a snapshot of a point in time.  On average, only approximately 5.5% of the rental market is within reach of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The HAP was of course introduced by Fine Gael and Labour.  It is a major problem.  If the Government is seriously interested in dealing with the housing crisis, it must set a date for the end of HAP.  Its cost doubled in one year.  The last figure I saw was approaching &euro;500 million.  It is now higher than that.  That money goes straight into the landlords' pockets.  Moreover, the tenant is left to come up with a top-up payment.  It used to be an under-the-counter payment.  Now it is an over-the-counter payment, fully endorsed by city councils and local authorities.  We are actively bolstering the private market.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for tabling the motion.  I have some difficulty with some of the wording concerning affordable housing, but I support the tenor of the motion.  We need to recognise we have a crisis, just as we did with the climate.  We have a housing crisis.  We have a crisis because we relied on the market to no avail.  We did not build a house in Galway between 2009 and 2016.  We used to file quarterly reports on the housing situation that would state how many houses would be built.  From 2009 onwards, that column stated that construction was suspended.  We have begun to build a small number of houses in Galway.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to get the housing figures, of course, because someone in receipt of HAP comes off the waiting list even though we were told that did not happen.  Such a person is considered to be adequately housed.  This adds to the total dishonesty of the language in this area.  We are now calling HAP placements social housing.  We take recipients off the waiting list and say they are adequately housed.  On Sunday last, I was on a political panel.  The councillors on that panel said there were approximately 4,500 households on the waiting list.  That figure refers to households, so we can assume that between 10,000 and 15,000 people are waiting for a house in Galway city. </p>  <p>  We have no master plan for the city.  Public land and private land is being developed by developers without a master plan.  It is on the D&aacute;il record that on two occasions Deputy Coveney agreed with me when I said that development in Galway was developer-led.  We have no master plan.  The Galway city development plan calls for the city council to facilitate master plans drawn up by developers.  A vast amount of land in the docks is held in trust for the people of Galway by one company.  We have 14 acres of land at Ceannt Station.  There are 21 acres of land on Sandy Road, some of it public and some of it private.  I do not know how much is public and how much is private.</p>  <p>  I am intensely worried by the role of the Land Development Agency.  I understand that just as there were 12 apostles, there are 12 members of that Land Development Agency.  Of these, three are women and the other nine are a mixture of developers, bankers and so on.  They are looking at that Sandy Road site in Galway.  Before I came down here, I looked again at what has happened.  The Land Development Agency used public money to engage five architects to come up with their vision.  Does the Minister know what the video presentation of one of those architects said?  It called the site a place to live well by accident.  We are paying taxpayers' money for this.  </p>  <p>  The vision statement calls for "a high-quality mixed use regeneration project, seeking to create a new sustainable neighbourhood in Galway City with usable public amenity [if Members can imagine that] in a vibrant and inclusive development".  There is no mention of a housing crisis.  As an afterthought, it adds that a "strong residential bias for the site is being sought".  This is public land, by and large, and we are asking for the vision of architects, who tell us it is a place to live well by accident.  There is no mention of a housing crisis or the housing task force that was set up under pressure because of the enormity of the housing problem in Galway.  There is public land and institutional land in lots of places.  There is no vision and no master plan and the Land Development Agency is pursuing developer-led development.</p>  <p>  At this stage I would almost give up, but I cannot.  It is a privilege to be here and to have been elected for the second time.  Since February 2016, I have been making exactly the same speech about housing and the housing crisis.  I appeal to the Minister of State as a member of the Green Party.  If we are going to have any change, let us make language mean something.  Let us make Galway an example of sustainable development.  I agreed with Deputy Naughten when he spoke about balanced regional development.  That is another part of the problem and the solution.  I represent a constituency that runs from the Aran Islands to south Mayo.  Many towns are going under because of a complete lack of support from the Government.  Let us look at all possible solutions.  Ultimately, the Minister will have my support if he builds public housing on public land in recognition of the serious emergency that we face.  </p></speech>

I welcome and congratulate the two new Ministers.  I wish them success, though unfortunately I do not think they will be successful unless they change their tack.  Housing remains a critical issue in my own constituency of Limerick City.  It was the number one issue on the doorsteps during the recent general election.  The lack of affordable housing for either rent or purchase is creating massive problems in our society.  We now have incredible situations where generations of families are living in the same crowded homes.  Children cannot study properly because there is no place to do their homework.</p> <p>There are grandchildren living permanently with their grandparents.  While the grandparents love to have the children in their home, they do not like them being there the whole time.</p> <p> We are storing up a national disaster unless there is a massive intervention in terms of building houses, including affordable houses.  A generation of working families have been robbed of the opportunity of owning their own homes.  This is the legacy of the failed housing policy of the previous Fine Gael Government.  However, that Government did not fail alone.  Its failure was enabled by Fianna F&aacute;il through the confidence and supply agreement.  I welcome that Fine Gael is no longer leading the housing portfolio, because it has been an absolute disaster on housing.  However, I have concerns about its enabler-in-chief, Fianna F&aacute;il, taking over the brief.  The new Minister, Deputy O'Brien, needs to act now and outline his plans through which affordable housing will become a reality.  To date, we have had no such detailed policy from the Minister's party and his statement this evening does not inspire much confidence in me.</p> <p> The legacy of the so-called housing policy of the Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il confidence and supply Government is the creation of an unflattering new normal.  Generations of families are living under the same roof, often in overcrowded conditions.  That has to stop.  Young couples are spending their earnings on high rents, with little prospect of owning their own homes.  That must end.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only political party to publish a costed housing policy.  My constituency office, like that of many other Deputies, is inundated on a daily basis with housing queries.  I urge all Deputies to support the motion put forward by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  We must introduce an affordable housing scheme that will offer hope to those people who are working hard without any possibility of owning their own homes.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, for bringing forward this important motion on behalf of the many thousands of our citizens for whom owning their own home is simply a pipe dream.  It is imperative that we tackle this aspect of our housing crisis head on and with immediate action.</p><p>This issue is a particularly dominant one in my own constituency.  House prices across County Wexford have risen consistently in the past couple of years.  According to the <i>daft.ie</i>report for the first quarter of 2020, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the county has increased by 6.1% since last year.  For a two-bedroom house, the increase was 3.3% and, for a three-bedroom home, the monthly rent increased by 2.4%.  I have also examined the CSO data, which show that the median house price increased in both Gorey and Wexford in the period from April 2019 to April 2020.</p><p>We can conclude from these data that we are seeing a steady increase in house prices in Wexford.  It is enough to cause alarm that we are following the trend in Dublin and other areas where workers are completely priced out of the market.  We are also seeing Wexford become a destination for families priced out of the capital and its hinterland.  As this happens more and more and as demand rises, market prices will continue to increase and we will find ourselves in a similar situation to what we see across the country, where accommodation is unattainable, unaffordable and unavailable for first-time buyers, average industrial wage earners and, especially, hard-working families.  Nationally, we need to get a grip on the imperative to provide good-quality, affordable housing.  The lack of such housing is already developing into a major societal problem, including in County Wexford.  It is time to act and we can begin by supporting this motion.</p></speech>

I agree with Fine Gael's assessment in a 2019 report in which it described Fianna F&aacute;il's housing proposals as lacking any credibility.  That was a bit rich coming from Fine Gael, given that Deputy Eoghan Murphy proved to be both unfit and out of his depth as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The programme for Government agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party can be summed up in one sentence, namely, that there is nothing to see here.  This is especially true in regard to affordable housing.  There are no targets for the delivery of affordable homes or affordable rental properties.  The Government seems to be clueless as to what affordable housing is or the cost of an affordable house.</p>  <p>  This is a kick in the teeth to young people and families wanting to own their own homes.  Clearly, this Government will continue to dither in delivering the affordable cost rental scheme that was first announced in 2014.  It is proving almost impossible for many people to get onto the property ladder as most rents and property prices are beyond their means.  I know of a one-bedroom apartment in Ballymun renting for &euro;1,6000, which is absolutely scandalous.  A three-bedroom semi-detached house with two bathrooms in Drumcondra is on sale for &euro;845,000.  A semi-detached house in Artane with three bedrooms and two bathrooms is selling for &euro;545,000, and a similar property in Whitehall is on sale for &euro;540,000.  Such prices put the prospect of owning a house beyond the reach of most people in my constituency.  The Government needs to look at the example of &Oacute; Cualann, a voluntary housing body that is building three-bedroom affordable homes in Ballymun and selling them for between &euro;170,000 and just over &euro;200,000.  Why can the Government not do the same and replicate it across the country?</p>  <p>  I have no faith in this Government implementing an affordable housing and rental scheme, just as the previous Government, which Fianna F&aacute;il supported, did not deliver any affordable homes to rent or buy through any Government scheme.  The Minister mentioned the Part V provisions and the retention of the 10% requirement.  The fact is that his party reduced the original provision from 20% to 10%.  He supported that reduction together with his Fine Gael colleagues.</p></speech>

The motion on its own will not solve the housing crisis we are facing but it will allow us to start solving it.  Cork City Council has 5,381 families and individuals on its housing waiting list and a further 2,737 families and individuals on the housing assistance payment or rent supplement schemes.  This means that in Cork city alone, there are 8,000 families and individuals who are looking for social housing.  That number does not include the thousands of people who earn too much to qualify for social housing but not enough to get a mortgage.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is putting forward a solution for tens of thousands of individuals and families nationally.  We are seeing three generations living in the one household because people cannot afford the ridiculous rents landlords are demanding.  People have a choice either to stay at home with their parents to try to put a deposit together.  The Minister referred to the Boherboy Road housing scheme in Cork.  I was the councillor in Cork City Council who proposed that motion.  I thank the council's housing department, which, with no Government plan or strategy, went away and developed its own affordable housing scheme.  Local authorities are having to step in where the Government is not stepping up.  In 2019, only 68 Rebuilding Ireland housing loans were approved in Cork.  I was in touch with a young woman who was approved last week and I take the opportunity to thank the council officials who helped her.  It took a year and a half to get that home loan over the line.  The reason it took so long is the bureaucracy and red tape that Fine Gael has put into the system, backed by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  People are looking for hope and for the Government to listen to them.  This motion lets people know we are listening to them, we care about their needs and their problems and we are trying to do something about them.  It is time to stop making promises and start building houses.  We need to offer people hope.  What is proposed in this motion will not fix everything but, for tens of thousands of people, it will be a start towards giving them an opportunity to own their own home.  We can leave here tonight saying that we have delivered affordable housing for people.  Would that not be a great thing?</p></speech>

As somebody from a large family who grew up in Army married quarters and subsequently in local authority housing, I really appreciate the start my family and I were given in life by being able to access affordable housing.  It is an issue I certainly will take seriously.</p> <p>The Government is keenly aware of the housing affordability challenges facing people across Ireland.  It is only by taking measures all aspects of our housing system, including housing for purchase or rent and whether delivered privately or publicly, that we can begin to improve affordability for citizens across the board.  This is what we wish to achieve.  The measures and commitments detailed in the programme for Government seek to address these concerns.  They represent the start of our ambition in delivering for citizens on this most important of policy areas.  Specifically on affordability, this includes actions to deliver homes for purchase under the affordable purchase scheme at prices that are significantly discounted compared with open market values.  It also includes a new form of tenure in cost rental which will deliver housing options at significantly below market rates.  It also includes the delivery of at least 50,000 social homes.</p> <p> In doing this, we will ensure that local authorities are central to the delivery of housing.  We will task the LDA with driving strategic land assembly to ensure that the sustainable development of new and regenerated communities is well served by central services.  It will be tasked to work with Departments, local authorities, State agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and to ensure there is sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.  We will also work with the private sector to ensure that an appropriate mix of type of housing is provided nationally.</p> <p> I believe there is a shared recognition that there is no single or simple solution to the challenges facing our housing system.  In addressing these challenges, we will demand that the objectives for the delivery of affordable housing be ambitious and achievable.  I am happy to confirm that a range of schemes and policy measures will be used to assist in the delivery of affordable homes as set out in the programme for Government.  These include the extension of the serviced sites fund, SSF, which will assist local authorities in the delivery of affordable homes for purchase and rent.  The SSF is currently being used to progress planning for some 3,200 affordable homes.  Local authorities have estimated that the fund will support them in making these homes available at discounts of between 10% and 40% on market value.  The SSF is assisting schemes such as that at Boherboy, Co. Cork, where 116 affordable homes are due for completion early next year.  These represent the first of many new affordable homes for purchase that will receive assistance from this programme.  The SSF is also supporting a cost-rental pilot development on Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is due for completion next year.  Delivery is starting.  Collectively, we have far more work to do, and we will do it.  </p> <p> Utilising State funds such as the SSF and LIHAF to contribute to the cost of delivering shared services infrastructure and utilities can make a real difference in reducing the ultimate cost of these homes for purchasers or the monthly rent paid by tenants in cost rental.  The &euro;310 million SSF is an important policy tool in helping us to deliver on our ambitions and we intend to expand its application as a priority.  </p> <p> Another important way in which we will be encouraging the development of more affordable homes is through the expansion of Part V provisions.  We will expand Part V to encompass affordable purchase and cost rental homes in addition to its current important role in providing social homes.  This commitment will not only add to the number of homes available in these areas, it will increase the available tenure options and assist in providing a good tenure mix within communities.  Other policies committed to in the programme for Government to assist in the delivery of affordable homes include the provision of seed capital to local authorities to provide serviced sites at cost in towns and villages to allow individuals and families to build their own homes, the continued availability of affordable loans through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, strengthening the mortgage to rent scheme in order to ensure it is helping those who need it and retaining and expanding the help-to-buy scheme for new priorities and self-builds.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, at which I am also a Minister of State, will progress the town centre living initiative and the town centre first policy which will deliver on unlocking the potential of our historic town centres, a point raised by Deputy Pringle with regard to Donegal.</p> <p> One of the Government's key priorities is the completion and roll-out of a new affordable purchase scheme.  By helping to lower the entry purchase price for households, the scheme will provide an equitable way of assisting people to afford their own home, while also building a sustainable and recyclable model that reflects the State's support for home owners.  The engagement of the Minister with key sectoral interests in the coming weeks and the short review of the existing provisions that he has instructed his officials to undertake will form an important part of this policy.  This will ensure that primary legislation remains fit for purpose and will inform new provision he considers necessary to reflect the priorities of the Government.  However, I must reiterate that in the context of the affordable purchase scheme, the Government will not support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, which proposes using income limits based on gross salary combined with counterproductive limits on the purchase price of affordable homes.  Rather, it will endeavour to accommodate each household's particular family needs and financial circumstances.  That is why we intend to assess eligibility based on the proportion of its net income a household would need to buy a house that would meet its housing needs on the open market.  Our scheme will take a more proportional and fair approach when it comes to these issues that have such a key impact on eligibility for prospective applicants than the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal.  The Minister will announce details of the new scheme in September and confirm the arrangements under which discounted homes will be sold to eligible purchasers by local authorities.</p> <p> In conjunction with our immediate aim of introducing an affordable purchase scheme, our long-term strategic aim is for the introduction of a cost rental sector.  This will begin to form a vital part of the housing sector in Ireland through the course of our term in office.  It is critical that this new aspect of the housing sector be developed on a firm policy footing in order to ensure that it is sustainable in the long term.  Pilot projects are in development on Enniskerry Road, Emmet Road in Kilmainham, and in Shanganagh in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  These projects will help to shape the policy development that is currently under way within my Department and through an external research project that has been commissioned on our behalf by the European Investment Bank.  Next year, the Enniskerry Road project will deliver two-bedroom homes for rent at &euro;1,200 per month in an area where market rates are at least &euro;2,000 for similar accommodation.  We hope to see this model widely replicated.  Cost rental has the capacity to be a sustainable means of providing secure rental accommodation to moderate income households.  Utilising the development of public housing schemes and situated between social housing and the private rental market, it will form an entirely new aspect of the rental sector.</p> <p> Cost rental will complement the range of other actions that will be taken by the Government to improve the entire rental sector over the longer term.  In the private rental market, these measures include the regulation of short-term lettings, the reform of the fair deal scheme and the further empowerment of the Residential Tenancies Board to deliver a range of actions in order to improve the operation of the sector.  We also aim to reform elements of the social housing sector and empower local authorities and AHBs to assist in delivering an additional 50,000 social housing homes over the lifetime of the Government.</p> <p> We believe that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price and in sustainable communities.  We understand that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically, and believe that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring the best use is made of existing stock.  The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and I are very much aware of the breadth of the task facing us in this area.  I am proud to take on this challenge.  The Government will put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  I am confident that the extensive range of commitments in the programme for Government will prove an excellent starting point for our collective ambition to make housing more affordable for many people across Ireland.  As such, I urge Deputies to support our amendment.</p></speech>

Housing was the number one issue on most doorsteps during the general election campaign in February.  For more than a decade, workers and young families have been let down by the failure to tackle housing affordability and the rental crisis.  They have been caught up in a never-ending cycle of being unable to afford a deposit because of the cost of renting.  Government support for the motion would signal its intent to rectify the issues of housing affordability and spiralling rents and show that Fianna F&aacute;il will stand by the promises it made during the general election campaign.</p>  <p>  The current average rent in Dublin is &euro;2,000 and the average house price is an eye-watering &euro;380,000.  People in my constituency of Dublin Bay North cannot afford houses at that price level.  We have a locked-out generation of young people who will never be able to afford a home of their own if housing policies do not change.</p> <p>There are hard-working families earning too much to qualify for social housing who cannot qualify for a mortgage to buy their own home, while we have sites such as the Lawrence Lands on the Oscar Traynor Road, which was earmarked for 640 units, remaining untouched since this was granted in 2015.  This is not good enough.  We need the Ministers to invest substantially in public housing units for the sake of young families and those young people who are locked out.  We need the Ministers to commit to an agreed definition of affordability and then deliver those affordable homes under that definition.  They need to deliver them fast.</p></speech>

Housing was one of the biggest issues of February's general election.  People who I met on the campaign told me they were put to the pin of their collar and mentally stressed.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il were in power for the last four years and have failed to deliver affordable homes to rent or buy in my constituency of Cork East.  As of today, there were just 333 properties to rent in County Cork.  In my home town of Midleton, a two-bedroom apartment will set one back by &euro;1,150 a month.  A three-bedroom house in Ballymacoda will set one back by &euro;1,730 a month.  A two-bedroom house in Watergrasshill will set one back by &euro;900 a month.  In Cobh, a one-bedroom apartment is &euro;840 a month.  How do people survive with this?</p>  <p>  Working families cannot afford to pay their rent and survive.  People with disabilities are like somebody who is forgotten.  What is the chance of anybody on &euro;208 a week renting anything?  They have no hope.  This is why I call on the House to support this motion.  The motion says to build public housing developments on public land, led by local authorities, to deliver affordable homes, affordable cost rental homes, and to use long-term low interest borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and our credit unions.  No one should have to live to work.  We should be able to work to live.  The Government must undertake one of the largest ever housing building programmes in the State and this will be the only way to deliver what is needed.  I ask the House to support Sinn F&eacute;in's motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="22:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700057#LLL00300"><p>If I was concerned about the new Government and new Minister before tonight's speech, I am even more concerned having listened to his words.  Nothing in the speech from the Minister or the Minister of State would not have been said by Deputy Eoghan Murphy in this Chamber only a matter of weeks ago.  The former Minister may not be here in person but his spirit is very much alive and well on the Government's benches.</p>  <p>  Let us unpick some of the claims.  The serviced sites fund is a good fund but it is not being used properly.  Homes in O'Devaney Gardens, with &euro;50,000 per unit from the serviced sites fund, will cost a first-time buyer &euro;360,000.  Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is cost rental, has &euro;80,000 per unit from the serviced sites fund, and the rents will be &euro;1,200 per month.  Neither are affordable to the working families who we all represent.  In County Cork, the Minister is not including the cost of the equity stake of the State which the home buyer will have to pay back.  When one adds that on to the full price, it goes from &euro;248,000 to &euro;273,000 if the full &euro;50,000 serviced site fund is allocated.  Again, that is not affordable.  If one takes the same shared equity model in Part V, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, knows that I support the increase of Part V, these will not be genuinely affordable to hard-working families.  I am even more concerned by what I hear from some industry lobbyists, that they want a private sector shared equity proposition, which would be even more bizarre.</p>  <p>  The most remarkable thing that we have heard this evening is the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, arguing against limits on price, because that is exactly what was in the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto.  It referred to &euro;250,000 or less, a clear limit on price.  Today, we have the first Fianna F&aacute;il U-turn on its election manifesto commitments.  In fact, limits on price are the only way to guarantee genuine affordability.  If the Minister had done his homework and read the circular that I sent him five weeks ago, he would have seen that the Sinn F&eacute;in model mixes limits on price and affordability based on net income.  It is the very centre of our proposition.  I was glad to hear the Minister say on the radio today that he will review the income limits set by Fine Gael of &euro;75,000 and &euro;50,000.  If he had read the details of our proposal, it includes exactly the same proposition published five weeks ago, and we will happily work with him on that.</p>  <p>  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, has been an abject failure.  It was meant to deliver 20,000 homes, including a large number of affordable homes, by 2019, and it has done none of that.  The Minister may come to the launch of my detailed analysis of LIHAF later this week.  I will send him an invitation.  We are calling for that scheme to be scrapped.  It has not done any of the things that it was meant to do and it is a waste of taxpayers' money.  The biggest problem is that we are not hearing anything new about the Land Development Agency, LDA.  We will not have the answers to the questions I will ask until the legislation is published but, for example, will the LDA still be a commercial designated activity company?  Will it develop unaffordable, open market price homes on public land?  What percentage will be social?  What percentage will be affordable?  What will the price of those units be?  If one looks at Shanganagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, neither the rental nor the purchase units will be affordable to working families.  Will all of its activities be subject to freedom of information?  Not just some, but all, including its commercial activities.  Will it have comprehensive compulsory purchase order powers, because the programme for Government is silent on all of that?</p>  <p>  I was delighted that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, true to form, mentioned his famous 2018 affordable housing motion, a motion so bland that I cannot even remember if it contained any commitments.  If the Minister tabled it again tomorrow, I would vote against it.  What the Minister failed to tell the House is that we tabled a motion with seven specific additions and he voted against every single one.  He voted against increasing capital investment in public housing, increasing the Part V commitment, giving local authorities more staff to deliver social and affordable homes, and also against amending Home Building Finance Ireland to deliver genuinely affordable homes for working people.  He voted against credit unions lending for affordable housing, which is absent from the programme for Government.  He voted against the redesignation of approved housing bodies and against ensuring the local infrastructure housing activation fund was used for affordable housing.  They were in the amendment that we tabled and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voted against them.  That tells us that the Minister is all talk.  Where is his plan?  When we see his plan, we will judge it, and when he starts to implement it, we will judge it by delivery.</p>  <p>  On the basis of what we have seen today, this is the same Fianna F&aacute;il speaking out of both sides of its mouth.  It supported Fine Gael for four years while criticising it.  The Minister now says he will do something different while implementing exactly the same housing policy as his predecessors.  That is why his opposition to our motion tonight shows, just as it was before, that nothing has changed and that this crisis will unfortunately get worse.</p></speech>

Parents will have received a response from the Minister's private secretary regarding queries today.  I want to highlight a number of points there.  The response states that the only way Firhouse Educate Together secondary school can stay in the accommodation in Gaelscoil na Gi&uacute;ise is if An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta and the board of management of that Gaelscoil allows this.  That clearly is an opening.

It will not work for the students who currently walk to school and their parents drive somewhere else to work and so on.  It might not work for some of the staff who currently work there at a time of real pressure for teaching staff, special needs assistants, SNAs, etc.</p><p>I wish to read a short message from one of the many people have sent me.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	I chose Firhouse Educate Together as a secondary school for my son as the ethos of the school is very much in synch with the values I wish to install in my children... [U]nfortunately if this school moves to Citywest from its current location in Firhouse, I will be forced to make the decision to enrol my son, who has learning disabilities, to a school which is closer to our home. </blockquote>  <p>That is the case for very many families there.  That is why they are saying, &quot;Save our school.&quot;  Will the Minister agree to meet representatives of the campaign and do everything she can to help? </p></speech>

The way this goes is that we will ask her questions and she will read from a script.  All the Deputies in the constituency are concerned about the move.  There was no real consultation with the school itself.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on that, and I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</p>  <p>  Roughly 40% of the students have special needs and the school is unique in that sense.  The idea of moving the school from Firhouse to another location 10 km down the road may not sound like an awful lot.  However, with traffic in the morning, it can take from an hour to an hour and a half depending on where people live.  All the parents do not come from Firhouse.  There are bottlenecks on certain roads and so on.  There are major difficulties in that regard.</p>  <p>  It is the first challenge for the Minister, and I would like to invite her to come to the constituency to look at this school and where these vulnerable children are going to be asked to move to.</p></speech>

Firhouse Educate Together secondary school opened in September 2018 in vacant classrooms in the permanent school building of Firhouse Educate Together primary school on an education campus shared with the permanent 16-classroom school for Gaelscoil na Gi&uacute;ise.  In September 2019, the Department put in place arrangements with Gaelscoil na Gi&uacute;ise and its patron body, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, to use some vacant classrooms in the Gaelscoil for Firhouse ETSS.  The Gaelscoil and its patron body, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, has informed the Department that, due to additional accommodation requirements in the Gaelscoil, it is not possible for the secondary school to continue to operate in that building for the coming school year.</p>  <p>  The Department is in regular communication with the school's patron body, Educate Together, on this and other accommodation matters, and the patron body keeps its school communities updated on an ongoing basis on such matters.  In December 2019, having considered various proposals by Educate Together in the local area which were deemed either unsuitable or unavailable, the Department advised the patron body of the proposed accommodation at the Citywest education campus.  The proposed building at Citywest is State owned and within the Department's control.  It has provided high-quality, fully serviced, permanently constructed accommodation for two other primary schools up until last September.  There are currently more than 30 permanent classrooms, full staff facilities, ancillary rooms and an external play area available for occupation before the start of the 2020 school year.  The accommodation will also serve two new schools opening in the Citywest area this September.</p>  <p>  While this accommodation is in the school catchment area adjacent to the Firhouse-Oldbawn catchment area, it offers the possibility of ready-made permanent and cost-effective accommodation on an interim basis for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school.  The Department offered the school's management and patron body an opportunity to view the accommodation in December last and remains committed to working with and supporting the school to minimise insofar as possible any impact this temporary move may have.</p>  <p>  The Department has informed the school that appropriate transport will be facilitated from Firhouse to the interim accommodation at Citywest while the school is in Citywest.  In December, the Department authorised Educate Together to explore the possibility of providing temporary accommodation on a site in Stocking Lane in Firhouse.  A proposal submitted to the Department in April was priced at an estimated &euro;3.6 million and requires a planning application with all the time and risk that entails.  However, it was never a realistic proposition that such accommodation would be available in time for the start of the coming school year.</p>  <p>  In April 2020, the Department completed the acquisition of the permanent site for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school at Ballycullen Green, Oldcourt Road, Dublin 24 and is currently progressing the project for the permanent accommodation as part of its fast-track design-and-build programme.  The first key step in this process has been reached with the acquisition of the site.  The next key step is securing planning permission.  Once planning permission is secured this will open up the possibility of providing temporary accommodation on this site at the earliest opportunity.  However, it will not be possible to have this accommodation in place for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The facility in Citywest currently offers the greatest level of certainty with regard to the provision of ready-to-occupy, high-quality accommodation for Firhouse Educate Together secondary school on an interim basis for the 2020-21 school year, pending its return to Firhouse when suitable accommodation becomes available there.</p>  <p>  With regard to the possibility of Firhouse Educate Together secondary school staying in the accommodation in Gaelscoil na Gi&uacute;ise, the Department remains in ongoing communication with the patron bodies concerned regarding all options.  I thank the Deputies for raising the matter.</p></speech>

The Minister is a proud Kerrywoman.  We had a brief chat beforehand, for which I am grateful.  The move from Firhouse to Citywest is equivalent to moving a school and asking its children to move from Tralee to Listowel with Dublin city-style traffic.</p>  <p>For me, at the moment, and without wanting to put the Gaelscoil in any position, that is the solution.  If the Department was looking at a solution on Stocking Lane with a budget of &euro;3.5 million, a fraction of that money could be used on the existing site to provide additional temporary facilities for the school.  Like my colleagues, I invite the Minister to meet representatives of the school.  Each of the Deputies who have raised this matter is willing to meet the patron body of the Gaelscoileanna if that would assist and if the Minister could facilitate that.  We ask also the Minister to meet representatives of the school in Citywest.  Could we meet the Minister about the matter at some stage in the future because, in six weeks' time, these students will be expected to go back to school?  The Minister should be sincerely assured that the move to Citywest will kill this school.</p></speech>

This plan will not be acceptable.  The Minister is facing a formidable campaign of opposition that has collected more than 2,000 signatures.  The campaign has community support and there was a large online public meeting on the issue last week.  I do not think the Department can just wash its hands of this and say that the choice is up to the patron bodies.  The Department must intervene and find a solution.  I appeal to the Minister to agree to meet with the board of management and the campaign.</p></speech>

That is the big difficulty and challenge.  The school's representatives are saying to us that it is not viable for the school in the long term to put parents into that situation.  Those parents are going to move their children out of the school and that will put pressure on other schools in the area.</p>  <p>  Logically, if one looks at the distances involved on a map, it does not look that far but the reality is that it will mean a lot for parents.  There are pressures on people.  We are supposed to be climate friendly and so on.  This plan means extra distance and pressure.  Additional resources are going to have to be put in place by the families affected.  </p>  <p>  I am concerned about the vulnerable children.  We need to look at other alternatives.  The Stocking Lane alternative would be the best choice but that seems to have been ruled out by the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to come and look at conditions on the ground because she will come to the same conclusions that we have.</p></speech>

I appreciate there is unanimity among the Deputies from the area on this issue.  The Deputies have raised points from the perspectives of parents and children and I have heard what they have said.

The summer provision programme for 2020 is hugely important because it assists, in particular, children who have profound learning difficulties, such as autism and so on.  I welcome the fact 5,000 more children will participate in summer provision this year than did last year.  The Minister knows children with disabilities have been profoundly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and those children and their families have had a difficult time as a result.</p>  <p>  St. Mary's special school in Drumcar, County Louth, is wonderful.  I am aware of an eight year old child who goes to that school.  A bus goes to that school during normal school times.  The family of the child was delighted to hear that summer provision would apply to the school but the problem is there is no public bus or bus provided by the school for summer provision.  The family is being asked to pay &euro;35 each way for the child to get a taxi to the school.</p>  <p>  I am not blaming anybody and people are very happy that summer provision is happening.  A small number of families do not have the money and cannot afford to pay &euro;35 in taxi fares.  The problem is that, given their financial position, the family cannot beg or borrow that money.  I accept that home provision is available but it is not suitable or possible for this family unit.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to look again at the regulations for the small number of families who want their child to attend the special school they are used to attending.  The school in question is approximately 15 miles away from the family home and there is no way the family can pay taxi fares or afford to go into debt to do so.  It is not possible for the family to pay &euro;70 and they cannot borrow that amount.</p>  <p>  I will be happy to hear the Minister say in reply that she will consider the issue.  I would say a very small number of families are affected but it would assist them and give them great happiness if their child was able to participate, for the first time in months, with the other children whom they were with pre-Covid-19.  The child in question is profoundly disadvantaged, non-verbal and autistic.  It would be a considerable boon to the family if he could attend at summer provision.</p></speech>

Before I address the specific issue, I would like to provide the Members of the House with an outline on the extent of the school transport service.</p>  <p>  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the 2019-2020 school year, more than 120,000 children, including 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million km at a cost of more than &euro;219 million in 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from the school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  With regard to transport for the summer provision programme 2020, given the exceptional circumstances in planning for delivery of the programme and the shorter than normal timeframe in which to plan the school transport services, in addition to the expansion of the programme and coupled with the social distancing requirements as per health advice, the Department, unfortunately, was not in a position to provide school transport for the programme this year.  However, my Department will provide grant funding to support families with the cost of transport arrangements for those children who are eligible for school transport and have been approved to participate in the summer programme.</p>  <p>  The grant payment is based on the distance that a family resides from their child's school of attendance.  The calculation is based on four trips per day - home to school and school to home, morning and afternoon - multiplied by the number of days a child attends school for that programme.  The current rate of grant is 39.12 cent per km for the first 6,437 km travelled and 21.22 cent per km for each km travelled thereafter.</p>  <p>  Families who are already in receipt of the special transport grant for children with special educational needs will be paid as normal following completion of the summer provision programme 2020.  Families who currently avail of a transport service will be contacted by the school transport section following the completion of the summer provision programme 2020 in regard to the arrangements for payment.</p>  <p>  Families who are not in a position to make their own transport arrangements in order to avail of a school-based programme have the option of contacting the special education section of my Department with a view perhaps to inquiring about the home-based programme.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, affording me the opportunity to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme and to respond to the issue raised.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the intent of what the Minister has said but I reject its content.  I do not find that acceptable and I want to stress that these are children with exceptional needs, as I know the Minister acknowledges.  There is no way the family in question can pay the bill and recoup the funding.  I absolutely acknowledge that the scheme is there but this family cannot get &euro;1,500 to pay for it.  Home provision is not suitable to this family unit and there are reasons for that.  This child will be left in a difficult and unacceptable situation.</p>  <p>  I know the community welfare office service is available but one does not want to reduce people to going to a community welfare officer and putting out their hands to beg for something to which they are entitled.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter again.</p>  <p>  I do not know how many similar applications the Department has received or how many people are affected.</p> <p>I have three constituents who attend schools in Louth who are affected by this.  I ask the Minister to look again at it and see if there is some way of looking after them.  It is unacceptable to them and to me that the Department cannot find a way in these exceptional circumstances where there is no public bus.  They have no way of getting there without the taxi and they cannot pay for it.</p></speech>

Particularly with a Ministry such as Health, his success will be the success of the entire nation in keeping us all healthy.  We do not need a reminder of how important our health service is or how well it has performed under the most difficult circumstances over the past months due to this awful pandemic.  However, I remain deeply concerned about the provision, distribution and use of face coverings and face masks.  I said it at the start of June when the previous Minister and the Government put a bit of energy behind the education on the use of face masks.  It seemed that we might get something going and that the Government might really put its full force behind it, but that has not occurred.  We were behind the curve then and we are even further behind now in July.  I cannot find accurate figures for our face covering usage but Italy has nearly 84% face covering and Spain, where local authorities have been involved in the distribution and provision of face coverings for free, has around 64% or 65%.  We are nowhere near that.  I am concerned.  Our transport workers are concerned.  The National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, has stated that its drivers are very worried that they are having people get on their bus at a time when the use of face masks is supposed to be mandatory but they do not have the means to enforce it.  We are putting our transport workers on almost the same front line as our health workers.  Our health workers are petrified and are calling my office and emailing me to say they are worried that not enough people are wearing face masks.  This worry is gathering momentum and gathering steam.  My big concern as we enter the autumn and winter months is that we may have a second wave or, more likely, super spreader events.  They are likely to occur in shared transport, congregated settings, workplaces, pubs and clubs.  That is where we need to get the message out.  </p>  <p>  The responsibility is on the Government and the Minister.  Will the Minister commit the Government to a widespread distribution of face coverings to transport hubs, secondary schools, universities, congregated settings, workplaces and even to homes if necessary?  Are there any plans for improved education initiatives along this line?  I have received representations from eminent scientists and well respected television broadcasters who want to work with the Department of Health, and I have made representations to the Department, to put together educational television programmes.  We may have had segments on current affairs shows but we have not had proper scientifically based programming to really hammer home how important it is for people to wear coverings to keep themselves, their families, vulnerable people and immunosuppressed people safe.  The focus has been on getting the economy back up and running but there are people who are too scared to engage in their local economy, to go to a local restaurant or shop.  Ireland will never get back on track until everyone feels confident enough to be able to engage in society and the economy and a big part of that, as well as the hand-washing, cough etiquette and physical distancing, is the use of face coverings.  We are nowhere near where we need to be.  Personal responsibility plays a big part but the Government needs to lead and the Minister is not leading at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="22:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700060#OOO00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words at the start.  I really do hope we will all work together; it does not mean we always have to agree.  Sorting out the healthcare system and making sure we get that care is something we all agree on.  I am sure we will disagree on some of the hows and whens and so forth.  I broadly agree with what the Deputy is saying.  Like him, we listen to the doctors and the people who really know what they are talking about and they are saying, "face masks, face masks, face masks".  They absolutely are.  I want to agree with the broad sentiment as we all do in getting that message out.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, provided guidance on face coverings in its advice to Government on the roadmap for reopening business and society.  I am just going to go through it here.  The NPHET advice sets out circumstances under which wearing of a non-medical face mask, which I think we are both talking about, is recommended.  These include using busy public transport and we have regulations coming forward very shortly to put that on a statutory basis.  I share the Deputy's concern that it has to be mandatory.  There has been incredible compliance across the country.  Look at how many people today have downloaded the tracker app.  There is incredible buy-in.  When we have a clear message and strong leadership, I think we will see the solidarity.  We are putting public transport on a statutory footing for exactly the issues the Deputy has raised.  Other circumstances set out by NPHET are when in indoor public areas such as retail, places of worship, cinemas and so forth; when visiting the homes of those who are cocooning; by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning; all visitors to residential care facilities; and indoor work environments where it is difficult to maintain a 2 m distance.  That is something we can do here and probably on a night like tonight could have done without the restricted seating in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure.  It does not take the place of all of the other things that have to be done as well such as respiratory etiquette, washing our hands and so forth.  They need to be worn properly in line with guidance.  We have to wash our hands before putting them on and taking them off.  The current NPHET recommendation is that the focus should be on increasing compliance, which is exactly what we are talking about, within the current recommendations for use.  On 15 June, as the Deputy mentioned, my predecessor, Deputy Harris, along with the then T&aacute;naiste and the National Transport Authority, NTA, launched a national communications campaign which outlines best practice for using the masks.  The campaign is communicating on who should wear the masks in what settings and how to wear and remove the face coverings correctly.</p>  <p> In response to the Deputy's point on the Government distributing face masks, at present we do not have a plan to distribute face masks for a variety of what I think are quite sensible reasons.  It is something we can keep under review.  I think the Deputy nailed the issue in his opening statement.  It is about compliance and about saying that on public transport it is the law and has to be done, so that one cannot by law take public transport without it.  We have to get the message home on compliance.  I am certainly open to considering if we need another push and if there are other ways.  I am very much looking at where it is and is not working so there may be some very targeted communications in that respect.  The face coverings are readily available in a lot of different places such as retail outlets, supermarkets, convenience stores, petrol stations and pharmacies.  We can get them online.  There is guidance on how to make them on the HSE website.  I welcome the increasing trend in the numbers reporting they are wearing the coverings.  According to the public opinion tracking research, it is currently 45% so maybe that provides a benchmark.</p></speech>

I imagine the schools will be back in some fashion, although that is a whole other debate.  Society will feel like it is moving even further towards reopening and we may feel further away psychologically from the pandemic.  I want to continue to hammer home the need for the Government to be ten steps ahead of where society is as we head into the winter.  We are going to have a re-emergence of seasonal 'flu; we always do and it always puts massive pressure on our health system.  If Covid comes back it will double or treble that pressure.  I do not want to have to wear a face mask on public transport or in congregated settings for the rest of my life.</p> <p>However we need to get through this winter season.  Maybe in the future we will need a traffic light system where if flu levels or Covid levels reach a particular level in our acute hospitals, the public are warned that it is amber or red and people should wear their masks on public transport, etc.  Perhaps that is where we will go in the future, but in winter 2020-21 we need to protect our transport workers.  We need to protect all our workers.  There are workers in shops who have been told by their bosses not to wear masks.  That is happening and it should not.  They are sitting ducks during their eight-hour shifts because anyone can walk in with or without a mask.  They need to be protected and we need to hammer the message home to employers that if they want increased footfall in their stores they need to look after their workers and protect them.  All this will help to protect society and prevent our front-line health workers from having to go through what they have been through in the last months again.</p></speech>

According to our public opinion tracking research, the level is now 45%.  I imagine that is variable.  It is probably variable by public transport compared with retail, or by types of retail or different workplaces and different parts of the country.  It will be interesting to see whether there are some areas where there is a lot of compliance.  The solidarity and uptake in the measures has been extraordinary.  We have got the virus in Ireland down to a really low level, one of the lowest in Europe.  That is down to great leadership from people such as Dr. Holohan and some extraordinary work from front-line workers, officials in the Department and the HSE, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and people further afield, such as the people keeping the shops open and keeping us all fed.  There is a lot of buy-in.  We all understand how awful it will be if there is a big resurgence and we have to put more restrictions in place.  The tracker app will help.  The recommendation not to engage in foreign travel - and where such travel happens, to travel to green-list countries only - will help.  I think there will be a lot of buy-in and there has been a lot of buy-in.  There was a lot of reporting about serious infringements of social distancing in Dublin city but the vast majority of the country was compliant.  The same will apply around face masks.  I am very open to taking another look at whether it is necessary to push further.  We will keep under review whether it needs a statutory basis for things other than public transport which we have gone with.  If the Deputy wishes to sit down with me or the officials, or send in ideas for what he would like to see, I ask him to do so.  I would be happy to engage with him on it.  I agree that we have to get the message out there that face coverings are one important part of our arsenal in fighting this awful disease.</p></speech>

I mean that.  As others have said, many people are really depending on him and the system needs all the support it can get.  I thank the Minister for coming here to answer questions on the extremely important issue of the Kilbrew nursing home and the care of Ultan Meehan.  His family want this issue raised at the very highest level.  There has been extensive media coverage of this case in recent days but it is important that we remember there is a family at the centre which has lost a son and a husband.  Our thoughts are with Mary Bartley Meehan and the wide circle of family and friends of her late and beloved husband, Ultan Meehan, and her late and beloved son, Adrian Bartley.</p>  <p>  I was shocked and appalled when the details of Ultan Meehan's case came to my attention.  Many but not all of the details are now in the public domain.  Anyone who has read or heard them will be shocked and appalled.  In early June, I contacted the HSE, HIQA and the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on the case.  I spoke with officials in HIQA who advised me that an on-site inspection was being conducted on 4 June.  This was a planned inspection.  I was advised that I would receive a copy of the report in due course.  I await that report.  The HSE responded to say that it has no governance or oversight over private nursing homes as they are private organisations.  The then Minister responded on 9 June to outline the legislative and regulatory framework and to acknowledge that HIQA has no legal role in examining individual complaints but takes a risk-based approach to regulation.  He confirmed that he had requested the HSE to follow up directly with the nursing home in question and asked that the Department of Health be apprised of the situation and any actions taken.  That report was to be shared with me but I have not yet received it.</p>  <p>  This case raises several issues.  It raises very serious questions around the care provided to Mr. Meehan at Kilbrew nursing home.  It raises immediate questions about the care provided to other residents, past and present, in that setting.  My clear understanding is that there is more information to come to light.  It raises serious questions about the wider issue of regulation and oversight of private nursing homes.  It will come as a shock to many people that the HSE has no role in the oversight of private nursing homes while HIQA cannot examine individual complaints, even those of an extreme nature.</p>  <p>  I have specific questions and would appreciate specific answers.  When was the Department of Health or the HSE first notified of concerns at Kilbrew nursing home or relating to the care of Mr. Meehan, and by whom?  We understand that nursing homes around the country were under great pressure and crying out for help during Covid-19.  Was that the case with Kilbrew?  Has the Minister or his Department received the aforementioned reports from HIQA and the HSE?  If so, what did they say about the situation in Kilbrew nursing home and any actions taken?  How does the Minister propose to proceed?  Will he commit tonight to a full independent rapid review of the clinical care provided to Ultan Meehan and related issues at Kilbrew nursing home?  This should be done immediately and that is the wish of the family.  It should be headed by a doctor, a consultant specialist in the area of medicine for the elderly.  Will the Minister commit to that tonight?</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised this issue and continues to do so, and is advocating strongly on it.  It may be useful if I read out the official position which sets out the statutory framework on what is happening.  Before I do so, I will answer the Deputy's questions directly.  I took down three, but I think there were more.  On when the Department was told of the issues, I will find out for the Deputy.  This question was not included in his original Topical Issue.  I do not know the answer but I will find it and revert to the Deputy.  On whether we have a report, none has yet been submitted to my Department.  We will examine it as soon as it arrives.  On whether we will commit to a full independent review of the care, that is not where we are at right now.  Currently, HIQA and the HSE are investigating the issue and officials in my Department are liaising with them on it.  I believe that is what we must do now.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented challenges across our health service and none more than in older persons services.  The health and safety of residents in nursing homes has been paramount in all our minds in recent months.  The National Public Heath Emergency Team, NPHET, the HSE and HIQA have placed a focus on supporting older people from the outset of the pandemic.  Every person who is supported by older persons services is entitled to expect and receive support of the highest standard.  Quality care and patient safety is a priority and a continued focus and must always be delivered safely and to a high quality.  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible.  We have regulators, the HSE, the Department and the Oireachtas, but nursing home providers are responsible for the care they provide to their residents.  HIQA has been in place since 2009 as the statutory independent regulator for the nursing home sector, including HSE-managed and private nursing homes.  It was established under the Health Act 2007 and has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including the registration of a nursing home facility.</p> <p>This means that a nursing home cannot operate as a nursing home without such registration.  It has essentially graduated powers up to the point of shutting nursing homes down.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of the restriction regulation, care and welfare regulation, and the national quality standards.  HIQA, in discharging its duties, determines through the examination of all of the information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing home meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the regulations and the national quality standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.  In addition, the chief inspector has wide-ranging discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p> <p> During the Covid-19 pandemic, nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA, which, under the 2007 Act has the legal authority to examine the operation of any facility under its remit.  In addition, a series of enhanced measures have been agreed by NPHET for long-term residential care settings and these are being implemented at the moment.</p> <p> As for this particular nursing home, I can confirm that the Department has received correspondence, including from the Deputy, on this matter and has forwarded these details to HIQA as the statutory regulator for nursing homes and to the HSE for appropriate action and follow-up.  I also have asked my officials to engage with both HIQA and the HSE to follow up on this matter.</p></speech>

I return to the issue of the reports and planning as to where we go from here.  That is really important and I do not want to leave that point.  The family seeks an independent review of this case and this needs to remain on the table here, notwithstanding the fact that the HSE and HIQA are involved in this.  Can the Minister indicate what the HIQA and HSE timelines are?  A month has now passed.  Is the Minister satisfied that this is an isolated incident?  I do not believe that he can be confident that it is and this is the concern that people will have in this regard.  Can the Minister further outline what plans he has for the broader regulatory framework for our nursing homes?  This case highlights an anomaly, a loophole and a gap in the regulation and oversight.  While many legal experts are calling for robust and strong safeguarding legislation, I principally require some clarity on the timeline.  What timeline can we expect here and when will a report be available and published?  On that point, was the Kilbrew nursing home crying out for help?  Did it make repeated contact with the HSE or it is the case that this went below the radar?  I implore the Minister, in my final ten seconds, that as this is shocking stuff, it needs the full weight of his Ministry to see it resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-07-07a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="22:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020070700062#QQQ00300"><p>I thank the Deputy and I am with him in this regard.  I wish to acknowledge the pain and suffering of the Meehan family.  The situation and the case we all saw reported is heartbreaking and shocking.  I cannot begin to imagine what the Meehan family have been going through over the past few months.  We owe it to them and to every resident in every nursing home to ensure there is a consistently high quality of care and that when people see issues, they can raise a flag in the knowledge that those issues will be taken seriously and will be reacted to.</p>  <p>  The Deputy and Members will understand that I cannot go into too much detail here in public about any individual case, even though this case has been widely reported and I acknowledge the Deputy is speaking with the permission of the family involved.  </p>  <p>  I can stress that since the outset of the pandemic, HIQA has had in place a quality assessment process.  All of the designated centres and the children&rsquo;s residential centres are formally contacted on a regular basis by an inspector of social services to assess how they are coping, the welfare of the residents, any concerns they may have and any deficits identified in continuous high quality care.  HIQA, as the regulator, has also completed a risk assessment of all nursing homes.  It has not been able to inspect all nursing homes but it has completed the risk assessment.  On 6 April, it commenced focused Covid-19 infection prevention and control hub to provide nursing homes with the guidance and support they need.  </p>  <p>  In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s direct question as to timelines, I will find out that information for the Deputy.  As it was not part of the question, I do not have the information to hand but I will find out that information for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The other matter worth mentioning is that as the Deputy is aware, an expert group will report to me very shortly on the nursing homes.  It is looking at what happened across the system.  We all will be interested in what happened.  What I am most interested in for now is what learnings there will be to ensure that everybody in those nursing homes, both those who work in them and the residents, is safe and secure.  I will continue to work with the Deputy on this issue and will keep him up to date on how it is all going.</p></speech>
