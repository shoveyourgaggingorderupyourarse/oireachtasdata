We need to try to minimise the risks and maximise the opportunities.  Earlier this morning, I attended a meeting of CEOs to discuss how Irish companies can remain competitive in the face of Brexit but also in the light of other global challenges, including attitudes on taxation in the USA, challenges within Europe and so on.</p>  <p>  We have much to do.  We need to help firms to compete.  This is an issue across Government.  It is about access to finance.  In the budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced a &euro;300 million Brexit fund.  Last Monday, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, also announced, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, EIB, a new fund designed to make money available to Irish businesses.  That is very important.  We need to continue to help firms to innovate by increasing money for innovation.</p>  <p>  This morning, Enterprise Ireland launched another fund whereby, within three weeks, businesses can access up to &euro;150,000 to help them innovate.  That is really important.  We need to encourage and support firms to trade and diversify.  Obviously, all the work I have been doing on trade missions with IDA Ireland is doing that.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about state aid.  On 10 November I had an extremely positive and good meeting with Commissioner Vestager, who has responsibility for competition issues - including state aid - to discuss the unique challenge facing the country.  We agreed to set up a working group comprising officials from the state-aid section of her area and officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The group already met last Monday for the first time and will meet again in December.  The purpose of this important initiative is to discuss the supports and measures available to Irish firms and to look at new measures and supports that can be developed as the Brexit situation develops in order to ensure that there can be - and I stressed this to her - a very timely response to any issues that emerge for Irish business.  She agreed that timeliness in response will be critical.  It was an extremely positive meeting and the working group has already begun dealing with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300003#A00700"><p>The Minister mentioned the scheme announced by Enterprise Ireland this morning and the earlier budget announcement by the Minister for Finance.  By any yardstick, the state of preparedness of business for the onset of a hard Brexit is alarming.  AIB recently published a sentiment index for quarter 3 of this year which shows that only one in four Irish SMEs is properly prepared for a hard Brexit.</p><p>According to InterTradeIreland, 19 of the 20 SMEs it surveyed are also not prepared for it.  Similarly, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, and Deloitte, two major consultancy, auditing and accountancy firms, believe this is the case.  </p> <p> In regard to the working group on the revision of state aid rules to which the T&aacute;naiste referred, will it examine specific issues such as the &euro;200,000 limit, which is posing a huge barrier?  During a previous Question Time the T&aacute;naiste referred to a proposal to introduce a rescue and restructure scheme.  What are the criteria for that scheme and what will be available to business via that scheme?</p></speech>

All of the organisations in this area are doing a huge amount of work to ensure businesses are Brexit-ready.  I would encourage any company, particularly those dependent on the UK market, that has not completed the Brexit score card or linked in with the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to do so.</p>  <p>  On the rescue and restructure scheme, the Department filed for this scheme in August.  Once approved, this scheme will allow for equity supports of up to &euro;10 million to SMEs in severe financial distress as a consequence of Brexit.  While I do not expect there will be a need for the State to provide rescue or restructure aid to companies in the Brexit context, this may well be the situation and so we need to have a contingency measure in place.  We have made good progress with the Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  We are also putting in place another scheme which will make medium-term finance available for companies.  We are also developing a longer-term business development loan scheme.  A variety of schemes are being put in place in terms of access to finance, which will be a key issue for firms that need to diversify from the UK market and to develop products on the research and development side.  A number of different initiatives are available.  Last week, a new fund for small and medium businesses was announced by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in association with the European Investment Bank, EIB, which will also make tens of millions of euro available to Irish firms at a low interest rate.</p></speech>

The issue was discussed on a number of occasions during Leaders' Questions.  As confirmed to me by the T&aacute;naiste by way of response to a parliamentary question, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has commissioned two reports; Sectoral Implications Arising from Brexit: Most Exposed Sectors, and Strategic Implications Arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns.  The T&aacute;naiste also told me that these reports will not be published and that the cost of these reports is in the region of &euro;250,000, which is a significant amount of public funds.  Why will these reports not be put into the public domain?  Surely, the purpose of these reports is to aid business in their preparedness for Brexit.  Will the T&aacute;naiste publish these reports and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

I will share as much as possible of that information.  Information relevant to companies will be shared with them.  If there is information that is key to our negotiating strategy which it would be better not to publish at a particular point from a national interest point of view, that is the approach we will take.  Anything that can be published will be published.</p></speech>

In the past three years, this office has also surrendered almost &euro;5 million of its funding to the State.  The most senior Garda position in that office has been vacant since 2016.  The T&aacute;naiste recently outlined her plans to reform this office.  However, I do not want to know what is happening in regard to those plans but what has happened at this agency over the past number of years and why it was allowed to happen under Fine Gael's watch.</p></reply>

In that context, and in keeping with the ODCE strategy of seeking to allocate resources towards confronting indications of wrongdoing at the more serious end of the spectrum, the ODCE did not initiate any summary prosecutions over the past two years. </p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement cannot initiate prosecutions on indictment, rather only the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.  On foot of investigations undertaken by the ODCE, and the subsequent directing of charges on indictment by the DPP on 21 December 2016, a former director of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc entered a plea of guilty before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to one count of fraudulent trading contrary to section 297 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended; on 21 December 2016, a former director of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc entered a plea of guilty before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to one count of failing to maintain a register of certain transactions involving directors and others contrary to section 44 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended; and, on 27 July 2017, a person entered a plea of guilty before Limerick Circuit Criminal Court to one count of fraudulent trading contrary to section 297 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended.  The facts of this case are due to be heard, and sentence imposed, by the court on 21 December 2017.</p><p>Once the DPP directs charges on indictment, the matter moves into the realm of the courts.  The speed of progress thereafter is determined within that process.  I refer the Deputy to the ODCE annual report 2016 which points to a number of key successes during the year including, following the examination of reports submitted to the office by liquidators of insolvent companies, 90 company directors were restricted and 11 disqualified by the High Court;  </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>93 restriction undertakings were obtained from directors of insolvent companies; as an alternative to formal enforcement actions, cautions issued to a total of 61 companies; the securing of the rectification on a non-statutory basis of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014 in relation to directors&rsquo; loans in 60 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;17 million approximately; 108 directions were issued to relevant parties requiring them to comply with their statutory obligations under company law; the submission of five investigation files to the DPP for consideration, with recommendations including charges under both company law and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001; seven demands issued to companies for the production of their books, records and other relevant documents; and during the year, the register of disqualified, deemed disqualified and restricted persons, as maintained by the Registrar of Companies, was reviewed.  Arising from that review, a total of 83 instances were identified where persons appeared to be acting in contravention of court orders-legislative provisions.  Following intervention by the ODCE, the individuals&rsquo; positions were regularised.</p><p>In excess of 1,050 statutory reports and referrals were received from liquidators, auditors, examiners, professional bodies and other regulatory and enforcement authorities.  There were 130 internally generated inputs and almost 250 complaints received from members of the public.  To encourage compliance with company law, the ODCE issued in excess of 16,000 copies of its various publications during 2016.Over the past ten years the ODCE has referred files in respect of a number of investigations to the DPP, on foot of which the DPP has directed a total of 214 charges on indictment.</p><p>In terms of reform of the office, organisational reforms in the ODCE were commenced in 2012 by the current Director of Corporate Enforcement upon his appointment, to enhance the capability of the office to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law and to ensure a more efficient and effective use of its resources.  These include reorganising the structures of the office; and recruiting additional expertise, including six forensic accountants and a digital forensic specialist.  As senior level vacancies have arisen, reconfiguration of the skill sets, competencies, roles and responsibilities associated with those posts in order to better reflect the organisation's current needs. That exercise has resulted in the creation of two senior level professional posts of enforcement portfolio managers, with one of those posts having been filled and the filling of the other expected shortly.  Further recruitment is ongoing.  Other reforms include fundamentally amending the investigative procedures used by the office so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take the lead in all criminal investigations; and fostering a greater culture of risk management within the office.</p><p>In addition to these reforms the establishment, as announced by Government earlier this month, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a new independent company law enforcement agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  The package of measures to combat white collar crime sets out an ambitious timeframe for the establishment of the new independent company law enforcement agency.  It is expected that the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision will be published by the second quarter of 2018, with final publication of the Bill by the fourth quarter of 2018.  Work on the development of the legislative framework for the agency has already commenced.</p><p>My Department will engage with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to advise on international best practice in the establishment of the agency in terms of internal controls, staffing, budget and corporate governance.</p></speech>

Those questions have not been answered.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to me the ODCE annual report of 2016 wherein the key successes of the office are set out.  I have read that report and I do not understand why the T&aacute;naiste's predecessors took no action to fix what I believe is an agency that is not working properly.</p>  <p>  When did the T&aacute;naiste become aware that this office is barely functioning?  The most significant thing this office has done in the past 12 months is sabotage an extremely high profile banker's trial and, as result, let him walk away scot free.  It has been brought to my attention that the figures relating to the number of director disqualifications and restrictions quoted in a previous exchange on this topic between myself and the T&aacute;naiste were secured not by the ODCE, but as a result of work done by receivers, giving the impression that the office is functioning better than is the case.</p><p>I received a response from the T&aacute;naiste's Department at 8.20 a.m., almost a full month after I submitted the questions.  In October, the T&aacute;naiste stated, "Between 2012 and 2016, investigations by the ODCE have resulted in the restriction of 886 company directors."  The figures I received this morning show that between 2012 and 2016, the ODCE only made nine applications for restriction, approximately 1% of what the T&aacute;naiste claimed in October.  The figure the Minister gave to me in October is clearly wrong.  It seems to have become a regular occurrence this week.  Can she correct the record on that matter?</p></speech>

He need only look at the 2016 report - as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said to me, I do not have time to go into detail - as there is figure after figure.  In 2016 alone, 90 company directors were restricted and 11 were disqualified by the High Court, while 93 restriction undertakings were obtained from directors of insolvent companies.  A register of persons deemed disqualified and restricted, as maintained by the Companies Registration Office, was reviewed.  A total of 83 incidences were identified where persons appeared to be acting in contravention of court orders and in excess of 1,050 statutory reports and referrals were received from liquidators, auditors, professional bodies and so on.  A huge amount of work has been done by the ODCE.  The Government has worked to put together a stronger package and to enhance the powers of the ODCE.  We recognise there is further work to do in the area and that is why the announcement was made with regard to a range of initiatives that are being undertaken to make sure that the office is even stronger and is not an arm of the Department but will be an independent body led by commissioners, as are the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Revenue Commissioners.  We are moving to a much stronger-----</p></speech>

She told me in October that 886 company directors were sanctioned by investigations resulting from the ODCE, which is not correct.  I previously made my position clear that the way we deal with criminal law in Ireland depends on who one is, where one is from and what one is worth.  I received a response from the T&aacute;naiste's office yesterday stating that she cannot publish the report received from the ODCE under section 995 of the Companies Act about the failings in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial.  Why can the Minister not do this?  What legal barrier is stopping her from publishing this report?  I asked the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation to examine the agency as a matter of priority to find out what is going on and why the Government has allowed it to happen.  White-collar criminals in Ireland continue to live subject to different laws than everyone else.  Saying that the agency is not fit for purpose is an understatement and many more questions need to be asked and answered on this.</p></speech>

I have had both direct confirmation and written legal confirmation with regard to this.  Under the legislation, which has been carefully examined - since my approach would have been to publish this - it is not within the powers of the Minister to publish such a report.  I certainly want to place as many of Judge Aylmer's concerns in the public arena as I can.  That will involve getting transcripts and so on.  The Department is working on a report that it hopes to be able to publish before the end of the year.  The strong and clear legal advice was that, under the legislation, I did not have the power to publish this report.</p></speech>

This is clearly a cutting-edge issue for companies to deal with in the months ahead particularly in view, as the Deputy said earlier, of the Brexit challenge.  Despite intense competition, the trajectory of Ireland's competitiveness performance is positive.  Ireland moved from 16th to sixth place in 2017 in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.  The World Bank's most recent Doing Business 2018 report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of one place on last year.  We can see that we are competitive.  It can be seen in the strong employment growth across all sectors.  There is no room for complacency.  We need to continue to improve the environment for doing business in Ireland and remain vigilant to the very significant challenges in the external environment.</p>  <p>  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth continues, enterprises are resilient and the economy is internationally competitive.  A range of work is being done on FDI.  The continued focus of IDA Ireland is working with companies abroad that will invest here.  A strong pipeline of investment is due in Ireland.  All the companies I meet are extremely positive about the experience in Ireland, the diverse workforce they can attract and their experience of doing business here.  We often talk about red tape but companies are positive about it.  Enterprise Ireland's work is also important.</p>  <p>  I will shortly bring the National Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government.  I pay tribute to it for the work it does.  We recently held a meeting in Farmleigh House with the stakeholders.  It was clear that the companies are doing much work.  The chair of the National Competitiveness Council was very involved in that and continues to work closely with the Department and Irish businesses to maintain that competitive edge.</p></speech>

What are multinationals saying to the Minister when she goes on trade missions with regard to the challenges related to housing and our planning laws, for example?  We saw the recent Athenry data centre debacle, which has really left us in a state of uncertainty.  We know the Taoiseach got no joy from Tim Cook when he recently visited him in California.  What is the Minister doing about planning laws?  My party has published legislation relating to fast-tracking major IT infrastructural projects.  What is the Minister doing about the provision of housing?  I am sure multinationals raise policy decisions of Government with her.  What are these companies telling the Minister and the Government with regard to these barriers to setting up, such as in Athenry or in Dublin where we have a shortage of residential units, and elsewhere around the country?  What will the Minister do about it?</p></speech>

The job announcements in Drogheda, Limerick, Waterford and so on and recent weeks bear testament to that.  The universal feedback is positive about the experience companies have in Ireland and they wish to continue investing here.  They are interested in our situation post Brexit and I think there are opportunities.  Those that have businesses in the UK are concerned about the changes there.  In recent times, the focus on housing is clearly being raised by some companies, both with IDA Ireland and myself.  They have questions about what is going to happen and what the Government's plans are.  Business wants to be assured that issues are being dealt with.  The most important thing is for us to be clear with businesses that a plan is in place to provide greater housing and that there is also a national planning framework and capital investment programme.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I have been outlining to businesses that a plan is in place to deal with these issues.  Quite a number of the companies I have met, when I have checked whether their staff have experienced housing difficulties, even very recently, have said they have not and that they have been able to deal with the issue.  However, there is no doubt but that the issue needs to be addressed; otherwise, it will become a barrier.</p></speech>

We really need to hear from her whether this opportunity has now been lost.  Is the investment lost to the country and the State?  As I said to her, Mr. Cook rebuffed, or at least did not give any joy to, our Taoiseach when he visited him recently.  Where are we in this regard?  Is the State now unable to land such major, large-scale investments?  This is a huge worry and concern for the community of Athenry and the wider west coast of Ireland, so will the Minister comment in that regard?  Specifically what does she intend to do?  I have raised this at our committee.  I have asked for her and the IDA to come before the committee, where we will have more time and will not be constrained, as we are here, by time limits, to have a broader discussion, specifically about the delivery of projects such as the Apple project.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</p></speech>

That is why it has been a priority for the Taoiseach to meet Apple and discuss with its directors both here and in the USA the issues in this regard.  The whole country regrets the delays because delays are always of serious concern to business.  That is one of the reasons-----</p></speech>

I would not put it the way the Deputy has put it, that it is lost.  We must continue to work with Apple.  What is important is that we deal with infrastructure planning, as the Deputy rightly says, and data centres.  The Taoiseach and I brought a memo to Government in order that we could fast-track data centres.  This is very important because, as the Deputy knows, Apple put in for one part of a project which, I think, has eight parts to it all together, so it would be extremely helpful for the future decisions that Apple may make to get that legislation through.  I ask for the Deputy's co-operation in the House, which I am sure we will get, to have that legislation passed.  I would certainly like to see those jobs in Athenry, and we will continue to work with the company and will progress that legislation, which will also be helpful.  There is no indication that companies are moving away from taking decisions to invest in Ireland - quite the contrary.  Based on my experience and the IDA work in recent months, there is a strong interest and pipeline of investment in Ireland, thankfully, because, as the Deputy knows, tens of thousands of jobs rely on that sector.</p></speech>

At the centre of its strategy is the Build Scale, Expand Reach strategy for 2017-20.  It works in many different ways to help that employment development.  In 2016, for example, 5,352 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Tipperary, and in the same year Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Tipperary created 290 jobs.  This was a net gain of 189 when losses were taken into account.  Enterprise Ireland has approximately 120 clients in Tipperary and supported client companies in Tipperary with an investment of &euro;11.2 million in the period 2014-16.  I understand as well that in Thurles, I think, the local council is involved in a new enterprise park.  I do not have all the details of that but, again, whatever way the Government, Enterprise Ireland and local LEOs can work to support such development, we will facilitate that.  As I said, Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies in Tipperary through teams of sectoral focused development advisers using a company-led diagnostic approach, which is used to assess the client's needs.  Then they can tailor the package to support them.  This will continue.  Enterprise Ireland has co-funded with local enterprise development groups 157 community enterprise centres across the country, totalling &euro;64 million, and there is a community enterprise centre located in every county.  The agency has also provided &euro;2 million to support the role of 46 business development community enterprise centres.  These employ 6,000 people across 1,200 companies and are key hubs of enterprise activity in many areas.  In Tipperary, Enterprise Ireland has co-funded the establishment of six community enterprise centres.</p></speech>

Towns such as Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore, Cashel, Nenagh, Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir have been left behind.  They were once vibrant retail towns and they are now facing huge difficulties such as competition from suburban shopping centres, problems with parking and parking charges, the increased popularity of internet shopping, and high commercial rates and local charges, and then one must contend with the black economy.  As a result, there has been a reduction in footfall, stemming largely from decreased consumer spending, so we have many empty premises that are contributing to the ghost town effect of many towns right around the country.  We see padlocked gates, permanently shuttered shops, derelict sites - all of the physical and visible signs of the ongoing pain and unemployment happening across rural Ireland.  The 2010 census showed an unemployment rate of 15% in Tipperary, as against the national rate of 12% at that time.  We need initiatives to be taken to address this imbalance.</p></speech>

The best way to begin to have that recovery that we need, and which is happening, as he says, is to ensure a regional focus when we attract jobs from overseas while also supporting local businesses.  The kinds of projects I have described that the LEOs, for example, are supporting will be very important.  In the Deputy's own area, Tipperary LEO was involved in five projects from the &euro;5 million in funding under the competitive local enterprise office fund.  Interesting things are happening, such as the south east artist and foot initiative, the digital initiative that is under way and so on, that will lead to more employment and lead to those premises opening.  There is a pilot programme that will offer carefully selected micro-enterprises with growth ambitions the opportunity to benefit from concentrated supports and advice.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland ran an overseas Enterprise Ireland client itinerary visit to the Lisheen mines.  Again, this is all part of trying to develop enterprise in the area and make sure jobs are created.  We have the very important regional development fund of &euro;60 million, and I will shortly - I hope before the end of the year - announce the results of the first &euro;35 million of that investment.</p></speech>

Her Department is feeding into the national planning framework that is currently out there for public discussion.  The criteria and classification used in this plan mean that in Tipperary, for example, Clonmel is the only designated large town and, because of the criteria established, many towns are left out.  The reality is that the funds in the plan will follow the designated towns.  What will happen to the towns that are outside of the plan and left behind?</p><p>They will be at a huge disadvantage.  The Government has a policy of shifting the balance in favour of the regions, but we will never get people to invest in any rural town unless there are incentives for them.  This plan goes against Government policy in terms of directing investment towards regional geographical areas.  The Department needs to look at this closely in terms of the disadvantage in which it will place many rural towns.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of consultation.  It is a draft planning framework.  There is certainly no question of placing areas at a disadvantage.  I would say quite the opposite.  It is about combining capital investment and a proper regional planning framework.  The intention is to ensure we have balanced and inclusive development throughout the country.  The development of Dublin is part of this.  I imagine and expect that when we have this planning framework in place, we will see a more even spread of jobs and investment throughout the country.  I believe the areas the Deputy has spoken about will also benefit because there is a better regional approach to planning, investment and development.  It is bringing all of the different factors together, such as where there should be housing and where there can be development and investment.</p></speech>

When does she expect it might make a decision on whether it will, in the end, proceed with an Irish plant?  From where does she think it will get the 100% renewable power?

We are striving to ensure that Ireland continues to be able to attract world-class data centres and other high-tech investments.  The Taoiseach recently met the company's CEO in the USA and underlined the Government's support for this valuable project, which will build on this company's substantial existing investment and job creation in Ireland.  My Department, through the IDA, has been engaged in ongoing discussions with the company involved, throughout all stages in the development of this project, including the various planning and legal processes.  This engagement will continue and the IDA is in ongoing contact with the company, both through its US headquarters and with management at its existing Irish operations.</p>  <p>  We strongly support this project for several reasons.  It would help reinforce our hard-won reputation as a country that values and supports technological investment.  The location of this centre in County Galway would have huge benefits for the wider area.  I have just been discussing regional development, and it would serve as a strong endorsement of the west and the merits of investing in regional Ireland.  We are making huge efforts to ensure balanced regional development.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about forecasted benefits of this &euro;850 million investment, and they are well-known.  It is expected that 300 construction jobs would be generated, together with 150 quality on-site permanent jobs.  Of course, there would a whole range of indirect benefits for the wider local and regional economy.  There is very strong local support in Athenry for the project.  There are many factors.</p>  <p>  Whether the project proceeds or not, and we will certainly work to try to ensure it proceeds, remains a commercial decision for the company itself to take.  We will continue working closely with the company and we will try to influence the final decision.</p></speech>

These companies coming to Ireland want 100% renewable power.  The Government has just presented a report which plans for the next 13 years and states we will only aim to keep the existing level of renewable power.  EirGrid states we could get up to 75% in that timeframe, which would provide all the power to run these centres, but the Government does not seem to believe in it, which is one of the reasons we are at the bottom of the climate change league.  Similarly, the Government pulled back the development of the grid to the north-west, including the Mayo and Galway area, and pulled back from the development of wind power there that could have powered the Athenry plant.  One of the reasons it went to Denmark is not just that it was stuck in the planning system but that the company realised that in Denmark it was dealing with a government which believed in this renewable, low-carbon future.  In this country, especially in Fine Gael, there seems to be an ideological opposition to the transition to a low-carbon 100% renewable future.  Why is this?</p></speech>

These companies, as the Deputy rightly said, are big users of renewable energy, and that certainly is to be welcomed.  Their experience in this country has been good.  I do not think what Deputy has said is correct, because it is very clear the planning delays were the issue relating to where we are at present.  The delays that have beset the project underline the need to have an efficient and speedy planning process and associated legal process in place in this country.  I and the Government certainly want to ensure that similar projects are not unreasonably delayed.  The Department of the Taoiseach established a high-level working group earlier this year to examine the many cross-departmental policy issues associated with these projects.  The Department is represented on this group, and we will bring the enterprise perspective and retail related analysis to the group to aid its discussion.  The group will seek to develop a strategic national policy approach to the development of future projects in Ireland.  It is examining among other issues the possible designations of areas suitable for the development of data centres and the identification and resolution of planning issues and infrastructural requirements related to such investment.  This approach is the right one.  It takes into account the issues about which the Deputy is concerned and which he raised today.</p></speech>

This is why we are at the bottom of the charts.  To put this aside, I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is looking at developing a plan for what we do with data centres.  One of the reasons for the planning delay in this case was there was not a national plan.  The planning system had to try to decide whether the project made sense without any understanding of the overall plan in terms of how many data centres we have, from where we get the power, the benefits for the local community and where we locate them.  I very much welcome, if I heard it in the T&aacute;naiste's answer, that she will now have such a plan.  When does she expect it will be ready?  What other bodies are involved?  I have just come from an ESB conference down the road, and it sees the development of a renewable sensitive dynamic network as key.  What is the role of the industry in this?  How quickly can the T&aacute;naiste turn around such a plan so at least companies coming in future know what is happening in this country?</p></speech>

I can confirm a cross-departmental group is looking at this.  I will arrange for details to be sent to the Deputy of who is on the group and an outline of the work, and in so far as I can do so I am happy to do it.  We should not forget that Ireland is still considered, and with good cause, the unofficial data centre of Europe.  There are well over 25 major data centres in Ireland.  Many of them belong to some of the world's leading technology companies located here.  The strengths we have to offer, and I hear it again and again when I visit the companies, for this type of investment include our climate, our energy supply and our business environment.  They are well known to potential investors.  We will continue to work on this national plan and the IDA will remain in very close contact with the company.</p></speech>

The Mid-East Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in this region, including County Meath, with public and private stakeholders actively engaged in delivering the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the plan.  The core objective of the plan is to see a further 25,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.</p>  <p>  The first two progress reports on the implementation of the action plan show that good progress continues to be made in implementing the actions.  The second progress report highlighted actions of specific benefit to Meath, such as the fit-out of Kells Tech Hub, using REDZ funding, to provide shared services and hot desking facilities.  In addition, Meath Enterprise was awarded funding under the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Initiative to develop the Boyne Valley Food Hub.</p>  <p>  There are now 12,800 more people at work across Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow since the launch of the regional action plan for jobs initiative in quarter 1 of 2015.  The unemployment rate in the region has also dropped to 5.8%, lower than the State average of 6.4%.</p>  <p>  I am also determined to grow foreign direct investment, FDI, driven job creation further outside of our main urban areas.  I am pleased that significant progress has been made towards achieving the IDA's target of a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in every region outside Dublin, including the Mid-East.</p>  <p>  There are currently 17 IDA client companies located in County Meath employing close to 1,500 people.  This year has seen some significant investments in the county, with Shire announcing plans to expand its global biotechnology manufacturing capacity over the next four years.  It is expected this will lead to the creation of approximately 400 permanent jobs on a 120 acre site at Piercetown, County Meath.  This news followed Facebook&rsquo;s announcement in January of the construction of a new data centre in Clonee, County Meath.  Construction for the &euro;200 million data centre is taking place, with more than 1,000 workers on site daily.</p>  <p>  The IDA continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in County Meath to its client base and it makes every effort to ensure that FDI is spread as widely as possible throughout the country.  Since 2016, there have been nine site visits to the county.  While site visits can be a useful indicator of new investment interest, they are not by any means indicative of the potential for FDI in an area.  I point out in this regard that at least 70% of investment comes from existing IDA clients.</p>  <p>  While the IDA always highlights the benefits of investing in the regions to prospective investors, determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the firm concerned.  Factors that are also important for overseas investors include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent.  Multinational companies ultimately decide for themselves whether they want to operate in the area.</p></reply>

It is very important and is certainly a vote of confidence in that area.  What I am concerned about is that while the Minister of State mentioned the Kells Tech Hub, and I welcome the investment that has gone into that, there was no IDA financial investment in Meath in 2016.  It was one of three counties which got no IDA investment, the others being Roscommon and Leitrim.  Meath is vastly bigger than Leitrim and considerably bigger than Roscommon, and it has considerable advantages in terms of promoting industry.  What is the Minister doing for Kells?  A number of year ago Kells was designated as an area which could qualify for State aid for employment, yet there was no funding from the IDA for it last year.  There is an IDA business park outside Drogheda which has had one company in it for a considerable period, but on the whole it is completely empty.  That is in County Meath too.  It is not acceptable.  I do not think that the IDA is putting enough emphasis on other parts of the county.  Clonee and Dunboyne are standing on their own two feet, as it were, because of their location and get by with support from the IDA, but with little financial investment.  Other areas need that support, in particular Kells and the business park outside Drogheda.  What on earth is going on with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300008#F00600"><p>The IDA is only one element of job creation.  It is a very important element and has been an important part of the job creation in County Meath.  Meath is very near to Dublin.  Clonee is on the border with the county.  I also point out the importance of the indigenous sector in County Meath.  The number of people employed in that sector has grown substantially over recent years.  There has been an increase of 41%, and there are now almost 7,000 people employed in the indigenous sector there by Enterprise Ireland companies.  That has to be put in the context of job creation in the county.  While FDI is extremely important, a lot of indigenous and start up companies come out of that.  Enterprise Ireland has a very important role in that.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are also playing an important role throughout County Meath.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has outlined the situation in Kells.  I do not have exact numbers but I will ensure that they are passed on to the Deputy.  It is important that there is regional balance throughout the county.  The LEOs should be highlighted as they are a first-stop shop for people who want to start companies.  In 2016, they created approximately 927 jobs there throughout the county.  It is a matter of looking at the context, with the FDI, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and LEO jobs.  I take on board the Deputy's concerns about business parks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300008#F00700"><p>I accept what the Minister of State is saying about the indigenous sector being important, but the question was about FDI and the role of the IDA in funding that.  It is a fact that there was no funding invested by Government through the IDA in Meath last year.  It is also a fact that there is a business park which is owned by the IDA outside Drogheda, in County Meath which is almost empty, apart from one very important industry.  It is also a fact that the Kells area was designated for Government support, yet last year nothing came through the IDA.  That is not to say that there is nothing else happening in Kells, but the IDA needs to have a much greater focus on County Meath and support it financially.  There are parts of the county that will stand on their own two feet, so to speak, and which are doing really well, and we are very proud of those towns and everyone who puts the work in to achieve that, including the IDA.  We must not forget about other parts of the county where support is needed and where we really need FDI.  We have a history of FDI.  We want to continue that and bring more industries into the county.</p></speech>

We have to look at the fact that since 2016 there have been nine site visits to County Meath by the IDA.  There are some flagship companies in Clonee, and there is a &euro;200 million investment by Facebook happening there at the minute.  That is a very important and significant investment.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about it earlier when she discussed data centres.  That investment is strategically very important.  The one disadvantage that Meath has, which other counties surrounding Dublin also have, is that sometimes people commute out of the county into the capital city.  That can be a disadvantage.  At the same time Meath is an important location for FDI, particularly when it comes to quality of life and the availability of housing as well.  I will emphasise to the IDA the importance of the issues that the Deputy has raised today, but the fact is that there have been nine site visits since 2016.  Companies are growing, particularly the foreign companies in the county, and sometimes they increase their workforce without the fanfare that some companies want.  That is a strategic decision taken by the company itself.  Meath has done really well, but the Deputy is obviously concerned about the regional towns.  It is important that we invest in those too.</p></speech>

This is an issue we raise in the House at every opportunity given the disparity in the economic recovery across different parts of the country.  We are effectively seeing a two-tier economy comprising Dublin and the greater Dublin area versus the regions.</p></reply>

Regional development remains a priority for the Government.  I am very much aware that an important part of unlocking the potential of regional Ireland is ensuring that foreign direct investment, FDI, is spread as evenly as possible across the country, as per Government policy.  IDA Ireland is committed to increasing FDI in each region, and I welcome the progress made so far in boosting FDI-driven job creation outside of the main urban areas.  In 2016, for example, more than half of all IDA Ireland-supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  There have been 507 site visits to date this year, up by 18 from the same point last year.  While site visits can be a useful indicator of new investment interest, they are not by any means indicative of the potential for FDI in an area.  It is important to note that at least 70% of investment comes from existing IDA Ireland clients.  While the agency always highlights the benefits of investing in the regions to prospective investors, determining which particular sites may be attractive to a client depends very much on the particular requirements of the firm concerned.  Factors overseas investors take into account include the suitability of local infrastructure, the proximity of transport hubs and the availability of skilled talent.  Multinational companies frequently seek to base themselves as close as possible to businesses operating in the same industry.  IDA Ireland continues to work with all stakeholders and potential clients, as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations, to generate additional jobs.  However, the final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  There are 17 buildings owned by IDA Ireland that are currently available.  In addition, the agency leases units from private investors, of which 24 are currently available.</p></reply>

The data show that is not happening.  Of the 323 site visits that took place in the first six months of 2017, 48%, or almost half, were in Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  Counties Laois and Meath had no site visits, while counties Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon had one visit each in the first half of the year.  We should not seek to diminish or dilute the significance of site visits and at the same time, IDA Ireland has almost 100 vacant properties across the country.  I take every opportunity I have on Question Time to raise this issue.  The Government must use whatever means are necessary to force IDA Ireland to encourage site visits in parts of the country where they are not happening.</p>  <p>  Last week, Deputy Quinlivan and I were part of an Oireachtas committee delegation that visited the south east to meet members of the business community.  If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State had been among our number, they would have been run out of town because people there are very annoyed by what they perceive as the lack of attention from both Government and the State agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  It was hot and heavy going during the two sessions, with the business representatives rightly making their feelings known in a vociferous manner.  The Government has a responsibility to achieve a greater spread of site visits into the regions outside the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300009#G00500"><p>I understand the south east is one of the areas that has seen significant investment recently.  It is important to note that foreign direct investment normally locates in clusters.  As we know, industry tends to follow industry.</p>  <p>  In regard to IDA Ireland activities, there were 27 site visits in Limerick, which is the Deputy's area.  In my own area of Clare, we had 20 visits.  These numbers represent a huge increase on what we were seeing in recent years.  In addition, the mid-west results for 2017 show that 57% of all job approvals thus far are based outside of Dublin, an increase of 37% from the same time last year.  This illustrates our focus on investment in every part of the State.</p>  <p>  I take on board the points raised by the Deputy and assure him that the capital development plan is focusing very much on those issues.  As I said, clusters are very important for FDI investment but also the proximity of third level institutions and the innovation centres that may be attached to them.  Another consideration is the quality of the road network, and we have seen substantial enhancements in that regard in recent times.  The inclusion of the Limerick-Cork motorway in the forthcoming plan will be particularly welcomed by the Deputy.  There are some areas in the north east, as well as into the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's part of the country, where there are deficiencies in the road network that remain to be addressed and this is reflected in the number of site visits.  The ultimate concern is to attract jobs into the country and ensure there is balanced regional development.</p></speech>

That is what people in Limerick are saying to me, as I am sure they are likewise telling the Minister of State.  Will he comment on that?</p>  <p>  On IDA Ireland site visits, while the Minister of State cited the numbers for the mid-west, Limerick and Clare, which are welcome, what about counties Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon?  He did not refer to them in his reply.</p>  <p>  Another barometer of the economic recovery is gross domestic product, GDP.  Last year, 45%, or almost half, of our GDP was generated in the Dublin area.  In the United Kingdom, by comparison, London city and the greater London area contributes 20% of national GDP.  That is comparing like with like in reference to our neighbouring country and clearly shows we have a major problem when it comes to balanced regional development.  IDA Ireland must do more to funnel jobs into those regions that have not experienced the upside of recovery.</p></speech>

Balanced regional development is a priority for the Government.  The Action Plan for Jobs undertakes to ensure all regions experience growth in jobs, and the statistics show that is happening.  Our plan up to 2020 is to ensure that of the 200,000 jobs we intend to create, 135,000 will be outside the capital.</p>  <p>  Regarding the national planning framework, it is important to note that we do not yet have a final document.  No matter where the T&aacute;naiste and I visit, in every instance the representatives we meet will say their region is not included in the framework.  That has happened in Limerick, the mid-west and in locations further south or north.  The reality is that submissions have been made and the local authorities have been very vocal in their views, as have the chambers of commerce.  I am sure that when the final document is agreed, and we have the three regional documents as well, it will be clear that all areas stand to benefit.  It is important that we plan for the future and do not return to the days when there was no planning.  Only by having proper planning processes in place can we ensure that all areas benefit.</p></speech>

This is an issue of particular concern as we approach the Christmas season, which is a high business turnover period for retailers.  It is estimated that up to &euro;300 million is spent on gift vouchers every year but there is absolutely no regulation of their usage.</p></reply>

Gift vouchers supplied to consumers are subject to the provisions of general consumer protection legislation, in particular, the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 on unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices and the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, SI 27 of 1995.</p><p>Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are also covered by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information Cancellation and other Rights) Regulations 2013.  Gift cards that come within the definition of electronic money, of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 are subject to the provisions of these regulations unless the card can be used to acquire goods or services on the premises of the card issuer or within a limited network of services providers or a limited range of goods and services.<br/><br/>The issuer of gift cards that come under the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money - or par value - at any time.  Redemption may be subject to a fee in specific circumstances and any such fee must be appropriate and compensate with the costs actually incurred by the issuer of the electronic money.  The European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 falls under the remit of the Minister for Finance.<br/><br/>My Department published a draft scheme for public consultation of the comprehensive consumer rights Bill on 25 May 2015.  In addition to the parts that deal with the consolidation and updating of the new law around the supply of goods, digital content and services and on the unfair contract terms, the draft scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that comes within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  It is important that we listen to all views and possible approaches to the issue of gift vouchers, including the validity of a set time period.<br/><br/><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i><br/><br/>While I am anxious to progress the scheme of the consumer rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals, which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft scheme of the consumer rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a general approach reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June 2017.  The proposal will now be considered in a trilogue with the European Parliament later this year.  Discussion at Council level on the second proposal on online sales has only just commenced.<br/><br/>In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017, if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time, is obviously open to question.  I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the scheme of the consumer rights Bill.<br/><br/>I also draw the attention of the Deputy to the very useful information for consumers on the issue of gift vouchers and cards on the CCPC website <i></i>particularly in the run-up to the Christmas period.</p></reply>

Consumers are being severely and negatively impacted.  Many people who are in receipt of vouchers and gift vouchers are children, especially at Christmas time.  When they go to use the vouchers to make a purchase with them, often they suffer a loss and huge disappointment.  It is high time that something concrete was put in place in this regard.  Fianna F&aacute;il is publishing a Bill next week to deal with the matter.  If it comes before the House we hope that the Minister of State will support it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen has made reference to what he is trying to achieve within his Department.  Perhaps the Minister of State will specify what the consumer rights Bill will do in respect of time limits, discounting and the loss of vouchers.  It is a big issue and it has been brought to our attention.  People lose their vouchers from time to time and when they seek to recover or acquire a replacement voucher they are met with stonewalling from many retailers.</p></speech>

As politicians, the best advice we should give to consumers who buy or receive gift vouchers is to ensure that the vouchers are used as quickly as possible.  This is also important.  People have a tendency to lose them, leave them in a drawer or let them go out of date.  That is the best advice we can give at this stage.  The consumer rights Bill, published in 2015, contained a set of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers.  We must also bear in mind the European Communities regulations.  We want to listen to all of the views possible on the area of the validity of these gift cards.  I am anxious to progress the scheme under the consumer rights Bill but we have to also take in to account the European Union legislative proposals for the directive on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for online services and other digital sales of goods.  In this situation I say to the Deputy that we will take all views on board and listen to all sides here.  We have the draft consumer rights Bill and obviously we want to be balanced to ensure we have the rights of the customers and businesses.</p></speech>

It goes to the heart of the situation that the State faces on Brexit; how exactly can we ensure that the economic recovery continues.  I have recently published a document form my Department about that very topic.  It is about helping firms to innovate, to do research and to make sure they are prepared for Brexit.  Earlier today I outlined to the House the range of issues that will make  difference in our firms' survival.  Access to finance is going to be absolutely critical and I have outlined a detailed approach, including the contacts with the European Commission we are taking in that respect.</p>  <p>  We have to ensure that jobs continue to be created.  There is no question that we have had a very successful action plan for jobs.  It is one of the key instruments to continue to support job creation.   The action plan for jobs process is working.  Since the plan was launched in early 2012, there are over 225,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to more than 2 million in the first half of the year.  Unemployment has fallen significantly with 18,000 new jobs created in the first six months of 2017 and in the same period employment grew faster in the regions - this is often not noted - at 2.8% more than in Dublin at 1.5%, with four out of five jobs created in the regions.</p>  <p>  The preparation of the action plan for jobs 2018 has started.  I held a forum in Farmleigh with all the key sectors to discuss what they felt the Government should prioritise for next year.  It was decided that we should focus on a smaller number of actions, but that they should be very key actions with regard to the Brexit challenge and where the economy is at this point.</p>  <p>  We will focus on more strategic actions to ensure a significant impact on sustainable jobs creation.  There are challenges out there and every action needs to be taken to continue the economic recovery.</p></speech>

Will the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation confirm that is recognised that we must lift the bar now to its highest level ever? The competition is greater, the threats are many and added to by Brexit and the competition from outside and within the European Union.  Competition is also affected by the added difficulties that have occurred around obtaining planning permission given that it is just as easy to give a quick and positive response as it is to give a slow and negative response.  Is it fully recognised that these challenges now presented to us are greater than Ireland has ever experienced before? Is it recognised that we have the will and the ways to deal with the issues?</p></speech>

A really sustained cross-government approach is necessary to continue the economic recovery.  We cannot take it for granted.  We must continue to focus on all the right areas, particularly on the competition aspect, as I spoke of earlier.  We must ensure that businesses who may need temporary financial support  have it.  This is extremely important.  I will work with colleagues to make sure that the new action plan for jobs focuses on the right areas, as informed by business, so we can continue to build that strong economy.  If we want the economic recovery to continue it is important that the Government continues to support enterprises, businesses and to put money into research and development.  I recently made an announcement, with the Taoiseach, of funding for research centres.  In the budget the Deputy will have seen that the Future Dairy project - in the agriculture sector - received extra funding to make sure that the dairy industry stays at the cutting edge of innovation.  On a recent trade mission I could see that in the UAE and Oman there is huge concern about food security.  Ireland certainly should be in a position to provide to some of those markets.</p><p>That kind of research is what will keep our economy operating very well.</p></speech>

The Action Plan for Jobs will be one of the key vehicles but it is only one.  It is also about ensuring regional development.  The Deputy would have seen in recent times that indigenous local companies are growing.  A huge number of new companies are registering with the Companies Office every month, so there is huge activity and innovation, and people who are willing to take risks to set up companies.  There is also continued foreign direct investment.  If we consider the job announcements even in the past two or three weeks, we have had Regeneron in Limerick, which shows huge confidence in Limerick, a recent announcement in Waterford, two recent announcements in Drogheda and a company opened its centre in Galway recently.  Those are just four examples.  I see no reason that this level of regional investment should not continue.  There is every indication it will continue but we cannot be complacent.  There are very serious challenges facing us, with Brexit probably being the most serious one.  All the indications are that Brexit will be very challenging for the vast majority of Irish businesses.</p></speech>

I take some responsibility for that but I ask Ministers and Deputies to take some responsibility for it also.  The purpose of the clock opposite us is to be mindful of the time.  It is not right that we will get through only ten or 11 questions today.  It is unfair to those Members who have questions tabled.

The current legal position is that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices.  My Department obtained advice on the issue of civil fines from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  In that context, any national legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties having regard to the protection afforded under Article 38.1. </p>  <p>  On 22 March 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.  One of the aims of the directive is to ensure that all national competition authorities are able to impose effective deterrent fines.  The proposal is currently being debated at the Council working group on competition and is also being considered by the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission published an Issues Paper entitled Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences on 27 January 2016.  The Issues Paper invited views on the enforcement powers of the State&rsquo;s main financial and economic regulators, including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the issue of administrative and civil fines was raised.  I understand the CCPC made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on 19 September 2017, in response to the Issues Paper, requesting the power to levy such fines.  With respect to any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise in due course, we will carefully consider them in the Department.</p></speech>

Do he believe the CCPC  should be empowered with financial sanctions?  Some of our other regulations such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation or the Data Protection Commissioner have powers to impose a financial sanction, yet this regulator does not.  It is high time we seriously examined this matter.  The Minister of State has cited to us on a number of occasions when we have raised this matter the constitutional issue but no more than the lack of regulations covering the gift voucher industry, which we conversed about earlier, it is the consumer who is ultimately losing out.  What is the Minister of State's own take on this issue?  Is he in favour of such a measure or will he merely coast along and allow another consultation process to drift on.  We have had numerous comments, as the Minister of State will know, from the Attorney General on the constitutional prohibition in regard to it.  Is the Minister of State in favour or not in favour of such a measure?</p></speech>

There are two areas concerned.  The proposal currently being debated by the Council's working group and the European Commission has to be considered by the European Parliament.  At this stage it is impossible for us to say what format the final EU measures will take.  We must also bear in mind that the CCPC had made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on the area of the levy of fines.  The main argument in regard to all this is with respect to Article 38.1 of the Constitution.  We are listening to the debate in Europe and as soon as recommendations or proposals that may emanate from the Law Reform Commission's exercise come through, we will consider those in due course.</p></speech>

I want her to be clear as to the nature of the criticism we make of her.  She will be aware that the response of the State to the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe has been one of the issues of greatest political controversy in this country during the past three years.  It has led to the resignation of a Minister for Justice and Equality and others.  In spite of that, when we have raised legitimate concerns about what the State has known, she has sought to undermine those concerns and deny the seriousness of the issues we are raising.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>What the T&aacute;naiste has done repeatedly is respond to allegations that we are not making against her.  Last night, she sought legal advice in respect of issues which are not relevant to the matters of concern to her.</p> <p> I want to outline to the T&aacute;naiste Fianna F&aacute;il's criticism of her.  It is this.  In May 2015, the T&aacute;naiste was aware of the strategy of the Garda Commissioner to attack and to try to personally destroy the reputation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  We do not say that the T&aacute;naiste formulated that strategy, we do not say that she was part of the make-up of that strategy but we say she was aware of that strategy.  To use a phrase that was used elsewhere on this issue, the T&aacute;naiste was privy to that strategy.  Our criticism is that the T&aacute;naiste did nothing to stop it.  The T&aacute;naiste did nothing to give the impression that it was wrong what was happening and, instead, she publicly sought to present herself as being supportive of Maurice McCabe and supportive of whistleblowers.</p> <p> It is also very significant that the Taoiseach on a number of occasions last week made false statements to this House.  We know already that on two occasions he made false statements.  He also made a third false statement on 14 November, which was Tuesday of last week, when he stated, "as things stand, the Department [of Justice and Equality] has not been able to find any record of being informed before the fact of the legal strategy the Commissioner was going to pursue."  We now know that is incorrect.  We know that on 9 November the Department was aware of this email.  What I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste is when did she become aware of this email.  I saw reports in the newspaper that the T&aacute;naiste became aware of it on Thursday of last week.  If that is so, why then did she not bring this to the attention of the Taoiseach?  Why did the T&aacute;naiste not go to the Taoiseach on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday, or indeed Monday, and tell him about this email so that he could correct the record of the D&aacute;il?</p> <p> Second, can the T&aacute;naiste tell us, after the Taoiseach spoke to her in Cavan on 11 November during the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, did she speak to any officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, and if she did speak to them, what did she ask them and what did she tell them?  Finally, when did the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, know about the existence of this email?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300012#K00200"><p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.  There are a lot of questions there.</p>  <p>  I want to be absolutely clear that the first time that I knew about the email was last Thursday when I was in contact with the Department.  As I have said on the record, that was the first time that I heard that this email existed - the very first time.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan is absolutely inaccurate in stating that I did not act on concerns.  That is completely and utterly inaccurate.  I have made it very clear that there was no role for me in the legal strategy.  Indeed, many Members of this House in the course of the questions to me suggested, contrary to what Deputy O'Callaghan stated, that I should have become involved in the legal strategy in some way.  I could not do that and the legal advice yesterday confirmed that once again.</p>  <p>  But to suggest that I did nothing about whistleblowers during my time as Minister for Justice and Equality is completely wrong.  The very first thing I did was I met Maurice McCabe and his wife, Lorraine.  I reread the minutes of that meeting this morning, and what I said to Maurice McCabe and what he said to me, and what his wife outlined to me.  I was the first Minister for Justice and Equality who ever met - I think this is accurate - a serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss an issue like this and I did it because I wanted to hear directly what the concerns were so that I would act properly in relation to them during the course of my tenure.</p>  <p>  What I then did was I acted in a whole range of areas to deal with concerns that had arisen.  I could not be involved in the legal strategy.  Referring back to that email in terms of action I could take, at one level that is about the legal strategy.  However, what I did do as a Government Minister was set the tone, I took the actions and I initiated a whole range of initiatives.  One of the first things I did in order to make sure that whistle-blowing was dealt with more seriously was raise my attitude to it publicly.  I raised it privately with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised it with the management of the Department of Justice and Equality on a continuous basis.</p>  <p>  One of the first things I did, which, by the way, had been delayed from 2005, was I said it was really important that there was ethics legislation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I asked the Policing Authority to work on that within a year, I put it into the legislation, so that whistleblowers would be dealt with properly within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If Deputy O'Callaghan reads that ethics report and the ethics code of practice, he will see there is a specific issue in it about speaking out and how whistleblowers who raise complaints should be dealt with within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Every time an issue came up, I made sure that it was dealt with.  I referred it to the proper place.  Instead of discussing these issues here in this House, as we are, while a Charleton tribunal sits to look at all of these issues and in some ways we try and run a parallel process, I set up an independent Policing Authority and I referred the policy of whistleblowers to that authority so that it could look at how it was proceeding and how it needed to change it.  I made it very clear the Government wanted the strongest policy possible in relation to whistleblowers.</p>  <p>  Every time an issue was raised in this House in regard to the treatment of whistleblowers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I was astonished at some of the things that were said here and I continually raised them with my officials to raise with the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I raised them myself.  I continually demanded that they were dealt with properly.</p></speech>

I am telling the T&aacute;naiste what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il last week was he justified not doing anything because it happened after the event.  We know now that is not correct.  What the Taoiseach stated was, "The Department was not in a position, after the fact, to express concerns about it or counsel against it."</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste could have expressed reservations about the legal strategy.  She did not do that.</p></speech>

Did the T&aacute;naiste ever mention that email to the Taoiseach?  Who told him about that email?  The T&aacute;naiste did not tell him.  The Taoiseach said he only saw it on Monday evening at 11.30 p.m.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell us when she told the Taoiseach because it appears that the she did not tell him on the Thursday, the Friday, the Saturday or the Sunday and I have a strong suspicion that there were efforts being made to suppress this email?</p></speech>

It seems to me that there was a conspiracy to ruin this honourable man and that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the T&aacute;naiste's former Department were part of this conspiracy.  I say this is because the T&aacute;naiste has refused to provide clear answers and explanations.  This is the T&aacute;naiste's last chance to answer those questions and to provide the necessary clarity.</p></speech>

That email was then sent on to the T&aacute;naiste.  It strikes me as very strange that this email and the telephone conversation happened at all.  It is very strange that the people concerned would be sharing information on a legal strategy and then sharing it with the T&aacute;naiste who, after all, had no hand, act or part in the formulation of that strategy.  The email clearly showed a deliberate plan to smear Maurice McCabe in the worst possible way.  The criminal complaints being used had been already disproved.  The T&aacute;naiste knew this and yet she did nothing.  Why did the T&aacute;naiste do nothing?</p></speech>

She said that she could not remember the email but I do not accept that because the political controversy surrounding Maurice McCabe had already led to the resignation of a Minister for Justice and Equality and a Garda Commissioner.  It centred on allegations against Sergeant McCabe of which the T&aacute;naiste was aware for a whole year, so not reading or remembering this email is, frankly, not believable.  It is baffling that the T&aacute;naiste did not object in some way to the Garda Commissioner's strategy.</p></speech>

She also continued to parrot this line that the whistleblower would enjoy protection from the Government.</p>  <p>  It was initially claimed by An Taoiseach, presumably after discussions with her, that the T&aacute;naiste had no knowledge of the strategy prior to Sergeant McCabe's cross examination.  That is not true.  The T&aacute;naiste knew three days in advance and yet she insisted, and allowed the Taoiseach to insist, that she did not know.  Furthermore, she failed to explain how this email came to light only following a parliamentary question.  She has not clarified how it did not show up in the initial O'Neill scoping exercise or the discovery for the Charlton tribunal.  Her refusal to provide plausible answers has placed her at the centre of this scandal.  The T&aacute;naiste may think that she will weather this storm, that she will ride it out but she will not because the terrible vista of a conspiracy to malign a good man, to smear him as a sex abuser in order to shut him up is not some minor political episode that can be simply brushed away.  </p></speech>

I will not take a lecture from her on due process and fairness.  I have always supported due process in every situation.  In fact, it has been a hallmark of the way I approached this entire issue.  I have been providing answers.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, I am not trying to hide anything.  I was not part of any conspiracy to undermine Sergeant McCabe; quite the contrary.  When Sergeant McCabe came to see me he spoke, for example, about the penalty points and all of the work that he felt needed to be done on that.  That is just one area he raised with me.  I took a whole range of actions to make sure the penalty points system was changed and I acted on many of the recommendations he made.  That is just one example of taking seriously what he had to say.</p>  <p>  I would make the point that these issues are before the Charlton tribunal.  I conferred with Deputy McDonald's colleagues and other Deputies in this House on the terms of reference of that tribunal and all of these issues are yet to be determined by the tribunal.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the email, what I have said about when I was told about it is accurate.  That is absolutely accurate.  I was asked previously if I contacted officials after our party meeting.  I did not contact them until the Thursday.  That is when I spoke to them.

I did say that it should be referred and it has been referred.  To say that I did not act is not correct.

It would have been a criminal act for me to try to influence the legal strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I acted by referring how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was dealing with whistleblowers to the independent Policing Authority, so that the way that whistleblowers were dealt with would be stronger and clearer.  I asked the authority to look at the policy in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how it was dealing with whistleblowers so that they would be dealt with better.  I raised the issue of the supports that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was getting.  I asked if he was getting one-to-one support and whether he was being helped to deal with the various issues.  I asked if his requests in relation to various personal issues which I do not want to mention here were being dealt with properly.  On every occasion, publicly and privately, I raised issues about how whistleblowers were being dealt with to make sure that they were getting the best possible supports within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

My party has always believed in due process and I have always believed in due process.  She can speak for her own party in regard to how it handles issues that arise but I can speak for my party, and I have always followed the principle of natural justice and due process.</p>  <p>  When the issue emerged in regard to Maurice McCabe and his treatment with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I am not speaking to any script, as the Deputy can see, I am responding to the questions that are being asked here, and I can respond to them fully because I am telling the full truth about the situation, as I had experience and knowledge of it in regard to this whole episode, the email spoke about a legal strategy.  Sergeant McCabe was represented at the O'Higgins commission.  Obviously, he had full legal representation and his legal rights were being protected there.  This email came in the context of the establishment and the work of a commission that was actively under way.  What I have made clear is where I had responsibility as a Minister in regard to whistleblowing, in the same way that the previous Government, which was the first Government to act, under the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, brought in the protected disclosures, I sent that protected disclosure policy from the Garda, as I have already said, over to the Policing Authority.  What emerged in that email was about an approach that counsel had taken.  We know that, subsequently, there was further clarification about that counsel's role and the role of the Garda Commissioner.  In fact, much more detail, which I was not aware of, emerged a year later, which is what I was referring to when I spoke to the Taoiseach.  I was referring to all of the information that came out later.</p></speech>

In particular, it refers to the national planning framework, which is currently in draft form, how this document relates to the mid-western region of Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, and in particular how it fails to address balanced regional development adequately and fails to harness the potential of the mid-west as a driver of national growth, as Ireland plans its future going forward to 2040.  There is still an unhealthy dominance by the greater Dublin area.  The draft plan does not fully harness the existing mid-west infrastructural entities, such as Shannon Airport and its international connectivity and industrial base, the university campus of Limerick and its innovative industries, the Shannon Estuary and its potential for maritime economic development, both in Clare and Limerick, and the position of the mid-west, particularly Ennis and Limerick, as the centre of the economic corridor between Galway and Cork.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government promises to put in place measures to revitalise all Ireland in order that benefits are felt on every doorstep and in every community.  It seems that, far from moving towards that aim of balanced regional development, we are going in the opposite direction.  The proposal to restrict population growth outside larger urban areas is going to impact negatively on the fabric of rural towns and villages.  The plan must provide for population and economic growth on a scale that will deliver balance in our economic recovery.  To date, this has been a Dublin-centric model.  The greater Dublin area will attract 50% of the estimated national population growth by 2040.  This does not reflect equitable or effective regional balanced development, especially when one considers the housing shortage that will exist in the greater Dublin area for the next decade, as supply fails to meet demand.  Population growth must be more regionalised and this can only happen if employment opportunities and services are developed in regions and not just concentrated in the Dublin area.</p>  <p>  The draft plan is under review.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that, when the plan is finalised, it effectively and definitively addresses regional development by funding infrastructure and economic drivers which will unlock the potential of regions such as the mid-west?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300014#M01600"><p>I thank Deputy Harty for those questions.  I was taking questions earlier in regard to jobs growth and one of the key points, of course, is that the majority of the jobs that are now being created are in regional areas.  The mid-west is one of the fastest growing regions in the country.  We had the jobs announcement which I attended in Limerick a couple of weeks ago, where Regeneron announced 300 very welcome jobs, and another announcement attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, in County Clare, where there were a further 50 jobs.  There is very strong growth, although we can cannot be complacent and we have to make sure it continues.  That is why I published my Department's Brexit plan.</p>  <p>  The national planning framework is at a draft stage.  The consultation just finished last week and there have been a good number of submissions in regard to it.  It is, of course, a national planning framework for the long term and it sets out a new, long-term strategic planning and investment context for Ireland over the next 20 years.  It is about a high level national vision for Ireland 2040 and will provide the framework and principles to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years, so it is extremely important.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, there will be regional plans, and it is important the Deputy is aware of this.  Of course, the plan is still at draft stage.  Some 1,000 submissions have been received and are currently being considered by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Murphy.  Those submissions are informing the final national planning framework document and every submission is, of course, important.  I believe the framework will be very valuable for co-ordinating across Government different policies and investment on national and regional development.  It will be published in association with the capital investment plan.  That is the first time the two have been published together and I believe that will be important as well.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about his own area.  Within the context of growing Limerick's population by 50% to 60% and expanding its national and international economic capacity, there is specific reference to the role of Shannon Airport.  Shannon Development and the Shannon-Foynes Port Company will, it is hoped, build on recent successes and add to the overall vision for counties Limerick and Clare.  There is a way to go yet in terms of taking account of the needs of different parts of the country.  The plan is still at draft stage and I have no doubt the Deputy will make the views from County Clare known in terms of the finalisation of the report.</p></speech>

Dublin Airport had a market share of 72% in 2005 and it has a market share of 87% today.  Shannon Airport has huge untapped potential in regard to development as an airport, yet it has only 5% of the market.</p><p>It would be a driver of economic development in the mid-west.<br/><br/>Current aviation policy seems happy to allow market forces to dictate how our airports develop.</p></speech>

The uncontrolled development of Dublin into a city state must not be inadvertently enshrined in our national planning framework.  The unbalanced aviation policy illustrates the difficulties our regions are encountering in attracting development, jobs and infrastructure that would allow them to grow effectively and contribute to our economic development.</p></speech>

In every contact that I have had with foreign multinationals, I have spoken of the importance of companies taking the opportunity to locate in regional areas.  We have seen major successes in the Shannon area as regards aviation, particularly in terms of leasing.  The Action Plan for Jobs, which I will publish in January, will refer to Shannon as a centre of excellence in aviation, leasing and so on and will place particular emphasis on how that can be grown further.  Ireland is regarded as a centre of excellence.  Shannon leasing and the work of Shannon Holdings have developed considerably.</p>  <p>  As a capital city, Dublin is always attractive in terms of the balance that the Deputy has described.  That is in common with other countries.  As we focus more on regional development, however, passenger numbers at Shannon will change.  Focusing more on our regional tourism policy will, given its potential, support the development in the region the Deputy seeks.</p></speech>

The cause of juvenile arthritis is multifactorial but includes genetic disposition and environmental factors.  Severe pain is associated with the condition and, because children are growing, any extended period of inflammation can affect their joint formation.  Therefore, early and aggressive treatment of the condition gives the best results for children.</p>  <p>  Parenting of a child with juvenile arthritis can be a rollercoaster experience.  The Irish Children's Arthritis Network, iCan, is a 100% volunteer-based, parent-led, grassroots charity.  It provides a national support network for children with arthritis and their families through the provision of factual, emotional and practical support.  iCan has funded the first ever dedicated rheumatology assessment suite at Crumlin children's hospital.</p>  <p>  The charity cannot do it all on its own and current services for the children in question are deficient.  The Government has a responsibility to provide a fully resourced, staffed and funded rheumatology service to ensure that these children, who are waiting in pain, are diagnosed early and treated quickly.  A delay in diagnosis and treatment risks permanent damage to joints and skeletal deformities.</p>  <p>  There are 793 children waiting for an outpatient appointment to see a consultant.  Of these, 226 have been waiting for more than 18 months.  There are 103 children who have been waiting for inpatient or day case treatment for more than six months.  The standards set out in the model of care for paediatrics are not being adhered to and clinic appointments are regularly being cancelled.  The three-monthly clinic monitoring of children on biological drugs is important but it is not being done.</p>  <p>  There should be six paediatric rheumatologists in the country.  We have but two.  Crumlin children's hospital has submitted a business plan to provide adequate but basic services for these children.  As an absolute minimum, a third paediatric rheumatologist, with a full multidisciplinary team, including doctors, physiotherapists, psychologists and ophthalmologists, is required urgently.</p>  <p>  Will the Government fund the development of the juvenile arthritis service at Crumlin children's hospital in line with the hospital's proposed business plan?  Will it also approve the appointment of a third paediatric consultant with a multidisciplinary team?</p></speech>

I am aware of the work done by Arthritis Ireland - I have taken a special interest in that - and iCan.  The aim of the presentation that the latter made this week was to increase awareness of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, JIA, and to highlight the need for additional services.  This is a common disease of childhood.  It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 children under 16 years of age with juvenile arthritis.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is aware of the challenges and has met representatives of Arthritis Ireland to discuss service needs in the health service.  The increased investment in the health services will be helpful in dealing more effectively with these issues, as will the new children's hospital, where there will be an opportunity to put the new paediatric models of work into play once it is built.</p>  <p>  The rheumatology specialty continues to be one of the most rapidly growing services in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, accounting for the highest number of medical day case patients per year.  This demand has had an effect on waiting lists for paediatric rheumatology services.  The Minister is awaiting the HSE's service plan.  He will address the question of how many consultant paediatric rheumatologists are required in so far as resources permit, but he is conscious of the need for more consultants in the context of children with this condition.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been undertaken.  For example, the paediatric rheumatology consultants in Crumlin were removed from the general medical roster, which has facilitated a greater focus on rheumatology services.  That is important.  The theatre closure situation is slowly improving, which will have a positive impact on access to joint injections for Crumlin patients.  The HSE has developed a national model of care for paediatric health care services, including the development of a hub-and-spoke model of care for paediatric rheumatology as part of a national clinical network in paediatrics.  A key priority for the children's hospital group is to develop a shared strategy to achieve the integration of services, including rheumatology, in advance of the move to the new children's hospital.</p>  <p>  This is a difficult condition for children and their families.  It requires ongoing intensive care.  The Minister for Health and the HSE have been taking some actions to improve the situation, but more investment is clearly necessary.</p></speech>

Children suffering from juvenile arthritis are entitled to a quality health service, something that they do not have at the moment.  These children and their families are demanding that funding for a third rheumatologist and a multidisciplinary team be included in the 2018 HSE national service plan.</p>  <p>  Some 70% of children presenting with this disease are from outside Dublin.  Therefore, we obviously need an integrated national and regional service along the lines of the European hub-and-spoke model, Crumlin hospital being the hub with links to regional centres providing ophthalmology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychological services etc.  Two clinical nurse specialists are required to co-ordinate and manage the transition of teenagers to the regional adult services.  These measures are required urgently and I look forward to the Minister for Health ensuring that the services in question, particularly the third rheumatologist and the multidisciplinary team, are included and funded in the 2018 HSE national service plan.</p></speech>

He has been actively working with the relevant local authorities and I have no doubt that, as we have responded very quickly in recent times when there has been flooding, there will be a speedy response.  It is a dreadful situation for families to find themselves in.  The Minister of State is working very actively to ensure that there will be an appropriate response.</p></speech>

It appears that when it comes to the survivors of the Magdalen laundries all of these worthy commitments go out the window.  Following a comprehensive investigation into the administration of the Magdalen restorative justice scheme, the Ombudsman has today published a damning report into the scheme's failures.</p>  <p>  What the investigation has exposed beggars belief.  The Department of Justice and Equality administered the scheme in a manner which deliberately sought to exclude women from the redress to which they were entitled.  Women who were effectively imprisoned on a single site, working side-by-side with those deemed eligible for redress, were refused their entitlements on the basis of the Department's incorrect administrative interpretation of the eligibility criteria relating to the 12 institutions covered by the State.  Given that the State has failed the women twice, will the Government do the right thing and act on the recommendations of the Ombudsman?</p></speech>

The scheme applied to 12 named institutions.  To date, &euro;25.7 million has been paid to 684 women under the scheme, which is still open.  I understand that the Department of Justice and Equality co-operated fully with the Ombudsman in the course of the investigation.  There are a number of recommendations in respect of women who were outside of the 12 named institutions.</p>  <p>  The report has just been received.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has stated that full and careful consideration will be given to all of the recommendations.  The Ombudsman has welcomed his response.  It is an issue which will be considered by the relevant Department, namely, the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have no doubt that, in line with previous reports from the Ombudsman, as many of the recommendations as possible will be taken on board.</p></speech>

It is something for which the T&aacute;naiste indicated support in the past.  Starting on Saturday, Change the Conversation involves 16 days of action by Women's Aid on violence against women in the home.  It has written to all Members and asked them to wear a purple ribbon.  Given the T&aacute;naiste's support and indications from most female Members from the Fine Gael Party for the production of a further Sexual Abuse and Violence Ireland, SAVI, report, will she please lean on the Taoiseach to spend the money and come up with a comprehensive report on sexual and domestic violence in the country?  The last report was published fifteen and a half years ago.</p>  <p>  Sexual and domestic violence has been on the increase and has gone under the radar.  We really need a report.  The Taoiseach complained a report would cost about &euro;1 million.  The women of Ireland, and the most vulnerable women and children of Ireland, are worth that money.  I would like to know what the T&aacute;naiste thinks and whether she can play a role, as a woman and T&aacute;naiste, in convincing the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to get out the cheque book and spend money on a much needed report,  given that it is Change the Conversation week.</p></speech>

We need up-to-date macro information on sexual and domestic violence in this country.  The Taoiseach does not need convincing.  This matter was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee last week.  The initial scoping work has begun to determine how precisely it will be carried out.</p></speech>

Concerns are increasing about the Mercosur deal and the intention of the European Commission to increase the offer being made to the four countries which are objecting, including Paraguay.  The European Commission had been offered 120,000 tonnes of beef imports, which would come into Ireland and other countries.  If the offer is increased, which seems likely, it will have a detrimental impact on our farming industry, in particular the beef sector.  It would be appropriate to take immediate action to ensure that we are not flooded with cheap beef that would destroy our already vulnerable beef industry.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach has made his views on the issue very clearly known.  Ireland wants more trade deals put in place, but we have very strong defensive issues, in particular on beef.  Any Mercosur deal is very sensitive and the Irish concerns have been very forcefully made by the Taoiseach.  We have sought and received support from other countries.  The French President has also been very strong on this issue, specifically in respect of concerns from a beef perspective.  We have some strong allies.  I can assure the Deputy that the concerns he outlined have been expressed very clearly by the Government on a number of levels.</p></speech>

Incredibly, she proposes to give more powers and resources to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  I say it is incredible because, given its very poor performance over recent years, especially its bungling of the Fitzpatrick trial, it is hard to understand why the Government is taking this approach.  The T&aacute;naiste has had a report on that office's handling of the Fitzpatrick trial for five months.  I have asked her on a regular basis when we will get sight of the report.  Can she tell us the reason for the further delay?  When can we expect to see the report?</p></speech>

It must have been misreported.  The Government plans to establish the ODCE on a statutory footing, with commissioners as opposed to the current model whereby it is part of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am not in a position to publish the ODCE report because I have strong legal advice that it is not within my power under the legislation to do so.</p></speech>

Laois has been mentioned already this morning but on Tuesday night in Kerry we also had extensive rainfall that caused very bad flooding, particularly in north and mid Kerry.  My town of Ballyheigue was flooded, along with premises in Ballyduff, Causeway, Listowel, Tarbert and Ballylongford.  One individual suffered over &euro;60,000 of damage to his property.  I ask that in light of this, along with any other county that received a heavy rainfall, the Government should not forget to respond to Kerry.  Funding should be made available to repair the properties and the local and tertiary roads, many of which were washed away beyond repair.</p></speech>

Given what we have seen in the past day or so we absolutely must keep this issue and how we respond to it under review.  We saw a very good response from the agencies with Storm Ophelia but the Deputy is correct and we must stay targeted on this.  If we can replicate the model used during Storm Ophelia, it would be the direction in which to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is very active on this matter today, ensuring all the resources needed in the area will be brought to bear to help those who have been so directly affected by this flooding.</p></speech>

Recently, there was a ruling in the UK Supreme Court that Scotland can set a minimum price for alcohol, and this paves the way for similar minimum price controls in Northern Ireland.  Similar price controls will help curb the leakage of revenue through smuggling but will the Minister and the House consider the progression of a Bill stuck in the Bills lottery, the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017, as this would help retailers, especially in the Border region?  Surely allowing passage of this Bill to the next stage would help many businesses along the Border corridor and protect much needed State revenue.</p></speech>

We had consultation in my Department between retailer representative bodies and officials last Friday and they will revert to me in the coming days with proposals to ensure we can achieve what we want, which is a really important piece of public health legislation, without placing an unfair burden on small shops, which is the concern of a number of people.  The Deputy is correct that minimum unit pricing saw a very significant landmark ruling and we now intend to introduce minimum unit pricing in this country, as it is a key part of the public health alcohol legislation.  I hope to be back in the Seanad to pass that Bill before Christmas with the co-operation of Senators in all parties.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about cross-Border matters.  A previous Government made a commitment that it would introduce minimum unit pricing, conscious of the fact it is not currently in place in Northern Ireland.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Tallaght hospital, the busiest trauma hospital in the State, was declared by the head of its accident and emergency department as dangerous and unsafe.  It is unsafe because it has been reduced to operating from five cubicles, with 16 patients waiting to be seen by the accident and emergency department doctors.  There were 140 patients yesterday, which is a 35% higher than usual admission rate.  There was a cardiac arrest patient in the waiting room awaiting investigation.  Another cardiac patient was in the toilet of the department, left agitated for 32 hours while languishing on a trolley.  There are other awful cases, including two people who are 79 years old who were waiting 24 or 32 hours to be seen etc.  What can be done to provide extra resources as this is replicated in hospitals throughout the State?  We need extra resourcing as this must be tackled now.  The patients and staff deserve better.</p></speech>

Much of it includes extra transitional care beds and extra home care packages to help discharge patients from our hospitals.  It is worth noting that whereas one patient on a trolley is one too many and the difficulties felt by people and described by the Deputy is not something any of us would stand over or accept, there are 1,300 fewer patients on hospital trolleys this November as compared with last November.  Each and every day this month there have been fewer patients than on the corresponding day last month.  It is important we acknowledge that out of respect for the front-line staff and the measures they are implementing.</p>  <p>  Deputy Crowe is entirely correct on the matter of bed capacity and we do not have enough beds in the health service.  I am due to receive a bed capacity review in the next couple of weeks and that will outline how many beds we need in the health service now and into the future.  I will endeavour to progress that through our new capital plan.</p></speech>

An application was made in the summer but it still has not received an answer.  I raised the matter two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach and I raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, last week.  Both of them indicated it would be brought to the Minister's attention.  It is absolutely crucial the Minister gets involved and ensures approval is given.  The hospital needs time to get the staff in place so the beds can be available this winter rather than winter 2018.</p></speech>

That would give the people in this country billions of euro for housing, health and education, which we need so badly.  The report would examine how a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5% should be imposed.  It is currently not being imposed and this allows corporations like Apple to pay less than 1% in tax on billions of euro in profit.  The average tax rate is not the 12.5% claimed by the Government but approximately 4%.  If we had a minimum effective corporate tax rate that companies had to pay before any of these loopholes kicked in, we could raise at least another &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion in revenue, which would transform the lives of Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I appreciate the views of the Deputy on it but as I explained last night, I profoundly disagree with the approach he has taken.  I reiterate that corporation tax policy and decisions we make on how to tax activity within our country is a legitimate part of an economic and political model for a country of our scale and size, located where we are and which has proven successful over many decades in attracting investment to our country.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett and I debated last night, missing in the analysis he offers is the role of that policy in generating very valuable jobs.  There are over 200,000 such jobs in our country.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>A decision to move to the kind of tax rate and model the Deputy has described could pose a risk to those jobs.  In view of that and the need for certainty in our tax model and for it to be clearly understood and impartially implemented by the Revenue Commissioners, I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment.  As I said last night, I accept that we and many other jurisdictions must evolve and improve our tax code to ensure it meets the growing international consensus regarding how tax should be collected globally and the Government and I are playing our part in that.  However, Ireland cannot be a global tax collector for any company and we cannot do all this work on our own but, rather, it has to happen as part of a broader global journey.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300019#R00100"><p>I move amendment No. 35:</p><blockquote>In page 32, line 11, to delete &ldquo;interest paid&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;interest or other distribution payable&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>Section 19 amends section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which deals with the taxation of special purpose structured finance companies.  The current regime was set up to create a tax neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.  </p><p>Last year's Finance Act introduced restrictions on the ability of 'qualifying companies', within the meaning of section 110, to remove capital profits arising from Irish property from the Irish tax net.  </p><p>Revenue has kept the use of section 110 structures under review and has identified a gap in the Finance Act 2016 amendments, which was not identified at the time.  That gap involves the use of shares which derive their value from Irish land.  </p><p>This Report Stage amendment is technical in nature.  It corrects the drafting to ensure that the Finance Bill amendment to section 110 applies only to interest which becomes payable on or after 19 October 2017.  This ensures that there is no retrospective impact on interest which is paid on or after 19 October 2017 but which was accrued in previous years.  Without this change, the provision would affect the tax liability of a company for those previous years which would be retrospective legislation.</p><p>I commend this amendment to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300019#R00200"><p>If I understand the Minister correctly, what he says is a technical amendment is actually an amendment of very serious substance because we want retrospection.  The Minister does not.  We know that but when it comes to the section 110 tax break we absolutely want retrospection, as much of it as we can get because the section 110 tax break has been ruthlessly exploited by vulture funds to be, as the Minister describes it, "tax neutral".  I love these euphemisms.  "Tax neutral" means, for the ordinary member of the public, these financial vultures which have swept in and made an absolute fortune at our expense pay no tax on their enormous profits.  The Minister established structures that would allow them do so.</p>  <p>  For the layman who does not understand the technicalities of this, let us keep it really simple.  No worker in this country gets tax neutral status, a special dispensation not to pay any tax.  There are measures in our tax code that were designed to ensure these enormously profitable, speculative, vulture-type entities, would be "tax neutral", and would pay no tax on their income or their capital gains.  </p><p> Where the Government had made some efforts to close that loophole for the future, although not completely, the Minister says he is determined that it not be retrospective.  Most people would say that we should claw back as much as we possibly can from these vulture entities that have been let away with murder under section 110 tax breaks.  </p> <p> Will the Minister clarify that I have understood him correctly and that his fear is that unless we make this amendment, some of these section 110 companies could have a bigger tax liability, that is, the Exchequer could receive more tax revenue from these section 110 entities?  If that is what he is saying, then I will certainly vote against the Government's amendment.</p></speech>

It appears that a technical amendment is a substantive amendment, which could have substantive changes to the tax liabilities of these section 110 companies.  Will the Minister confirm that Irish property that would be put into a section 110 structure would now be taxable retrospectively and therefore would not be tax neutral if this amendment does not go through?  Will he confirm that if this amendment does go through, anything up until last year's Finance Act will continue to be able to avoid paying tax through those section 110 structures?</p></speech>

We made those changes a year ago.  We amended section 17 of the current Finance Bill as published to include shares that derive their value from Irish land in the definition of specified mortgages.  In respect of the interest issue, the Minister now proposes to make a change that may be technical but is not without consequence.  He needs to clarify this issue.</p></speech>

He needs to give the House a clear indication of the impact of this proposal will be.  Will it result in a gain to the Exchequer and if so, how much and over what period?  Alternatively, will it result in a loss to the Exchequer and if so, how much is that loss and over what period?  It is regrettable that in the case of these amendments, which are quite technical, no detailed briefing material is available, whether on a dedicated website available to people who are dealing with the Finance Bill or by way of a detailed briefing.  We need to know.  There is now a budgetary oversight committee and the Government has committed to greater transparency but it has introduced an amendment such as this without a detailed explanation of what it is about and its likely financial impact on the Exchequer, good or bad.  It is essential that the Government clarify this now.  If there is no financial impact, will the Minister tell Members in order that they can assess the proposal?</p></speech>

While colleagues may differ in their evaluation of the policy overall, the amendment deals with shares that derive their value from property that are held in section 110 companies.</p>  <p>  As for Deputy Boyd Barrett's remarks, we do not tax retrospectively.  We differ on that.  Regardless of what the asset or the income is, our approach to taxation is to tax from this moment on if we change the law, which is why I am making this change.  I do not believe that retrospective taxation would be enabled if the amendment was not passed, as it is such a well-established tenet of how we implement tax policy here.  On any benefit that the State will accrue from this amendment, we expect the financial benefit to be exceptionally small as we are not aware of this being used to avoid a tax liability but now that we are aware of the issue I want to change it.  On briefing, these amendments have been available for a period of time.  I have supplied information and clarification to anyone who has sought it from me.  I understand the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has a growing staff, which might be able to assist on matters such as this.  I will be happy to engage with the committee or any Deputy on similar issues for next year's Finance Bill to provide clarification in advance.  </p></speech>

We do not have to hand the Minister's initial note in order to go through it.  This is the problem which I raised yesterday and Deputy Burton has raised it again.  We have amendments before us, which may be very substantial, that were not in the initial draft Bill but could have significant implications and we have not been given a proper explanatory note.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the tax-neutral status of these section 110 companies and his concern that if this amendment is not made, there could be retrospection.  The Minister has said that he does not like retrospection but we do when it relates to section 110 companies.  If the Minister is saying that by not changing it that there is a possibility of retrospectively capturing some tax from section 110 companies, which have got away with murder and have avoided tax to an extent that the Minister cannot give us figures - he has never given us figures on the amounts of tax foregone as a result of the section 110 loophole - then I say to him he should leave it as it is.  Then we can see how we might use the current tax code to get some of the foregone tax lost in recent years as a result of this scandalous section 110 tax-neutral structure, which allows these vulture funds to pay no tax on enormous profits and capital gains.  I refer to shares on property, income gains and the capital gains they might make on those shares on Irish property, which has shot up in value, as well as in respect of the rental income generated from it.  </p></speech>

Will the Minister clarify whether he or his officials made an estimate as to what is the likely gain or loss to the Exchequer and over what period or whether it is neutral to the Exchequer?  If it relates to the underlying shares, that implies there are groups of shareholders who are potential beneficiaries or who will pay extra tax, we do not know which, as a consequence of this arrangement.  Will the Minister also tell us the likely value of the asset portfolios in the companies whose shares the Minister is referencing to make this mechanism available to shareholders in these companies?</p><p>When what happened in relation to section 110 was identified, there was absolute agreement across the House that the loophole should be closed and the Minister's predecessor moved to close it.  Now the Minister is making an amendment to it.  I understand it is complicated.  Tax is always complicated.  However, it is an absolutely fair demand on the Minister that he would explain to the House what it is and who broadly are the shareholders.  Are they likely to be offshore or onshore shareholders?  Are they other companies in chains of companies?  Are they individual savers?  We require an explanation.</p></speech>

Any inference that I am in any way looking to reduce the value or the impact of changes made to how these organisations were taxed in the past is wrong and inaccurate.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners regularly review the tax code to see if we need to make any changes to either deter avoidance or deal with discrepancies that might lead to difficulties in the future.  The Deputy asked me earlier if I could give the House an estimate of a yield.  I told the Deputy that I cannot and the reason is that we have no evidence at the moment that this is being used in any way to diminish a yield that the State should currently be receiving.  However, we are making this change in case it could create an opportunity in the future that we would not want someone to take advantage of or a problem for the tax code overall.</p>  <p>  The second question Deputy Burton put to me concerned who are the shareholders.  They could be any of the groups to which she referred.  I am not in a position to comment on who are the owners of shares of different organisations that fall under the heading of section 110.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, we have a clear policy difference on this matter.  For reasons we have previously debated, I do not believe retrospection would be an improvement within our tax code.  Instead it would undermine the way it has operated.  This is a principle which should be held firm for individuals, companies and organisations such as these.</p></speech>

He is amending an amendment to the section in the consolidated Act which was brought in on Committee Stage.  The amendment to section 19 of the Finance Bill was that this section would only apply to interest paid on or after 19 October 2017.  The significance of this amendment is that it does not include just interest but also other distributions payable.  There is a responsibility on the Minister for Finance to outline the purpose of section 19, the addition of "other distribution payable" and what it means and how it applies, as the Minister states, to the issue of retrospection.  This issue is not clear to us.</p>  <p>  No briefing note was circulated.  For years we have been dealing with this type of situation where technical amendments have been tabled by the Minister for Finance.  Every single year, I have asked, as a matter of course, that the speaking note the Minister is happy to put on the public record in a D&aacute;il debate would be circulated to Deputies in order that we could speed up this process.  If we knew in detail what this was about, perhaps we would not have any difficulty with it.  However, I cannot stand here and support this amendment after the Minister noted on the public record that this is about retrospection while not being clear about what the amendment specifically means, how it interacts with section 19 of the Finance Bill and how it concerns retrospection.  We know that many will try to gain the system by wrapping property up in companies and the value of the shares.  This is a big issue but it does not just relate to this matter.  We will visit it again when we deal with stamp duty issues.  However, I cannot support this amendment if the Minister does not give us a clear explanation of what exactly he is trying to achieve.</p></speech>

To deal with the issue again, as the Deputy will be aware, this year we extended the scope of this provision by also catching shares that derive their value from Irish property, which we debated on Committee Stage.  The intention was to catch any interest payments in respect of the period since budget day, which was 19 October.  However, the drafting in the Finance Bill is not quite right in that it refers to interest paid after budget day.  This, for example, means that interest which was accrued before budget day but paid out after it would be caught by the provision and this would amount to retrospection taxation.  This is the point I have been attempting to make during the debate on this amendment.  By making this change, we will catch the interest since budget day but not before.  This goes back to the differing views on retrospective taxation.</p></speech>

He put on record the rationale for the change.  He explained at the time that the package of anti-avoidance measures was being introduced to deal with a number of specific tax-avoidance schemes which had been uncovered by the Revenue Commissioners.  He said that, essentially, those schemes involved converting what should be taxable income payments into capital gains to avail of the lower capital gains tax, CGT, rates.  The Minister went into an amount of detail in that regard.  I have no issue with introducing anti-avoidance measures to deal with those contrived arrangements.</p><p>I must ask the question on behalf of those who raised the issue who claim that this will also affect bona fide commercial transactions.  Has the Minister examined the impact of this proposal in that respect because a number of people put it to me that the measure will close down most forms of commercially motivated management buy-out transactions and many third party SME company purchases because of the wording adopted?  It is important that the Department would deal with it.  That is the essential claim that is being made by some representatives and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that it would not be the case and that the anti-avoidance measures that have been introduced by him on Committee Stage are only going to affect the type of contrived arrangements we all agree should not be allowed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300023#V00200"><p>The amendment brought forward on Committee Stage to section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, in introducing a new subsection (3A), is intended to counter a specific tax avoidance scheme which has been uncovered by Revenue.  The scheme involves individuals avoiding a liability to income tax where a company indirectly buys back shares from a shareholder and the purchase is funded from the assets of the company.  The changes announced to the legislation are to ensure that distribution treatment correctly applies to such transactions.</p>  <p>  The broad policy objective of the Committee Stage amendment was to ensure that where, in effect, a shareholder receives distributable reserves of a company on a disposal of their shares in that company, then the member is treated as having received a distribution from the company which is subject to income tax.  The draft amendment meets this policy objective.</p>  <p>  That amendment, which now forms section 22 of the Finance Bill, has no impact on bona fide management buy-outs, buy-ins or third party SME company purchases.  The amendment only has application where shareholders enter into arrangements to dispose of their shares and where the consideration is paid from the assets of the target company.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many management buy-outs involve the provision of financing by the target company out of the assets of the company.  However, a bona fide buy-out is not structured on the basis of a shareholder specifically arranging for the proceeds to be funded from assets of the target company.  Bona fide financing arrangements entered into by the purchaser to fund the purchase of the shares are outside of the scope of the new provisions.  Therefore, on the basis that the proposed amendment to section 135 does apply to bona fide management buy-out transactions, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I am advised that Revenue will be issuing comprehensive guidance once the provision has been enacted and that should meet the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300023#V00300"><p>I welcome the commitment to publish guidance and also the reassurance the Minister of State has given that the provisions will not impact on bona fide commercial transactions because I know that is not the purpose of the changes introduced.  In our economy commercially motivated management buy-outs are an important feature, as are third party SME company purchases and we do not wish in any way to impact on transactions that are commercially motivated.  The nature of the anti-avoidance schemes was explained on Committee Stage, which convert what is essentially taxable income into capital gains and thus avoids the payment of CGT using certain reliefs under a certain tax structure.  I have no issue with that being addressed and I welcome the commitment and reassurance provided by the Minister of State.  I ask that Revenue would monitor the implementation of the measure to address any legitimate concerns that arise that it would in any way impede commercial transactions.  On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

It is directly related to the scandal of the &euro;13 billion Apple case.  It turns what is already an enormous scandal around that &euro;13 billion of tax that Apple should have paid but did not pay, which the Government still does not want to collect, but now we discover, courtesy of the so-called Paradise Papers that in regard to the double Irish tax scam which our tax code facilitated to the tune of &euro;13 billion in lost taxes to the people of this country, the real figure of losses may be far greater.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The reason for that is the phasing out of the double Irish was indicated as being likely to happen from the end of 2013 onwards because of political pressure in the House.  The pressure was primarily from the left, including from ourselves and Sinn F&eacute;in, and externally from people raging about tax avoidance by multinationals as well as from growing international opprobrium about the scams of these multinationals to rob ordinary people of billions in tax revenue.  That revenue could have gone into housing, health and education, especially at a time of austerity.<br/><br/>We discovered that the so-called closing of the double Irish tax scam was simply a prelude to the opening of another tax scam to benefit Apple and a few other extraordinarily wealthy corporations.  The narrative and chronology is well worth setting out.  In July 2013 Joe Higgins, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I and some others were the only people who wanted Apple brought in, along with Facebook and Google, to appear before the Joint Sub-committee on Global Taxation.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and some Independents who were on the committee closed ranks.  They said that the committee would not bring in representatives from those companies to ask questions about the double Irish.  Not only that, incredibly they turned off the cameras when we were discussing the matter.  There was an unprecedented decision to have the discussion <i>in camera</i>in private session to discuss whether the companies should come in and when a vote would be taken on whether they should come in.  Such was the degree of servility of the entire political establishment in the face of Apple when the rumours about the scale of the double Irish were abounding and being articulated by some of us in the committee.<br/><br/>When we roll the clock on, the scale of the double Irish tax scam becomes clear, as does the likelihood that the Government would be forced into agreeing to close down the loophole.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, scurried over to a private meeting with the chief executive of Apple in January 2014.  He admitted on the record when questioned by us after that meeting that corporation tax was discussed.  I would dearly like to see the minutes of those meetings or the recording of those meetings to learn what was discussed.<br/><br/>We know now, thanks to the paradise papers, that in March, shortly after that meeting, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple started to contact Appleby.  The legal firm specialises in tax avoidance for big corporations.  Apple contacted the legal firm's subsidiaries in March 2014 in the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.  They are all tax havens where there is no corporate tax.  Apple settled on Jersey.  The legal firm acting on behalf of Apple asked whether the jurisdiction in question could confirm that an Irish company could conduct management activities without been subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.  Apple was busy reconfiguring the tax scam and using its Irish companies because of the possibility of the double Irish being closed down.  The then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, went over and met Apple representatives later in the year.  We had a debate at the committee on the 2014 budget.  At the debate I suggested, to much ridicule from the Government, that the much trumpeted double Irish will, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies will be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes but in a slightly different way by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>I did not know how right I was.  The scam was already being planned.  The replacement of the double Irish was already being engineered by the Government and Apple.  How else can the Minister explain the extraordinary coincidence of Apple not paying a single extra cent of tax after the closing of the double Irish, the reconfiguration of its subsidiaries to Jersey and the interaction allowing them to pay no tax?  That has been confirmed by Seamus Coffey.  According to Seamus Coffey, raising the cap to 100% on intangible assets meant that we lost &euro;722 million in tax revenue in 2015.  Mr. Coffey went on to comment on the changes the Government brought in through a recent budget.  He said they are only active from the day of the budget.  He points out that they could have applied to all claims during the period when the Government had raised the allowance to 100%.  He said that would have resulted in up to &euro;1 billion of additional corporation tax being collected in 2018.  In other words, this is not simply history.  The Government decided not to take &euro;1 billion from Apple under next year's budget.  We can only imagine what that could have done for the housing crisis, the health crisis and the lives of people who are chronically under-resourced in areas of key public services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300024#W00200"><p>I went back to look at the debate in the D&aacute;il when this cap was removed to enable full exemption on intangible assets.  The change was brought in by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  He said:</p><blockquote>Section 35 provides for additional enhancements to section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the provision of certain intangible assets for use in an Irish trade. It removes the current cap on the aggregate amount of allowances and related interest expenses that may be claimed and amends the definition of intangible assets which may qualify for the relief to specifically include certain customer lists.</blockquote><p>That is it.  It is completely innocuous.  It was simply a paragraph in a Second Stage speech by the then Minister for Finance.</p><p>However, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Minister knew what the consequence would be.  He knew he was facilitating massive tax avoidance by Apple and other corporations.  He knew that working with intangible assets is a key mechanism by which these companies avoid taxation.  He knew that what subsequently happened would happen.  As the Government is aware, what happened was an explosion of foreign direct investment in intangible assets.  The relevant figure went from approximately &euro;3 billion to approximately &euro;29 billion.  That was an explosion of &euro;26 billion as a result of one paragraph in that speech and one law that was changed for the benefit of these corporations.</p><p>We need answers from the Government.  It is good that the Government is going back to change this under extraordinary pressure.  How can the Government justify the original change being made?  We can read papers on what qualifies as, and the indicators of, tax havens.  There is a paper by Taylor, Richardson and Lanis based on data from Australian and US companies.  They identified large inward movement of intangible assets as tending towards proof of the country in question being a tax haven.  It is a key indicator of a tax haven.  Ireland has this by the bucket-load in view of the explosion in activity that has taken place.</p><p>The Government has a problem in light of Seamus Coffey's paper.  The paper highlights the explosion of &euro;26 billion and explains why it occurred.  It also explains that if the 80% cap had been in place in 2015, then almost &euro;6 billion of these allowances would not have been allowable and would have been subject to tax in 2015.  Had that been the case, up to &euro;722 million in additional corporation tax would have been collected in 2015.  Seamus Coffey went on to say that we do not know what impact not removing that cap would have had and he said that it is unknowable.  The point is the measure does not add anything to the Irish economy.  The Government likes to talk about jobs, etc., but the movement of these intangible assets has nothing whatsoever to do with jobs.</p><p>Another important point was raised by Seamus Coffey.  He maintains not only do we not benefit from this inflow of intangible assets over this period, but in fact we lose out.  We lose out because it is a key factor in the increase in our gross national income and, therefore, the increase in our contribution to the European Union budget.</p><p>He outlines how the payments from the Exchequer account for Ireland's contributions increasing from slightly less than &euro;1.7 billion in 2014 to &euro;2 billion in 2015 and again in 2016, to &euro;2.3 billion in 2017 and &euro;2.65 billion in 2018.  There is a cost, in cent and euro, for the artificial inflation of our gross national income, GNI, and a significant reason is the increase in supposed intangible assets investment in Ireland.</p> <p> This returns us to the point made about the finance curse and the fact that the country is being run for elites who do not live here.  Policy has been captured by these elites and we go to such extreme lengths to shape policy for their interests that we offer them a tax haven and allow them to use this country to avoid paying large amounts of tax for years.  We then end up paying for it through an increase in our contribution to the European Union budget. </p> <p> For these reasons, the Government should agree to the proposal to have a report done on how much income we have foregone, the reasons the changes in the 2014 budget were made and the reason the Government, under pressure, agreed to reverse them.  Does the Minister now accept it was not a good idea to introduce the change and that, rather than benefitting the real economy, we incurred only losses through the increased payment to the EU?  Alternatively, does he maintain that the change was good for a certain period but is no longer a good idea?  We need to know the answer to these important questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Seamus Coffey's report, on which he did excellent work in flagging up this issue, was interesting and embarrassing for the Government.  What was more embarrassing, however, was Mr. Coffey's blog in which he asked why one would allow a 100% cap for intellectual property that had been already onshored.  This is not like our previous conversation about retrospective taxation because the capital allowances in question must be used year after year.  We are not arguing that capital allowances used prior to 2017 would have a different rate applied to them but that from this point onwards, a company would be able to use only 80% against its tax liability.  This does not deal with the issue.  That is not an issue of the core retrospection of taxation.</p>  <p>  Mr. Coffey made clear that &euro;850 million in revenue will be lost to the State as a result of a couple of words the Minister is willing to insert in this Bill, for whatever reason.  The Minister informs us the Government does not do tax policy for individual companies.  In this case, the policy is not designed for an individual company because a group of companies, albeit a small one, will benefit.  There is serious suspicion about the reasons this has been done.  I would like to know which companies, groups or representatives of groups the Department and Minister consulted on this amendment and section.  All this information should be placed in the public domain because transparency is needed.</p>  <p>  This tax measure will allow well known multinational companies such as Apple to pay very little tax on substantial sales they are recording in this State.  Let us examine precisely what is being done here.  Until 2015, Apple recorded all of its sales outside the Americas in Ireland.  It did this through a stateless company.  As a result, even though all the sales were being recorded through a company in Cork, which had no employees or management structure, it did not pay tax on these sales because the company was not tax resident here or anywhere else in the world.  This loophole was closed down in 2014.  We learned in the Paradise Papers that Apple subsequently changed its structures and Apple itself told the media two weeks ago that all of its sales outside of the Americas continue to go through an Irish company.  This time, however, the company is tax resident, which means Apple must pay taxes arising from these sales in Ireland.  This is what happens normally across the world.  Whether a company is producing widgets in a factory in Mayo or crisps in Gaobh Dobhair, it pays taxes in the country in which it is tax resident.  Why then have Apple's taxes not increased significantly?  The reason is that when the tax residency laws were changed in 2014, the Government set a timeframe for implementing the change and introduced the 100% cap.  As a result, the company in Cork which now owns the intellectual property of Apple, which bought it from the company that is offshored on the Isle of Man, now holds these capital assets that it can write off against its profits.  That is what is happening here.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Government will argue that the measure results in the deferment of tax and that once the capital allowances are paid, the companies in question will have to pay additional taxes.  There is no guarantee that when that time comes, these companies, given their current structure and form, will be resident here, will still have their current structures or will have profits that are taxable.  Some of the intellectual property, particularly that which is based on patent protections, may generate profits while such protection lasts but will evaporate when the patent protections expire. </p>  <p>  This is a core issue involving &euro;850 million of tax foregone.  As has been pointed out, the increase in intellectual property also impacts on gross national income and results in an increase of &euro;200 million in our annual payment to the European Union.  Despite this, the Government has decided not to tax this intellectual property because it was onshored heretofore.  This is the wrong policy.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Minister on this issue.  It is not a case of trying to screw Apple or the multinationals but an issue of achieving tax fairness.  I am not asking the Minister to change the rates that applied ten, seven or five years ago.  My argument is that if capital allowances are to be used against profits that are generated by a company in 2018, 2019 or 2020, a cap of 80% should apply.  What the Minister is building into the Bill is a 100% cap for profits that are generated in future, which is not acceptable. </p>  <p>  We have all seen the manoeuvres and tut-tutting Ministers engage in concerning tax schemes, such as the so-called single malt.  Earlier this week, we were told the Government was examining the single malt.  The scheme is not new as it has been on the radar for some time.  A report by Christian Aid brought the issue into the public domain in a very understandable way.  As I stated, however, the single malt was raised directly with the previous Minister for Finance by my colleague, Matt Carthy, MEP, a year and a half ago in the European Parliament.  It is Government policy and when the public finds out about it and anger spills over at some point, the Government tut-tuts and states it is focusing on the issue and will make a change in the next finance Bill.  It then introduces this type of scam - it cannot be described as a loophole if it is, like this one to apply a cap post-2018, deliberately inserted in the finance Bill.  </p>  <p>  This is not a minor issue.  Many of the provisions we have discussed cost significant amounts of money and can result in significant losses to the State.  The chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the person who the Government asked to carry out a report on corporation tax, is telling us the State will lose &euro;850 million per annum as a result of this measure and argues there is no reason the cap cannot be applied to intangible assets that have been onshore until now. </p></speech>

The Minister indicated previously that this is a timing issue and the amount of tax paid will be the same over the relevant period.  Mr. Coffey questions that view, although he does not definitively state it is wrong.</p><p>Given the pace of change in corporation tax globally and in how these companies structure their affairs, it is a valid question to ask.</p> <p> The Minister provided for a yield in the budget day book of &euro;150 million in 2018 from this measure.  I question the basis of that.  The capital allowances related to the intellectual property, IP, that was onshored prior to budget day can be used to shelter 100% of relevant income and one would have to question whether these companies will continue to transfer IP to Ireland, what impact it will have on such activity and whether there will be a yield of &euro;150 million from this measure in 2018.  The Minister needs to explain the basis of that.</p> <p> The impact of the removal of the 80% cap in budget 2015 was quite extraordinary.  The scale of the impact was mind-boggling.  In 2014, the capital allowances claimed on IP amounted to &euro;2.6 billion and the following year, in 2015, they amounted to almost &euro;29 billion.  We have the data in respect of the onshoring.  The Minister confirmed it in parliamentary questions that, "While data on the value of intangible assets onshored through this channel is more limited, the relocations in 2015 along with RandD related imports added approximately &euro;300 billion to Ireland's capital stock."  Corporation tax receipts increased quite substantially in 2015.  That has to be acknowledged as well.  They went up by &euro;2.3 billion, increasing by 50% more than the Government had envisaged.</p> <p> The changes in 2015, as a result of the removal of the cap, were staggering and we are still dealing with the fallout from that.  The Minister is reinstating the cap at 80% and he has made what he has confirmed is a policy decision that the change only applies to IP that is onshored after budget day.  In other words, the capital allowances relating to the IP that was already here on budget night can continue to be used to shelter 100% of the relevant income.  The Minister needs to explain in detail the basis of that policy decision.  We learned on Committee Stage that it is not a recommendation from the Department of Finance officials.  It is very much a policy decision.</p> <p> The Minister needs to explain the implications of not putting in the effective date of budget night.  He needs to explain what would be the implications if he was to say that the future claims of capital allowances against all IP now here would be subject to the 80% restriction in terms of the relevant income that can be sheltered by it.  Presumably, those implications, which the Minister has assessed and has thought through, are the reasons he has decided not to apply it in that manner.</p> <p> Given the scale of what happened in 2015 and given that this is an important policy decision, the Minister needs to explain what level of consultation there has been and with whom, for instance, individual companies and representative bodies.  All of that needs to be in the public domain and on the public record in order that we can have the fullest possible information as to what has guided and informed what the Minister stated is a policy decision, not a recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300026#Y00200"><p>The decision that was made by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, at that point on the management of capital allowances and the rate at which their depreciation could be discounted in the tax code was the right decision then on the basis of what we understood about the magnitude of those assets then, on the basis of how we treated at that point other assets in the tax code, and on the basis of how intangible assets were taxed in other countries against which we would benchmark ourselves and against which we need to be competitive for investment, for the registration of assets and for the maintenance of jobs.  The decision that I am making to go back to the 80% is the right one now.  I have made a policy choice.  I made that policy choice in consultation with my officials because, of course, the Department of Finance outlines choices to me and gives views on this matter.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say, as it was acknowledged by a number of speakers, that the Seamus Coffey report laid out a broad policy direction on this, but it is up to me regarding the timing and how it is implemented, and as Minister for Finance I have made that policy choice.  I have made that policy choice for two reasons.  First, I looked at the value of intellectual property assets as we understand them now, the way in which they move across the world and the impact that they have on payments that the Exchequer needs to make, and I decided that now it is right to tax them in the way I have described in the Finance Bill, and that is what I have done.</p>  <p>  On the reason for the timing and how I have done that, I believe there is an opportunity for Ireland across the coming years to get to a point where we have employment, research, manufacturing and the registration of intellectual property assets related to all of those activities all located in our country.  Getting to a place where we have both commercial activity and employment and registration of assets related to that work - all, or most of it - located in Ireland for a company, it is my judgment that, over the years ahead with all of the change that could develop around our country, this could offer a new form of competitive advantage to Ireland.  That is why I have made the choice on the timing of this.</p>  <p>  It was acknowledged, in fairness, by those who are criticising what I have done, that this affects the timing as to when the tax will come in rather than the magnitude of the tax itself.  The expectation is that, if those companies stay present in Ireland and if the assets remain located in Ireland, at a point in the future we will gain those tax payments, and this decision is about affecting the timing of when we will be able to receive that tax revenue.  I made that choice, as I explained a moment ago, because I believe bringing in this tax change in the way I have done will best serve and allow us to meet an opportunity that is there for Ireland to tax these assets better and combine the location of these assets with other forms of economic activity in our country.  I was not under pressure to make this move.  It was something that formed a core recommendation of the Coffey report and I made that recommendation myself.</p>  <p>  I already answered questions on Committee Stage about who I met about this, but I will answer again.  I met the American Chamber of Commerce.  In my meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce, this matter did not come up.  However, I had many meetings with my officials on this and other policy choices that were presented to me, and in those meetings the officials outlined different options that were open to me, and I made this choice.</p>  <p>  Returning to a question that was asked about what happened in 2014 when the treatment of it was changed, it is important to put on the record of the House that the reason this was done, and it has also led to reasons I have now decided to make this change, was to change the tax treatment of these assets, to bring it into line with how some of these assets were taxed elsewhere, and to bring the treatment of those assets into line with how we taxed comparable assets in the tax code then.  That is the reason it was done.  It is important to acknowledge that in the subsequent period, other changes have taken place across the world, primarily driven by the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process that is under way, that have changed how those assets are taxed elsewhere.</p><p>It meant that companies which have incredibly valuable designs or brands looked for new places in which to locate.  They are the policy reasons behind that change.  I have made this change now because I believe this is the fairest and most effective way for us to tax very valuable assets such as these.</p></speech>

That is what happens.  The company gives these assets precisely the value that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax.  That is the way it works and Seamus Coffey says it very clearly.  The increase in capital allowances almost exactly offsets the increase in intangible asset-related profits such that the onshoring of these assets resulted in little or no additional corporation tax being collected in 2015.  That is the way it has always worked, including with the double Irish.  He also pointed out that the Minister's decision to not apply the new reduced cap on the allowance for intangible assets was unprecedented in terms of the treatment of such assets because whenever changes were made previously, they applied to all claims.  He points out that the specific regime for capital allowances for intangible assets was introduced in 2009.  Amendments were introduced in the Finance Acts from 2010 to 2014.  He goes through a number of the changes and points out that all previous changes to the regime applied to all claims for capital allowances related to expenditure on intangible assets and were applied to all claims for capital allowances under the regime.  The most recent change is the first occasion on which a change was introduced to the regime that only applies to new claims.  Who does that suit?  It suits Apple and a few other companies.  In fact, the full extent of the lost tax revenue is apparent in the Revenue tables on tax expenditures which jump by about &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion between 2014 and 2015.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance now says that it was purely based on the information that we had at the time, the situation in terms of the tax regimes of competing countries and so forth.  He is saying that it had nothing to do with the fact that this was when the pressure was mounting and the Government was forced to end, or at least wind down, the double Irish regime.  He is claiming that it is purely a coincidence that the Government announced the ending, or winding down over an extended period, of the Double Irish at the same time as opening up that tax loophole.  It seems to me to be quite an extraordinary coincidence that one tax avoidance opportunity would be closed and another one would open up, without any relationship.  Of course, the same budget marked the beginning of the so-called knowledge development box.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister saying that if he had the information that was available to the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, he would make the same decision?  If the Minister had the information that he has now about the situation that pertained then, would he also have made the same decision?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister have any estimate of the amount of revenue lost by the change implemented in budget 2015 and the cost to the Exchequer in terms of the increase in payments to the EU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300027#Z00400"><p>The Minister may have misheard me earlier.  I was not acknowledging that this was an issue of tax deferred or an issue of timing.  What I was saying was that this was what the Minister would claim.  I went on to point out that it may not be the case because the companies may not be here in ten years' time when all of the capital allowances are used.  Allowances for intangible assets, which have patent protection would have lost value and so on and the structures could have changed.  Had we taken that approach with Nokia, for example, as has been pointed out by the author of the report, we would have been caught well short.  Companies change, move, change their structures and so forth.  We know that Apple did it in 2015, so it is not just a case of money that will come to us at a future point in time.</p>  <p>  The Minister says that this was the right decision at the time but it was not.  He said that it was the right decision at the time with the knowledge that was available.  What was that knowledge?  What we know now is that the Minister's predecessor, his Fine Gael colleague, was lobbied through the Department by multinational companies, a multinational tax planner and by the representative body for US multinationals and lo and behold, who benefits from this?  Who benefits, not to the tune of a couple of bob here or there, a couple of thousand, million or even billion euro?  We are talking about massive amounts of money and it was the American multinationals who benefitted from the decision.  They lobbied for this.  They asked the Government to do this.  They asked the Government to increase the cap.  A multinational tax planner argued in a submission to the Department that the multinationals needed certainty about the onshoring of intellectual property, IP, because the Government was changing the tax residency rules.  If there is one reason to vote against this Finance Bill, it is this.  This amounts to &euro;850 million next year, the year after and the year after that.  It is &euro;850 million that the Minister is deciding not to collect now because he wants all of the IP that was onshored to be able to be used against future profits these companies may generate in order that they can write down their tax liability to close to zero.  </p></speech>

However, in setting out options, he said that the Department would also convey views.  Has the Department given a view or a recommendation on this specific issue?  It is important that the Minister would answer that question.  How long will it be before the capital allowances in respect of the IP onshored prior to budget day will have been exhausted?  That is a particular number of years.  How long before that will be exhausted?  The Minister did not answer the question about the yield from this.  What is the basis of the estimate that this will bring in an additional &euro;150 million in 2018?</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to deal with the issue of the risk that this is not a timing issue and that there is a loss to the Exchequer as a result of this over time.  This goes back to the points that Seamus Coffey made when he outlined three key risks in that regard.  First, it requires the profits to be present in the future in order for the tax to be collected.  Second, some of the intangible assets will, by their very nature, be time limited.  Third, there is a risk of the asset leaving the country when the capital allowances have been exhausted.  Capital allowances will be exhausted at some point in time so the argument that it is a timing issue is dependent on there still being taxable income in respect of those companies after the capital allowances in respect of the IP onshored up to budget day have been exhausted.  That really is the nub of the issue.</p></speech>

The pros and cons of different options were outlined and it was left to me to make the choice and that is what I have done.  That is what I am stating in the D&aacute;il here this afternoon.</p>  <p>  Several questions were put to me that I have not answered to date.  Deputy McGrath just asked how long we believe it will take before existing allowances are fully exhausted or used.  That depends on how the lifetime of the asset is currently being accounted for by companies.</p><p>We believe that, across a five-year to ten-year period, we will see all of the relevant allowances for these kinds of assets fully drawn down.</p> <p> In regard to the Deputy's question about the risks that are outlined by Mr. Coffey, I acknowledge those risks are there but I believe they are outweighed by Ireland getting to a point where we can have the co-location of IP assets and economic activity about further investment and jobs located here.  I believe that is a long-term, valuable opportunity for Ireland in a quickly changing world.</p> <p> In regard to the question on yield, I estimate the costing is &euro;5 million for every &euro;150 million that is located here in Ireland.  To look at the quantity of movement in Ireland in 2016 and on the available figures for 2017, I believe that &euro;150 million figure will be achievable.  On the question on the cost of EU contributions, the figure is approximately &euro;200 million.</p></speech>

This, in my opinion, is an even bigger scandal and, at the very least, it needs to be investigated.  It is inexplicable that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 2014 changed the tax code around intangible assets to essentially neutralise the impact of closing down the double Irish tax scam.  One tax scam closed down and another one opened, directly as a result of a decision made by Deputy Noonan and the Government which has not been explained.  To get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets is extraordinary, in and of itself, but to get 100%, and for the former Minister to make that decision in 2014, is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  For the current Minister, similarly, having recognised that this needs to be changed, to then make a decision not to ensure that we collect an extra &euro;800 million a year, and to essentially exempt the claims from before budget day, is extraordinary and, again, the only beneficiary can be Apple and that small group of corporations.  They designed this and the Minister has danced to their tune.  Hundreds of millions are being lost which people desperately need in this country for housing and health.  That is what this exposes.  At the very least, we want a thorough investigation so all of the facts can be laid out before the people and they can judge what was lost, why decisions were made and whether it is, as I believe, one of the biggest scandals, if not the biggest scandal, it is possible to imagine in this country in terms of people having tax revenues stolen from them.</p></speech>

A carve-out was built in regarding non-bank lenders that were involved in loan origination business, meaning that non-bank lenders with hundreds of millions lent to Irish businesses and with profits in the millions could continue to pay as little tax as &euro;250 per annum.  BlueBay Ireland is one of the beneficiaries of this treatment.  It has lent out more than &euro;160 million across the State.  BlueBay has issued debt to, among many others, the fast food restaurant company Abrakebabra and the Mater Private Hospital.  I assume, on looking at its lending rates, the blended average of the loan book is in the region of 6%.  This would mean profits in the millions in 2016.  Looking at its accounts, which can be seen by anyone who wants to look at them, we see the total sum it paid in tax on those millions in profits was &euro;250.  Irish banks will not pay tax for 20 years because of the losses they have carried forward, but these non-bank lenders are not paying tax either.  There are other sweetheart deals in respect of some multinationals that we discussed on previous amendments but this was supposed to be dealt with when we dealt with the section 110s in last year's Finance Bill.  This whole section, in the context of section 110, is dodgy, and the evidence suggests it needs further tidying up, to say the least.  It is incredible that a foreign bank can set up a section 110 company, and we have examples of this.  That company then lends into this State hundreds of millions of euro and makes profits on that lending and, because it is in this type of vehicle, no tax is payable.  BlueBay is not unique in this regard.  There are other such companies that pay as little as &euro;250 in tax.  I imagine the Minister will take to his feet and, without naming the company, present words to the House that will somehow justify that a company recording millions of euro in profit pays &euro;250 in tax, yet he says this State is not facilitating State-sponsored tax avoidance.  That is exactly what this is.</p></speech>

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax-neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.</p>  <p>  Loan originations involve a section 110 company fronting for a foreign bank and either lending directly to larger, more sophisticated borrowers or immediately issuing newly made loans to smaller borrowers from foreign banks.  Provided the foreign bank is established in one of the countries with which we have signed a double tax agreement, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.  As the original creditor, there can be no taxable capital gain on any subsequent sale of the loans.  If the loan origination company is a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it can operate in a tax-neutral manner in Ireland using a section 110 company.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that in the Finance Act 2016, the reporting requirements for section 110 companies were enhanced.  As a result, the Revenue Commissioners will have access to more information and at an earlier time regarding these companies.  However, getting complete data from the Revenue Commissioners may take longer than the timeframe suggested by the Deputy.  Given this constraint, it would not be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested report into legislation.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Finance Act 2016 changes, the desire was to address issues relating to property and property-based loans.  I acknowledge, however, that issues outside property are more complex and I want to ensure that section 110 operates in a proper manner.  If concerns are raised regarding the operation of section 110 in the loan origination space, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners and my officials to investigate these concerns.  Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, officials from the Department of Finance will continue to work with the Revenue Commissioners to analyse the use of the section 110 regime to minimise tax avoidance opportunities.</p>  <p>  I cannot therefore accept the proposed amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300030#FF00300"><p>I note the Minister said he will ask the Revenue Commissioners to investigate any concerns regarding section 110s.  The problem is that BlueBay, for example, is owned by the Royal Bank of Canada.  Obviously, there is a different currency here; this section 110 company was set up in Ireland and money filtered through the Royal Bank of Canada into the section 110 company.  A total of &euro;160 million of it went into the Mater Private, Abrakebabra and others and a 6% interest rate was recorded on that, which gave the company taxable profits in their millions on which it paid &euro;250 in tax.  That is what is happening with BlueBay or, really, with Royal Bank of Canada.  The Minister would argue for this in terms of double tax treaties but if the Royal Bank of Canada wanted to lend here, it would face serious barriers regarding currency and other issues.  The problem is that this is completely legal because when we dealt with section 110 companies - and I quizzed the Minister's predecessor on this at the time - loan originators were carved out from it.  We made an exception for loan originator companies.  I question whether there are issues of state aid if a foreign bank can come in, lend on, structure it within a section 110 company in Ireland and not pay any tax in respect of the profits it records from its lending activity.  I have serious concerns about this.  While I heard what the Minister said about the timing of this issue, I believe a report within six months is possible.  There may need to be a further assessment afterwards but the Minister needs to start the ball rolling in this regard.  I have been raising this since the Government carried out this carve-out two years ago and I am not satisfied with the response the Minister has given.  I note he will ask the Revenue Commissioners to investigate these matters, which I welcome, but he needs to go further.</p></speech>

If the activity to which the Deputy refers is due to the operation of a double taxation agreement, and if a company is not paying tax in one jurisdiction, it will pay tax on that economic activity in the other jurisdiction.</p><p>In regard to what I said earlier, not only have I asked the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the matter, I have also asked my officials apprise me of the matter because, as I said on Committee Stage, I acknowledge that issues outside the management of property are more complicated.  I want to ensure that section 110, as it is structured, operates in a proper manner and does not maximise tax avoidance opportunities.</p></speech>

I presume we will return to this issue again and again.  There are serious issues.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this and the Minister has mentioned again that where there are double taxation treaties, there would be no tax liability.  I seriously question that.  Does that mean that the Royal Bank of Scotland operated here on a tax-free basis?  Does that mean any foreign bank can lend into the State tax-free?  I doubt that is the case.  However, when a company sets up a non-bank lender which uses section 110 of our tax code, it then becomes tax-free.</p>  <p>  There are serious lending impediments to lending for firms not located in this jurisdiction, including transfer issues, currency costs, having personnel in the country and so on.  I want a report.  The Minister has given no commitment to come back with any type of assessment.  He gave a commitment to ask the Revenue and his officials to apprise him of the issue and determine whether there are any problems, but there is nothing in terms of transparency.</p>  <p>  The Minister has not committed to bringing forward any type of report.  He is not committed to providing any information to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach or the Committee on Budgetary Oversight or parliamentarians in the House which would better inform us of this issue, if so required, or reassure us that there are no issues.  My amendment is an attempt to deal with the fact that there are non-bank lenders in the State which are branches of international banks making millions in profit by using a section unique to our tax code, that is, section 110, and paying only &euro;250 in tax.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300033#JJ00100"><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I move amendment No. 42:</p><blockquote>In page 41, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;25.</b>The Minister shall, within six months from the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available to restrict banks from carrying forward losses against taxable profits of the banks, which could result in many institutions paying no corporation tax for the foreseeable future.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>This is a very simple amendment, the provisions of which we have been debating for several years since the Government changed our tax code to allows banks to carry forward 100% of their losses against profits recorded.  The Minister will correctly say that is standard accounting practice and is allowed for every company in Ireland.  However, we must acknowledge that when the NAMA Act was going through the Oireachtas in 2009 at a time of great pressure, the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, had the foresight to recognise that while the banks were bust and needed to bailed out by the Irish people and had losses of tens of billions of euro - at that early stage the quantity of the losses were not known but there was an indication of how large they would be - when the banks became profitable again, normal accounting practice under the tax code should not apply to them because they would doubly benefit by not paying tax for a long period until all the losses they had incurred were absorbed, as well as the Irish public having had to put its hand in its pocket to pay for those losses.  He made it very clear that should not apply to Irish banks that were guaranteed by the State and needed to be bailed out, which is why he introduced through the NAMA Act a change to the legislation to allow for only 50% of losses to be carried forward.</p><p>Similar to some of the points earlier made by the Minister's regarding intangible assets, this is a deferred tax.  The same amount of tax will be paid unless the bank leaves the country or goes bust.  Had the Brian Lenihan provision been kept in place, the banks would pay tax this year, next year and the year after.  They can afford to do so.  AIB is on course to record &euro;1.5 billion profits this year, Bank of Ireland recorded &euro;1 billion profits last year and Permanent TSB went into profitability last year.  In spite of that, AIB and Permanent TSB told the finance committee that on current projections, it will be 20 years before they start to pay taxes to the Irish public.  That is not acceptable to me, my party or the majority of the Irish people who understand the pain and suffering the people went through as a consequence of picking up the tab for those banks.</p><p>The Minister will point to the banking levy.  It is a separate entity and also applies to banks that did not cause financial distress in the State.  This amendment addresses a very clear issue in terms of carrying forward losses and that Members believe it is not right for one of the most profitable banks in Europe, which will record &euro;1.5 billion in profits this year, not to pay any corporation tax for 20 years.  My five year old will hopefully have finished college by then and be out in the world on his own.  He will still be shouldering the banking debt because of the Anglo bonds and so on but it is only at that stage that AIB will start to pay tax.  That is unacceptable.</p><p>Although I disagree with it, there was a reason at the time for the Government to change the Lenihan provision and that was because of the way capital losses are accounted for in terms of the capital within the accounts of the banks.  The Government's argument was that if the tax code was not changed, the State may have had to provide additional capital to the banks, which would be completely unacceptable to the Irish people.  The Minister was right to make that case.  However, the current financial position of AIB tells us that if we revert to the position of the Lenihan provision, the State would not have to provide any additional capital.  The same is true for Bank of Ireland.  This is about raw fairness, which Irish people understand.  We bailed out the banks that crushed the economy and destroyed families.</p><p>Members alone will make the decision on this issue.  We have been sent here to make decisions such as this and within the next 30 minutes will have to decide whether we will accept that the most profitable banks in Europe will not pay a penny in corporation tax for over 20 years or will start to pay a portion of tax from next year while still allowing them to carry forward their losses and exhaust them over a longer period of time.  However, at least the banks would then be starting to contribute to tax revenue and that could be used to provide for the real issues facing our people, society and country.  Because it increases the fiscal space, it could be used to build houses, create child care places, extend hospitals in order that they have enough beds and provide greater protection for those who need it.  Members need to decide on that issue within the next 30 minutes.  I appeal to them to do what is right and what I believe the Irish people want us to do, which is to ensure fairness is brought to the heart of this discussion and this part of our tax code and to bring back the Lenihan provision that, with the foresight of what he believed the situation was going to be, would ensure profitable banks would pay some taxes.  He knew they were going to be profitable again and, by God, they have become profitable on the backs of the Irish people.  Now, not in 20 years' time, is when they should start to pay their taxes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300033#JJ00200"><p>The provision inserted by the late Brian Lenihan and referred to by Deputy Doherty involved much foresight and upheld the principle in our corporate tax code that trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely.  The provision did not disallow tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used by limiting the set-off to 50% of profit in any given year.  Each year, at least half the profit would, therefore, be subject to tax and could not be sheltered by losses brought forward.  That was changed in the Finance Act 2014, as referred to by Deputy Doherty.</p>  <p>  The bank levy is not relevant to this discussion as it is a separate matter and is levied for different reasons.  It is based on the deposit books of the institutions concerned.  However, the relevant figures show that as at June of this year the deferred tax assets of Bank of Ireland included an amount of &euro;1.25 billion in respect of tax losses available to relieve future profits from tax, while at the end of last year AIB had recognised deferred tax assets of &euro;2.9 billion and Permanent TSB had deferred tax assets and tax losses carried forward of &euro;373 million, equating to tax losses of just under &euro;3 billion.</p>  <p>  The Minister in effect promised a report.</p><p>The Minister needs to deliver a report on this issue.  Before I made a decision on whether to change the policy I would need to see the full information.  We have it on record from some banks that changing this provision, or reverting to the original provision in respect of limiting the losses that can be offset against profits, would not impact on their capital position in terms of the State having to inject new capital.  We need to know the implications for Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB, which it is widely known is not in such a strong position.  We need that assessment and those facts on the impact on core tier 1 capital and on whether additional capital would have to be injected in the case of one bank I mentioned.</p> <p> I respect and accept the principle of trading losses being carried forward indefinitely to be set off against future profits, and I support that.  By any definition the events that happened between 2008 and 2011 or so, when the recapitalisation of the banks and the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, transfers occurred and the losses were crystallised on the banks' books, were truly exceptional and extraordinary and resulted in enormous losses and deferred tax assets on the books of the banks.</p> <p> The Minister needs to prepare a report on this issue.  I understood it was pledged, in what form I am not entirely sure, but the Minister needs to do that.  It is important that we tread carefully, that any change in policy is well thought through and that it examines all the consequences and fall out from such a change.  We need that analysis and assessment and I hope the Minister will accept at least one of these amendments. </p></speech>

The majority of people do not realise how this country is run.  If they knew a little bit more about what does happen and how things are done there would be much more anger.</p>  <p>  The notion that banks that were rescued because there was a banking crisis and austerity was introduced to help deal with its outcome, are back making money and can put off losses against that is ridiculous.  I agree as well that companies have to be able to carry losses and get fairness but this is a completely different situation.  If these banks had not been bailed out by the people, I would say fine, let them keep on carrying the losses forward.  It is not that the banks solved their own problems.  They did not.  The State decided to bail them out and that meant the people bailed them out.  It is irrational to equate them with normal companies.  Aside from the figures Deputy Doherty mentioned about the profits they are about to make, when these guys got a bit of oxygen in their lungs and got back on their feet they started to throw some people out of their homes.  History will be pretty unkind to this period in terms of many decisions that were made and how those people have behaved.  The Minister should try to relate this to a normal situation in life where somebody is on the flat of their back, cannot eat or drink, is out for the count until someone comes along and rescues them, makes them strong again, feeds and nurtures them back to health and then they turn on the same people who nursed them back to health and look to throw some of them out of their homes.  How can we ever say that was the right thing to do?  I do not understand how we can.  The notion that they would not pay their fair share of tax now is ridiculous.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300034#KK00300"><p>We have discussed this several times before with the Minister.  I am sorry to say the Government is really cowardly on this issue.  To recall the figures for the well-known banking sector, the high street banks, AIB has &euro;3 billion of deferred tax assets.  They are called deferred tax assets because they are worth that in terms of AIB being able to reduce its tax bill now that it has begun to make profits.  We are all delighted that AIB is back in business and is doing much better because everybody in the State bailed it out.  A deferred tax asset is part of the balance sheet and value structure.  Perhaps the Minister is holding this deferred tax asset in this way in order to boost the company's value.  Bank of Ireland has &euro;1.3 billion in deferred tax assets, that is losses from the crash period which it can utilise as it begins to make profit and write off all of its profits without paying any tax.  Somebody working in a hotel or restaurant will pay tax on their low income: somebody who is making profits of &euro;1 billion a year will pay no tax.  That situation will possibly continue because the bank will have capital allowances, intellectual property rights and so on.  Permanent TSB has &euro;373 million in deferred tax assets.  We got a cheery little public relations statement during the week from KBC.  I do not know whether it was toasting itself in the bank's headquarters because its owners abroad and staff in Ireland have discovered that they have approximately &euro;128 million.  That is all but that is still a good little deferred tax asset to have.  There is also a wide range of other financial companies for which we do not know the details.  There is a wide range of construction and development, land and property, companies, which because of the crash also have deferred tax assets.</p>  <p>  The Minister has refused to address this issue.  There are several ways to address it.  From a fairness point of view, is it really correct that a family earning two salaries, whose joint worth ranges between &euro;80,000 and &euro;120,000, is properly contributing income tax, pay related social insurance, PRSI, and so on, and that a small business, a shop in any part of Ireland, that makes a profit of &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 potentially has to make a corporation tax contribution?  We are very good at talking about the corporation tax contribution because, rightly, we say our corporation tax is very low, and the Minister has defended this.  It is 12.5%.  It is not as high as the top marginal rate of income tax that the couple on &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000 will pay.  The effective rate of tax in their joint cases is likely to be approximately 35%.  We have tax structures that must raise the money we need to run the country but the Minister is saying that the banks and the construction and development companies, particularly those which speculated, drove the property bubble and crashed the economy bringing the banks with them, will be singled out for Fine Gael's and the Independent Alliance's largesse, care and consideration.</p><p> Remember that the corporation tax rate is only 12.5% here, after allowing due deductions for any capital investments and so on, in terms of purchasing capital into the country.  Ordinary businesses pay that.  I have gone to the OECD and negotiated on the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, of which I am a very strong supporter, because we need a fair taxation system which collects enough money to fund the country.  The Government has said, "Hold on, there is an exception to this.  Profitable banks will be left out of making a tax contribution."  The people who work in the banks in different jobs pay income tax, the small and medium sized businesses who pay interest on their borrowings from the bank pay 12.5% on their taxable profit, but the banks themselves are picked out for a special exemption.  I ask the Minister not to tell me that this is because Ireland has a tax law structure.  Of course we do and in the ordinary course of events, if one makes an ordinary loss, of course that may be written off, but these are not ordinary losses.  Over recent years, we have listened to and met with people who have been badly dealt with by the banks in respect of tracker mortgages.  The Minister has himself acknowledged this in a very genuine way, but then he turns around to the same banks and tells them, "Folks, have a free ride on us".  There are easy ways to address this issue.  I was part of the discussion with Brian Lenihan to limit the banks use of losses.</p></speech>

It is intolerable that Irish taxpayers who bailed out these banks are in some cases being thrown out of their houses by these same banks, ruthlessly and without mercy.  These banks decided to sell on debts to vulture funds which treat these people even worse than the banks had and now we are to give them a rolling tax break as long as they like, to let them roll.  If that was an ordinary company which had set up in any part of this country, Revenue would be after it every year, screwing them, going as hard as they could on them and threatening them but because the banks are this elite group that brought this country to its knees, and are torturing people still, they seem to have some magic wand that they can wave over Government which means that it will not face up to tackling them.  It is scandalous what they are getting away with when one sees how what I call the little people, like ourselves, are being treated by these entities.  What Deputy Doherty is doing is right, in fact we should go further.  There should be no breaks for these people.  We should make sure that the money that the Irish people, through blood, sweat and tears, put into these banks is recouped after everything they have gone through, losing houses, businesses over the last ten years.  The banks were the cause of the problem and we kept throwing money at them - it was like throwing it into a cesspit - and saying "You are great guys, keep going.  We believe you are right."  At the same time, the ordinary people are suffering the consequences of what they did.  Until we as legislators face up to this and stop patting these people on the back, the ordinary people of Ireland will remain downtrodden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300035#LL00700"><p>Amendments Nos. 42 and 44 call for reports within six months, that is what we are talking about.  Having listened to the debate at the finance committee, I think it is reasonable to ask in relation to the banks that these amendments be treated in the same way and that the reports and information be made available to this House.  What annoys people the most about the banks now is that they are now back on their feet, making an obscene level of profit.  As parliamentarians, we have to ask ourselves if this is the type of banking system we want in this country, a banking system that will ignore the pain and suffering of the citizens we represent in the interests of their profitability and that only.</p>  <p>  Looking at what is happening in the banks now, they are taking people to court for repossession.  People do not even know which part of the bank they are dealing with.  AIB and the other banks now have numerous entities with banking licences within their organisations.  A customer may have taken out their loan from AIB, but they may be taken to court by AIB, PLC which is an entity in itself.  People cannot defend themselves against them.  The banks are mounting massive legal battles with families and individuals who have been pushed from pillar to post and have no money left in their family finances and they are fighting for their homes and we are letting the banks away with it.</p>  <p>  Ulster Bank, for example, has sold loans to vulture funds knowing full well that the loan they have sold depends on its income on a family home.  They are dividing up the loans and sending the customers to the courts.  Vulture funds, represented by Capita, are treating people in the most despicable manner.  It is incredible what that regulated authority is getting away with.  The finance committee, having requested the vulture funds to come before us, received its first response today saying thanks for asking, but no thanks.  If they have access to the Minister's Department, and we have all the dates and times that those funds met the Minister, I believe the Minister should tell them that there will be no further meetings, accommodation or consideration of any position that relates to them until such time as they sit before the finance committee and answer its questions on behalf of citizens, who are their customers, who we represent.  It is appalling for Capita to sit back and treat this as though they are untouchable.  This House has to make some statement, whether by the Minister providing the reports that we are asking for or some other means of legislation, that will put manners on the banks, the vulture funds and Capita and the service providers that represent them.  We are allowing them to crush the people who are left fighting for their family homes.  We are allowing the banks to walk all over them while at the same time we are allowing the same banks to carry on making the obscene profits that they have been making.  At the same time as this is happening, the public banking system in Germany is telling us what we should be doing here.  We must consider the balance between the citizen and their rights, a public banking system and the type of greedy vultures who we now have in the general banking system in Ireland and in the vulture funds.  They are getting away scot free.  All these amendments are asking for is a report within six months and that is reasonable, particularly after the arguments that I have heard at meetings of the finance committee.  It is not acceptable that we would ignore what is going on.</p><p>For anyone to be making billions of euro of profits off the backs of people they currently have in court is not acceptable.</p> <p> While we were discussing the tracker mortgage issue, families were in court dealing with attempts to have their properties repossessed.  One of those cases was brought by KBC although it said it had none.  It said it was not doing it but it was and on the same day we were sitting.  Alongside these reports, we need to consider telling the banks that no further action can be taken through the courts against the SME sector or home owners until such time as investigations are carried out into the way they are making their money.  The SME sector is linked to all of this.  Let us be honest about it.  Some of them were encouraged by the banks to move away from their core business and now everything is affected, including family homes and businesses.  If they were separated out and structured properly, they would survive.  For example, the global restructuring group, GRG, in Ulster Bank is a huge issue which has not been resolved.  As we discuss this and await reports, which we want, all of these people continue at speed to take families and small business to court and to ruin local communities further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300036#MM00200"><p>The German playwright, Bertolt Brecht, stated that the crime of robbing a bank is absolutely nothing compared with the crime of owning one.  Never was a truer word said when we consider what the banks have done and allowed to be done to the people of this country in recent years.  The people of this country have paid a bitter price in the crash of the economy for the reckless gambling and greed for profit and bonuses of the bankers.  They paid a further bitter price in the enormous cost of the bailout, which was paid for with cruel suffering and austerity over years.  Finally, when those banks are nursed back to profitability as a result of the suffering ordinary people have endured due to the banks' activities, the Minster reprivatised them to ensure that the full fruits of the profits which they will make in future years, and not just the 12.5% tax, are given away to shareholders.  They are not given to those who paid the price but to the private shareholders who can buy bank shares.  That is the first crime and, even now, one that the Government should pull back from in its further plans to reprivatise the banks.  As if all those crimes which were carried out for the banks and their shareholders are not bad enough, we then have the extraordinary situation of banks, which are once again fantastically profitable, for years to come paying no tax.  It is absolutely true, as Deputy Wallace said, that there would be murder if the people of the country knew it.</p>  <p>  When I try to explain to people these sorts of loopholes which allow banks, vulture funds and corporations to avoid tax, most of them do not believe me.  When I tell them that AIB is making profits again, repossessing homes and charging extortionate interest rates but is paying no tax at all and will not for years, they do not believe me.  They think it could not be true, yet it is true.  It is because it is so unbelievable that there is no revolution in the country.  I am being absolutely straight with the Minister.  If people really knew the extent of this carry-on, there would be a revolution.  If they knew that, side by side with the homelessness crisis, the chronic situation in our hospitals, the overcrowded schools and the massive deficit in our infrastructure, billions upon billions are going out in tax expenditures for losses made by these banks every year, they would revolt.  However, the Government is lucky.  It is saved by the fact that very few people are really listening to the detail of the debate, and even if they did, they would hardly believe it or understand what they were hearing.  It is absolutely shocking.</p>  <p>  I am not so sure about losses being brought forward.  It is another example of one law for the rich and one law for the poor.  What about all the people who suffered losses during the austerity period through no fault of their own?  What about those who ran up personal debts and lost out in all sorts of ways?  Can they carry their losses forward against their income tax next year?  Will they get any allowances in their income tax next year or the year after for the losses they made?  Not at all.  However, the banks will pay no tax at all for years.  Their shareholders will make dividends and the value of their shareholdings in those banks will appreciate.  It is absolutely outrageous.  Perhaps there is a case for losses being brought forward for certain genuine businesses to keep them in business.  However, that these banks, in particular, can do it is shocking.</p>  <p>  It is an open goal for tax avoidance in the future and for our friends who have subsidiaries.  Losses can be manufactured.  We know how they manufactured and manipulated the prices of intellectual property assets, which we were discussing earlier.  It is quite possible to manufacture losses when there is a network of subsidiaries.  That is another problem I have with the whole principle of losses being brought forward.  The idea that the banks, after all they have done to us and all we have done for them, can pay no tax beggars belief.  AIB is one of the most profitable banks in Europe.  The Government is lucky that it beggars belief though.  It would be paying a much bigger political price if it was not so incredible.</p></speech>

However, it all seems to be a waste of time and energy.  As I said last night, although I hate being repetitive, Deputy Boyd Barrett is right about how Joe Bloggs and Mary Public would react if they knew what was going on with the cartels and the regulators who are in bed with them.  We have regulators for everything in this country and we are getting new ones every day, and they are absolutely useless, toothless and fruitless.  They are out only for themselves and get into cosy positions with these big cartels.</p>  <p>  There is no will from this Government.  It is not that we are a couple of hundred years old as a State.  We only have our freedom in this country a limited time.  We will have a very important commemoration in two years.  If the Soloheadbeg ambush men came back, they would not waste bullets shooting the Government.  They would line the Ministers up and shoot ten of them with the one bullet.  Think of Dan Breen, Se&aacute;n Treacy, Se&aacute;n Hogan - those great men.  Men on both sides died.  For what?  To be raped and plundered by vultures and for the Government of the day to acquiesce in it.  The Government is cushioning them.  It is bringing them into the bowels of the Department and asking them what they want it to do.</p>  <p>  The argument might be made that we needed some funding when we hit the crash.  Why did we hit the crash?  It was naked greed and the regulator was asleep.  The regulator should have been prosecuted, but not at all.  We could not prosecute the regulators because they are doing what Governments allowed them to do and not the jobs they are paid to do.  Where are their contracts?  We now have public interest directors in the banks.  It is a joke.  They are just taking up space at a boardroom table.  They are doing absolutely nothing.  I questioned the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, several times about them.  I asked if they were going to be held accountable and what was their role.  He told me that they had no public interest role.  He told me that agus &eacute; ag su&iacute; sa su&iacute;och&aacute;n ansin.  He told me that himself.  They do not have a public interest role.  It is just optics.  It looks good.  The big game goes on.</p>  <p>  What the banks are doing to the people is linked with the courts.  There is very little justice in the courts for unfortunate families and small farmers.  Some are from the Minister of State's constituency.  He knows them well.</p><p>They are of hurling fame.  I refer to the blackguarding of the individual and his family, including his daughters and sons, at this hour, last week and the week before in the Four Courts.  It is terrorism.  We are aware of war crimes in various wars.  What I refer to are war crimes being perpetrated against the people.  It is terrorism.  It is emotional terrorism.  Mr. Tony O'Brien was criticising people who were concerned about families they believe, rightly or wrongly, are sick because of a vaccine.  I will not say whether they are right or wrong.  Mr. O'Brien called it emotional terrorism.  I am referring to the real emotional terrorists and bullies.  War crimes are being committed by the banks and their thugs, with the repossession agents.  They are nothing better than thugs.  I was in the Minister of State's native county to see them in action.  They represent a third force.  It was like guerrilla warfare, with balaclavas and Alsatians.  They were tearing down a house.  When the Garda superintendent and inspector were asked to defend a woman standing at her own gate, they turned their backs.  I met that superintendent in the Garda station in the Minister of State's town.  The latter did not turn up.  He might not remember it.</p> <p> A poor man and his boy were kicked and beaten senseless by thugs - a guerrilla force in a democratic country.  The boy, who was 14, was nearly killed as he punctured his lung.  A fire brigade paramedic who was asleep in his house heard the rumpus and attended to the boy.  Only for him, the boy would have been killed.  It took two hours for a Garda squad car to come.  Were there prosecutions?  No.  I am ashamed to say some of the thugs were from my own county.  They had carried out ten repossessions on the night.  It is a lucrative, greasy, messy, disgusting practice.  It is as bad as the drug trade.  It is every bit as bad as it because in involves blood money from ordinary citizens.  Year in, year out, we are failing here to pass legislation to protect the people.  It is despicable and reprehensible in every case.</p> <p> Deputy McGuinness and others mentioned Capita.  This agent and others like it are just mercenaries.  That is all they are.  I mentioned a mercenary last night and the Ceann Comhairle stopped me.  They asked advisers what to do and went off again.  The agents are no better than mercenaries who went to various wars all over the world and killed as a career.  It is despicable and it is happening under our watch.  I do not agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on many things but he is 100% right.  If the people knew about it, there would be complete uproar, and rightly so.  Small businesspeople and SMEs took out loans and the banks shovelled money at them.  They could not keep the bankers away from their doors, in that there were loans for this and loans for that.  When the crash came we all suffered but there is no mercy shown, only selling on to the next sleazy vulture fund at rates of 17%, 20% and 30%.  The businesspeople themselves might come up with 80%, being the asking value, but there would be no sale to them.  It is dirty, messy, disgusting and abhorrent to any right-thinking person.  Why is has not sunk in here among successive Ministers for Finance and the permanent government, I do not know.  I do know part of the permanent government is comprised of the regulators.  A very good friend of mine, a very decent businessman, Mr. Seamus Maye, who was himself destroyed by a cartel, spoke at an event quite close to the constituency of the Minister of State, namely, the Kilkenomics festival in Kilkenny.  I ask people to look at the video.  We have plenty of regulators but no regulation.  We have no regulation of the banks.  I am not blaming the ordinary staff in the banks but those deep in the board rooms.  The robbers are living inside them now and they are creating the policies on how they can rob the people blind without any gun or violence.  They just rob and steal from them.  We have the tracker mortgage issue and everything else.  I am involved with the Friends of Banking Ireland and I have a template of a letter that is being sent to people to inquire into their circumstances.  We are getting amazing responses back.  People are just getting an offer of &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 in pay-back money or go-away money to compensate for the robbing and the stealing.</p> <p> A man went down to the court last week and said he was overcharged by the bank by &euro;260,000.  It is not a matter for the courts, he was told.  Unfortunately, many eminent people in the courts and their families are up to their necks in hock to the banks.  They should not be sitting to hear such cases.  It is quite clear that if they had any moral compass, they would remove themselves from such cases.  It is a merry-go-round.  The merry-go-round gets murkier and dirtier but it is like ice on a pond.  When the sun comes one of these days, the ice will melt and you all will be submerged.  The Government has the opportunity to change this but will not. </p> <p> We are getting back our financial independence somewhat.  Why do have we to be lying down, licking these people and letting them run amok among our own citizens?  They are running amok and destroying lives.  I referred last night to suicides, marriage break-ups and children in awful situations.  There is also the homelessness crisis, which the Government will not deal with.  More people are being made homeless on an hourly basis.  There is something very sinister at the heart of the Government and our institutions, which are in a cabal with the people I have spoken about.</p></speech>

If there is no request for a withdrawal - it is up to the Deputy whether he withdraws the remark - we need to pursue the issue we are discussing.  The Minister has already availed of his first opportunity out of two and has not referred at all to the fact that the losses are allowed to be carried on in the banks.

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has never met with Capita.</p>  <p>  Perhaps it would be helpful to the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Deputy McGuinness, for me to let him know that I subsequently met representatives of Banking and Payments Federation Ireland and I put in place a structure, which I hope to be able to conclude soon, in which Members of the Oireachtas will meet members of the federation, which is composed of the banks and the service providers and if there are particular cases members of the public have brought to the attention of Members, they will be in the room with the right people to try to bring those matters to a conclusion.  That is something on which I took the initiative some months ago.  I hope to make an announcement in that regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the amendment, loss relief is a standard feature of corporate tax regimes worldwide.  Under the Irish corporate tax regime, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate amount of tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not to allow loss relief in the next.</p>  <p>  Under existing loss relief provisions in the tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for off-set against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Alternatively, a company may claim to have the loss set off against profits of any description for the same accounting period in which the loss was incurred or of an immediately preceding accounting period of the same length.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of all other OECD countries.  It would be difficult to justify the taxation of business profits without also taking due account of business losses.</p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, under the NAMA Act 2009 a new section &ndash; section 396C &ndash; was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The provision limited the amount of prior-year losses that a NAMA-participating institution could off-set against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  It should be noted that it did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the Minister for Finance decided it was appropriate to remove the restriction on relief for losses in participating institutions, with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  That was done against the backdrop of the introduction of the new capital rules under the EU capital requirements directive, CRD IV.</p>  <p>  The removal of the restriction has protected the carrying value of deferred tax assets at the banks in which the State has a significant stake thus improving capital ratios under the new Basel III rules and consequently increasing the value of the State&rsquo;s investment.</p>  <p>  The removal of section 396C enabled the banks to absorb their losses over a shorter timeframe than would be the case with a 50% limit in place.  While corporation tax will not be payable on the banks' trading profits until their losses are fully absorbed, the net effect of the measure in terms of tax receipts is largely one of timing.  This will be off-set by an improvement in the valuation of the State's equity stakes in the banks, as well as its debt investments, while the risk to the State as backstop provider of capital is also reduced.</p>  <p>  Rather than interfere with the deferred tax assets by changing tax policy, the Government has ensured a contribution from the sector by introducing a bank levy which has been payable since 2014.  This provided an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It is anticipated that the bank levy will raise &euro;750 million over five years.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendment.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, agreed to provide a technical paper.  He will consider a range of options, and they will be presented to the finance committee for it to consider.  He has not committed in any shape or form to changing the current tax strategy in respect of deferred tax assets.</p></speech>

I have been fair to the Government in my previous contribution in acknowledging that the 2014 change was to ensure no additional capital was provided to the banks.  That was the argument that was put forward.  There is a certain validity to that although I disagreed with it at the time.  However, there is none today.  No argument exists in terms of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The Minister is asking Members to vote down an amendment that would outline the direction of the Government's policy, which would be that banks should pay their fair share of tax.  I cannot agree to that because this is a scandal.  Massive amounts of profits are being collected by the banks on the back of extraordinary interest rates that are twice the European average, and on the back of the tracker mortgage scandal, which they will have to pay back.</p></speech>

My amendment No. 44 is similar but the amendments are not grouped.  It has been said that the Minister will deliver a technical paper.  We need to get more detail on what will be in the technical paper.  The amendment before us looks for the options available to restrict the carrying forward of losses.  The other amendment looks for details on the potential impacts of restricting the carrying forward of loss relief.  Can the Minister give an assurance that both of those issues will be addressed comprehensively in the technical paper or report or whatever one calls it?  Could he elaborate on that and provide confirmation?</p>  <p>  I take it from what has been said that the Minister does not want the measure to be in the Finance Bill but could he give us a commitment on a timeframe?  A report has been requested within six months and for the Minister to then agree to make himself and his officials available to go through the technical paper or report on the options and their implications.  We need to have the full facts on what the implications are.  We have it on the record in respect of AIB and Bank of Ireland that no additional capital requirement from the State will be triggered.  Permanent TSB may be in a different situation and that may be a consideration for the Government.  I do not know but those are the facts that we need to have at our disposal when we make such an assessment.</p></speech>

This is actually a running scandal in the country.  If we allow the banks to take us for a ride, then take us for a ride they will.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael accepted, reluctantly, a bank levy at the request of the Labour Party.  That was only because Fine Gael absolutely refused to address this area.  The argument of the Minister of State is wrong.  The four banks I have named will get &euro;5.5 billion of deferred tax assets.  They will thank Fine Gael very much.  These are the people who brought the country close to its knees.</p>  <p>  The Government is not even willing to match the actions of the banks in respect of how they are treating people with tracker mortgages and accidental landlords, a cause dear to the heart of the Minister of State.  The houses of many of those people are being repossessed.  The banks are not even being put on a par with ordinary businesses that pay their taxes.</p>  <p>  Perfectly acceptable ways have been found to deal with this.  They may not be perfect but they would actually result in these banks making a contribution.</p>  <p>  We need to build schools, roads and public transport among other things.  We need to build our health service.  We could even reach an agreement that the tax so engendered could be used to fund the new health service.  That would be a reasonable arrangement and I imagine all of us could agree on it.</p>  <p>  It is a cowardly and wrong response.  Technically, with that response the Government is actually making us the laughing stock of Europe.  Why should European countries hold out a hand to us when we cannot even put up a hand on our own behalf?</p></speech>

While it might be welcomed to resolve some issues, the banks, vulture funds and organisations like Capita should appear before the committees of the House.  This is not about individual cases, although they are important.  It is about the culture within the banks that we need to expose.  It is about the culture of greed that led us to the collapse in the first place.  That culture continues to destroy families and businesses.  The banks have questions to answer in terms of how they are handling funds now and how they are dealing with clients now.  They have questions to answer about their attitude and the fact that they are using extreme legal muscle to punish people.  Those questions can only be answered with accountability and transparency in public session before the appropriate committees of the House.  That is what the Department of Finance needs to emphasise.</p>  <p>  It is not business as usual.  The banks are accountable and they must appear before the committees of the House.  They cannot be compelled, but they can be brought in and made to respect democracy and rights of citizens before Oireachtas committees.</p></speech>

The old saying about laughing all the way to the bank is appropriate.  The bankers are laughing all the way to the bank, inside the bank and all over the bank.  They are literary piddling all over the people.  Why not, since they get aplomb from the Government?</p>  <p>  Deputy Burton mentioned different cuts and what can be done for the children's hospital and so on.  People who are going blind in Cork and Kerry cannot get cataracts removed.  We could reference any category, including those involving schools, education, disabled people or unfortunate people who are downtrodden.  Up to 30 or 40 people are languishing on trolleys for three or four days in my hospital in Clonmel.  There is mayhem and bedlam.  They have blankets for pillows.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, these institutions are being let off tax-free.  This is a scheme designed to allow them to write off taxes, yet they have bled the people dry.  Why would they not do so, seeing as they get the support of the Government and the entire system of administration and taxation and so on?</p>  <p>  What about the ordinary person who pays taxes?  I heard the Minister suggest the Government did not have enough money even to make a start to pay back the women who had to give up work.  Those women are now being penalised with certain payments.  They had to retire under the public service ban when they got married and became pregnant.  They had to give up work.  Many other areas could be helped in some small way.</p>  <p>  However, it is all for the big institutions and big people.  It is political and moral cowardice to an extraordinary degree because the Government will not tackle the banks or take any opportunity to try to bring them before committees, as Deputy McGuinness suggested, to hold them accountable to the House.</p>  <p>  We are accountable to the people, and so we should be, as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  We are messengers of the people.  However, we are not even tickling these people.  They are a protected species, like the hen harrier.  We cannot go within 100 miles of them.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister of State to ensure that there is not one law for the banking community and another for the rest.  Banks are companies.  If we make an arrangement for one company and set a precedent for that company to get away with X, Y or Z, then why not do it for every other company throughout the country that incurs losses?  Many small businesses throughout Ireland have suffered losses.  Unfortunately, they do not get the same type of deals.  I am deliberately using the term "deals" when referring to what the banks are getting.</p>  <p>  As Deputy McGuinness pointed out, rightly, what they are doing is remarkable.  Capita has now changed its name to the Link Group.  We have to start dealing with another new set-up now.  In recent weeks, a letter went out to all the people who the company is torturing at the moment.  We have another new company set up along with the 300 others with various types of names.  These companies are sending letters out to people.  These companies seem to be doing whatever they want to the ordinary person, yet they are still clapped on the back and get whatever relief is needed.</p></speech>

The question is what we do from here on.  We all have the facts before us.  We all know that these banks are super-profitable.  We all know that the State requires additional revenue.  It is not as if we are not subject to pressures.</p><p>This is not actually about taxing the banks more.  It is about taxing the banks fairly.</p><p>They will be still able to use these losses and carry them forward, albeit over a longer period.  The key issue is that they will start to pay tax at an earlier point.  That is what this is all about.  As I stated, the Minister of State did not offer any justification for refusing to accept the amendment.  While there may have been justification for the current arrangement in 2014, I do not see any justification for it at this point, particularly in respect of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. </p> <p> As Deputy John McGuinness stated, the amendment would commit the Minister to preparing a report.  A technical paper is being done and the amendment would go one step further by having a report prepared.</p> <p> On a side issue, I agree with Deputy McGuinness that the Minister, Minister of State and their officials - I do not criticise the officials for doing their job - should not meet vulture funds or their agents if they refuse to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300041#RR00100"><p>I move amendment No. 43:</p><blockquote>In page 41, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Use by Multinational Companies based in Ireland of &quot;Single Malt&quot; tax avoidance system</b><br /><br /><b>25.</b>The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report analysing the use by Multinational Companies based in Ireland of a system known as &quot;Single Malt&quot;, which directs profits to countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement but that do not have any corporation tax, and the impact this has had on returns to the Irish Exchequer.&quot;.</blockquote><p>This amendment relates to research carried out by Christian Aid, which has pointed out that, following the announcement by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in October 2014, that he was ending the double Irish tax scheme by making it a requirement for a company registered in Ireland to also be tax resident, a new scheme was soon developed, which Christian Aid has coined the &quot;single malt&quot;, which provides the exact same tax avoidance benefit as a double Irish scheme.</p><p>As Members will be aware, although the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that he had abolished the double Irish scheme and used strong language when he stated that abolishing the ability of companies to use the double Irish will help tackle aggressive tax planning by multinational companies, he forgot to add that he would allow companies already using the double Irish scheme to continue to use it until 1 January 2021 and he gave companies which were not availing of it a three-month window to get set up before the rules kicked in - nice concessions, if one can get them.</p><p>As Deputy Noonan was announcing this change, tax advisers in the United States were already promoting the new single malt structure.  A note, written in October 2014 by a tax expert in a well known US tax firm following the announcement, states:</p><blockquote>this does not mean the objective [of the double Irish] cannot still be achieved in other ways.  Ireland has an extensive treaty network.  At least two of these treaties contain management and control residency standards and are with countries that have similarly low tax rates.  Specifically, it is possible to form an [Irish non-resident company], as under existing structures, with its management and control in Malta. ... that company should be treated as a resident of Malta, and not Ireland ...  Malta does not impose any tax on royalties derived from patents, trademarks, or copyrights (resident non-domiciled companies also are exempt from Malta tax on foreign source income that is not remitted to Malta.)  And since Malta is an EU member state, royalties paid from an Irish company to a Malta company should not be subject to Irish withholding tax.  Thus, this Malta company should provide essentially the same benefits as [a] Bermuda company ... Alternatively, the [double taxation] treaty between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Ireland likewise has a management and control standard, and the UAE does not impose corporate income tax.  The Ireland-UAE treaty also exempts royalty payments from withholding tax.<br /><br />Thus, notwithstanding the Irish proposal, it should still be possible to achieve the same results using a company managed and controlled in Malta or the UAE, rather than in a Caribbean nation.</blockquote><p>It is a bit scary that Ireland currently has 73 double taxation treaties with other countries and more are currently being negotiated.  In its report, Christian Aid pointed out that Ireland's double taxation treaties with other countries override Irish domestic tax law.</p><p>I have debated the role double taxation treaties play in tax avoidance with the former Minister on many occasions.  During the 2016 Finance Bill debate, when it was announced that a withholding tax of 20% would apply from next year on certain property distributions from Irish funds to non-resident investors, Members pointed out that it looked doubtful that the rate of 20% withholding tax could even be applied to the majority of these non-resident investors.</p><p>The Department of Finance confirmed to me that non-resident investors may seek relief from the newly enacted 20% withholding tax if they are resident in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made the point to me at the time that non-resident investors may be also able to seek relief from the dividend withholding tax if they are resident in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  That is a standard feature of double taxation treaties and is based on the OECD Model Tax Convention.  He added that he was sure that I was familiar with the notion that one does not pay tax twice in different jurisdictions on the same profit.  Tax is paid once and where there are double taxation agreements the tax is paid in the country in which the person is tax resident.  If a person pays the tax in the other country he or she gets a credit against his or her tax liability in the country of residence.  The problem with that agreement, as a briefing note from a US tax firm points out, is that Ireland has tax treaties with countries such as the United Arab Emirates, which has no corporation tax, which is currently involved in the bombing of Yemen and where it is very easy to set up a brass plate company.  Christian Aid has made the point that although companies using the double Irish scheme can continue to do so until 1 January 2021, a preliminary search of the Irish and Maltese company registries shows that at least four multinationals have already established holding structures with Irish registered but Maltese tax-resident companies. </p> <p> The amendment calls on the Minister to lay before the House, within six months, a report analysing the use by multinational companies based in Ireland of a system known as single malt, which directs profits to countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement that do not have any corporation tax and the impact this has had on returns to the Irish Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to give the amendment serious consideration.</p></speech>

I would just add two points on that.  First, Mr. Eddie Hobbs phoned me recently.  I would not be on his political page on many things but he phoned me to point out that one of the things we should be doing is penalising accounting and consultancy firms that are in receipt of public contracts who are knowingly and on a very significant scale advising corporations and wealthy Irish individuals who can no longer avail of the double Irish or other tax avoidance mechanisms to go to Malta.  They are advising them to set up in Malta so that they can continue to avoid tax.  That is what some of these accountancy and consultancy firms are doing, firms that are in receipt of public contracts on a regular basis.  Our tax code - I cannot quote the exact section but I am sure the officials will know it- states that any measure that is taken for the specific purposes of avoiding tax is not allowed.  Even without specifying exactly what that is, one is not allowed to do something for the specific purposes of avoiding tax according to our tax code.  We should act against firms based here that are doing this and ban them from getting public contracts.  Why on earth would we give public contracts to accountancy and consultancy firms that are simultaneously advising rich corporations and individuals how to avoid paying taxes that are owed to the Irish people and the Exchequer?</p>  <p>  My second point is on the fact that we have another double taxation treaty in this Bill.  We called a vote on it, much to the bewilderment I suspect, of many in this House.  Deputies were asking a few weeks ago why we were opposing a motion for a double taxation treaty with Macau.  Most people do not even know where Macau is located.  Macau is one of the biggest tax havens in Asia and this Bill provides for a double taxation treaty with Macau.  What is that about?  We did not get much justification for that.  What is that about?  Is this going to be yet another mechanism for these guys to use the relationship between our tax code and that of another tax haven like Macau to avoid paying tax?  I would certainly like an explanation as to why that is contained in this Bill.  Why is the Government pushing a double taxation treaty with a known tax haven?  Deputies simply have to google "tax haven" and "Macau" and they will get reams of information about how Macau's main business is being a tax haven.  The Bill is riddled with this kind of stuff.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300042#SS00300"><p>I commend Christian Aid and other development agencies such as Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam who have been working over a long period to develop tax justice in the developing world.  They are working hard to ensure that taxes are collected, particularly in countries that are resource rich and whose main products are exported without processing.  In many developing countries, between corruption and co-operation via various locations around the world, people are left in extreme poverty because there is no international will to address it.  I worked in the developing world for a considerable period, specifically in eastern and southern Africa and I am a realist.  I know that this can happen only through international co-operation over a long period of time.  Organisations like Christian Aid have done sterling work in bringing to our attention the impact of tax agreements which were not designed with the developing world in mind but which have terrible consequences for people living in extreme poverty in a range of different countries.  If we want the world economy to grow and people to prosper in Europe, Africa and Asia, then taxation is one of the issues that must be addressed but international organisations like the UN and the OECD are the only realistic way of doing it.</p>  <p>  I would like the Government to think about this amendment again.  The request here is for a report.  What is threatening about a report?  The aim is to address issues that many people in Ireland would deeply support, regardless of whether they are political.  From that point of view, the Government should reconsider its position of extreme opposition to the idea that we would consider reports which set out what is happening in the context of issues that are very dear to the hearts of Irish people.  Irish people want to see those countries which are struggling with extreme poverty helped.  </p><p>Our development aid programme currently stands at more than &euro;600 million, as the Minister is aware, and does excellent work.  If he saw where the money goes, I think he would give some consideration to producing the report because it can only help us all to make better decisions and to find a way of helping countries to develop and meet the UN minimum development goals, provide schooling for girls, for example, help tackle malaria and so on.<br/><br/>In regard to the paper Christian Aid has produced, Ireland has to ask itself questions at this point, such are the rate and pace of developments at the moment in international tax, and such is the awareness globally, particularly in Europe, of some countries benefitting unfairly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other countries.  That includes us being taken advantage of, as well as cases where we are seeking tax advantages.  In the context of Brexit, change is coming down the road, whether we like it or not, and it is going to be very difficult change.  In recent replies to me on the double taxation agreements, the Minister and his officials have acknowledged that we have currently paid back approximately &euro;600 million in taxes which are deemed recoverable in respect of Irish adjustments.  The Italian Government is developing particular models that will be used to ensure that countries get minimum tax recovery in regard to activities broadly taking place in their jurisdiction.  We also know that, in terms of the double taxation agreement and other arrangements that exist with India, claims that may be as high as &euro;300 million are currently pretty much conceded, although the Minister could tell us more.  Therefore, who are we fooling?  Even yesterday, the British Tories, with many of whom Fine Gael has good relations, or more specifically, Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had a specific section in the budget speech dealing with digital taxation, which is also going to the address this issue.<br/><br/>What is wrong with providing a report?  We should not even have to put down amendments about these reports.  It is an insult to the idea of an open democracy.  This information should be available.  We should be able to make arrangements and have debates and discussion whereby we can grow our economy and have a fair taxation system but it should not be a case of beggar my neighbour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300043#TT00200"><p>At an earlier stage of the debate I praised the work of Christian Aid in regard to bringing this back into the public debate.  <i>The Irish Times</i>carried the story prominently and it would not be the first time <i>The Irish Times</i>has reported on the issue of the single malt, although not giving it that title.  More than a year ago, on 8 November 2016, the Minister's predecessor was before the European Parliament.  At that time, my colleague, Matt Carthy, MEP, put to him very clearly that not only was he not closing the double Irish quickly enough, and we heard about the tail that is allowed until 2020, but that there is availability to companies within our tax code to continue using that type of structure and this is because our network of tax treaties overrides domestic law.  Despite the change to the legislation which ended an automatically-created tax residency for companies here despite their claims they were managed and controlled in another jurisdiction, wherever we have a tax treaty with a country that still calculates tax residency on the basis of management and control, that would override on this issue.  Those countries include Malta, where the title &quot;single malt&quot; comes from, but also include Panama, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Netherlands and Belgium, which are other vehicles that could be used in this regard, given the double taxation tax treaties we have with those jurisdictions.</p><p>It was interesting that when Matt Carthy put that to the Minister's predecessor, his response was that this was very unpatriotic and he should wear the green jersey.  That was the former Minister's response to the fact there is a major loophole, whether intentional or unintentional, in our tax code that has allowed large companies to continue to use the double Irish.  The Minister's predecessor has acknowledged the reputational damage this has done to Ireland.  He was not really concerned about losing tax revenue and all the rest, but about the reputational damage.  Let there be no doubt that, as we close one loophole and create another door, or do not close the door, this reputational damage is going to continue.</p><p>Christian Aid has identified that, for example, four multinationals are using the single malt and it names one of them as being Microsoft.  I am not sure if that is the case or not.  I am sure Christian Aid's information is solid and I understand the company has not distanced itself from that claim.</p><p>The real question is what the Government is going to do about it.  The other point is that this is not new, which is the point I have been trying to make.  We have been raising the issue of the double taxation treaties and the fact the double Irish has not been closed and is continuing to be availed of.  As I said, when Matt Carthy raised this at the European Commission, the response from the then Minister was a typical response from him, if the House does not mind me saying it, namely, the only problem with the double Irish is that it has the word &quot;Irish&quot; in it.  It was a case of, &quot;We cannot end the issue of stateless companies because it is about Americans and other jurisdictions&quot;.  It is always this defensive, &quot;nothing to see here&quot; approach.</p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace is 100% right.  This is quite technical stuff.  It is probably a failing of those of us on the Opposition benches but if we were able to articulate this in such a way that the public understood what is actually going on here, there would be massive anger at the Government.  It is unbelievable what is happening.  It is not a case of the Government having a look at this to see what is happening.  The Government knew well this was going on for a couple of years.  This is the standard response of Government, namely, to continue until it comes to a point where pressure is heaped on and it then acts in the smallest way.  Then, when it does act, it has the brass neck to stand up and say, &quot;Look at us.  Aren't we great?  Didn't we end the double Irish?  Didn't we end the stateless companies?  Didn't we do this and that?&quot;, while forgetting all about this type of session, where myself and others have been basically demanding that the Government does this before we lose our international reputation.</p><p>I am proud of my country, I love my country, but I do not love some of the stuff that is happening in my country.  I do not like the fact we are being criticised internationally, and they are right, in regard to how our tax code is allowing companies to abuse international tax practice.  This is not just about us losing revenue; this robs everybody, including the Third World.  It robs services, resources and revenue and it creates additional wealth for those at the very top, those at the peak.</p><p>The Minister has facilitated this.  It is State-sponsored tax avoidance signed into law by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  He can sign it out of law, which is what I am asking him to do.</p> <p> We need to get to grips with some of this issue.  We dealt with it before - we do not need the &euro;850 million in tax, so just leave it to one side because it would affect the likes of Apple and so on.  What of the section 110 companies and loan originators?  Do not worry about that - we are getting &euro;250, which is better than nothing, and they employ 43 people down the road.  Forget the fact that they are making millions of euro in profit lending to Irish society.  The Minister does not want us to focus on this issue because it has been standard practice in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il for a long while, but it is time to call a halt.  International pressure will continue to be put on this country and we will lose other battles as a result.</p></speech>

The report alleges that Ireland's corporate tax residence rules and our tax treaties facilitate this structure.</p>  <p>  Our tax residency rules were amended in 2013 and 2014 to shut down known aggressive tax planning structures.  Those rules are now fully in line with international best practice and are similar to the rules in other countries, such as the UK.  Similarly, the corporate tax residence rules in our bilateral tax treaties are fully in line with long-standing OECD and UN recommended best practice.  Additionally, the Finance Bill will begin the process of ratifying the BEPS multinational instrument, which will introduce important anti-avoidance clauses into Ireland's tax treaties.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the structure referred to in the amendment is designed to avoid the operation of US anti-avoidance rules rather than to reduce the amount of tax payable in Ireland.  Of course, the US tax reforms currently being discussed in America could end such structures that seek to abuse US tax rules.</p>  <p>  The issue of aggressive tax planning by multinational companies is a global problem that requires a global solution.  I agree with Deputy Burton that dealing with this issue through fora such as the OECD is essential.  I have not commented on any individual company that is named in the papers that have been released, including the most recent disclosure, but I contend that a general lesson has emerged from the papers.  Within hours of a country making a movement on its tax policies, large companies will compare that change versus existing policy in other countries.  By examining the mismatches or opportunities created between policy in, for example, Ireland and policies elsewhere, including different levels of corporation tax, opportunities for planning are created.  I am committed to addressing this issue through the OECD.</p>  <p>  Where it is in our power to act, we have taken action.  I have cited examples.  Similarly, the ratification of the BEPS multilateral instrument to amend tax treaties and the implementation of other actions will go a long way towards shutting down aggressive tax planning.  I have asked my Department to revert to me on this matter and to inform me of what action is needed to deal with it bilaterally or on a domestic level.  When I receive that information, I will decide whether further action is needed.  I do not want to see continued growth in the kinds of practice that undermine the legitimacy of the collection of taxation on a national or global level, but change like this has to happen in a co-ordinated manner.  If Ireland makes changes on its own, the problems and the opportunities will shift elsewhere.</p></speech>

We are discussing a race to the bottom in terms of how tax is collected from those who can best afford to pay it.  The Minister asserts that we are fully in line with international best practice.  When we argue in the House about how Shannon Airport is allowed to be used as a forward base for US military purposes, I sometimes hear the argument that other Europeans are working with the Americans as well and that the Americans are our friends.  It is almost as if the fact that they bring arms, bombs and so on through to destroy places like Yemen is none of our business.</p>  <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned that we were robbing the Third World with our behaviour.  ActionAid Ireland made the same point recently, namely, that the Irish double taxation treaty system was depriving low-income countries of vital revenue.  According to it, multinational "companies from wealthier countries have a rapidly increasing presence in" low-income source countries where the relevant economic activity takes place, but the source country's ability to tax foreign multinationals is restricted in most of Ireland's tax treaties with lower to middle-income countries, thereby undermining their taxing rights.</p>  <p>  We will not start discussing climate change again, but we need to play a better role.  What we are doing in terms of the taxation of large companies leaves much to be desired.</p></speech>

I mentioned that I was talking to Mr. Gerard McSorley, who is a fine Irish actor, but I was actually talking about Mr. Sorley McCaughey of Christian Aid, who authored that good paper.</p><p>The game is up on the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; role that Ireland has played.  The noose is tightening.  Frankly, it is about time the Government got with the programme.  We can argue about what happened previously, and we should when it comes to the changes made in 2014, but we must give up this stuff.  It is not sustainable in the future and is robbing the majority of the world's peoples of incomes that are owed to them and that they need to make society function.</p><p>I do not know which writer with <i>Rolling Stone</i>described Goldman Sachs as a giant squid wrapped around the face of humanity sucking it dry.  These corporations are another instance of that.  It is what they are doing.  As Oxfam has pointed out, the consequence of that has reached the extraordinary level of the world's nine richest people, most of whom are the CEOs of these very corporations, now having more personal wealth than the poorest half of the planet.  It is literally the 1% and the 99%.  That is where we are going and we should play no part in it, and it is shameful that we have been.  Let us do something about this.</p><p>The Minister did not answer the question about Macau.</p></speech>

It is quite important that the Minister meets them.  Ireland is currently on a long campaign to gain a seat at the UN.  We have done that successfully in the past, partly because our contribution to the developing world, in terms of development aid, has been very significant in money terms, as have the contributions of Irish people through the decades, including missionaries from Ireland in earlier decades.</p> <p> In the context of their legacy, I ask the Minister to meet Christian Aid.  He is meeting bankers and everybody who represents the other side of the argument.  What would be wrong with meeting the authors of these reports?  I would like a commitment from the Minister on that, if possible.</p></speech>

It is done through the mechanism of transfer pricing, intellectual property, IP, and related royalty payments.</p>  <p>  I understood that through the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process we would have new rules around transfer pricing and it would be much more difficult to shift profits in the same manner.  Instead of shifting profits to traditional tax havens where there is no tax, it appears that profits are now being shifted to countries, including those in Europe, which apply very little tax to companies and their activities.</p>  <p>  We are always informed that expanding our network of double taxation treaties is a positive thing and good for trade and commerce between countries because it facilitates exports and imports and so on.  However, the suggestion now is that double taxation treaties are, in effect, resulting in an extremely aggressive tax avoidance mechanism.  The Minister needs to address that.  The issue of the place of effective management and the management and control test, whereby an Irish company can be incorporated here but deemed to be resident in a country with which we have a double taxation agreement, comes back to the issue of profit shifting, something which companies seem to be able to do very easily using transfer pricing and IP.</p>  <p>  I would like to know a lot more about how Revenue applies internationally accepted OECD transfer pricing rules governing how royalties are calculated in terms of payment for IP and how that can result in profits being transferred from one company in a group in one country to another company in a group in another country where there is much more favourable tax treatment.  Companies seem to be able to move profits to wherever they want.</p></speech>

I want Ireland to have a tax code which is competitive and addresses issues which are part of the growing consensus on how taxes should be collected globally, and that is what we have.  I reiterate that we have made many significant changes to date and are committed to making more.  The foundations for making some of the additional changes have been laid down in the Finance Bill.</p>  <p>  On the questions which have been put to me, it is possible that some of these practices are now being generated by companies comparing our tax code not only against jurisdictions which perhaps have no taxation systems at all but lower levels of taxation than we do in respect of corporate profitability.</p>  <p>  On questions put to me directly, Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the agreement in respect of Macau.  It is only an information exchange.</p>  <p>  On double taxation treatments, the broad point that should be made is that they are designed to make sure that activity is only taxed once but that it is taxed.  The number of double taxation treatment treaties allow Irish companies to have economic activity abroad on which they pay taxes here in Ireland.  That is a very valuable element of double taxation treatment.</p>  <p>  I will meet Christian Aid.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was present at the opening and said, &quot;The Government is committed to maintaining our stable and competitive corporation tax regime, and our strong incentives for research and development, so we can continue to attract and retain inward investment and create high-quality jobs&quot;.</p><p>It appears that our corporation tax rate is not what is attractive for LinkedIn but, rather, our 73 double tax treaties.  In March 2017, LinkedIn registered LinkedIn IP Holdings.  The company is registered in Ireland, its place of business is an office in Valletta in Malta and the company's registered secretary is a Maltese national.  It can, therefore, avail of the benefits of the double taxation treaty between Ireland and Malta even when the double Irish is finally phased out. </p><p>The Minister said he is not interested in a race to the bottom.  I do not think he has had the time to read it yet, but I recently gave him <i>The Darker Nations</i>by Vijay Prashad.  He will probably get to read it after the election during Christmas.</p></speech>

We are looking for a report but we will split the difference.  The Minister stated the technical paper will be before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach by June and will examine the options and implications of restricting the loss relief carried forward by the banks.

They were included in the Finance Bill to strengthen the existing capital gains tax anti-avoidance measures in sections 29 and 980 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the exclusion from the charge to capital gains tax for non-residents who dispose of shares or securities that derive their value from Irish land, provided they are quoted shares.  However, following publication of the Bill it was pointed out that there are likely to be unintended consequences arising from these amendments as they affect bonds as well as shares.  It has now been ascertained that they could impact negatively on some financial services activities because having a capital gains tax charge on debt is out of keeping with international norms.  For this reason, paragraphs (a) of section 25(1) and section 27(1) of the Bill as amended on Committee Stage are being deleted.  Given the issues raised and potential unintended impact, it was not possible to develop an appropriate solution in the time allowed.  It was, therefore, considered more prudent to delete rather than amend the relevant provisions.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will revisit the specific anti-avoidance issue with a view to it being considered for inclusion in the Finance Bill 2018.</p></speech>

I do not want him to repeat what he said but I ask him to clarify why the requirement in the original amendment, which is an anti-avoidance measure and stipulates that, for non-residents to get the capital gains tax exemption, shares had to be actively and substantially traded on a stock exchange, is being deleted and whether that weakens the Bill rather than strengthens it?</p></speech>

Gains in respect of sales of such shares by a non-resident person are not currently liable to capital gains tax.  The words "actively and substantially traded" were included in the amendments in the Finance Bill to ensure that shares that are listed on a stock exchange but not actively traded, that is, where there is no change in the ownership of the shares, would not qualify for the exclusion in sections 29 and 980 for quoted shares.</p>  <p>  Concerns were raised with Revenue that the proposed changes would have a negative impact on the ability of Irish banks and other financial institutions to securitise debt, issue covered bonds and raise finance generally.  The term "shares" is limited to shares that are actively and substantially traded on a stock exchange.  Section 29 and 980 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 define shares as including stock or security.  The view of Revenue is that loans secured on land and estate generally constitute an interest in land for the purposes of section 980 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and are regarded as securities for the purposes of that section.  It was considered that bonds issued by securitisation companies backed by commercial and residential mortgages could be caught by the new provisions as they may not be actively traded.  In addition, covered bonds are issued by Irish financial institutions and backed by Irish commercial and residential mortgages.  It is unclear whether those bonds are traded in sufficient quantities to satisfy the "actively and substantially traded" test.</p>  <p>  As regards bank debt, it is arguable that all Irish bank debt is backed by Irish property and Irish-secured debt.  Such bank debt would previously not have been caught by sections 29 and 980 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as they are listed.  Although the bonds are listed, trading in them is often infrequent as they are generally held as long-term investments.</p></speech>

When this was first adopted in America, it led to sub-prime lending.  I do not want to go over old ground but Members have not received the Minister of State's briefing notes and it is very difficult to absorb everything he reads out.  In terms of unsecuritised debt, will that apply to venture funds and financial and banking companies and will it include mortgage debt such as that which Members are familiar with and concerned by?  If so, I ask the Minister of State to outline what the implications will be.</p></speech>

As I said, I noticed that the phrase "substantially traded on such stock exchange" was being deleted from the amendment, which is why I raised the issue, and now it has been pitched in that it is to do with securitisation and mortgage-backed securities and so on.  The Deputy has spoken about what the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said when we dealt with intellectual properties being onshored and the impact that had.  I ask the Minister of State that either he or his successor ensure that briefing notes on ministerial amendments to future finance Bills are circulated to Members before Report Stage begins.</p></speech>

As Deputy Doherty knows, I am the junior Minister in the Department of Finance.</p><p>On every occasion when we have raised the issue of reports during this Report Stage debate we have committed to trying to make sure each report is available in good time so the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform or spokespersons will have the reports concluded and people can make a determination prior to the budget.  I cannot give that commitment.  It is not within my gift.</p> <p> The amendment would have impacted on normal business activity.  The Revenue Commissioners are saying to me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services, that it is too big a risk to take.  We think the right thing to do is to delete the sections and revisit this in the Finance Bill 2018.  If anything is happening that is not as we would expect we can move more quickly.</p></speech>

The Minister shall within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the possible extension of the Capital Gains Tax Relief for farm restructuring to Stamp Duty.&quot;.</blockquote><p>I welcome the Minister's amendment because we have sought progress on this issue.  We highlighted to the Minister and the Department the existing section 604B, which gives relief from capital gains tax for farm restructuring.  We made the case that it is logical to us that if a farm restructuring is being conducted and qualifies for capital gains tax relief there should be a corresponding or commensurate relief in respect of stamp duty.  I acknowledge the work of Deputies McConalogue and Cahill on this issue.  We welcome the Minister's amendment.  It is real progress in that it will be a 1% rate of stamp duty where the purchase and sale meet the test of the farm restructuring, certified by Teagasc and so on, in terms of the conditions that normally apply to the existing 604B relief. </p></speech>

We looked for this concession because if a farmer qualified for capital gains exemption it made no sense to be paying stamp duty at the higher rate.</p>  <p>  The land structure in this country is unique in that over 70% of farms are fragmented.  For viability in the future consolidation has to be welcomed and encouraged, if at all possible.  This capital gains exemption was brought in several years ago where farmers were selling a portion of their farms and could prove to Teagasc that it was for the purpose of consolidation because they were purchasing land nearer the main farm holding.  This amendment is welcome and will help the viability of farming in the future.  We welcome the amendment.</p></speech>

I thank the Government for facilitating this too.</p>  <p>  We all know how invaluable the agricultural sector is to this economy and that farms need to grow to sustain their produce.  It is important that they are allowed to progress.  Farming is modernising every day without the hindrance of further taxes.  It was the first sector the previous Government depended on to revive the economy when it came to power in 2011.  A couple of years later there was volatility when farmers came under pressure with the drop in prices.  Anything that helps them progress, develop and modernise has to be welcomed.  I thank my party for pushing this agenda. </p></speech>

Only once in a lifetime will the neighbouring farm come up for sale and give the farmer the opportunity to consolidate the holding and pull it together.  The capital gains tax relief exists for someone selling the outside farm to buy the nearby land.  It makes sense to have something similar for stamp duty.  It is even more important with the proposed increase in stamp duty.  Great credit is due to the phenomenal work that Deputies McGrath, McConalogue and Cahill have been doing to push this forward.  We definitely need to see it progress.</p></speech>

When the budget was published several issues arose about the stamp duty increase, in particular the inconsistency and lack of logic in applying a higher level of stamp duty to land consolidation movements and transactions when at the same time there was a capital gains tax relief.  It did not make sense.</p>  <p>  My colleague Deputy Cahill was to the fore from the outset in identifying that inconsistency and pushing this matter.  I commend Deputy Michael McGrath who, with Deputy Cahill and me, met Department officials to highlight that.  I commend the Minister of State and the Minister for seeing the rationale behind this, changing and amending it.  With such fragmentation in our farming units it makes sense to try, through the taxation system, to facilitate the consolidation of farms into more united units to promote more efficient farming.  This measure will assist in that. </p></speech>

In fairness to the Minister he asked us to withdraw the amendment and said that he would table an amendment on Report Stage and I acknowledge what he has done because this is very important for the farming community.  I hope that people who are interested in farming, when other amendments come forward such as keeping the stamp duty for agriculture, will be as enthusiastic and make sure we get what is needed for the farming community across the country.</p><p>It was necessary.  It might have been an oversight, but we put down an amendment and the Minister said he would sort it.  I commend him on doing so.</p></speech>

We had this amendment before the finance committee and debated it with both Ministers, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said he would consider it.  It now has been dealt with and that is very welcome.  The Minister of State is familiar with farming in Wexford where there is fairly good land, and similarly in my own area, but there are many farms which are very fragmented.</p>  <p>  I also thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, for withdrawing the statutory instrument on tractors travelling on the roads.  It has gone through officially today.  Tractors have to travel on roads because farms are fragmented.  We do not all have grey Fergusons and Fordson Dextas.  We have modern tractors which can carry proper, safe loads and which have safe breaking systems which travel fast.  I am not saying they should travel at a fast speed, but common sense needs to prevail.  Farms are fragmented and have been since the days of the Land Commission and the division of the big estates.  A great job was done then but unfortunately the smaller landholdings are being amalgamated into big estates once again, but in a different guise.  That is a matter for a different amendment, and in my county especially no one can get a bloody patch of land apart from one business.  It is very necessary because farms, farm families and farm enterprises are under enough pressure without this and everything else that is coming down the line.  The change is welcome and will benefit the agriculture industry.  </p></speech>

He stated on Committee Stage that, while he had framed his amendment in the form of a report, he hoped there could be a Report Stage amendment that would put into effect a stamp duty relief.</p>  <p>  This matter of a stamp duty relief for farm consolidation was also raised by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath on Committee Stage where I indicated my intention to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.  At the time, I was not in a position to give a commitment as to the form that relief might take. </p>  <p>  I have since examined the matter and am guided in bringing forward my amendment by a previous stamp duty relief that applied and by the capital gains tax relief that currently applies.  </p>  <p>  My amendment will allow a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she both sells and purchases land for the purposes of consolidating an existing farm holding.  For the relief to operate, there must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months.  Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty will be paid only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold.  A reduced rate of 1% will be charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value.  If the sale takes place before the purchase, relief will be given at the time of purchase.  However, if the purchase takes place first, stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place. </p>  <p>  When the stamp duty relief previously applied, a maximum period of 18 months was allowed between a purchase and a sale.  I am increasing this period to 24 months in line with the capital gains tax relief.  The rate of stamp duty that previously applied in relation to the relief was the standard rate.  The standard rate is now 6% but I have decided to apply a lower rate of 1%. </p>  <p>  A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply.  The most important condition is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes.  This is the certificate that is currently required in relation to the capital gains tax relief.  The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  A purchaser of farmland must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming.  Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can be subsequently recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered as appropriate. The relief will apply in relation to instruments conveying or transferring land that are executed on or after 1 January 2018 and on or before 31 December 2020. Because I will need to seek state aid approval for this relief from the EU Commission, I have to make the commencement of the new provisions subject to a Ministerial Order which will be made when such approval is obtained. </p>  <p>  I trust that my proposed amendment will address the concerns that motivated Deputy Michael McGrath to propose his own amendment.  In view of the nature of my amendment, I do not propose to accept his amendment and agree to the preparation of a report on a stamp duty relief for farm restructuring.</p></speech>

I have serious concern about what the Minister is doing with the seven year exemption on capital gains tax.

That is why I have put down this amendment.  I will not push it but I ask the Minister, his Department and the Revenue Commissioners especially to pay a close eye on this and monitor the tax foregone as a result of bringing forward this threshold on properties rather than land which has the potential to be developed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300049#ZZ00600"><p>Before moving on to address this amendment, I must provide the following clarification to the House.</p>  <p>  On 9 November, the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach considered section 28 of Finance Bill, 2017 as published.  As part of that process, there was discussion on an amendment to section 28 of the Bill as it then stood which had been put forward by Deputy Doherty.  When reviewing the record of the debate officials became aware that the advice that was provided to me during the debate in respect of legal advice received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was incorrect in that it conveyed a misunderstanding of the advice given by that office.  This caused me to make what I now understand was an incorrect statement, that is, that I received legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to the effect that it was not legally possible to exclude buildings from the scope of the exemption provided for in the Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  While legal advice had been received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in relation to the existing relief in section 604A, that advice did not indicate that it would not be legally possible to exclude buildings from the scope of the exemption provided for in the Finance Bill.  </p>  <p>  Having clarified the position I will now turn to amendment no. 50 in the name of Deputy Doherty. His amendment seeks a report to be prepared on the reduction in the holding period from seven years to four years within six months of the passing of the Act.  As has been indicated in the past, in replies to a number of parliamentary questions, there is no information available on the number of properties purchased during the qualifying period.  It is unlikely to be possible to ascertain the number of persons who will avail of the relief in the six-month period after the Bill is signed into law, and it is not clear as to the basis for such a report. </p>  <p>The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment also raises the issue of limiting the reduction in the qualifying relief to land only.  A number of reasons give rise to the requirement that in amending section 604A that buildings should not be separated from land. While it is likely that free standing buildings can be defined and determined in law, that is, a building with some minor curtilage attached and land can also be defined, a difficulty can arise where buildings and land occupy the same site. </p><p>The effect of Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s proposal would be to require that, where land and buildings occupy the same site, they would have to be treated separately for the purposes of this relief.  The land could now benefit from the CGT relief as amended but any building on that land would not qualify until it has been in ownership for the full seven-year period.  It is likely that land and buildings sharing the same site have been purchased as one lot.  It is also likely that owners want to dispose of such land and buildings as a package rather than separately.  It may be that there are more buildings than empty land on specific sites and the reverse on other sites.  It would be difficult for sellers and, indeed, purchasers to value the land where there is a different timing of the tax treatment between the land and buildings on one site.  Different tax structures for buildings and land can raise complex issues with respect to the allocation of value between the two because disposals usually reflect transactions in which the land and the structures on it are disposed of as a unit.  The different treatment would be likely to impact on the possible disposal and the value of such property where there was both land and buildings on it.</p> <p> As the CGT relief applies across all the European Economic Area, to exclude buildings from the scope of the exemption introduced in the Finance Bill 2017 would be problematic, particularly given the difficulty of verifying the accuracy of the information provided by taxpayers.  That difficulty is mitigated by having land and buildings included as part of the change to the relief, which gives rise to no definitional problems.  The provisions of the Interpretation Act, which defines the term "land" as including houses and buildings on land, would also make limiting the scope of the amendment to land more complex.  There is, in this context, a concern that while a definition of buildings was possible it may not be possible to adequately define all buildings so as to make a clear distinction between land and buildings in all cases.  In addition, with urban areas being most in need of increased housing stock and some of the best located potential urban development land being on brownfield sites occupied to some degree by buildings, excluding them from the scope of the amended relief would potentially serve to exclude some of the land most suited to development in urban areas.  Including land and buildings in the amendment links to the policy on the increase in vacant site levy to 7% from 1 January 2019 which is intended to encourage owners of properties to develop vacant sites or buildings not in use.  Not including buildings in the CGT exemption, as is being suggested, could hinder the success of this policy.</p> <p> It is worth noting that this exemption was introduced at the same time as the reduction in the rate of stamp duty for commercial property.  In deciding to make this change to the CGT relief, I also considered it appropriate to make the change to the stamp duty treatment of commercial property.  Ultimately, it is necessary to end reliefs when they are considered to have achieved their objective rather than prolonging their life unnecessarily.  The issue now is the timing of revenue foregone.  It is worth noting that with all schemes such as this there will be deadweight and with a general provision such as this it is difficult to avoid.  The price of improving the operation of the property market is the relief on the gain made.  The state of the economy when this relief was introduced in the 2012 budget is different to the position at present.</p> <p> The proposed change by Deputy Doherty would only alter the timing of the relief and not whether the relief would apply.  Businesses or individuals who can benefit from the relief are likely to take the availability of the relief into consideration in any decision they make on the disposal of their property.  A separate treatment of land for the purposes of the CGT exemption could give rise to issues of valuation and possible legal uncertainty.  It would also be contrary to the policy aim of getting land and buildings into the market.  The proposed change would at best only alter the timing of the relief and not whether the relief would apply.  Sellers will clearly take the existence of the relief into account in any decision they make on the disposal of their land or buildings.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept this amendment.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to amend the record of the House.</p></speech>

The Minister has summed up the complete bind of the Government to a free-market approach to resolving the housing crisis.  The Minister accepts that there is a dead weight and a bunch of speculators who will not have to pay tax that they otherwise would have paid but takes the attitude we can do nothing about it if we want to release land onto the markets in order that homes can be built on it.  However, if the Government had that money, it could use it to build homes directly.  That would be a far more direct way of doing it rather than throwing tax expenditures at a very small number of people at the top of our society and hoping it filters down in the form of increased house building.  The change by the Government is an admission.  Although we did not hear it from the Minister, it is an admission that this Fine Gael policy contributed to massive land hoarding and the housing crisis.  The reason for it was to stop vulture funds flipping properties quickly and, therefore, showing up the fire sale that had been pursued by NAMA and what a good deal they had got at the expense of the public.</p>  <p>  I do not think the change from seven years to four years resolves the issue, however.  I agree that it can mean for some that they will sell ahead of when they otherwise would have sold.  However, if they hang on for seven years, they can still have the benefit of the exemption.  They can continue to hang on for seven, eight, nine or ten years and get the benefit of the exemption.  If I recall correctly, in the budgetary documents a cost of zero is outlined alongside this measure.  That just cannot be accurate.  As the Minister stated, at the very least there is some dead weight involved.  At the very least there are people who plan to sell buildings or land next year.  They were going to swallow the cost of the capital gains tax but now will still sell but will not pay the tax, and the public will lose out as a consequence.</p>  <p>  The change since Committee Stage in the Minister's response about whether there is a legal impediment to this differentiation seems to me to be significant.  It is fair enough that the formulation of "land" may be imprecise because property is built on land.  However, is it not possible to come up with a legal definition of vacant land?  That is land that has nothing built on it.  That is the only place the argument can be made about whether there is an incentive to get building land onto the market.  Is it not possible to come up with such a definition and therefore limit the benefit of this tax expenditure to those parcels of land which may actually provide new housing?</p></speech>

It probably just adds to the argument I was making about the need to split up "land" and "buildings".  What I heard from the Minister is a lot of challenges but no reason it cannot be done.  My point is that this is not just a matter of timing.  Commercial buildings in Dublin will be sold next year for other reasons relating to the portfolio or the need to reinvest money etc.  Those buildings will be sold and it will have been planned to pay 33% CGT on the capital gains.  As a result of this amendment, those concerned will now walk away without paying that tax.  That is huge.  It is absolutely huge.  We are talking about buildings that were bought in or about 2012 and are being sold in 2017 and 2018.  In some cases, there will have been a 100% uplift.  It is a massive amount of money.  I do not want a report.  We can forget about that.  What I want is for the Government to carve out those types of commercial buildings and to ensure that land is released for development purposes, which is what we really want.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the definition of "buildings" and "land" and so on, the hotel and the car park might not be deemed "land" but there might be land at the back of the hotel etc.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>All of those issues can be resolved.  If there had been willingness, those issues could have been resolved.  Maybe it is too late given the late stage we are at in dealing with the Finance Bill.  I must flag, however, that the approach being taken is wrong.  The Department, through a direction from the Minister, should have stipulated that the CGT four-year exemption should only have been for land.  As with the I-RES, we were able to create a new, whole new definition of companies that hold property.  We could have done the same thing for those assets that would comprise land alone.  That is my main concern.  That is why I want a report and monitoring.  I want to see the impact of somebody selling a hotel.  We do not see the impact but people will seriously benefit from my amendment financially.</p></speech>

Next year, we will see both public and private housing delivered, although we need more supply.</p>  <p>  I believe in ensuring we have the right policies in place at each point in the development of the housing market.  This is why the change is the right one to make.  It has the objective of trying to increase supply.  I have explained to Deputy Doherty why we cannot separate the definitions of "land" and "building".  It is not a matter of there being no will.  Significant issues arise in respect of separating the definitions.  If I were to try to make the separation, it could actually undermine the implementation of this policy.  I expect the policy to have a material effect next year.  As I said, I will most certainly be monitoring its impact in 2018.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will be able to provide us, through the Revenue Commissioners, with some type of report or data, even if not complete, that would be sent to the finance committee or budgetary oversight committee in advance of next year&rsquo;s budget to give us some indications or trends.  Thus, there would be more than just a ministerial assessment of this measure.</p></speech>

We are not going to convince the Minister.  Amendment No. 51 is to call for a report on the potential income that would be raised by imposing a financial transaction tax.  All the indications are that the revenue raised would be heading towards &euro;1 billion.  The European Commission is in favour of such a tax, as are many of the European states.  It would be charged at a rate of 0.1% on transfers of shares and 0.1% on derivatives, but the Government will not countenance it because it touches in some small way on the interests of finance capital.</p></speech>

We are calling for a report on abolishing the local property tax, which is in reality a home tax, and replacing it with a so-called landlords' tax of &euro;600 per annum on a second home and &euro;1,000 per annum on a third and all subsequent homes.

There are wealth taxes in other countries in Europe.  They are not of the scale of the proposed millionaires' tax.  We heard in the past week or so about the 13,000 who have become dollar millionaires in Ireland over the course of the past year.  My figure is a euro millionaire figure so it would not be quite so large, but presumably not far off.  The numbers of millionaires and homeless people are increasing simultaneously.  We believe we should be taxing the wealth of the very wealthiest in society with a tax such as the millionaires' tax.</p></speech>

A survey was carried out recently that showed that eight people out of ten in the country want to see a wealth tax.  Therefore, the Minister might consider it, even in the interest of what the majority of people want.  The people want it particularly because the level of household wealth has grown by 51% since the trough in 2013.  The top 10% own 53% of it.  The number of millionaires has increased exponentially and it would be entirely justified to tax them.</p>  <p>  Even setting aside our differences on that, does the Minister not believe we should have a database on wealth distribution?  In this sort of debate, we often end up saying a tax would not raise that much and that it is all pie in the sky.  We should have a proper database on the distribution of wealth rather than just the aggregate figures that are available through the Central Bank or CSO.  Would that not be a way to assess whether the proposed tax would be useful?  We are convinced it would be.  The tax would be a fair one the objective of which would be to share the wealth in Irish society.  A database would help to provide evidence on which to base a serious discussion given that many people believe the proposed tax should be considered.</p><p>Will the Minister at least consider that we should have a database on the distribution of wealth?</p></speech>

The reason is that we already have such a progressive tax system in place in which those who have more income pay more tax.  Many different evaluations of the tax code that have been carried out by the OECD and international experts have recognised that.  The reason we do not currently have a database to assess wealth is because of the difficulty, for example, in how we would value different forms of wealth.  It may be possible to evaluate the value of assets that are regularly traded such as stocks and shares or even property but, for example, when one gets into other forms of wealth that are not traded as often it is more difficult to value them and therefore to tax them.  I am not currently aware of there being such a database in other jurisdictions but I imagine if there is Deputy Boyd Barrett will tell me in a moment.  One of the reasons no such database exists is because of the difficulty in defining and measuring wealth.  That is one of the reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The aggregate figures are collected and various bodies collect figures on wealth distribution, for example, Credit Suisse.  The survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report provided by the CSO has begun to give an assessment of the distribution of wealth, hence the figure which confirmed many of the other studies that were previously rubbished by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, about the top 10% having 54% of the wealth.  Of course we can find out.  We do not believe in a local property tax but we have a property tax base.  The Minister established a database to find out the value of property.  We can easily find out the value of property wealth and we have those figures.  We can find out the volume of deposits and the size of them via the banks and the Central Bank and likewise with shares and other such wealth.  There are ways of doing those assessments if there is a will to do them.  It is done in other countries but it seems there is no real will to do it here.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the progressive tax system but that simply does not acknowledge the exponential growth in the number of multimillionaires in this country, which every single report on wealth distribution shows is increasing dramatically.  The overall aggregate household wealth is increasing dramatically also but most ordinary people are not feeling it.  Even at an anecdotal level that would suggest there is a small group of people who are getting wealthier and in the interests of fairness it should be something the Government would examine in order to get some assessment of the wealth, where it is, how it is distributed and how we could distribute it more fairly.</p></speech>

Effectively, our amendment would delete the so-called sugar tax from the budget.  We are against the sugar tax and I have not been convinced by the arguments that have been put forward in its favour.  I should qualify that by saying that in no way are we defenders of the soft drinks industry or the sugar industry nor do we underestimate or understate the negative impact of soft drinks on health in terms of problems of obesity and diabetes.  Those are very real problems and I discourage people from drinking soft drinks at all or if possible at least to minimise their consumption.  I do not believe a sugar tax is the answer.</p><p>Another amendment which has been ruled out of order sought to have a report carried out to assess the situation but evidence already exists from other jurisdictions.  For example, in a number of American states, for example, in Philadelphia, it was shown that the impact of a sugar tax was regressive in that it would affect people on low incomes and people of colour the hardest, significantly harder as a percentage of their income than higher income earners.  We are against regressive taxation.  One could dress up water charges as a green tax or other measures as health charges but fundamentally they amount to regressive taxation and in this case puts the burden onto the consumer of those drinks, which we are against.  The tax will act in a regressive manner to shift wealth disproportionately away from lower income groups.</p><p>If the Minister could convince me that the measure would have a massively transformative impact over the other measures that could be taken I would be happy to debate the issue but I do not believe it would have the impact other measures would have.  The kind of measures I favour in terms of dealing with health crises, including those caused by sugar, include regulation, policy and measures relating to ownership and taxation but on the companies that produce the drinks rather than taxes that are simply paid by the consumer.  If the Government is serious about an approach in terms of a healthy lifestyle then let us have a carrot approach and a serious approach to increasing the amount of physical education in primary schools, which is on average one hour a week.  A study by UCD pointed out that for girls it is an average of 46 minutes a week but in reality that amounts to very little when the before and after bits are taken out.  Let us contrast that with religion, regardless of ethos, where it is two and a half hours a week.  We are the third lowest among 37 European states for time spent on physical exercise in primary schools.  If the Minister is serious about young people being healthy then he will significantly increase the amount of time spent on physical education in the school curriculum.  He would also build a real national health service which includes free visits all the way through people's lives to dentists and doctors, which would allow them to have a relationship with those health professionals and instead of this country being a low spender on health promotion we would become a high spender.  Those things would have much more of a radical impact in terms of people's lives and as part of an education and health promotion campaign could dramatically reduce people's consumption of high sugar soft drinks.</p><p>In addition, I favour regulation such as the measures relating to alcohol that are very controversial.  We support the ban on alcohol advertisements for anything to do with sport and the same approach should apply to soft drinks.  It should not be allowed to promote drinks that are full of sugar which have a very thin veneer of connection to sport.  We should regulate that out of existence.  Similarly, we should regulate the existence of vending machines for soft drinks cans in places where young people congregate, which I think still includes some schools, community centres, swimming pools and other such venues whereby people are able to access such drinks if they want but if they are not pushed in the way they currently are it would have more of an impact.</p><p>I am in favour of taxing corporations.  Let us have an extra tax on the profits of those corporations which are primarily involved in the production of junk food and junk drinks.</p><p>The same applies in terms of regulation of advertising of soft drinks and junk foods.</p> <p> I will make another point quickly.  I agree it is not the same and I am not trying to suggest it is the same.  I accept that all the scientific studies required have not yet been done.  However, we should not suggest that the alternatives to full-sugar soft drinks, including drinks with saccharine and all the other additives, are not without complications.  A number of studies indicate the complications of artificial sweeteners.  They have the same effect of getting people used to sweet tastes and, therefore, they can make people consume more sugar elsewhere in their lives and diets.  This is not the answer to a problem.  It causes problems and is a regressive measure.</p></speech>

While speaking on the issue, I am deeply conscious that I am filling in for Teachta Doherty, who has gone out for his tea.  Most likely, he is having beans, chips and a can of Coke.  He is one of those people who should be in the Chamber to listen to this.  He is one of those people who likes soft drinks but still supports the principle of the tax.</p>  <p>  This is not a new idea; it has been around for a long time.  It has been examined by different sectoral committees, including the Joint Committee on Health.  I am not convinced by the arguments of the previous speaker that this is somehow a tax on the poor or the working class or anything like that.  It should never be a case of either-or.  My party supports higher taxes on wealth and higher incomes.  We support effective corporation taxes and so forth.  It is not the case that someone could on the one hand support this but not be in favour of progressive taxation on the other hand.</p>  <p>  Incidentally, we had a proposal to include a sugar tax in our alternative budget.  While I am putting this question to the Minister, I am conscious that we would use associated revenue to spend generally across all services, albeit we proposed an increase in health spending.  When people see new taxes like this introduced, they need assurance.  We can win the support of the public if they see that the money is actually used for practical purposes.  Given that this tax is being sold on the basis of encouraging people's behaviour and so on, will the Minister give consideration to ring-fencing money raised from the sugar tax for the issues about which we have spoken, including the promotion of healthy living, illness prevention, primary care and so on?  Can that link be demonstrated?  We must try to win support for these types of taxes.  People need to see that the money is actually being used rather than simply going into a black hole.  We need to ensure that we invest in comprehensive holistic primary care and so on.  The Minister might outline his intentions to ring-fence, if at all.</p></speech>

I agree with what the Government is doing.  We should ensure the money raised is put into education and health.  Better education will help our youngsters, and our grown-ups in some cases, to use better food and to avoid these soft drinks.  I will oppose the amendment.  I commend the Government on what it has done.</p></speech>

The effectiveness of the measure will not be measured by the amount of taxation it brings in for the State but rather by how it changes the offering of companies and the behaviour of consumers.  Certainly, soft drinks suppliers are changing and diversifying their products.  They were doing so even before the introduction of this tax.  In that respect, it has already made a contribution as a public health measure.  The effects of this tax are largely unknown.  It would be wrong to overstate the importance or likely consequences.</p>  <p>  It is easy to put more and more responsibility on schools and maintain that schools should be doing this or that.  Schools have limited resources and are stretched.  Their core function is one of education.  The big issue in many schools in my area relates to overcrowding and schools awaiting new developments.  These schools only have small yards and the children cannot even run in them.  That is the reality in many schools in my area.</p>  <p>  I welcome this initiative.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports it but we do not support the amendment.</p></speech>

Anyway, I am glad the Sinn F&eacute;in policy on this matter is clear and that the party supports the principle of the sugar tax.</p>  <p>  In some ways, Deputy Paul Murphy is one of the most unlikely socialists I have ever come across.  He continually preaches the need for higher taxation.  He points to the role of taxes and how taxes need to be used to change behaviour.  Yet, every time we bring in a tax with that intention, he appears to oppose it.  I would have thought that if anyone can agree with the principle of tax policy being used as a way of influencing behaviour, surely it would be someone such as Deputy Murphy, who advocates higher taxes on many forms of activity every day of the week.  When I saw that Deputy Murphy had tabled an amendment in this regard, I initially assumed that he must have been calling for a higher tax, since that appears to be his normal response to every other form of tax policy that we introduce.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made the point that he is not convinced by some of the arguments put forward.  Of course, that is always his right.  In recent years, however, in the debate on issues like childhood obesity, many of the clinical experts in this area have called for tax to be used to reduce the excess consumption of drinks that have a high sugar content and that can cause great difficulties for children in later life.  That is why we are bringing in the measure.</p>  <p>  It will bring in a yield to the State of approximately &euro;40 million but the reason we are bringing in the measure is because we believe it can play an important role in the Government&rsquo;s action plan, A Healthy Weight for Ireland.  The plan is about trying to put in place a number of different measures to deal with the growing difficulties we have relating to obesity.  This tax is not being introduced in isolation.  It is one of a range of different policies that either have been brought in or are in the process of being brought in, such as legislation relating to food labelling, calorie posting in restaurants and incentives for industry to reformulate products.  This tax is a classic example of how it can be done and there is some evidence that it is already happening.  Other measures include providing health services in primary and secondary schools, better provision of information and guidelines for people through the media, training of health care staff and healthy eating initiatives.</p>  <p>  I do not contend for a moment that this tax on its own will change all of the behaviour we seek to change.  I do believe, however, it will make a contribution.  I would have hoped Deputy Paul Murphy, as a full-throated socialist, would embrace this tax rather than seeking to oppose it.</p></speech>

As Deputy Michael McGrath stated, I enjoy a can of Coke sometimes.  This is an important issue.  I told Deputy Cullinane that if he stated in the House that I was drinking Coke, my wife would have a good go at me when I arrive home tonight because I am trying to lose weight.</p>  <p>  A while back, while waiting to be interviewed on "Morning Ireland", I had a conversation with a clinical expert on obesity who was about to be interviewed in a slot.  We discussed the issue of obesity and another issue about which I was due to speak on the programme.  He told me my party needed to get to grips with obesity, an issue which impacts most on deprived areas.  He pointed out that, as a result of obesity, people in these areas are also deprived of many opportunities and stated that one of the key steps, albeit not the only one, was a sugar tax.  Investment is needed in physical education in schools and in making sport accessible in deprived areas.  While I do not wish to diminish the great work done by the GAA, soccer academies and a wide range of other sports, it can be expensive to keep up with a sport, whether paying for new football boots or a sports bag or making the weekly voluntary contributions.  These issues must all be addressed. </p>  <p>  The imposition of a sugar tax is a good move.  Deputy McGrath is correct in this regard.  We have learned already that the estimated revenue from the tax has already been revised downwards on the basis that companies have decided to alter the ingredients of their products.  Moreover, arising from the decision to introduce a sugar tax, people are becoming more aware that these products are one of the causes of obesity.  This can only be good because obesity is a major killer.</p>  <p>  I was convinced by the arguments made by the clinical professor to whom I spoke in the "Morning Ireland" waiting room, although I was not happy when he broke the news to me that I was obese, even if he did not do so on air.  It is for this reason that I no longer drink Coke.  We all have to try to lose a couple of inches from our waistlines.</p></speech>

There is a big difference between a glass of milk and a glass of Coke.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is scraping the bottom of the can in support of his amendment.</p>  <p>  The sugar tax is a good measure but it will not be the be all and end all.  We must do much more as a society to tackle obesity, which will require more than taxation measures, although these also have a role to play.  That is the reason I am pleased to support the measure.</p>  <p>  My only concern is that all forms of taxation need to have a shock effect and achieving this is a balancing act.  I am not sure the levy is set at a sufficiently high level.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in our alternative budget, went further than the Minister's proposal on the basis that a significant increase in price is needed to achieve a change in behaviour.  If one incrementally increases a tax, people become used to paying a little extra and they are not presented with an in-your-face choice as to whether they wish to continue down a particular route or consider alternatives.</p></speech>

I do not believe imposing additional costs on products such as these will reduce consumption any more than I believed increasing the costs of bin collection would reduce waste output.  What is needed are alternatives that enable people to recycle.  If recycling is promoted and recycling infrastructure is provided, people are sensible enough to do the right thing.  Much the same applies to the consumption of sugary drinks.  We need to appeal to people's intelligence rather than hitting them in the pocket without explaining what we are doing.</p>  <p>  Young people these days are very intelligent but they are battered with advertising which suggests these types of drinks are fun and will enhance their quality of life.  They become addicted to these products as a result of advertising.  Once they are addicted, it is difficult to wean themselves off these drinks.  Consequently, I do not believe this tax will make much, if any, difference.</p>  <p>  I also note there is no commitment to ring-fence the revenues from the tax for health promotion measures.  I would give the measure some credence, although I would still disagree with it on the basis that a regressive tax is the wrong approach to the problem, if the Government gave a commitment to invest every single, solitary cent of revenue from the sugar tax in various forms of health promotion.  This would include, as Deputy Paul Murphy stated, the banning of advertising of sugary drinks in sport, removing vending machines and ensuring sugary drinks are no longer sold in schools or where young people gather.  Critically, it would involve resourcing physical education, not only in terms of hours, as Deputy Murphy suggested, but by addressing the lack of facilities for engaging in sport in schools in working-class areas.</p>  <p>  The Minister may not be aware of it but some of his colleagues are certainly aware of a battle being fought with the Christian Brothers who plan to sell the playing fields of Clonkeen College.  This school, which is in my local area, has a fantastic record and history in Gaelic football, soccer and so on.  The sports fields it has used for years are being taken off them and despite appeal after appeal being made by parents, teachers, students and Deputies, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, will not lift a finger because, he says, the decision has nothing to do with him.  This is a publicly funded school, yet the Minister is allowing the Christian Brothers to pay off debts incurred as a result of the abuse they inflicted on previous generations of children by taking playing fields off future generations of children who need them for sport.</p>  <p>  The Government must resource and provide facilities at school level.  Gyms are needed, as are education and health promotion initiatives to encourage people to engage in healthy activity and to see the folly of imagining that life would be made better by drinking sugar-filled drinks.  As has been stated, these measures could be paid for by taxing some of the companies concerned but the Government never adopts that approach.  Instead, it always chooses to hit people in the pocket.  Any charge based on consumption inevitably hits the least well-off.  The wealthy, who, incidentally, have access to playing fields and gyms and money to pay for all these types of activities, will not be hit by this tax.  The Government is going about this in the wrong way and its sugar tax will not work.  Notwithstanding my differences with him on this issue, if the Minister were serious about the tax, he would give a firm commitment here and now to ensure every cent generated by the tax will be used for health promotion of the type I have described.</p></speech>

To go back over recent years, when the household tax was introduced it was described as a tax for local services.  We were asked how socialists could possibly be opposed to developing local tax structures when socialists across the world support such structures.  The household tax was then replaced by the property tax.</p><p>We were told it was a tax on wealth, that socialists across the world support taxes on wealth and were asked why we did not support this tax.  It was added to by the water tax, which we were told it was a green tax.  We were told socialists across the world support taxes on the consumption of water and that it is an environmental measure.  Now we come to the sugar tax, the Minister states he is shocked and surprised again that socialists are opposed to these sorts of taxes.  The Minister might want to draw some broader conclusions about our approach to taxation because I do not agree.  We do not put forward regressive taxation measures on ordinary people as a way of changing behaviour.  That is not a socialist approach to taxation.</p> <p> While we call for more taxes on the wealthy, it has nothing in common with that kind of nudge theory of trying to change individuals' behaviour.  We are in favour of taxes to raise wealth and resources in order that they can be used by the public - by the State - to improve people's lives.  That is what we are for.  If one seeks a contrast between the approach of Hillary Clinton, a liberal in an American sense, and Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, the former was in favour of the sugar tax in the US presidential election.  She was in favour of this sort of nudge theory whereas Bernie Sanders was against such a tax because it is a regressive tax and was instead in favour of the kind of measures we propose.  We are debating a sugar tax but fundamentally, there is a philosophical economic approach to how one sees taxation and what the purpose of taxation is.</p></speech>

All Members will be familiar with that scheme and will have received many representations on it in the course of their work, principally on the issue of the qualifying criteria for the primary medical certificate.  Deputies will be acutely aware of that aspect but that is not the issue my party is raising here.</p><p>Certain qualifying organisations may also qualify under the scheme but the existing criteria are narrow.  Principally, an organisation, in order to qualify, must be chiefly engaged in the care and transport for severely and permanently disabled persons.  My colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, raised an issue with me relating to a special needs school he is representing and hopes to help.  The school is seeking to purchase a bus for the transport of pupils attending it.  However, the majority of the pupils do not have the primary medical certificate and under the existing law, the school would not be in a position to qualify.  We do not seek to change the law for an individual case but the case highlights a genuine issue that needs to be addressed relating to the qualifying criteria for an organisation to benefit from this scheme and avail of the tax concession.</p><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for engaging on this issue.  I understand the Department is willing to consider an amendment to a statutory instrument, SI 353 of 1994, which, if the Department is in a position to proceed, will come before the House and so on.  Essentially, what I think is under consideration, which we would welcome, is that instead of the definition being that the organisation must be chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons, it would be replaced with a requirement that at least one service user for whom the organisation provided care and transport services would have obtained a primary medical certificate.  That would be an important change that we would warmly welcome.  I encourage the Government to proceed with that and take the necessary steps for it to be executed.  While it could certainly benefit a certain number of special schools, it may also benefit other service providers around the country.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, took a particular interest when I raised the issue and I thank him for his engagement.  That would be real progress.  It does not redefine the eligibility criteria for the primary medical certificate.  That is an issue we have raised previously and will raise again but this is at the level of the qualifying organisation.  It is an important change that it is to be hoped will happen and that we would welcome.</p></speech>

It is a wonderful facility with a voluntary board scrapping and scrounging to try to pay the excellent manager and staff using community employment schemes.  Across the border, in County Limerick, the HSE is funding the staff but it is not doing so in this case.  The centre has received a generous contribution from one J.P. McManus but now it is caught in this trap.  Its dealer told the centre to get rid of its old bus, which is not actually old as it dates from 2010, but which has given endless trouble and has cost it a fortune.  Consequently, it must upgrade the bus.</p>  <p>  I am sure all Deputies visit day care centres and know of the work they do and how the elderly, who are so isolated now in towns and rural areas, as well as in the cities, need these services.  There may be a couple who have the primary medical certificate but there is a need for change in this regard.  A change was made because as I stated, the centre bought the bus in 2010 and at that time, it was allowed to get the rebate.  Subsequently, a statutory instrument or something was signed or a ruling made by the HSE that the centre cannot get it.  It is the cruelest of blows because the people who go to that centre love it.  They look forward to being picked up at their homes once or twice a week.  As I said, this change is necessary.  Deputy Michael McGrath stated the Minister is looking at changing it.  It has to be changed as it was a hammer blow to these people.</p>  <p>  We also heard mention of VAT in the budget and a start was made to give VAT back to voluntary groups.  I refer to organisations such as Knocklofty RehabCare centre and RehabCare Clonmel, as well as special needs people throughout the county who need this.</p>  <p>  One will never have a situation where all the people qualify.  They might be hugely restricted in their development but may not be missing a leg or a limb.  I am sorry to use such crude language but that is what qualification entails.  One can be profoundly disabled and be able to move around or profoundly ill in other ways.  These are the people who we are trying to keep out of the nursing homes and hospitals.  This is a support for half a day or three quarters of a day, where they are picked up in the morning, brought in for their tea and a scone and where they avail of a chiropodist, hairdressers and so on.  They have their meal and have a little entertainment and games and then are brought back home again.  It is a lifeline, keeping such people alive, out of hospital and out of nursing homes.  It is mainly organised by a board of directors who are volunteers and we cannot ever forget that.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether the Department of Finance or the HSE changed the rule but it was a mean, lean decision.  It flies in the face of all we are trying to do for social inclusion.</p><p>We talk about equality but where is the equality in that?  Do we want them all to be without a limb?  Is that what we are down to?  Goodness, this is hapless.  They need supports in many other ways.  This is stimulation and it reinvigorates them, and while they may be lost then from the Thursday or Friday until the following Monday or Tuesday, at least they can look forward to this.  We will all be visiting these places at Christmas, we hope, for the different celebrations.</p> <p> This has to be changed.  I hope that common sense will prevail.  There is no-one trying to cod the system here.  It is not like the Ponzi schemes we were talking about in the context of other amendments, where billions have been written off by big businesses and companies.  This is about ordinary people, the enablers in Ireland who are providing these day care centres.  They are fundraising in the main, with some support from the HSE.  In terms of upkeep, damage from storms, no matter what it is, they have to fundraise.  This is a shock, though, because they could buy a bus in 2010 and get a certain amount of the funding back under the grant scheme.  Now they find that when they are forced to buy a bus in 2017 they cannot avail of the grant scheme because not all of the users are on crutches or in wheelchairs.  There are some who are in wheelchairs, certainly but many are able bodied and can walk.</p> <p> I hope that the Minister and his officials will look at this again because it is a wrong move and it is detrimental to the well-being of the elderly, the not-so-elderly and the vulnerable, as well as to the volunteers who try to run these places outside of their normal jobs.  They have already paid their taxes.</p></speech>

There are community centres all over the country where people voluntarily cook food and provide different types of activities for people who would not see another person were it not for the community centres and the services they provide.  As was rightly pointed out earlier, some of the people concerned may not be without a limb but they are not able to walk.  Many are in wheelchairs and have family members or neighbours helping them to get out of bed in the mornings.  Then people from the community services come to help them.  A lot of these community services are struggling to survive and do not have a lot of money.  When they go about buying a vehicle, they try to avail of whatever tax allowances are open to them.</p>  <p>  In terms of the medical certificate side of things, there are massive problems.  We all talk about helping people with disabilities, but one thing we should do, as politicians, is make sure that we do not put obstacles in the way of those who are helping to improve the lives of those with disabilities by bringing them out and enabling them to have a chat with others in a community centre or a local hall.  These services are provided in cities, towns and rural areas.  There are great community organisations which are bringing these people to local community centres three to five days per week.  They can have a wash, have a meal and get involved in various activities.  The work of these community organisations is invaluable.</p>  <p>  When these organisations try to improve things by getting a reliable bus that will bring people to the centres, they have difficulty with Revenue in terms of getting money back because of regulations or because of the way something has been put in place.  We need to take the obstacles out of that.  I know that many of them have charitable status, which is welcome.  A bus is a big investment.  Some of the roads that the buses are travelling on are not in great shape, and after a certain amount of mileage, the buses get worn out.  In many cases, it would cost more to fix them than to replace them.  These community organisations are fundraising too.  Every community fundraises and they are doing all of this off their own bat.  There are good people throughout this country who are doing this day in and day out.  It is the quiet people around Ireland who are making these sacrifices and doing this work.  Then they see an obstacle that is blocking them from getting something to which they should be entitled automatically.  There should not even be a question about this.</p>  <p>  I would say to the Minister that while this may be an oversight, it needs to be addressed.  It is not as if it will cost a massive amount of money.  It is well known in all relevant Departments that the numbers involved are small.  In my own area, people from four parishes would be brought into one community centre.  That is the way they do it.  It is done efficiently.  We should make sure that we facilitate these people for the good deeds they are doing out there.</p></speech>

Without that service, which involves being collected by a bus or organised transport and being brought to the community centre, they would be prisoners in their own homes and would not be able to enjoy the activities that are being provided.  The Government would pay a hell of a lot more if these people ended up in institutionalised settings or in need of further care in their homes.  These community organisations are doing the Government a service and the least we could do is go some of the way towards assisting them in what they are doing.  Any responsible Government taking care of its weaker citizens would reach out to them in the context of this provision in the Finance Bill and assist them.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath's amendment simply asks for a report on some of these matters.  I asked on Committee Stage if the Minister would consider reviewing the other area of the primary medical certificate, how people make applications and so on.  Even at this stage of the day, we still have not received some of the information requested at that committee meeting.  I mentioned it to one of the Minister's officials who said that it was being prepared today and that the Minister was signing off on it but we still have not received it.  It may have come by email in the past while but my point is that a commitment was given to provide us with the necessary information which would inform our Report Stage debate.  It might have eliminated the need for some of the discussion around these amendments but we did not get that information.  I do not think that is fair play.</p>  <p>  In terms of the amendment before us, the request made on Committee Stage was that the Minister would give us the opinion of the Department, his own opinion or the policy being pursued with regard to primary medical certificates and all of this area.  Can it be loosened up?  Can we be of more assistance in the context of these schemes?  I ask the Minister to look at that scheme again and to look at the amendment before us.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>He must try to understand people in rural communities in particular, but also in urban centres, and give them an opportunity to have a reasonable outlet in their lives, provided by communities in the context of a bus collection service, and allow them to qualify in some way for the scheme.</p></speech>

The reference to "No. 2" on line 4 is incorrect and needs to be deleted.  This has been checked and clarified by the Bills Office.</p>  <p>  I propose to take amendments Nos. 60 and 61 together.</p>  <p>  To respond directly to the Chairman of the finance committee, I spoke to Deputy Michael McGrath, who put forward the amendment on Committee Stage, and clarified this matter with him, as did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p>  <p>  These amendments concern access to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which plays an important role in increasing the mobility of citizens with severe physical disabilities.  The scheme is a significant tax expenditure, costing &euro;65 million in taxes foregone and grant payments in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the local government fund in respect of the relief from motor tax provided to members of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In accordance with SI 353 of 1994, registered charitable organisations are eligible to become members of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme where they are chiefly engaged in the care and transport of disabled persons who have obtained a primary medical certificate.  The effect of the amendment, by removing the word &ldquo;chiefly&rdquo;, would be to significantly broaden access to the scheme for charitable organisations.  The amendment could open up the scheme to organisations which are not primarily involved in the care and transport of persons with disabilities.  As such, it would result in a poorly targeted scheme and a large additional liability to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Following discussion on Committee Stage, officials have brought forward proposed amendments to the regulations governing the scheme to address the issue raised by Deputy McGrath.  If the Deputy will withdraw the amendments, I will make the necessary changes to the scheme through the regulations.</p>  <p>  I too was spoken to by the group in my local area, St. Aidan's in Gorey, which is also buying a bus.  I was aware of this issue prior to it coming up in Finance Bill.  While it was being progressed in any case, I am glad we had the opportunity to speak in a constructive way with Deputy McGrath.  I am satisfied the matter will be concluded to the satisfaction of all those agencies involved.</p></speech>

It would be an important change.  The difference it will make in practice, in some cases, means the difference between a bus being bought or not - that is the simple reality - and that difference is life-changing for some people in terms of their quality of life on a day-to-day basis, in particular their experience of getting out and about, and so on.  It is very important.  I acknowledge that, back in 2015, an amendment to the scheme provided wider access to charitable organisations because, up to that point, relief was confined to bodies not primarily funded by the State.  That was changed then and if the Government proceeds with the change we have discussed, and which will have to go through all the usual channels, the removal of the word "chiefly" will open up the possibility of making this scheme available to many service providers.  That is critically important.  The essential change, which is a significant one, is that the existing requirement that more than half of the service users need to have a primary medical certificate will be replaced with a requirement that just one service user will have a primary medical certificate.</p>  <p>  I can understand the perspective of the Minister of State, the Department and Revenue on what they call tax expenditures and the need to control that but, I believe this is quite narrow in scope.  When we consider the difference it will make and the impact it will have on the lives of people who are very vulnerable, I believe there is very strong support for this in the House.  I urge the Minister of State and his officials to work on this and to bring forward the amendment to the statutory instrument as quickly as possible, and to assist - we can all play our part - in making organisations aware of the change and the benefit.  It should be acknowledged that the savings under this scheme are very significant.  I thank the Minister of State.  I will withdraw amendment No. 60.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what the Minister of State said about his own situation in Wexford and I am sure there are many such cases.  I have a question about the mechanics of how and when, and the delay.  In the case of St. Vincent's day care, a wonderful institution in Tipperary Town, it had literally bought a bus when this cropped up.  Those people got good support from a certain equine industry across the border in Limerick - we in Tipperary never refuse money from any county.  I salute J.P. McManus for this.  They wrote to him, he assessed it and he did this.  However, they are stuck with this difficulty.  Many organisations are in the same position and this is the time of year when they are changing vehicles and garages might have special deals.  In this case, however, the group has bought the bus.</p>  <p>  It was pointed out that "chiefly" is a very important word in this regard, which I accept.  How long will this change take?  This group has bought the bus and it cost them a fortune as it is not an old bus.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, the roads are not great and this bus was just a bad model, so it was hard luck they ended up with it.  The dealer told them it would cost too much to keep it going and that they should take it off the road.  This is what they have done.  They went looking for money and have been fundraising, which they would have been doing anyway.  It is the difference between seeing people get out of this day care centre or not.  The group has volunteer drivers much of the time.  This is very necessary and I hope the bureaucracy will not delay it too long.  The Minister of State might give some clarification as to when it will be enacted.</p></speech>

In every part of the country this is one of the problems Deputies have faced.  I thank him for giving this because, while it is small thing, it is important and helps communities throughout the country.  While the Minister of State might not be able to do so, he might clarify for those who have sent in paperwork during this transitional period whether that will be sorted out.  Will it be looked on favourably from now on and when will it be sorted out?</p></speech>

To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, he has agreed to engage on the issue to see whether it can be progressed.  The issue we are raising relates to the taxation of travel and subsistence expenses actually incurred by independent professional contractors, many of whom, as we know, are working in the areas of IT, engineering, pharma and biopharma in regard to delivering major capital projects across the country.  We are certainly not talking about bogus self-employment in any respect.  These are people who are moving from project to project, which is the nature of the work they do.  They are incurring actual expenses which I would argue are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of their business.  The Revenue and the Department appear to take a different view.</p><p>It is an issue in the sense that we have to remain competitive in the delivery of major capital projects around the country.  We have lost many key independent professional contractors with expertise to overseas because they travel from project to project.</p> <p> This issue needs to be examined.  I appreciate the fundamental nature of the requirement that all self-employed expenses must meet the key test of being wholly and exclusively incurred for business purposes.  That cannot be compromised.  In respect of employees, there is an additional requirement that expenses be incurred in respect of the performance of their duties.</p> <p> I will engage with the Minister on this matter.  If there are proposals, they will be tabled at the finance committee in the normal course.  I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy McGrath.  We must show encouragement.  Being self-employed is not easy.  One is responsible for everything.  If one gets sick, one has nothing on which to fall back.  Some moves have been made by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, regarding PRSI, but the cohort of people to whom Deputy McGrath referred are mainly from abroad.  We need every innovative and highly skilled person, including in IT terms, to assist in our economy's recovery.  As such, I support the amendment.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage, I outlined my concerns about the approach for which this amendment calls.  Moving in this direction would breach the policy that it is not appropriate for travel to and from work to be a tax deductible expense.  Regarding the taxation of expenses, the Revenue Commissioners have specific concerns about the practicality of the proposals.  Based on the figures that have been shared with my Department, the impact on the sector of the current treatment of such expenses for contractors appears to be relatively small.</p>  <p>  I have raised these issues with Deputy Michael McGrath.  He is still of the view that further engagement could be helpful.  He is aware of my concerns on the matter.  I am happy to meet groups that hold this view to determine whether a further teasing out of the issue is merited.  Based on my current views, however, I appreciate the Deputy's withdrawal of the amendment.  I will engage with the group, perhaps early in the new year.</p></speech>

The purpose of raising it again is to refine and clarify the commitment that we have been given.</p><p>Children's footwear and clothing are zero rated, but only up to certain size thresholds that were set in 1984.  Current Revenue practice in respect of the footwear threshold is up to and including size 5.5 and, in respect of clothing, up to and including a 32 in. chest or a 26 in. waist.  The position appears to be that, under the EU VAT directive, the ten years of age cut-off point cannot be changed.  This may be an interpretation of the directive, but the Department's position is that it cannot change.  However, what can change - if there is evidence - is the average shoe and clothing sizes of ten year olds.  These sizes were last considered in 1984, presumably in consultation with the industry and so on.</p><p>I raise this issue because, as every parent knows, the difference in the price of footwear between sizes 5.5 and 6 or 7 is not just down to VAT.  The difference is significant.  A size 5.5 runner might be &euro;40 whereas a size 6 runner might be &euro;70.  VAT does not explain the difference.</p><p>This is an important issue for families.  Will Revenue commit to engaging with stakeholders to examine whether there is a basis for revising the average sizes of footwear and clothing for a ten year old?  That is my essential request and is what I would like to have done.</p></speech>

It was 1984 when the thresholds were revised, which was 33 years ago.  We penalise a kid for growing too tall or being a bit heavier than other children.  This issue needs to be examined, given that the current approach is not working.  Deputy Michael McGrath has been fair in how he has tabled this amendment, and I ask the Minister to agree to it.</p></speech>

Under Article 110 of the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services that were in place on and from 1 January 1991 but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services after that date.</p>  <p>  Since the mid-1980s, Irish VAT law has defined children's clothing and footwear as that not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build and foot size of ten years of age.  This includes clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age.  As the legislation in 1991 provided that only clothing and footwear appropriate to children up to ten years of age could avail of the zero rate of VAT, extending the provision to children older than that would be counter to Article 110.  In order to remain compliant with the EU VAT directive, the age limit to which the zero rate applies in this case cannot be raised.</p>  <p>  The practical application of the measure is that zero rating applies to children's clothing of sizes up to and including 32 in. chest, 26 in. waist or 152 cm height, and children's footwear up to and including size 5.5, or 38.  These sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at manufacturing and distribution levels.</p>  <p>  While EU VAT law prohibits any increase in the age of children's clothing to which the zero rate applies, the practical application of the current zero rate to children aged up to ten years can be redefined where there is evidence that the size limitations have changed since the current criteria were agreed in the 1980s.  A further detailed review of the average size of footwear for children was carried out in 1997, but there was insufficient evidence to warrant a change in the 5.5 limit.  If sufficient evidence is supplied to the effect that average shoe and clothing sizes for ten year olds have changed since 1984, the Revenue Commissioners could review the matter.  Where the industry representing children's footwear and clothing has reason to believe the current practical size measurements no longer reflect the average child aged ten, it should contact the Revenue Commissioners, who will review the matter.</p><p>Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p> <p> Legislation currently deals with VAT on the average shoe size of 5.5.  A second part of this conversation is why a shoe size of 6 can be nearly double the price of a pair which are 5.5.  The VAT rate does not explain that.  Perhaps we need to seek an explanation from the clothing and footwear industries.  Perhaps the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach could invite them into explain the significant anomalies.  I know from my children that the price of shoes increased from &euro;30 or &euro;35 to &euro;70 when going from 5.5 to 6.</p></speech>

The price differential is not solely explained by VAT.  Products are marketed in a way that shows a range up to 5.5 for footwear, but beyond that the range differs and a completely different price model is used.  That is the reality.  VAT is part of the price differential because the simple truth is that clothing and footwear sizes appropriate to an average ten year old are VAT exempt and zero rated.  Beyond that, the rate is 23%.  It is a hefty increase and, as I said, a burden on parents and families.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is putting the onus on the industry, but there is no incentive for it to ask Revenue for a review and-or to suggest the thresholds need to be raised.  I would like the Department and Revenue to take the initiative and undertake a review.  The Minister of State needs to examine the files from 1984 - the organisations have probably changed since &ndash; and find out who Revenue engaged with at that time and how it arrived at these thresholds.</p>  <p>  The evidence is clear.  I am asking for a review and not for Revenue and the Department to wait for others to come to them because I do not think that is going to happen.  I do not think there is a commercial incentive for the industry to do so.  It is taking advantage of the situation and will not seek to change it.</p></speech>

A strong case was made for a report to be produced by the Department on this issue.  The rate was established in the 1980s.  I am not sure whether body sizes have changed since that time because we do not have a report.  We all have knowledge and experience.  There is a major jump in prices, which puts pressure on families.  Not all families are average.</p>  <p>  As I said on Committee Stage, my 11 year old wears size nine shoes and school trousers for a 15 year old; he has been buying adult clothes for quite some time.  This type of analysis should be carried out.  The price differential is a serious issue.  I can understand that changing the rules on shoe sizes would affect many adults.  Can the Minister of State explain why the Department will not commission a report at this time?  Why would the Department not carry out research instead of asking the industry or somebody else to come to it?</p></speech>

Some people in the House were not even born then.  They are currently reviewing the information contained therein.  In 1984, clothing and footwear sizes were determined after consultation with footwear trade interests at manufacturing and distribution levels.  The panel included the Federation of Irish Footwear Manufacturers, the Federation of Irish Sports Distributors, the National Federation of Drapers, Start-rite shoes (children only) and the Irish Wholesale Footwear Association.  An investigation has revealed that further consultations were undertaken by Revenue with the footwear industry in 1997 following calls by the sector for a review.  This included KPMG, the Irish Footwear Association, Dunnes Stores, Clarks, Fagan and Associates, Dubarry, Deloitte, Goodbody, Coopers &amp;amp; Lybrand, PwC and BDO.  We will ask Revenue to review the determination of sizes for the average ten year old.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  If we returned to the 13.5% VAT rate on the hospitality sector it would raise &euro;491 million.  That is a lot of money, which could be better spent elsewhere.  I did not necessarily agree with the decision at the time, but there was a case for giving a tax break to the hospitality sector when we were in the depths of recession.  However, it has boomed since.  One only has to walk the streets of Dublin to see how well the hospitality sector is doing.  I do not think we could justify using &euro;491 million in this way.  It could be spent on plenty of other things, most notably addressing the housing crisis.  Many other areas could benefit from this money.  We should return to the 13.5% rate.  The Minister made it clear he did not agree and I do not expect he will change his mind on foot of what I have said.</p></speech>

Some parts of the country, such as Dublin, are doing well and hotels are flying.  Unfortunately, hotels down the country have struggled.  The 9% VAT rate needs to be left in place.  The Department needs to come up a system which deals with areas where hotels are filled to capacity, such as in Dublin where those looking for hotel bed cannot get them.  On the other hand, bus loads of people could be brought into hotels every night of the week in other parts of Ireland and plenty of beds would be available.  It is a problem.  The Minister had to leave the rate at 9%, but we have an opportunity to make sure we deal with areas of major economic growth where hotel beds are full.</p><p>The Department will be able to tell that to the Minister.  One cannot just raise it right around the country, which is why I oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

In the negotiations on the programme for Government, we in the Rural Independent Group lobbied for the further take-up of this very successful scheme in order to apply it to building.  It was necessary at a time and we did not even have to give it to builders.  We could have given it to people buying the houses in order to increase the building of houses.</p>  <p>  This is desperately needed down the country, where the recession has not ended at all past the Red Cow interchange.  It is needed in the accommodation and other services, including those dealing with food.  Deputy Fitzmaurice stated a bus load of people could be put into some hotels but a train load could be put into many hotels and there would still be availability.  There is not a bed to be got in this city but offices are being built so I do not know where employees will rest, unless they are worked around the clock.  I do not think we are that bad yet.  I do not agree with the amendment because this VAT rate is required.</p>  <p>  Although I am straying, it is interesting because we had a debate on rural crime the other night and there was nobody to contribute from Labour, Deputy Boyd Barrett's group or Independents 4 Change.  There are two different Irelands; we live in one where it is desolate, there are no services and there are not enough garda&iacute; to patrol it.  We are being stripped of services every day of the week.  This is needed; we must live too outside the Pale.</p></speech>

The annual cost of the lower VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% is &euro;491 million per year, with a cost per VAT percentage point at &euro;109 million per year.  This is an exceptionally significant recognition through the VAT code of a very important sector within our economy.  In addition to the costs I have shared, it should also be noted that in the sectors covered by this rate, employment has increased gradually each year since 2011, with an overall increase of over 35% in the period from the middle of 2011 to the start of 2017.  That is equal to an increase of 40,500 jobs, which is a very significant number.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all parts of the tax code, no change made in the past to help with the recovery of the sector can now be taken to be given in future.  That is why I made the decision I did on stamp duty for non-residential commercial property.  That change was put in place to support the recovery of a sector.  Many parts of the sector have now recovered and therefore it is no longer appropriate to have the lower tax rate in place.  In the run-up to budget 2018, I considered this change, as I considered many others.  I decided it should not be made for two reasons that were touched on by Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzmaurice.  First, although there are many parts of the country in which hotel are at  full capacity - Dublin and Killarney are two very good examples - the reality is we still have many hotels and companies in the services sector in other parts of the country still working to get back to a decent ongoing position for their businesses.  As a result, I decided now is not the time to make the change.  A further reason I decided it should not be made this year came from consideration of the changes in the value of sterling.  Everybody is aware of that and I want to see the effect on short-haul tourism into Ireland from the United Kingdom market.  The performance of that market is crucial to how tourism in Ireland performs overall.  For both those reasons I decided not to make this change.  As a result, I am not in a position to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>

We are in the minority.  I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath and others concerned about the rural-urban divide, or the areas that have seen recovery in this sector against those which have not.  Those areas need help.  There is another side to the equation that can be seen with the figures we got from the Department of Finance concerning profitability in food services and accommodation.  Profits have increased by a fairly extraordinary 37%, so the areas that have recovered are making extraordinary profits.  Would it not be better to redirect this tax expenditure towards the areas that need help, such as the rural areas mentioned by the Deputies?  That is instead of giving this big tax break to all elements of the tourism, accommodation and food sector.  I know it will not happen this year but it might be worth considering for next year.  We could redirect the tax expenditure to help some of the areas that clearly are struggling or where resources could better assist in sharing the recovery.</p></speech>

They would not agree that Killarney is in the same league as Dublin.  My daughter is dancing there this weekend and my wife is down there.  She might report when they come back from the competitions on Monday.  Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about increased profits but with such increased profits come increased taxes.  There is a knock-on effect.  It has been a good and successful scheme and it is still necessary for large parts of Ireland.  I am not just talking about rural areas but everything below the Red Cow.</p></speech>

The problem is if something is introduced, the businesses that are just surviving may be blown out.  It is a balancing act in business for a Minister or anybody else.  I understand fully where the Deputy is coming from and I know the Deputy wishes to help weaker businesses in what he is saying by ensuring stronger businesses pay a bit extra.  The Department could formulate something, such as a bed tax or something for cities that are going well, if that is possible.  It might have the same result as the Deputy's amendment.  If we increase the VAT rate, businesses could be gone before they get help, which is a big problem in some areas.  This would not apply to all areas and thank God we have seen recovery in certain parts of the country, which is great and welcome.  It is a balancing act and we must keep it going.</p></speech>

That is how times have changed.</p>  <p>  We have to be mindful of businesspeople.  Members encourage people, in particular in rural areas, who run businesses such as hardware stores, small shops or pubs and tell them to be entrepreneurs.  Many of their premises will be bought for &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.  The increase in stamp duty encourages them to go off to Australia if they want and not to go into business because they would now pay an extra &euro;12,000 duty on a purchase of &euro;300,000.  People have come to me who bought land last February and March and paid their deposit and completed the first bits of contracts but there was a hold-up and problems with the purchase.  Clarification of this issue is badly needed.  Those people would have gone through with the purchase before this measure was announced if everything was right but they have been left in a quagmire and, unfortunately, it looks like they are going down the road.  Some such people borrowed to their limit.  Some others might not understand that.  A purchaser might have been bidding at an auction and made an extra bid, possibly to try to give a future to their children.  Some have gone to the banks and could not get the extra money.  Sales are in jeopardy.</p>  <p>  The Minister should go around the country and look at the small towns in which every Member is trying to encourage people to turn on a light in a dark area of town.  It gives all Members great heart when that happens, no matter what side of the political divide he or she is on.  Unfortunately, this measure has come out of the blue.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, said on the evening of the budget that it does not affect farms.  That was quoted to me by members of the Opposition that night.  We must be very clear that that is what he said.  Unfortunately, no one realised that residential and non-residential property are affected.  Many people have been caught in the crossfire.  Solicitors have put letters in newspapers about the problems it has caused and auctioneers have told us about them.</p>  <p>  I welcome the measures taken by the Minister in regard to consolidation and I am not taking from that.  I also welcome the abolition of the age limit of 67 in respect of intra-family conveyance or transfer.  I applaud the Minister for that.</p>  <p>  The amendment quotes the figure of &euro;300,000.  One will not buy a 2,000 square foot hardware store in Dublin for &euro;300,000 but one could buy such a store for less down the country because, unfortunately, in some areas no one wants to open businesses.  When we encourage a person to open a business, we should not kick that person but, rather, should be pro-business.  I acknowledge that the Minister is fond of making sure things are pro-business.  We should send out that message rather than telling people that &euro;12,000 has, unfortunately, been put out of their reach and they can say goodbye to it.</p>  <p>  I want doors to be opened in towns.  I want young farmers to come back to the land rather than it being deserted.  I want rural Ireland to thrive, as it can.  Some good measures have been implemented.  I am not criticising that.  My God, we need to deliver this amendment for those who are affected because the stamp duty increase sends out a signal that they are going to be further crucified.  There is revenue of about &euro;12 million or &euro;14 million per year on stamp duty on land purchases.  Are we going to run youngsters off the land?  While &euro;12 million or &euro;14 million might not be a lot for a country, &euro;12,000 or &euro;14,000 could be the difference between a youngster taking over the land or staying in some city in some country.  Unfortunately, we have lost many youngsters to immigration, in particular from the west of Ireland.  We are trying to bring them home and there are some good incentives in place such as the young farmers scheme.  I ask the Minister to rethink the stamp duty increase and allow an exemption up to &euro;300,000.  If he wanted to make it higher thereafter, I would support him but I ask him please to give people that opportunity.</p></speech>

We debated the amendment on Committee Stage and withdrew it and are now putting it forward for debate in the Chamber.  The shock was the surprise.  There are rumours that a farming organisation was in the know about the measure on the Friday before budget day.  I do not know if that is mere speculation but the Minister, Deputy Creed, did not seem to know about the measure when he made a statement on it.  He was either given the wrong information or he did not understand it.  It is a serious situation because many people have been caught by surprise.  They might have been planning to purchase a shop, a hardware store or a site.</p>  <p>  The former Taoiseach went to Edgeworthstown and announced in a blaze of glory that every road from Glenamaddy was going to be redone.  He did not have the skills of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in terms of tweeting and hashtag #Leo, but he did it with blunder and bluster.  All the roads were going to be rejuvenated.  There was going to be money for everything and every rural town and village was going to be enhanced and window boxes would be put in with shamrock that could be picked from them to win the parade that year.  However, nothing has happened because the money rural Ireland got from the scheme the former Taoiseach announced would not buy a stamp for the application of each business in the towns and villages I represent where there are derelict and closed-up houses.  We need to open the closed-up houses and shops and open businesses.  We need people to buy them.</p>  <p>  As I said, the figure of &euro;300,000 referenced in the amendment is pretty high if one wants to buy property in the countryside but in Dublin it would not be enough to use as hello money to go in to meet the auctioneers and the lads or get a business to the Central Bank with the Government or the bankers.  However, rural Ireland needs to be rejuvenated.  We will do several things.  We are going to go into derelict sites in every village and town in the country.  It would make sense to go with the measure I sought previously regarding the VAT rate in regard to hardware shops, building materials, plasterers and builders, although not big developers.  Those businesses should be given back the VAT charged on purchases.  If that were done and the Government encouraged councils to reduce their charges we would have living towns and villages and halve our homeless crisis.  The Government either cannot see that or has an anathema toward house building.</p>  <p>  As I said, and as Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to, many people go to an auction with some support and so on to buy a property but might be a bit nervous and go farther than the bank had sanctioned.  Many such people get a call from the bank's junior manager to tell them they have overstepped the mark and that the bank cannot loan them the sum they bid because the person had submitted projections of earnings and income that no longer add up.  Such people would have gotten a dig out from their families of &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  That is not the type of dig out that has been mentioned in respect of another former Taoiseach.</p><p>That happens in families and communities.  That is how we live in rural Ireland.  The Deputies who live in this city might not understand it.  They should come out beyond the Pale more often to see what goes on down in the real world.  This measure will add &euro;12,500 extra, which they cannot borrow.  It was not accounted for in the original figure and they will have to try to make up the shortfall and get a dig out.  This is a very necessary amendment to get businesses thriving.  We need to encourage people to set up businesses.  Deputy Michael McGrath tabled an amendment for professional people to get tax concessions.  These are ordinary people whom we have educated.  Many of them have gone abroad and want to come home.  We need to make it attractive for them to come home and we need to support and encourage them to start families to keep the schools, sports teams and the communities alive.  Otherwise, there will not be anyone to go on the bus and we will not need the blooming bus.  Rural Ireland will be a wasteland.  It will be all either planted or owned by the conglomerates, the vulture funds and indeed some of our own home grown vulture funds.  This amendment should be considered.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and I will support anything above the threshold of &euro;300,000 that we have put into the amendment and we want to stimulate those young people to set up businesses to become the innovators and employers.  They will pay taxes, rates, value added tax, VAT, and so on. </p> <p> I was invited tonight to the reopening of a pub in Tipperary, The Lady Gregory, a wonderful pub.  Everybody is delighted it is reopening and I wish the new owner or operator the best.  We need these types of places open.  We need them to keep the rates and the wages and everything else paid and to give people an outlet where they can go to celebrate.  We need shops and businesses so that people are not running into big supermarkets.  We do not want a branch of Tesco on every boreen in the country.  It was always the small shopkeeper and the small farmer that kept things going in rural Ireland.  They got us out of many recessions.  They give credit as well.  We do not get much credit from Mr. Tesco, or Mr. Lidl or Mr. Aldi or any of them.  I am not knocking them but we do not get much credit there.  We get it in the hardware shops, from the small shopkeepers.  We could put post offices, which are closing in other areas, into them too.</p> <p> I am asking for common sense in this regard because this measure in the Bill is sharp, with no grace period.  Some people were tied up in negotiations with solicitors, some had the deal done and had spit on their wrists and shook hands but their solicitors have not fulfilled the transactions, leaving them in limbo.  It is a very mean and cheap hit, especially when there is a fanfare about rejuvenating rural Ireland.  That is idle talk.  This amendment is an effort to rejuvenate rural Ireland.  We are asking the Minister to put his shoulder to the wheel.  The Minister of State and the two Deputies behind the Minister are from rural Ireland.  They know what I am talking about.  They know the villages and the towns in their areas.  This amendment will help the homeless, get living towns up and running and enhance the environment with the Tidy Towns committees which do voluntary fundraising as well as brilliant work.  They will be helped as well.  It is a win-win situation.</p> <p> This provision in the Bill is a mean cut.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said he was not aware of it or did not understand it.  We think a farming organisation knew about it beforehand, which is not nice.  We are giving the Minister a chance to correct this tonight and rejuvenate rural Ireland, support young people to come home, support the families in rural areas and keep the schools, clubs and everything else going in those areas.  Without rural Ireland alive we will only have trees growing, forestry plantation and desolation. </p></speech>

I understand the thought process behind it but I do not think the first &euro;300,000 in commercial property should be at 2%.  I support the 6%.  It is there not only to raise money but to have an effect.  There has to be a cooling down of the commercial property market.  </p>  <p>  I support amendment No. 66, as tabled by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath.  This is a sensible amendment.  It will go back to 2% for the first &euro;300,000 of agricultural land.  That is sensible.  Tax can do two things: raise income and lead to behavioural changes.  We need to support the agricultural sector.  Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzmaurice are completely correct in that. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge, as others have done, the changes made in this Bill and the last one that support that sector.  In this Bill, however, the increase in stamp duty is not supportive and this is a problem.  That is a sensible half-way meeting point where the first &euro;300,000 would be subject to 2%.  I support that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.555" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300062#NNN00500"><p>The broad background to this is that the rate for non-residential commercial property for many years at different times in our economy was 9%.  It then moved down to 6% and then to 2%.  It went from 6% to 2% because so little activity was happening in any of the different forms of non-residential commercial property to which the rate applied.</p>  <p>  At 2% it is a quarter of what it has been at most recent points in our economy and it is one-third of what it was some years ago.  If we do not use opportunities like this in our economy to bring rates like this back to a normal level we will be back to where we were before the many different crises that we are trying to get out of hit us.  That is rates of taxation that are too low, across too narrow a base to fund public services that people need.  It is for this reason that this budget contains measures to raise taxes because if we do not do that now the next difficulty we get into we will be doing again what we do every time there is a big difficulty in Ireland, namely, increase taxes.  Most other economies around the world decrease them when they get into difficulty.  That is the background to this change and why it is the right change.  We are simply going back to where we have been for most of our very recent past. </p>  <p>  On some of the points put to me, Deputy Mattie McGrath appears to think it is a bad thing that I did not flag this move in advance.  If I had flagged it in advance it would have been to the benefit of several people in our economy who would have made a very significant sum of money if I had let them know what we were going to do.  If I had done it I can only imagine what Deputy Mattie McGrath would be accusing me of doing the next day in the D&aacute;il. </p></speech>

Anybody who says they were not aware this was an option the Government was considering needs to read the papers we publish during the summer much more carefully in future.</p>  <p>  In response to the two different points put by Deputy Fitzmaurice, I think he agrees with much of the rationale for my doing this.  He has a significant disagreement about its impact on people in rural Ireland who are involved in land purchases or are looking to make land purchases in the future.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns raised by organisations and members of farming organisations and those involved in buying agricultural land.  Different Members raised those issues with me.  I acknowledge in particular the work of Deputy Deering in the aftermath of the budget in articulating issues of concern and working with me, as did the Ministers of State, Deputies D'Arcy and O'Donovan, and Deputy Heydon.  They helped me understand issues that were developing and how we could respond to matters while retaining the overall shape of what we were trying to do.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> That is why I made the decision to remove the age limit in the implementation of consanguinity relief.  I undertook considerable work on the matter.  Some people advised that I move the age from 68 to 69 years, I was even advised to bring it to 70 years but I decided the best course of action would be to remove it entirely and instead to provide an incentive for farm consolidation by subsetting that for a number of years time, and flagging that this clause and relief is available for a period of some years after which a new age limit will be put in.</p> <p> After we dealt with that another issue was raised regarding farm consolidation and the very same young farmers to whom the Deputy referred who may own many different pieces of land, or may want to acquire another piece of land, either to consolidate their farm holding or have a single farm holding with that farm holding to be located in a number of different places.  That issue was raised with me, particularly in the context of dairy farmers, which is why I made the next change by bringing in relief in relation to farm consolidation which I set at 1%.  I did so in order to bring it into line with what we are doing in relation to the management of consanguinity and abolishing the age limit in relation to it.</p> <p> If I accept these amendments, my challenge is that for the first time I will be separating different forms of non-residential commercial property and while the Deputy will raise an issue with me on non-residential commercial property in rural Ireland what will happen after that is that small business owners will make the point to me that if this relief applies to a small farmer why does it not apply to a small business.  If we go down that route, we begin to fragment a tax base which is essential for the type of change in the tax code to which I referred earlier which is important that we make.</p> <p> For those reasons I am not in a position to accept the Deputies' amendments.</p></speech>

If the Department of Finance was in tune it would have a separate thing for agricultural land.  The Minister says he cannot separate one from the other, but there is a scheme for farmers under 35 years.  Unfortunately, there is a situation where the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine says a young farmer is one under 40 years and the Department of Finance says it is 35 years.  I wonder which it is.</p>  <p>  I did not ask the Minister to lose money in any of this.  He could had taken the hint from what myself and Deputy Mattie McGrath did.  I tabled amendments that were twice ruled out of order, though I raised it here and I argued the toss, but I have to accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  I proposed a measure that would bring in perhaps twice as much money from the likes of these vultures by introducing a 50% tax, as people such as David Hall have called for, and those who are shafting people would have to pay the tax.</p>  <p>  Fair play to Deputy Deering, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and every other Deputy mentioned by the Minister for what they have done.  It is a pity they did not also tell the Minister about the small farmer who is trying to buy the 20 acres, about the small shopkeeper.  We have choices to make.  If someone opened a shop in rural Ireland, the council would be due rates immediately.  That is less money for the Exchequer to send down.  These are the things that will benefit rural Ireland and are needed.</p>  <p>  Young farmers who want to buy bits of land are walking away from it.  Look at the rates that were there, which were 9% rates, that is four times what the Minister said.  What is the result of this?  Most of our farmers are now over 55 years.  When the Government includes incentives, they will ensure that young farmers will come in, but what we are doing is removing the incentives and we will end up with farmers who will not bother about taking over the farm.  This is the consequence. </p></speech>

We spoke earlier about vulture funds.</p>  <p>  Different amendments were discussed this evening about the &euro;5.5 billion written off for our banking friends and the Minister did not want to listen to that either.  This is rural Ireland that we are talking about.</p>  <p>  I want to pick the Minister up on the idea that he did not tell anyone.  Someone told a leading farming organisation.  We did not have time to read the Minister's books during the summer before the budget but we will have plenty of time if he keeps going the way he is because we will have nothing to do in rural Ireland except watch the computer and we cannot do that because we cannot get broadband.  We will have to buy the papers or we will have to go into the towns to go onto the web.  The people of rural Ireland have nothing else to do.  This is a simple issue that will rejuvenate small villages and do the very things that the scheme rolled out in Edgeworthstown is supposed to do - the Four Roads to Glenamaddy - all that was missing that day was Big Tom.  This would help but this was not allowed.  We are not talking about all farmers, we are talking about small businesses and shopkeepers.  We said non-residential holdings; that does not mean all land.  It is shops for clothes and hardware, hairdressers and whatever else; they are all over the place.  If one drives anywhere, one will see them.  The Minister is missing the point.  The whole area of stamp duty is a dangerous one on which to put a budget.  We know where that got us before.  It got us into a huge lot of trouble.  It is not very set or fixed revenue.  Farmers cannot get an extra &euro;12,000 or &euro;15,000; the solicitors had not completed the transaction.  Will the Minister indicate if there will be any grace period for those caught in the transition, those who were in the process of buying somewhere but had not signed the contract?  I welcome the consanguinity rule and the situation regarding consolidation of holdings and the changes on age.  I am not a nay-sayer.  I want to make that point to Deputy Doherty because if his current leader gets his way we will not even be able to get a cup of tea in this bar.</p></speech>

I raised this during Committee Stage.  Experts are suggesting that it could be &euro;2 billion to &euro;2.5 billion of commercial property transactions in 2017.  The Minister's figures are estimated on a yield of transactions of about &euro;4.5 billion which is way off what analysts such as Jones Lang Laselle, experts in the field, have suggested.</p>  <p>  Second, there are no anti-avoidance measures built into this.  I asked a Parliamentary Question on the matter which was answered two days ago.  The Minister said he would deal with it during further stages of the Finance Bill.  We are at the last stage here and I do not see it.  We had Davys tell us after budget day that they expect tax avoidance measures to pop up again as a result of stamp duty because what happened in the past when stamp duty was at 9% was that assets were put into special purpose vehicles and thus availed of the 1% stamp duty rather than the 9%.  When stamp duty was reduced to 2% that incentive was not there because the differential was not that much but now that it has increased to 6% they are saying that it is likely there will be tax avoidance issues.  I can see no measure here that deals with that so that it is possible to structure assets into special purpose vehicles, sell them on and then sell the shares on with a liability to pay 1% rather than 6%.</p>  <p>  The other, bigger issue relates to the stability of this policy.  The commission has echoed what we said on budget night, namely that it is a very unstable type of tax and the Government is basing a lot of its budgetary arithmetic on increased resources that are made available to different expenditure heads on it.  The Minister needs to listen to what the commission said in its report over the last couple of days.</p></speech>

It is a complicated area that presents a number of challenges and I will seek to fully address the issue when the Finance Bill is in the Seanad.  I will deal with the matter then. </p></speech>

If I look at the continuation of the level of that yield into next year, I believe the yield I have forecast will be delivered.  That being said, there are two other factors to be noted about the figures.  The first is that the contribution property-related transaction taxes are making to the total figures for the budget next year are 3% of the total value of the revenue needed for 2018, which is significantly lower than that before the crash period.  The second is that, as important as the yield is to deliver the overall figures of the budget, there are other reasons for this measure, including shifting, in particular, human capital and workers into other forms of construction, especially the delivery of homes.  Reference was made to what the Commission said.  It also stated today that the overall figures in the budget and the macroeconomic approach are plausible in terms of delivering the deficit targets for next year.</p></speech>

for any such purpose, and the relevant provisions of Chapter 6 of Part 38 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 shall apply,<br /><br />(e) not be made until such time as construction operations have commenced pursuant to a commencement notice.</blockquote>(9) For the purposes of satisfying themselves that either the conditions for the making of a repayment under this section or the conditions for

pursuant to a claim made in accordance with subsection (8),<br /><br />(b) not carry interest, and<br /><br />(c) not be made after the expiry of 4 years following, in relation to the relevant residential development, the date of acknowledgement by a building control authority in accordance with article 10(2) or 20A(3)(b), as the case may be, of the Regulations of 1997 and this paragraph

Consolidation Act 1997 may be disclosed by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners to a building control authority for the purposes of enabling the building control authority to comply with a request made under paragraph (a).</blockquote>(18) This section shall not apply to construction operations comprising relevant residential development commenced, pursuant to a commencement notice, after 31 December 2021.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In tandem with my budget announcement of the increase from 2% to 6% in the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property, I announced that, in relation to land purchased for the development of housing, I intended to introduce a stamp duty refund scheme.  Not only will this ensure that the increased rate of stamp duty does not contribute to house price inflation, the design of the scheme will provide a stimulus to the timely delivery of badly needed new residential property.  This new section 83D in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for this refund scheme.</p><p>Because of the seriousness of our housing supply challenge, the refund scheme has a number of conditions that are designed to ensure that only those builders and developers who provide completed housing units within a reasonable period of time can qualify for a refund of the difference in the amount of stamp duty payable at the rates of 2% and 6%.  The refund scheme will apply to both one-off houses and to larger housing developments.  In the case of larger housing developments, there is a requirement for efficient use of a site in that a specified proportion of the site must be developed for housing.  It will be possible to develop a site for non-residential purposes as long as that does not compromise the required amount of residential development.</p><p>I am aware of the pressures being experienced by some developers in raising the necessary finance for housing development.  For that reason, I have made provision for the refund to be available at a relatively early stage in the development process but I first want to be sure that there is evidence of a real commitment by developers to providing the required level of housing within a reasonable period of time.  Before a refund can be claimed, developers must have submitted a commencement notice to a local authority as required by the planning regulations, the local authority must have acknowledged the commencement notice and then construction operations must be commenced within the period of 30 months immediately following the acquisition of the land.</p><p>Where a large development is being carried out in a number of phases, a refund can be claimed only in respect of a phase where construction of the houses in the particular phase has actually commenced.  To ensure the efficient use of sites for residential development, a certain proportion of a site will have to be developed for housing.  There are two alternative tests to be satisfied in this respect.  Either at least 75% of the area of a site must be occupied by housing or the gross floor space of the housing units constructed must account for at least 75% of the area of a site.  These alternative tests will ensure that both low-rise and multi-storey apartment buildings will be accommodated.  The appropriate test must be applied in relation to the part of a site being developed in each phase of a multiphase development.  In the case of one-off houses constructed on a site that exceeds one acre, the refund will only apply to the stamp duty attributable to an acre.</p><p>Following the commencement of construction and the making of a refund, a further condition must be satisfied.  This is that the development, or a phase of a development, must be completed within two years of being commenced.  The test for completion relates to the certificate of compliance that must be submitted to a local authority when development is completed.  When development is not completed within the two-year timeframe, or where the relevant 75% &quot;substance&quot; test is not satisfied, a developer will have to repay the refunded stamp duty to Revenue together with interest calculated from the date on which the refund was made.</p><p>A further measure designed to ensure the earliest possible delivery of housing is that the refund scheme will be time-bound.  To be eligible for a refund, construction must commence on a one-off house, on a housing development or on a phase of a housing development before the end of 2021 and be completed within two years of commencement.  That means that the latest date for the completion of development will be the end of 2023.</p><p>The refund scheme will be administered by Revenue on a self-assessment basis.  However, as happens with the administration of the general tax assessment and collection system, Revenue will carry out compliance checks to ensure that refunds have been correctly claimed and that any follow-up conditions for the relief have been satisfied.  Standard interest and penalty provisions are being applied in the case of incorrectly claimed refunds and false declarations.</p></speech>

While I support the substance of it I reiterate the point that was made earlier by a number of Deputies about adequate briefing material being provided in advance to enable us to properly assess amendments.  It is a point that is well made.  I ask that in future it would be accommodated.</p>  <p>  This is a very detailed amendment and I have gone through it as best I can with the cross-referencing back to the Principal Act.  I support the fact that the Minister is facilitating a refund where land is being developed for residential purposes.  That is an issue I raised directly with the Minister.  Will the Minister give the House some information on how he arrived at the timeframe in terms of the requirement that construction would commence within a period of 30 months?  Some might argue that is tight, perhaps it is not, but will he give us a sense of how he arrived at the timeframe?</p>  <p>  The amendment also provides for an apportionment of the reclaim in areas where only some of the land will be developed for residential purposes.  Will the Minister clarify the role of land within a residential development that is open space provided for recreational facilities?  Is that regarded as residential development?  If it is not then the way the provision is structured would discourage the provision of open space and recreational facilities as part of residential developments.  That is an important issue.</p><p> With regard to the issue of the clawback provision set out within the amendment, the amendment provides for a scenario where residential development specified in a commencement notice is not completed within a period of two years after the date of the sending by a building control authority of an acknowledgement in respect of that notice.  Major developments can take longer than two years to complete.  Small and medium-sized builders secure much of the funding available to complete the work all at once.  Will the Minister address the point about the clawback and the two-year provision?  Under the clawback provision, less than 75% of the total surface area of the land in question must be occupied by dwelling units.  Alternatively, the gross floor space of dwelling units must amount to at least 75% of the total surface area of that land.  There needs to be clarity on whether open spaces required by the planning permission are included or excluded from the 25% calculation.  Will gardens be included or excluded?</p> <p> On the reclaim of 4%, that is, the differential between the two points.  It is made clear in the amendment that it can be made through the Revenue online service as soon as construction operations have commenced.  However, there is no indication of when the refund will actually be made.  If this is not set out in the legislation, then at least there should be a requirement, provided everything is in order and all of the appropriate documentation has been provided to the satisfaction of the Revenue, that there would be a refund within a defined period of 30 months.</p></speech>

I am inclined to oppose it.</p>  <p>  Yet again, the amendment seems to be providing some sort of tax incentive for private developers.  I could be wrong because I have not had a chance to study it, but I am concerned that this is the case.  To my mind, we do not need to organise more giveaways for private developers.  Will the Minister explain fully what it is?  At this late stage I am somewhat suspicious of it.</p></speech>

It is welcome that there is an incentive and that stamp duty can be drawn back.  It may be a good idea.  It is a pity this arrangement was not made for other things.</p>  <p>  The amendment recognises the problem with the housing crisis in different parts of the country.  The measure is welcome.  What happens when the payments are being brought back?  These people are probably investing large amounts of money.  The Revenue should ensure that the payments are prompt or fast and are not held up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300067#SSS00400"><p>I take the Deputies' points regarding the need for briefing on an amendment of this scale.  It is something that I will take account of in future.  I introduced the amendment on Report Stage because when I was working through the implementation of the change in non-residential commercial property and considering the consequences, it became apparent that there was potential to feed in to an increase in prices for non-residential commercial property that was being sold and that might be used for residential development in future.</p>  <p>  I wish to address the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made.  This is not about providing additional relief.  We should see this measure in the context of the debate on non-residential property.</p>  <p>  Perhaps you will give me a little more than the two minutes allowed, a Cheann Comhairle, so that I can answer all the questions put to me.  If I miss any of them, I will respond further, given the scale of the amendment.</p>  <p>  I will address the point about whether this is tax relief.  As I have said, we should see this move in the context of going from 2% to 6%.  The change from 2% to 6% amounts to a revenue gain for the Exchequer.  As I outlined earlier, the amount is between &euro;370 million and &euro;380 million.  This represents additional taxation for the development sector that we do not have in our base.  I am keen to ensure that if land is to be acquired for homes and that land is currently classed as non-residential commercial property, then the higher rate does not lead through to the price of the homes going up at the other end or that the rate would not be used as a reason to push up the price of the land.</p>  <p>  I am proposing to rebate four points of the six points, or 6%, to anyone who has a credible plan to provide more residential development.  Let us suppose someone acquires land.  The purchaser would have paid stamp duty of 2% on it.  The rate now moves up to 6%.  Indeed, it has been at 6% since the financial resolutions were passed.  Upon enactment of the Bill, the purchaser will then get four points back.  The rate will go back to 2% as it was before budget night.</p>  <p>  This is not only about ensuring that it does not have inadvertent but likely consequences, such as pushing up the price of homes when they are built, but also serves to provide another incentive or reason to use land that has been acquired to supply residential development as opposed to other forms of development.  That is the broad approach.</p>  <p>  A specific question was put to me by Deputy McGrath on the timeframe.  I engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the question.  The advice that Department gave me was that the 30-month period and, to address an additional question put to me by Deputy McGrath, the two-year period were reasonable timeframes to allow the planning process to start and end as well as to allow for the overwhelming majority, if not all, of residential development to be delivered.  That was the assessment on the basis of my engagement with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath asked about green space.  Deputy McGrath drew attention to the 75% and 25% proportions.  These proportions are in place because I am keen to ensure that if land is bought and stamp duty is paid at 6%, then we do not end up in a position whereby a purchaser can buy 100 acres only to build two homes.  Then, that person could come back and claim to have delivered residential development.  That person could argue that since he had delivered residential development, he can take the 2% rate.  We put in place criteria specifying 75% use of land.  Alternatively, let us suppose someone buys land but decides to use that land to deliver high-density development, for the sake of argument, a large apartment block.  We have provided that 75% of that development has to be used for residential property.</p>  <p>  We are looking to deal with any avoidance measure in respect of the delivery of a small number of houses using the 75% criterion of the area of land.  Furthermore, to ensure that high-density development is not impeded, we have set down the 75% proportion for the footprint of the building.</p>  <p>  This leads to Deputy McGrath's question on green space and where it sits.  Green space would then sit in the 25% proportion, unless it is green space that forms part of a garden.  Again, I will explain the advice that I have received.  Let us suppose some land is acquired and the owner develops a normal housing development.  A measurement of the houses and a reasonable expectation regarding the gardens and the curtilage around the properties would get to the 75% proportion that is expected.  We expect that requirement would be met easily.  That would then deliver the 4% rebate.  The green space would be in the other 25%.</p><p> Either Deputy Michael McGrath or Fitzmaurice asked about the timing of repayments.  I expect that the Revenue Commissioners will repay the money as quickly as possible and I will ask them to do so because we want this to be another incentive for delivering residential development.  Within reason, garden space is taken into account when defining a residential unit.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  Research into legacy giving in Ireland in 2016 indicates that legacy income accounted for 11% of fundraised income over the period from 2012 until 2014.  In January 2017, the Institute of Fundraising reported that legacies in England and Wales account for one quarter of the total amount given to charities each year and exceed &pound;2.24 billion per annum.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing changes to the capital acquisitions tax code to incentivise the giving of donations to charities as part of legacies.  This is the key request.</p><p>The second element relates to donations to charities through the donation of shares, a practice that is extremely limited at present.  The overall thrust of the amendment is to support, through the tax system, the gifting or donation of assets, shares and so forth, through the inheritance tax system, to charities that are fully registered and regulated. </p></speech>

Generous conditions are applied to ensure charities can survive.  The report requested in the amendment should be done for the two reasons set out by Deputy Michael McGrath.  In addition, we must ensure we deliver on this issue for the simple reason that it would be of assistance.  A large number of legacies go unaccounted for and the State grabs nearly everything.  If people had an incentive to leave legacies to charitable organisations, some would be willing to do so, which would help struggling charities to survive.</p></speech>

Capital acquisitions tax is a tax on the beneficiary of a gift or an inheritance.  Section 76 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that a gift or an inheritance which is taken for public or charitable purposes is exempt from both gift tax and inheritance tax and is not taken into account when computing tax to the extent that Revenue is satisfied that it has been, or will be, applied for purposes which in accordance with the laws of the State are public or charitable.  As there is already provision for the transfer of gifts and inheritances of assets, including shares, for public and charitable purposes free from capital acquisitions tax, I do not see a need to consider any further options to incentivise such donations.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy require further clarification on this matter, I will be pleased to engage with him on it.  I would also be happy to meet groups which may have ideas in this area.  I ask the Deputy to accept my view on the amendment and consider withdrawing it.</p></speech>

Certain groups have made specific proposals to improve legislation in this area, notwithstanding the existing tax code and the provisions the Minister set out.  I will engage with the Minister and his officials on the matter and withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

It calls on the Minister to produce, within six months, of the passing of the Bill, a report on the implications of bogus self-employment, namely, the misclassification of PAYE workers as self-employed.  This is an important issue for workers and their rights, particular in the construction sector.</p><p>I put forward this amendment as a tribute to a friend, colleague and comrade who tragically lost his life on the weekend before last.  His name was Billy McClurg and he was a bricklayer and trade union activist.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>He was somebody who acquainted me with the plight of building workers and bricklayers who were fighting for the right to have decent conditions of employment and pay on building sites in the construction sector.  His loss is, obviously, first and foremost, a loss for his partner, June, his children, Emma, John and Rachel, and his many grandchildren and family and friends.  They will feel the loss of him, as a father and a family man, acutely, and even more so because of the particular conditions of his death were tragic in that he took his own life - something his family were happy that I would say publicly because they, like many other people, feel that the issue of suicide needs to be highlighted so that we confront it and let people know out there who have suicidal ideation that it is okay to speak out about these matters and that we should have a society which supports and helps those who face that dilemma.</p> <p> I knew Billy as an activist.  He taught me about the continuing dilemma of thousands of building workers who want to fight - this is the irony of many of the issues we have discussed over the course of this Bill - for the right to pay tax.  Is that not amazing?  We have spent all of ten or 11 hours discussing how some, such as big corporations, property speculators, banks and the very wealthy, do everything in their power not to pay tax but there are thousands of workers out there in precarious situations, skilled workers in the case of the late Billy McClurg, trained, qualified and passionate about what they do.</p> <p> Billy, in particular, was a precision bricklayer.  In and out of work, he was concerned that things were done perfectly, whether it was his garden, the state of the roads and the streets in his area, or on the building sites that he worked, that the work was done properly to the highest standard.  He spent much of his working life fighting for the right to pay tax and to be employed properly with proper pay and conditions.</p> <p> He and his many of his comrades - I stood with them at many building sites around this city - were forced to protest and to take strike action because they were denied the right by building contractors to be directly employed.  Those contractors wanted to misclassify them as being self-employed so that they would not have to pay for their employees' benefits such as PRSI, sick pay, holiday pay, pension entitlements and bank holidays and would be able to dismiss them, to hire them and fire them, whenever they wanted - something that still tens of thousands of workers are affected by.  These were workers who wanted to pay tax and they wanted to ensure that the best quality standards of work were done on building sites.</p> <p> Thirteen years ago, I stood outside a picket in Ballybrack on a public contract site where we were protesting.  Billy and two of his colleagues ended up in prison for that protest because they defied an injunction telling them to stop picketing.  I remember Billy pointing at the subcontractors who were inside who were supposedly self-employed and saying, "Those guys are not qualified bricklayers.  These houses will fall apart in a few years".  They were council houses which were being built to replace council houses that previously had fallen apart because they had also been built by cowboy builders.  Ironically, 13 years on, just as Billy predicted, because the building standards were not applied and, almost certainly, the bricklayers who were working on that site were not qualified bricklayers, those houses are falling apart and will have to be paid for to be remediated with public money.  Here was somebody who fought all his life and went to jail because he wanted the right to pay tax and he wanted the work done properly on building sites.</p> <p> What he was fighting for is still relevant today.  Up to 60,000 construction workers working on building sites are being falsely classified by employers as being self-employed when they very obviously are not and, consequently, they are losing as workers, in terms of pay and conditions.  We will only find out in years to come that in many cases the quality of the work from the Celtic tiger era may be substandard, but also the public purse is losing out because if they are not PAYE workers, we do not get the tax revenue in.</p></speech>

This consultation invited submissions from interested parties on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under arrangements of this nature.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the Minister has now received the report informed by this consultation and which was prepared by a working group of officials.  The report is intended to broaden and deepen the understanding of the impacts for Exchequer revenue of what is often termed "disguised employment".  It will inform the debate on any potential measures to address these impacts.  Obviously, I will need to consult with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, but I would intend bringing the report to Cabinet very shortly and publishing it as soon as practicable.</p>  <p>  As the report examines the issues identified by the Deputies, I do not see the need for this amendment.</p></speech>

Billy fought for most of working life on this but so have many thousands of building workers.  Indeed, I have cited to the Minister recent examples of where this sort of practice continues to go on.</p>  <p>  Let me cite a few facts.  Billy and his colleagues would always say, "It is not just that we lose out, but that the public is losing out," because if they were paying tax there would be more money available for housing, health, etc., and it is a fact.  I asked the Minister about this, and there was a table he promised me on the figures relating to the tax that comes back from relevant contracts tax, RCT, as against PAYE in the construction sector, and two weeks after I asked the question I have not got the table, but I got some figures myself.  In 2016, &euro;255 million came back in tax revenue from RCT, the supposedly self-employed sector, but over &euro;200 million of that was given back in offsets and refunds, and only a net amount of &euro;49 million came in to the Exchequer.  That covers I do not know how many workers because the Minister did not give me the figures.  I would say it covers approximately 60,000 workers and all we get back is &euro;49 million in tax whereas in the same year the Exchequer got back &euro;536 million from approximately the same number of directly-employed workers in construction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.609" nospeaker="true" time="21:10:00" ><p>That is what Billy and his colleagues always fought to be and what construction workers today are fighting to be, namely, directly employed PAYE workers.  That is a loss to society as well as to the workers who are having to fight for proper conditions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="21:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300070#VVV00200"><p>That table was to be given to the Deputy and I apologise for the fact that it was not.  We will get it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The joint investigation unit undertakes highly visible site visits and inspections on construction sites.  The work involves the examination of contractors and employees on such sites.  A key objective is to ensure that all visits are properly planned, executed and reported upon.  There were 2,126 construction site visits last year.  Visits are generally unannounced but efforts are made to ensure that disruption to construction activity is minimal.  They serve to support compliance by affording Revenue and other agencies an opportunity to engage with contractors, subcontractors and employees present on a site to ensure that they are aware of their obligations and to detect, disrupt and deter non-compliance.  This is achieved by interviewing those persons present on a site.  A total of 11,699 interviews were conducted last year.  In 2016 special emphasis was placed on challenging the inappropriate classification of workers as self-employed contractors.  Principal contractors engaging a large number of individual subcontractors and with several layers of subcontracting below them were selected for examination.  This activity resulted in 848 individuals being registered as PAYE employees and in the reclassification of 345 subcontractors as employees.</p></speech>

During the Celtic tiger period, they just were not happening at all and many workers lost out very bitterly as a result of that.  Those who stood up for themselves, who fought and protested were often derided, blacklisted and denied the right to work.  I am glad that there has been a bit of an improvement but it is still rife, if not rampant.</p>  <p>  While there are building contractors who play straight up and do things as they should be done, there are also many cowboys out there who are abusing workers and almost certainly doing shoddy work because they do not want to pay building workers properly.  They think, because of the transient nature of construction work, they can get away with it.  It is being done on a wide scale and the very tiny amounts of tax revenue that are coming back from the RCT sector in construction as against ten times that amount in the PAYE sector for the same amount of workers is a clear indication of the abuse that is going on.  We need far more enforcement in this area.  Any big contractor who is found guilty of abusing workers' rights and the tax code in this way should never again be awarded public contracts.  This has to be wiped out so that people like Billy and his colleagues in the construction industry, who have had to fight week in and week out against this kind of abuse by cowboy contractors, will no longer have to do that and can just get on with their jobs.</p></speech>

The Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Republic of Kazakhstan) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 479 of 2017).&rdquo;,</blockquote>and<br /><br />(b) in Part 3 by inserting the following after paragraph 8AB:<blockquote>&ldquo;8AC. The Exchange of Information Relating to Tax Matters (Macao Special Administrative Region of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 480 of 2017).&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Both agreements referred to above have already been considered and approved by the D&aacute;il Select-Sub Committee on Finance as part of the ratification process and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The amendment proposed makes changes to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 24A to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The amendments to Part 1 give effect to a new double taxation agreement with the Republic of Kazakhstan.  All such international agreements entered into by Ireland must be listed in Part 1 of Schedule 24A.  The amendments to Part 3 give effect to new tax information exchange agreements which the State has entered into with Macao.  All such agreements entered into by Ireland must be listed in Part 3 of Schedule 24A.</p><p>Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter cross-border activity.</p> <p> Tax information exchange agreements between Ireland and other jurisdictions allow the Revenue Commissioners to request information that is relevant to an Irish tax investigation directly from other authorities.</p> <p> The addition of these agreements to Schedule 24A is the final step in the legislative and ratification procedure that will ensure that they will have the force of law.  It is essential that these amendments be made in the Finance Bill, as doing so completes the Irish ratification process for these agreements, thereby fulfilling Ireland's commitment to complete ratification as soon as possible.  The agreements will come into force once both parties have completed their ratification processes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300073#YYY00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the implementation of the social protection measures contained in budget 2018.  It includes the provisions required to enable a &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all weekly social welfare payments.  It provides for a &euro;2 increase for each qualified dependent child, the first such increase since 2010.  It provides for a suite of measures which are targeted at ensuring that we make sure that work pays.  It provides for the extension of entitlement to maternity leave and maternity benefit in cases of premature births.</p>  <p>  The Bill is grounded In the values and principles which underpinned budget 2018.  The budget reflects a commitment to supporting individuals and families who may rely to a greater or lesser extent on the State for their income needs; a commitment to making work pay and to supporting people into employment; and a commitment to enabling and facilitating the development of a sustainable and resilient economy in the interest of all of our citizens.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Bill reinforces our commitment to building a fairer and more inclusive society, with a dual focus on incentivising and rewarding work on the one hand and, on the other, enhancing welfare supports for those who have attained pension age, who are carers or who, by virtue of illness, disability or unemployment, are not in a position to provide for themselves.  I would like to briefly outline the provisions of the Bill.</p>  <p>  Sections 1 and 2 are standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill, its construction, citation, commencement provisions and definitions of terms used in the Bill.   Section 3 provides for an amendment to the definition of the term &ldquo;share-based remuneration&rdquo; to cater for the introduction of a new tax relief being introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  This tax relief is the key employee engagement programme for qualifying share options granted to employees of small to medium enterprises and is being provided for in the Finance Bill.  The amendment in the Social Welfare Bill simply provides that any gains realised on the exercise of a share option by workers via the key employee engagement programme will not be subject to PRSI.</p>  <p>  Sections 4, 5, and 6 provide for an increase of &euro;5 per week in the rates of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit respectively, with effect from 26 March 2018.  Section 7 provides for the proportionate increases in the rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than a prescribed amount.   Section 11, which I will come to shortly, provides for the increase in the maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  Section 8, together with Schedule 1, provides for the re-designatIon of the family income supplement as the working family payment.  The decision to do this follows a review by my Department of the effectiveness of the range of in-work supports we provide.  The title of "working family payment" will explicitly reflect the nature of the payment and will facilitate further take-up of this payment which is aimed specifically at working families.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s approach, my approach and that of my predecessor to the working family payment is guided by two principles: first, that we have to ensure that work pays and it is worthwhile for people to go out to work; and, second, that it should have a positive impact on reducing child poverty in the country, which is still far too high.  That is of particular importance to me.  It is not as simple as changing the name from family income supplement, FIS, to working family payment.  Under section 8, I am proposing to put FIS under the umbrella of working family payments and I plan to bring forward a number of progressive supports for working families with a view to assisting those who are transitioning from unemployment into employment, and in some cases from under-employment into full employment.</p> <p> Section 9 provides for an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly earnings thresholds for the working family payment for recipients who have up to three children, with effect from 29 March 2018.  Section 10 provides for another positive measure to support the transition from unemployment into employment by enabling the continuation of the back-to-work family dividend.  The existing legislation had the effect of closing the scheme to new claimants from the end of March 2018 and the closure of the scheme in its entirety from 2021.  We will stop that.  Section 11, together with Schedule 2, provides for new rates for the full range of social insurance benefits.  All maximum weekly insurance-based pensions and benefits are being increased by &euro;5, with effect from the week commencing 26 March 2018, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments.  This section also provides for proportionate increases in respect of qualified adults, together with the increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child payment.  Section 12 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payments from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week.  This measure comes into effect from 29 March 2018.</p> <p> Section 13, together with Schedule 3, mirrors the provisions of section 11 with the increase in the rates payable to social assistance claimants, which will come into effect in the week commencing 26 March 2018.  This section specifically also provides that jobseekers aged under 26 on a reduced rate payment will receive the full &euro;5 increase per week.  Sections 14 and 15 provide for extended periods of entitlement to maternity benefit and maternity leave, respectively, in cases of premature births on or after 1 October 2017.  The extended period of entitlement will be equivalent to the duration between the actual date of birth of the premature baby and two weeks before the expected date of birth, which is the point at which the current entitlement to 26 weeks leave and benefit would normally begin.  By way of illustration, where a baby is born in the 30th week of gestation, the child&rsquo;s mother will have an additional entitlement of approximately seven weeks of maternity leave and benefit.  This is equivalent to the period from the actual date of birth in the 30th week to the date two weeks before the expected date of birth.  This additional period will be added to the mother&rsquo;s normal entitlement to 26 weeks of maternity leave and benefit.</p> <p> Section 14 introduces the necessary changes to the Social Welfare Acts to provide for the additional maternity benefit, whereas section 15 introduces the parallel provisions to the Maternity Protection Act 1994 with respect to maternity leave.  Section 16 provides for an amendment to the National Training Fund Act 2000 to provide for a 0.1% increase, from 0.7% to 0.8%, in the national training fund levy payable by employers in respect of reckonable earnings of employees in class A and class H employments from 1 January 2018.</p> <p> The House will be aware that the budget also provided for a number of other measures that do not require changes to the primary legislation.  I signed the regulations earlier this week that allow for the payment of the Christmas bonus payment to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments.  Other non-statutory measures in the budget included the extension of the free fuel allowance by one week and the introduction of the new telephone support allowance.  This week, I also signed a commencement order relating to a measure in last year&rsquo;s</p> <p>budget extending the invalidity pension scheme to self-employed workers for the first time.  This includes small business owners, farmers, tradespeople, freelancers, contractors and professionals.</p> <p> The Bill before us today will serve to improve the living standards of all those who have recourse to the social protection system.  It is the second budget in a row in which it has been possible to provide for an increase of &euro;5 per week in social welfare rates, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment that the benefits of the continuing economic recovery should be shared by all of our citizens.  The additional resources being applied to the qualified child payment, the first such increase to be introduced for seven years, reflects our commitment to supporting families.  The Bill also ensures that the social protection system offers real incentives to take up employment opportunities, recognising that working families are the backbone of Irish society.  I hope and trust the Bill will be supported by all sides of the House.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

These are budgets where the main burden is shouldered by those who can least afford it.  The configuration of this D&aacute;il changed at the last general election and the Government has been dependent on us for support.  We expected certain commitments arising from that support, and as a direct result, the past two budgets have been judged to be progressive, which I welcome.  However, in welcoming the improvements both in the last Social Welfare Act and this current Bill, one must say we have a long way to go even to get back to where we were before 2010 if we consider the overall landscape.</p>  <p>  For example, this Social Welfare Bill and the budget on which it is based did not address the question of the pension anomaly introduced as a result of changes in 2012.  We had some discussion about this at the social welfare committee this morning and the Minister informed us that a report will be available shortly on this matter.  Will she confirm that?  The report will be referred to a Cabinet sub-committee, which will formulate a number of options for the Cabinet.  As I understand it, this procedure is being undertaken because there is currently no money in the social welfare budget to effect changes.  There is a design to get money from across Departments, I assume, in order to effect some changes in the area in 2018.  There is no question of waiting until 2021, as that is completely out of the question.  My understanding is that the Government could find the money from next year's budget but the sub-committee is being established in order to come up with the money before next year's budget, if possible.  That is our policy objective and we will keep speaking with the Minister about it.  The budget did not provide any top-up payment for people who cannot work due to illness or disability, and I will come back to that presently.  The budget did not increase direct provision payments, which is a pity, as a small amount in this area would go a long way.</p>  <p>  I am intrigued by the position with the working family payment.  We were all given to understand this was the Government's big idea.  We were told much research, study, analysis and reports were being done on it; the working family payment would be the panacea that would practically remove poverty traps once and for all, ensuring it paid people to work rather than staying on social welfare.  We asked on a number of occasions if the family income supplement, which is designed to do something similar - imperfect as it may be - would be continued and we were told no decision had been made.  However, two weeks ago during Question Time the Minister told me the family income supplement would be retained but as part of the overall working family payment.  Strictly speaking, that is not correct.  What we have is simply a renaming of the family income supplement as the working family payment.</p>  <p>  I note that in the Fine Gael election manifesto there was some discussion on the family income supplement and the view was taken that it was not fit for purpose.  Although it had many good features, it did not necessarily achieve what the Government wanted.  We are now in a position where we are simply retaining it under another name, albeit with a few increases for different categories where there are one, two or three children.  Strangely, whoever wrote that section of the Fine Gael election manifesto was partly right as there are difficulties with the family income supplement because it creates poverty traps that are easy enough to enumerate.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>They would be easy enough to get rid of too if the will was there.  I, therefore, want the Minister, in her reply to refer to the changes the Government envisages in the future in the family income supplement to remove those obvious poverty traps.</p> <p> We will have to concentrate on the living alone allowance in future budgets.  It is not true to say that it costs two people twice as much to live as one person.  All Members know what happens when there are two old age pensioners in a house.  They get used to a certain standard of living that is not exorbitant by any means, but when one of them dies, the household income immediately drops by 50%.  It falls off a cliff and the few paltry euros in the living alone allowance are not nearly sufficient to make up the difference.  I know many pensioners, as I am sure the Minister does, who have fallen into poverty as a direct result of that situation.  If the objective of the social welfare system is to combat poverty, a focus on the living alone allowance would be a good way to do it.</p> <p> At a time when there is a lot of fuel poverty in the country and the cost of fuel has been increasing steadily, the fuel allowance is being increased by a grand total of &euro;22.50 for the year.  That &euro;22.50 is one week's extra allowance for the year.</p> <p> The bereavement grant has not been restored.  I have come across problems in practice, as I am sure others have too.  When someone cannot afford the cost of a funeral, they have to access the community welfare officer, who is now an employee of the Department of Social Protection.  We in the mid-west find that the budget to help those people seems to exhaust itself after approximately three or four months.  All those who are unlucky enough to have a bereavement in the latter part of the year can depend on is a pittance, if anything at all.  </p> <p> I note also that the pension increases which came into effect from around the 7th and various social welfare increases which came into effect from early March last year are now deferred, most to the very end of March.  That is a very retrograde step.  That is the danger when the date is moved.  The practice used to be to have social welfare increases from 1 January and I hope that system can be reverted to.</p> <p> I welcome the provision of invalidity pensions for the first time for the self-employed but several things remain to be done.  The question of jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed needs to be addressed.  The Minister suggested some time ago to a committee of which I am a member that this should come, like invalidity pensions for the self-employed, out of general taxation.  However, several reports and studies indicate that the self-employed would be delighted to fund that measure.  If they wish to fund it, they should be given the opportunity to do so.  As regards self-employed people who fall out of work due to illness, not all of them will be out of work for life and the question of short-term illness benefit for the self-employed will have to be attended to in the not too distant future.</p> <p> The general statistics on poverty are still quite striking.  The Minister may say that the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, figures are not up to date and none are available for the past couple of years when the economy has been growing.  However, the worrying thing about the poverty statistics is that the economy began to grow again towards the end of 2013 and continued to grow during 2014 and 2015.  However, the impact of that economic growth on the poverty statistics was very marginal.  For example, consistent poverty dropped from 8.8% to 8.7% between 2014 and 2015.  The deprivation rate in 2015 was 25% and the at-risk poverty rate was 16.9% compared to 17.2% in 2014, which is a very marginal reduction.  The figures for those classified as children are even more striking.  The Government has a target of lifting 102,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020 but at the current rate of progress, it does not have a hope of achieving that.  We must not forget the 3,000 children who will be sleeping in emergency accommodation tonight.  It is no exaggeration to say that they and their families have been failed by the State.</p> <p> We cannot ignore the findings of a recently-published independent report about the impact of changes made to the one-parent family scheme by one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Joan Burton.  The report states that the balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of lone parents being at risk of poverty as a direct result of those changes.  That echoes the findings of the Crosse Miller report.  There have been a number of improvements for lone parents in this budget and the previous one, but it all seems to be an attempt to mitigate the consequences of what happened under Deputy Burton's regime and the changes she made.  Surely it would be simpler to reverse the change until we have what Deputy Burton described as a Scandinavian-type child care system or something approximating to it.  I say that because the all-party committee on social protection did a lot of work on this issue and issued a very detailed report that called for a more flexible and responsive system and got rid of many anomalies such as whether a person was entitled to something depending on what sort of tenure he or she held in his or her house.  That report was all but ignored.  The figures for poverty among lone parents are particularly stark.  For example, the most recent figure for lone parents in consistent poverty is 26.2% or more than one in four.  Some 32.2% were at risk of poverty and a staggering 57.9% experienced deprivation.</p> <p> I referred previously to the question of people on disability allowance.  People such as Senator John Dolan and his organisation have campaigned long and hard for a top-up payment for those on disability allowance.  That is against a background of statistics that show that consistent poverty among the disabled rose starkly from 14.4% to 22.4 % between 2014 and 2015.  The at-risk rate rose from 25.2% to 38.4% over the same period and the deprivation rate reached a staggering 53.2%, up from 51.3%.  The argument will be made that the disabled is not a homogenous group and there are different categories of disabled people, all of whom have different needs, etc., and, therefore, rather than having one solution for everybody, we should target the individual provisions that exist to help the disabled.  However, provision for the disabled has fallen by approximately 10% over the past five years and, therefore, that argument does not hold up.  I do not know anybody who is disabled and is too ill or incapacitated to work who would not welcome or benefit from a top-up payment.  That needs to be looked at carefully.</p> <p> As regards pensions, I urge the Minister to get on with the auto-enrolment system.  Pension coverage in the private sector is down to just over 40%.  There is a two-tier pension system.  The public sector has a funded, gold-plated defined benefit pension scheme, and good luck to it.  However, the coverage rate for those employed in the private sector is down to 42% according to the figures I have.  As the Minister is aware, auto-enrolment has been operating in the United Kingdom since 2012 and has resulted in a significant increase in coverage among private sector workers.  We have been talking about this for ten years.  The Taoiseach recently said it will take several years to introduce it.  It is extremely urgent that we get on with it.  It was adverted to in a report issued by the Department of Social Protection eight years ago, in 2009 or 2010.</p><p>It is extremely urgent we get on with that.  We will not be opposing the Social Welfare Bill 2017 on Second Stage but we will submit amendments on Committee Stage, some of which will cost the Exchequer nothing, some of which will cost a very small amount but will bring about very significant improvements for the people at whom they are directed.  We will discuss all that next week, hopefully, if we are still around, on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-11-23a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="22:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017112300076#BBBB00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The main purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to the budget day announcements which primarily see increases of &euro;5 across a range of social welfare payments and the extension of maternity benefit and leave for premature births.</p>  <p>  As I said last year, in a society where we try to treat people equally I find it somewhat unfair and unacceptable that those working people who will benefit as a result of changes in taxation will see their benefit accrue from 1 January, but those dependent on social welfare must wait another three months.  That has not been the case traditionally and it is noticeable that this period is extending.  Every effort should be made in future budgets to align those two, not just from the point of view of the payments but that where there are benefits people are treated equally. </p>  <p>  Shortly before the budget the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and asked the committee if there was anything it would recommend.  We emphasised two issues: lone parents and the contributory State pension.  I acknowledge some changes that are aimed at lone parents.  Deputy O'Dea referred to the challenges facing those, particularly children, in lone parent households: 26.2% of lone parent households were in consistent poverty in 2015; 36.2% are at risk of poverty and 57.9% of them experience deprivation.  I acknowledge some progress has been made in that regard in this budget but the Department commissioned reports on it and the committee investigated this area and there are huge challenges.  The risk of poverty and deprivation in that group of people is very significant and further work needs to be done.  </p>  <p>  The second issue is the State contributory pension, and I was disappointed on budget day not to hear any mention of the anomaly arising from the 2012 changes.  The Minister's appearance before the committee today was very helpful.  She clarified the situation.  For the first time many realised that the cohort of people directly affected by the 2012 changes will be addressed as a stand alone issue, separate from the future total contributions system.  I look forward to the Minister's report to the Cabinet sub-committee and advancing that.  It is important that those people who were disproportionately affected in 2014 are dealt with fairly.  The Minister has acknowledged this because for too long it had been indicated that the only solution for them was as a result of a change to a brand new pension system.  Dealing with these people as a group that has been adversely affected is important.  </p>  <p>  I have a slight concern about mortgage interest supplement despite raising this with the Minister at the committee meeting this morning.  It is not mentioned in the budget or the Bill.  The Minister answered me but it was very specifically due to expire at the end of this year and there have been no new entrants for several years.  The Minister said there will be solutions.  She needs to bear in mind the people in receipt of this.  I ask her to make a commitment that they will continue to receive that payment and that whatever administrative changes the Minister or Department need to make will be seamless for those people.  The last thing we need is for somebody in receipt of this payment to be at risk of losing their own home as a result.  It is a relatively small sum of money, approximately &euro;4 million was spent this year, and it is a declining number of people but they have not found solutions to their housing problem.  It is a real issue and the concern is that the Minister's predecessor had indicated that this was due to expire and I would like a clear comment on how it will be dealt with. </p></speech>

A motion passed only a few weeks ago in this House calling for the total reversal of the 2012 changes gave these people hope that these changes would be forthcoming.  I put these points to the Minister at the committee meeting this morning.  How much longer do these people have to wait?  There have been mixed messages from the Government on this, from the Minister and the Taoiseach.  When will these older people receive the State pension they deserve?  When it comes to righting wrongs money is an easy excuse.  It is always peddled but it certainly does not wash with people when billions of euro can be found to bail out the banks and millions can be wasted in setting up Irish Water and bringing in water charges until the Government is forced into a U-turn which wastes millions of euro in taxpayers' money.  The Government can spend &euro;5 million on a public relations spin operation yet we cannot get a straight message about the changes to and reversal of the 2012 pension cuts.  The Minister cannot suggest that money is not available to right this wrong which has affected over 42,000 people.</p>  <p>  Where is Fianna F&aacute;il in all of this?  Why did it not push for this issue to be included in this Bill?  It should be in it.  Last year when I brought a motion to the House, Fianna F&aacute;il unfortunately opposed it by abstaining.  Now, after intensive lobbying by older people it has introduced a motion.  It had an ideal opportunity to right the wrongs and get it included in the Social Welfare Bill and get the changes reversed but it did not take it.  </p>  <p>  Most of this Bill has to be welcomed, the increases in social welfare payments, the continuation of the back to work dividend, which was due to close to new entrants from next March and the extension of maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies among others.  Questions have to asked, however, about other elements of the Bill.  The renaming of the family income supplement as the working family payment beggars belief.  The working family payment that was a cornerstone of Fine Gael's general election campaign last year turns out to be little more than a name change.  The Department can promote work all it wants but if affordable child care is not available lone parents cannot return to work.  If zero hour contracts, low pay and precarious working times and conditions are the only option for lone parents they are better off on social welfare.  That is not good.  It is not promoting welfare over work but it is the stark reality.  Until a mandatory living wage is introduced, family income supplement, or the working family payment as it will be named, given to low paid workers is essentially a State subsidy for employers.  If those workers were paid a living wage they would not need so much assistance from the State and the money could be put to better use in other areas. </p><p>We are still waiting on the Government Bill that will half-ban zero hour contracts and there is nothing on the subject in this Bill either.</p> <p> Time and again, the Minister has committed to reducing child poverty.  She has said it is her main priority as Minister but what is she doing to achieve this?  Increases in qualified child payment is a specific measure which directly targets children in low-income households, in poverty or at significant risk of poverty.  Despite knowing this, the Minister has increased the qualified child payment by a miserable &euro;2, which is nowhere near enough.</p> <p> We need to see specific key actions to take children out of poverty, including consistent poverty.  An increase of &euro;2 will not do that.  While the Government talks about a growing economy and releases statement after statement welcoming falling live register figures, what happens to the 140,000 living in consistent poverty in this State?  What about the majority of lone parents who are living in deprivation, who cannot afford a warm coat for their children or to heat their own homes?  What about the young people on reduced rates of jobseeker's payment because of their age?  What is a growing economy doing for these people?</p> <p> In March this year the UN recommended that Ireland establish a child maintenance service.  Did the Minister read this recommendation?  Is she ignoring it?  Why is she leaving lone parents at the mercy of a court system that is stressful, costly, and time consuming to seek child maintenance to which they are entitled?  We need a structured and proper child maintenance service that assists and supports lone parents and their children that is in line with the UN recommendations.</p> <p> There are more than 150,000 people registered as self-employed in this State.  Bogus self-employment is a threat to all workers.  It undermines pay and conditions, workers rights and security.  It gives the whip hand to the most unscrupulous employers, undermines union organisation and negotiating power, takes all the risks that are common in construction and other industries and offloads them on the shoulders of the workers themselves.  It smears the many genuinely self-employed people.  Bogus self-employment leads to tax and PRSI losses that harm all workers.  A conservative figure of &euro;750,000 in employer PRSI is lost annually along with considerable reductions in workers' entitlements.  I urge the Minister to address it immediately.</p> <p> There are more than 5,000 men and women aged 65 in receipt of jobseeker's payments, not because they are jobseekers but because they have been robbed of their State pension for a year.  This rule does not apply to all workers because the discrimination goes beyond that.  Those in the public service are given a special supplementary pension but other workers are not entitled to this accommodation and are left without any income for the year unless they sign on to jobseeker's payment, receiving a weekly payment that is almost &euro;50 less than they would have received in their State pension.  For those who have worked their whole lives and paid their taxes and pension contributions, the result is that they must sign on to jobseeker's payment at 65 years.  In 2021, the pension age will increase to 67 years and in 2028 it will increase further to 68 years.  Does that mean that those who are forced to retire at 65 years will remain on jobseeker's payment for two or three years?  What plans are in place to address this serious problem?  We are waiting on a money message from the Government to bring forward legislation that I brought forward to abolish the mandatory retirement age, which would resolve this issue.  If the Government is not forthcoming with the money message, I want to hear the Minister's plan.</p> <p> There was no consultation on the increase in the pension age, it was not discussed, and there was no debate or vote.  It was just a decision made without a thought as to the consequences.  The Minister has reminded us on many occasions that social protection is about protecting the most vulnerable, unless one is a lone parent, a child living in consistent poverty, a pensioner on a reduced State pension, punished for raising her family, a 65 year old forced onto the dole, a young jobseeker, a young person or a person stuck in low-paid, precarious employment.  Sinn F&eacute;in will allow this Bill go forward to Committee Stage.  There are positive elements to it but there are other elements that require serious change and we will put forward many amendments to do that.  Unfortunately, the Opposition cannot table amendments that have a financial cost on the State, which represents a serious problem.  We must work with what we have.  I will bring forward amendments and I look forward to the debate then.</p></speech>
