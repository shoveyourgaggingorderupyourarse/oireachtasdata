    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500003#A00500"><p>The public services card, PSC, was provided for in legislation in 1998 when it was introduced alongside the personal public service number, PPSN to replace the previous revenue and social insurance, RSI, number and the social service card, SSC.  The clear and stated objective, as articulated in Oireachtas at that time, was that the public services card was not to be confined to welfare services, as has been reported in recent weeks, but to act as an identifier for access to a broad range of public services.  Successive Governments have reaffirmed this policy both in Government decisions and through legislation.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office advises that the legislation is clear and provides a strong basis for the existing and continued use of the PSC across the public service.</p><p>The PSC provides citizens with the convenience of having to submit information only once to verify their identity.  As an example, about 70,000 people use the PSC to apply for passports each year; we pay more than 600,000 people approximately &euro;150 million through our post offices each week using the PSC as the identifier in each case; 600,000 free travel journeys are made using the PSC each week; about 400,000 PSC users use the MyGovID service to access online services with the Revenue Commissioners, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, the National Driving Licence Service, NDLS, welfare and, shortly, the national childcare scheme, NCS.</p><p>The PSC has strong public support, and approaching 90% of the adult population hold a PSC.  Research indicates that they overwhelmingly value the card, are fully aware of and agree to the sharing of data required to enable its use across the public service, believe they have more than enough information about the purposes of the card, understand why their data is being retained, and do not object to their data being retained.</p><p>In October 2017, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, commenced an investigation into the SAFE PSC process and delivered its final report to the Department on 15 August 2019.  On 17 September, the Department published the report of the DPC together with a summary of its own response to the findings of the report, and related correspondence between it and the DPC.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As stated earlier this month, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and I informed Government that we were satisfied that the processing of personal data related to the PSC does, in fact, have a strong legal basis, that the retention of data is lawful, and that the information provided to users does satisfy the requirements of transparency.  This opinion was arrived at following very careful consideration both of the report and of the strong legal advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p><p>The DPC had requested that the Department implement a number of actions on foot of the publication of its statement on Friday, 16 August, within a very short timeframe.  Based on the strong legal advice received, however, we believe that it would be inappropriate, and potentially unlawful, to withdraw or modify the use of the PSC or the data processes that underpin it, as has been requested by the DPC.</p><p>The Department sought to meet the DPC on two occasions since receipt of the report with a view to outlining the basis for its conclusions and seeking to clarify a number of matters of concern relating to inconsistencies both within the DPC's report and between the report and the accompanying letter from the DPC.  The request for a meeting was declined on both occasions.</p><p>The Department wrote to the DPC to advise it of the decisions taken and understands that the DPC is in the process of preparing an enforcement notice.  To date, the DPC has not issued an enforcement notice.  On receipt, the Department will consider the scope and terms of the enforcement notice and respond appropriately at that time.  It should be noted that the findings in the DPC report do not have the force of law until such time as they are formalised in an enforcement notice.  In the meantime, the Department will continue to conduct SAFE registration and issue PSCs.  It will also retain the supporting documentation collected as part of the SAFE process.  The reason for this is that it is not sufficient, in the case of a dispute over any decision, simply to record that decision was taken.  It is also necessary to produce the documentation on which the decision was grounded.  Other bodies, for example, credit unions, public utilities and banks, similarly retain documentation submitted in support of applications for their services for as long as the person concerned is a customer of their organisations.</p><p>My Department is committed to ensuring that data relating to individuals are securely held and used only for relevant business purposes.  The Department&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding data is reflected in its use of advanced data processing and storage technology hosted in secure, State owned and operated data centres, and is reinforced by a range of legislative and administrative provisions that are designed to protect the rights and interests of individuals.  Neither the PSC nor the underlying public service identity dataset contains any information relating to the holder&rsquo;s use of public services.</p><p>The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, restricts the sharing and use of the public service identity, PSI, data to a number of specified bodies set out in Schedule 5 to that Act and only relating to a transaction a person has with that specified body.  It is important to note, contrary to statements by some commentators, that the sharing of the PSI dataset does not involve sharing information regarding use of public services.</p><p>A person is required to undertake a SAFE 2 registration process only once.  When the PSC reaches its expiry date, a new photograph is taken to update the new card and the PSI dataset.  A person who is SAFE-registered can update the other elements of his or her identity dataset as these change, for example, when changing address.  In some of these circumstances a new PSC may also be required.  For example, a person reaching the age of 66 will automatically be issued with a new card with the free travel functionality, enabling him or her to avail of free travel on public transport services.</p></reply>

Has the Minister fully read the report of the Data Protection Commission?  Will she agree that it is carefully researched, detailed and analytical?  On the face of it, it seems extraordinary that the Office of the Attorney General which spent much less time considering it was able to come to a diametrically opposed conclusion.  In the circumstances, will the Minister agree that it is only right and proper that we should see the legal advice on which the Government&rsquo;s position is based?  Is there some rule, of which I am not fully aware, that precludes the Government from showing us the legal advice received?  It is only fair that we should receive a detailed analysis of how the State&rsquo;s law officer came to a diametrically opposed conclusion.  Is the Minister aware that several public bodies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Road Safety Authority, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, have backed off from demanding an individual be compelled to produce a public services card to avail of services they offer?  Does that indicate that they do not have as much faith in the Office of the Attorney General as the Minister appears to have?</p></speech>

However, I am not sure I would describe it as a pleasure.  I have, however, read it several times.  The Deputy is right that it is a comprehensive document which runs to some 170 pages, plus an annex.  It is significantly different by some 40 pages and four findings from the draft report we received a year ago.  As the Deputy knows having been a Minister in the Cabinet, the sharing of advice from the Attorney General in the public realm is not an established practice.  The Attorney General has advised me and other senior Ministers on this issue.  He has been involved in the process since 2017.  To suggest they just got together several weeks ago to come up with some response is not a true reflection of the amount of work which went into the submissions, as well as the engagement between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Data Protection Commission.  This is a comprehensive report on the back of a compressive review carried out by the Data Protection Commission.  As I have said before, I have respect for the office and the individual who holds that office.  I respect the position she holds.  We just have a different opinion on the set of legal circumstances underpinning the legislation.  There is a brief available to the Deputy who has been invited by the Secretary General on several occasions to attend the Department.  That offer is still open.</p></speech>

He stated that even a cursory glance - perhaps while he was in the car travelling between functions - of the different sections, subsections, miscellaneous provisions, etc, would readily lead one to conclude that the Data Protection Commission was completely wrong in its two year&rsquo;s research.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s position now?  Will she accept and follow up on what the Data Protection Commission has recommended and directed?  Is she going to allow a situation to occur where she will be dragged to court to do so at further expense to the taxpayer?</p></speech>

In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply.  Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly between the parties themselves, or with the assistance of support from the Department of Justice and Equality such as the Family Mediation Service and the Legal Aid Board, or, most times unfortunately, ultimately through the courts.  When any one of the parents applies for a one-parent family payment from the Department, a contribution towards the cost is sought from the other parent of any children of the relationship.  The liability to maintain the family scheme is managed and administered by the Department.  Its role is to determine on the basis of income information supplied whether the liable relative is in a position to contribute to the Department; to determine the amount of contribution due by the liable relative; to monitor and enforce payment of the contributions due; and to engage with both parties to ensure the requirements of the legislation are met.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the system is not really working the way intended in the best interests of both the State&rsquo;s finances and the families we serve.  I have had several discussions with stakeholders, experts and the ordinary people affected by the current regime.  Having listened to the points raised, it seems clear that the current system is not working.  There is much we could learn from what has been achieved in other jurisdictions.  While many of the concerns relate to wider issues of family law, several points have also been raised with me specifically about the set of people I represent and look after within my Department.  We have engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality.  I do not believe, however, that we have the luxury of waiting for a year or two.  We kind of know what needs to be done.  I will carry out some research in the short to medium term.  When it is completed, I will come back to the Deputy with some proposals.</p></reply>

My party has stated this consistently for several years.  Last year I published proposals for the establishment of a State family maintenance agency based on similar models abroad.  Across the water in England and in the North, there are systems in place which work well.  The proposals I have brought forward are based on these models.  They have worked in addressing the core problems.  More importantly, they have helped to reduce child poverty through the collection of child maintenance payments.  The Minister has rightly alluded to problems in the system with payments not being received such that people have to go to court to chase payments and have payments assessed.  This is causing significant problems.  I will touch on the review of the effects later.</p></speech>

It forms the basis of a good start.  When I look at international best practice, the UK comes in fifth place.  I am surprised by that given that its legal set-up is so similar to our own.  We are looking at Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Finland, all of whose agencies achieve very good outcomes.  Not all of these agencies, however, are statutory maintenance agencies.  I want to enact change in the fastest way possible.  That might not mean a statutory agency; it might be something else.  I am conducting the research.  I tasked my officials to start looking at the issue quite recently.  I will come back to the Deputy as soon as I have anything to work on.</p></speech>

I would certainly be interested in being kept up to date on that.  We need to look at this with a view to the long term as well as the short term.  Whenever I have raised this issue with the Minister she has said that her hands are tied because the issue crosses into the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is critical that the Departments come together to look at this for the long term.  The review that was carried out was the result of an amendment I secured to the Social Welfare Act.  That is why we are here.  More importantly, that report shows that the liable relatives unit is clearly not working.  The Minister has to acknowledge that, and I believe she has.  One of the interesting statistics in the report is that, of the 18,078 cases examined by the liable relatives unit in 2018, in just 2,174 cases did liable relatives begin making a contribution.  Only &euro;269,949 was collected by the liable relatives unit in 2018.  That shows that the system is not working.  I costed the proposal I brought forward.  For a small amount of money, we would have a statutory child maintenance service.  I welcome the Minister's comments but we need to move on this issue because it is causing serious problems.</p></speech>

What the Deputy has just put on the record of the House, however, is not a true reflection of our decision on liable relatives.  In the vast majority of those 18,000 cases the people pay maintenance directly.  They do not come through us, so it is not a fair reflection of the work of the people in that unit that only 2,400 or thereabouts make payments through it.  The unit tries to have family members engage with each other rather than sticking its nose in the middle and acting as an enforcer.  Where an arrangement is made between two parents, that arrangement is monitored by the unit.  It only steps in and issues an enforcement notice where there is no such arrangement.  That is why the number is so low.  In the first instance, we try to keep those in the family unit as amicable as they can be despite their separation.</p></speech>

What is the up-to-date position in that regard?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500005#C00600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, community employment, CE, schemes deliver on a number of our objectives.  They provide a means for people to gain valuable work experience as a stepping stone to full-time employment, they deliver valuable services in our communities, towns and villages, and they help people who are genuinely long-term unemployed, are far removed from the workforce, and who have very high barriers to employment, to overcome social exclusion.  As the labour market has recovered and the profile of people available to take up places on CE schemes has changed, at my request the Government established an interdepartmental group to explore how the social inclusion aspect of CE schemes might best be organised into the future.  This included considering which Department should hold lead responsibility for sponsoring CE schemes focused on social inclusion, the rural social scheme and the job initiative scheme and whether there is any need to modify participation arrangements for individuals on these schemes.</p>  <p>  Many meetings of the group have taken place, along with bilateral meetings between officials from my Department and other appropriate Departments.  There has also been a consultative process with relevant stakeholders.  Submissions were invited and were received in large numbers.  These were considered as part of the deliberation process.  I am advised that a final draft of the report will be given to me very soon.  We will be setting a date for the final meeting of the interdepartmental group either today or tomorrow.</p></speech>

The Minister has acknowledged what a fantastic success CE schemes have been and the benefits they have yielded both to individuals and to communities.  She has said that she expects the final report shortly, which is precisely what she told me last July.  Is the Minister giving the House a commitment that the final report will be available within this D&aacute;il session, perhaps in the next couple of weeks?  I have two things I would like the Minister to confirm.  Will the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection have ample opportunity to debate the report and to have input into it?  Has any decision been taken as to the appropriate Department to run these schemes?  As the Minister knows, at the moment community employment schemes are under the aegis of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Will that continue to be the case?  If not, why not?</p></speech>

I know that I said "shortly" in July, but this "shortly" is different.  I expect the last meeting of the interdepartmental group to be held in the coming weeks, if not earlier.  It is at that meeting that decisions will be made on the recommendations, so I cannot tell the Deputy now what will be decided.  It will be decided at that meeting.  From there, the report will have to go to a senior officials' group, then a sub-Cabinet group, then Cabinet.</p>  <p>  I would be very pleased for the Oireachtas joint committee to hold a lengthy discussion of the report at that stage so that it can tell me whether it agrees with it or whether there are parts of it with which it disagrees.  It should be remembered that it was the submissions that came from our CE hosts and CE participants and supervisors that carried the most weight for me.  I am very mindful of the value of the schemes.  To be honest, I do not believe we recognise their value as much as we should.  I would like to establish some method of formally recognising the value of community employment schemes throughout the country during the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, I expect all of this to be done long before the end of this D&aacute;il session.  This is a 14-week session and I would like to wrap this up in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that, as levels of unemployment fall and levels of employment increase, there is less need for activation.  The Minister should bear in mind, however, that we face a number of threats on the economic front.  There is one in particular, of which we are all aware, which could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment.  Will the Minister ensure that, in its final deliberations, the committee is conscious of the fact that CE schemes need to be adaptable so that they can quickly be changed to accommodate that situation should it arise?</p></speech>

Anybody unfortunate to lose his or her job as a result of a hard Brexit, which we all hope does not occur, will not be unemployed for the long term if our plans for the next year can move him or her into one of the new jobs being created.  I am mindful that CE schemes exist to do a particular job.  I am not sure it was traditionally segregated into classifications before 2015.  I now think it was unfortunate that we segregated the schemes.  People need to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of whether they are travelling at the same speed as others.  Everybody going into a CE scheme should come out prepared for full-time employment, even if that employment is classified as sheltered employment.  The aim and objective of everybody coming into a CE scheme is to leave it with the skill set, self-confidence, and dignity he or she needs to enter the workforce.  I want to ensure that is what we achieve and, more importantly, that we publicly value these schemes.</p></speech>

Last year, I increased the payments to qualified children under 12 for the first time since 2010, thankfully, and increased payments for children aged 12 years and over to recognise that they cost more money.  In addition, we restored the Christmas bonus to 100%, which was long overdue.  This was paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients in 2018 to assist them with the extra expenses incurred by all around Christmas. </p> <p> Increasing the standard rates of payments is, however, only one approach the Government has taken to improve the living standards of social welfare recipients.  We have also introduced measures that target those most at risk of poverty, such as increasing significantly the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance last year.  We extended the fuel allowance season and increased funding for school meals.  The latter is coming into its own.  We increased income disregards for lone parents and low-income families while strengthening consistently the provision for employment services.</p> <p> As part of preparations for budget 2020, I hosted my Department's annual pre-budget forum in July.  Representatives from some 50 community, voluntary, trade union and business groups had an opportunity to present their budget priorities directly to me and my officials.  In addition, my officials and I regularly engage with a wide range of stakeholders both bilaterally and through regular meetings, including with the community and voluntary pillar and the social inclusion forum, at which poverty research and other issues are discussed.  I had four meetings on Monday of this week.</p> <p> In addition, the Department's social inclusion division examines the impact of potential budget measures on poverty rates and a social impact assessment is carried out.  This is an evidence-based methodology that estimates the likely distributive effects of changes on household income using the ESRI's SWITCH model.</p> <p> Regarding Brexit, the convention on social security was signed on 1 February 2019 and the parliamentary ratification processes in Ireland and in the UK, where it took a little longer, were completed by March of this year.  This means that, no matter what happens when the UK leaves the EU, recipients will experience no change to the reciprocal social welfare arrangements that have existed for a long time between Ireland and the UK.  The rights and entitlements of both EU and British citizens to social welfare payments will remain as they were before Brexit, irrespective of what kind of Brexit materialises.</p> <p> Discussions are ongoing on this year's budget.  The current context will push us in a direction in which will be having a slightly different and more focused budget than we would have had heretofore.  As is the norm in my Department, I expect the discussions to be ongoing right up to the day before the final budget is decided upon.</p></speech>

I want to zero in on the issue of pensions.  Is it true, as we are reading in some newspapers, that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, with which it is negotiating or framing the budget, are considering freezing the base pension rate in the budget?  I understand there is a threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would present a challenge for any Government, but the Government could go after the rich, including the big landlords.  Why is the Minister seemingly choosing to target the pensioners in this budget?  Are they to be made the whipping boys for a no-deal Brexit, with the rents and insurance costs increasing?  The Minister will ensure that their carbon tax goes up.  It seems as though the Minister is preparing to freeze their pensions.  I would like her to comment on that and not evade the issue as she did in her introductory comments.</p></speech>

As I suggested to the Deputy, the only thing I put on the record publicly in any newspapers &mdash; I do not know where he is reading what he is reading &mdash; is that my job is to make sure that, in every budget, the limited funds I get, whether they are small or big, are targeted at those who need them most.  That is exactly what I am going to do this year.</p></speech>

We have also met them.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Barry, on pensions.  There is a gender gap concerning pensions, in particular, that the Minister said she might address.  Among the advocacy groups that impressed us were the Children's Rights Alliance and the No Child 2020 campaign.  Many commentators and distinguished journalists, such as Mr. Fintan O'Toole, said we should have a children's budget this year, irrespective of anything else, because we know that over 100,000 children live in consistent poverty while 250,000 live in poverty.  We clearly need dramatic action in this regard.  So many families &mdash; nearly a quarter, according to the census &mdash; are headed by lone parents.  There were disgraceful changes to the one-parent family payment under the previous austerity Government.  There are considerable challenges.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has found money in every single budget, as did his predecessor at times.  He has found additional money behind the sofa.  There is at least &euro;600 million.  Is the Minister fighting to get most, if not all, of the &euro;600 million for the most vulnerable families, particularly our children?</p></speech>

I am well able to do it.  I hope that the last two budgets show the Deputy that we get relatively decent outcomes from the discussions.</p>  <p>  I love the idea of a children's budget except that children are not the only people in the country who are most vulnerable.  Included are their parents, who in many cases are lone parents.  Some of the most affected are those with disabilities.  I am loath to say that while there are many pensioners living in poverty in this country, there are many who are not.  I am not going to chase votes like some others might do; my job is to make sure I get the biggest slice of the pie to look after the people who are currently living in the most vulnerable circumstances and who are at risk of poverty, as well as those who will be most vulnerable in the case of a hard Brexit.  While I am mindful of all the knowledge I have, I am also very mindful that there are those in Ireland today who will potentially lose their jobs in the next six to 12 months.  I have to be mindful of having a budget for them also.</p></speech>

I do not know which paper she does not read because it seems to me that every newspaper in the State is being briefed by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and by Deputy Michael McGrath, in respect of expecting a freeze of the basic pension rate.  Fianna F&aacute;il's fingerprints are all over this one, too.  I can safely say that a large majority of Fianna F&aacute;il supporters will not support the idea of freezing basic pension rates in this budget.  Ten years ago, the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government tried to take the medical card away from the over-70s.  We all know what happened in that case.

The National Youth Council of Ireland, in its pre-budgetary submission, A Fair Share for Young People and Youth Work, wants the Minister to start moving this year to reverse the low levels of support for the young people in question, who may be desperately seeking a job.</p>  <p>  We are coming very close to the fuel allowance period, which I believe will start at the end of this week.</p><p>Has the Minister been consulted?  The Taoiseach makes announcements in New York in regard to carbon taxation and it looks as if we will have a massive green tax increase in this budget in a couple of weeks.  Has the Minister been consulted about whether there is going to be a universal payment, whether it is going to be tax and dividend, or whether we are going to take the hypothecated tax and the green tax and target it at the most vulnerable people, in particular those who are in fuel poverty?  We know a very significant proportion of our people, perhaps 15%, are in fuel poverty.  What input has the Minister had into that, given it is such a huge problem?</p></speech>

What I want to put on record is that both the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael manifestoes before the last general election committed to increasing the State pension by &euro;5 each year for the lifetime of the next Government.  It made it into the programme for Government and we have done that.  With respect, I would love to see the Deputy's manifesto where he made the promise, given his sudden newfound interest in looking after pensioners.</p>  <p>  The issue of those under 26 comes up at every single budget forum and it is under consideration every single time we sit down to our negotiations, so that is the best I can tell the Deputy at the moment.</p>  <p>  A number of us have an input into how we are going to address any carbon tax gains to make sure the people who are most vulnerable and will be most hit will be able to absorb this and make sure they can be eased into new practices, as opposed to being hit with financial implications that will hurt them in their pockets.  We are going to do our level best.  My mindset is that the people I look after have single incomes and are some of the most vulnerable from a fuel poverty perspective.  I will make sure I look after them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500007#E00800"><p>I launched the Department's new compliance and anti-fraud strategy last week, covering the years 2019 to 2023.  While it is acknowledged that the vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming the correct entitlement due to them, my Department has a duty to ensure that non-compliance in the social welfare system is minimised so that resources we have just spoken about can be directed to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  The strategy sets out how my Department will tackle welfare non-compliance during the period in question and it builds upon the successes of the previous strategy, which ran from 2014 to 2018.  The new strategy comprises four pillars: &ldquo;Prevent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Deter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Detect&rdquo; and &ldquo;Account&rdquo;.  My Department's objectives under each of these pillars are as follows: to prevent error or non-compliance entering the system in the first instance - which does happen, as we recognise - by having in place robust scheme application channels and clearly defined assessment processes to try to reduce some of the errors that are made, either by the humans in the Department or the humans we are interacting with; to discourage attempts to defraud the social welfare system by actively pursuing the recovery of overpayments that have taken place and considering cases for prosecution where there has been a deliberate attempt to defraud the State; to detect instances of fraud and error in the social welfare system as quickly as possible through various control measures and techniques; and to protect moneys entrusted by the taxpayer and authorised by the Oireachtas through appropriate governance procedures, oversight and monitoring.  It is underpinned by a comprehensive implementation plan, which outlines how we intend to achieve our objectives.  Of course, we must remain alert to new and emerging forms of fraud, so our approach will remain flexible and dynamic in terms of how it is structured.</p>  <p>  An important new initiative relates to the need to tackle false self-employment, which is contributing to a drain on the Social Insurance Fund and the denial of employment rights to affected workers.  My Department is establishing a new unit of social welfare inspectors which will be focused solely on false self-employment, as opposed to the entire team of inspectors being involved in all inspection cases.  As part of the new strategy, the Department plans to conduct over 750,000 reviews of social welfare claims over the course of this year and 2020.  This represents an increase on the 742,000 reviews conducted last year.  The target for savings resulting from these reviews in 2019 is &euro;530 million.</p>  <p>  Control reviews take place across the range of schemes operated by the Department and can take a variety of forms.  They include desk-based assessments of customer claims, face-to-face interviews with customers by trained investigators, home visits, audits of employers&rsquo; PRSI records, specialist investigations, self-declarations by customers and joint inquiries and operations with other State agencies, including Revenue and CAB.  Reviews looking at the medical conditionality underpinning certain schemes are also undertaken to try to help ease processing.</p>  <p>  Reviews arise from both targeted and random case selections and where specific information comes to the attention of the Department.  In this context, it should be noted that customers are under a legal obligation to report any change in their circumstances, including income or means, to the Department and such notifications may also trigger a review of a person's entitlement.  These reviews, and the other activities described in the strategy, form part of the control work which is a core function of all officers of the Department.  For this reason, while the Deputy asked for a costing, the cost of the work under the strategy cannot be disaggregated from overall departmental expenditure and functions.  It is my genuine hope that this strategy will give strong assurances to Irish society generally that the system of control we operate is robust and effective.  I hope this clarifies the three matters raised by the Deputies.</p></speech>

I am not sure how she can estimate savings yet cannot estimate the cost to the Department.  The previous strategy only saved an estimated &euro;1 million so is that figure of &euro;530 million an overestimate of what might be saved under the strategy?  I certainly welcome the prevention element because, in many cases, it is actually mistakes by the Department that cause overpayments.  I strongly welcome the emphasis on bogus self-employment.  Can the Minister confirm that the Department will as zealously seek the prosecution of employers who engage in fraud through bogus self-employment as it will seek the prosecution of people who draw social welfare payments?  It is important that we get that balance between white-collar crime and blue-collar crime, if we can call it that.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister any intention of trying to simplify the multiple and complex categories of welfare assistance, which would probably save the Department a lot of administration money in terms of the overall cost of delivering the system, which was &euro;629 million in 2018?</p></speech>

Overall, the key outputs from the 2014-18 strategy were as follows: more than 4 million control reviews carried out; &euro;2.5 billion in savings; 94,000 reports from members of the public in regard to potential fraud processed; &euro;400 million worth of overpayments recovered; almost 190 suspected identity fraud cases identified; and almost 1,500 cases referred for prosecution.  I have a detailed response as to how the control numbers are calculated and if that is of interest to the Deputy, I will give it to her as I do not have time to read it out.</p>  <p>  We look at all schemes every year and we find there are anomalies on different schemes.  There are different criteria for different schemes so I am assuming that what the Deputy is alluding to is some sort of universal payment which would make it easier for people.</p></speech>

I believe there are anomalies in our system.  For argument's sake, the cost of the disability review we undertook in last year's budget, on which I will hopefully have findings later this year or at the beginning of next year, should seek to establish that people who are living on a disability payment have different outgoings than people who are trying to seek work.  There are anomalies in our system that can be addressed but it can only be done by statistical data.</p></speech>

Is she aware that her predecessor, when he introduced the previous so-called anti-fraud strategy in 2016, estimated that fraud amounted to &euro;530 million?  Some &euro;530 million was going to be saved as this was the amount of fraud in the system.  Subsequent parliamentary questions revealed that in 2016, the Department raised &euro;110 million in overpayments, of which only &euro;41 million amounted to fraud.  Has the Department taken any steps to recalculate how it measures fraud in view of the Taoiseach's massive overestimation of the amount of fraud in the system?</p></speech>

We have not changed how we calculate our control measures and their results.  However, I consider the sum of &euro;41 million in deliberate fraud to be a sizeable amount of money, taking from money we could collectively spend on fuel poverty, children and schools meals, if the Deputy says that is all it was.</p></speech>

Of the 100 prosecutions for welfare fraud last year, only one could be attributed to employers actively engaging in bogus self-employment.  This is something we must address.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has campaigned on this issue, as has my colleague, Senator Nash.  If there is an opportunity to address it, that is a welcome element of what the Minister is announcing.</p></speech>

There is a hell of a difference between &euro;530 million, which appeared on the side of every bus I saw in 2016, and the actual figure of &euro;41 million.  The Minister said there will be an emphasis on bogus self-employment.  Will there be a separate and increased number of staff allocated by the Department to focus on bogus self-employment as a result of this?  Will that be part of the new strategy?</p></speech>

The answer is "Yes".  We have a new unit.  I can only assume that as a regulator in the past the Department, in its inspections or investigations of complaints, sought to right the wrong.  If it discovered in the past that an employer had wrongly classified somebody from S to A or to any other classification, it made the employer right the wrong and backdate the payment to rectify it.  We are somewhat past that now.  As a regulator, we sought to rectify things as opposed to punishing people.</p>  <p>  We have to lead by example.  To answer Deputy O'Dea's second question, the unit is new.  It is a ring-fenced team whose members have had specialised training.  They have a specific remit and I hope it will yield results very quickly.</p>  <p>  I am sorry that I did not have an answer to Deputy O'Dea's first question earlier.  According to my notes, the &euro;530 million the Taoiseach referred to at the time was control savings and only part of that would have been fraud.  However, &euro;41 million in fraud is a sizeable amount and, collectively, we must stamp it out.</p></speech>

With due respect, I do not want a response that refers to the Department surveying 1,000 customers who say they are happy with the process.

Given that I read the first half of it into the record, I will read the second half and that might answer the Deputy's questions directly.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to use the SAFE 2 registration process and issue PSCs.  It will also retain the supporting documentation collected as part of the SAFE process.</p>  <p>  The reason for this is that it is not sufficient, in the case of a dispute over a decision, to simply record that the decision was taken.  It is also necessary to be able to produce the documentation on which the decision was grounded.  Other bodies, for example, credit unions, public utilities and banks, similarly retain documentation submitted in support of applications for their services for as long as the person concerned is a customer of the organisation.  We intend to do the same.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that data relating to individuals are securely held and only ever used for the relevant business purposes.  The Department&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding data is reflected in its use of advanced data processing and storage technology hosted in secure, State-owned and operated data centres and is reinforced by a range of legislative and administrative provisions that are designed to protect the rights and interests of individuals.</p>  <p>  Neither the PSC nor the underlying public service identity data set contains any information relating to the holder&rsquo;s use of public services.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, restricts the sharing and use of the public service identity, PSI, data to a number of specified bodies set out in Schedule 5 to that Act and only in respect of a transaction a person has with that specified body.  It is important to note, contrary to statements by some commentators, that the sharing of the PSI data set does not involve sharing information regarding use of public services.</p>  <p>  A person is only required to undertake a SAFE 2 registration process once.  When the PSC card reaches its expiry date a new photograph is taken to update the new card and the PSI data set.  A person who is SAFE 2 registered can update other elements of their identity data set as these change, for example, if the person moves house.</p></speech>

There are legitimate concerns in that regard and that is supported by the Data Protection Commissioner in her findings.  It certainly does not comply with the data retention principle that data controllers have no basis for collecting or keeping personal data that they do not need just in case a use is found for them at a future date.  The Department's response to the Data Protection Commissioner on the blanket retention of data says that the process of satisfying the Minister as to identity is not necessarily complete once the card issues, yet the legislation clearly states that a public services card will not be issued unless the Minister is satisfied as to the identity of the person.  It is a nonsensical argument.  Numerous bodies, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, have serious concerns about the retention of individuals' personal data.  The Minister's response was unsatisfactory so perhaps she will deal with those points.</p></speech>

However, I refer to the four magnificent words he used: "they do not need".  The reason we retain the data on the identification of a person's address is that we need them.  As I will probably say later this evening, we believe we have a strong legal basis to do what was anticipated back in 1988 and established in the 2005 law, which has been amended a number of times since then by successive Governments.  We have a strong legal basis to deliver our mission, which is to give effective public services to people and that they do not have to prove to State services who they are on multiple occasions, as it is done on a once-and-done basis.  Regardless of whether the Deputy likes it, people tell us they are very satisfied with the process.</p></speech>

It is not only me, the Data Protection Commissioner or the organisations that have serious concerns about the unlawful retention of people's personal data and how that can be used.</p> <p> The Minister's response is unsatisfactory.  We will follow it up later in the boarder discussion.  She keeps citing facts and laws but we have not seen them.  I will put a question to her and follow it up later.  To follow on from the issue Deputy O'Dea raised, which I raised last week in terms of the advice from the Attorney General, the Taoiseach said last week he had received third party legal advice.  The Minister said there is a precedent and reasons the Attorney General's advice cannot be given but there is no reason the third party legal advice cannot be given.

There is no justification for continuing to have a discriminatory reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance for young people now.  Will the Minister restore that rate and restore equality for young people in terms of social welfare payments in the coming budget?</p></reply>

Receiving the maximum weekly rate without a strong incentive to engage in either education or training can lead to welfare dependency from a young age, and nobody wants that.  If young persons participate in incentivised training or any of the education opportunities that are available to them, they can receive the maximum weekly rate of &euro;203.  The youth employment support scheme, YESS, which I launched last year, is targeted exclusively at young jobseekers and participants receive &euro;229.20 per week.  My Department offers young people a number of work placement and training supports closely aligned to the labour market. </p>  <p>  The policies in place for the past number of years have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term youth unemployment.  In 2009, youth unemployment had reached its highest rate with almost 28% of young people under the age of 25 unemployed.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate at the end of August 2019 saw that rate almost halved in the past tens and it is currently 14.7%, but that is still far too high.</p>  <p>  The Department is finalising a review, arising from an amendment brought forward during the debate on last year's Social Welfare Bill, on the impacts of the reduced rates on young jobseekers and I will review it shortly.  My view is well known in this House.  The objective of the Department is to ensure any young person under the age of 25 is as encouraged as much as they can be and supported in every way, shape or form into training, work experience or education.</p></speech>

The reason many young people were unemployed in 2009 and the years afterwards was due to the calamitous economic collapse precipitated by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party when in government and perpetuated by the austerity cuts Fine Gael and the Labour Party Government continued.  The evidence for that is that prior to the economic collapse, we had near full employment.  Even though there were no discriminatory social welfare rates, young people worked.  The idea that if young people's social welfare payments are not slashed, they will all sit around doing nothing is discriminatory and prejudicial against young people.  Does the Minister imagine that if one is under the age of 25 one can survive of less money - the social welfare rates are already poverty rates - on half or a little more than half of the payment rate?  In the era of equality, that is just wrong.</p></speech>

He has a different perspective from the one I have.  I will cite research that was not commissioned by us but undertaken by the National University of Ireland Maynooth, which is independent of all of us.  Its researchers found that those 18 years old in receipt of jobseeker's allowance on the age-related reduced rates prior to 29 April 2009 had an average unemployment spell lasting 111 weeks.  However, those whose claims commenced after 29 April 2009 and who were in receipt of the reduced rate - at a time the Deputy is blaming Fianna F&aacute;il which is probably not fair - had a reduced unemployment spell lasting only 50 weeks.  Unless the Deputy had a different explanation as to why that happened when we had massive unemployment rates, I am not sure, but a large number of people in the past number of years, through the supports on offer both from the Department of Education and Skills and ourselves, have gone back into training and are educating themselves so that they can get a better job and a career.  That is the support that should be available as opposed to the Deputy wanting to give them an extra &euro;100 a week.  That is far more valuable for our young people.</p></speech>

In June this year, more than 21,000 young people were being actively discriminated against by this State.  In a recent debate, Deputy O'Dea, said his party introduced it but it has not worked.  If the Fianna F&aacute;il Party believes it has not worked and the Minister, in an earlier contribution, said this discrimination towards are younger people is up for consideration at every budget, what will Fine Gael do about to end it?  Will  it insist it should be a red line issue for budget 2020 or is it happy to discriminate against the 21,000 citizens involved?  In the pathways to work strategy introduced in 2016, there was a commitment that there would be a review and a report on the impact of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  That was three years ago and we have not seen such a report.  The Minister has cited other reports that might back up this discrimination but the report to which she committed has not been published some three years later.  Where is it?</p></speech>

The number people in this age category who were on the live register at the end of August this year are thankfully much lower than 21,000.   They number 16,223 but they are 16,223 people too many.  The reason this is not discriminatory is other options are available to them.  The weekly payment is &euro;203 for those on our training schemes; &euro;229 for those on any of our community employment or T&Uacute;S employment schemes; and &euro;229.20 and for those on YESS.  The purpose of the supports of this State, albeit that income support is a large of it, is to ensure we help support people through education, training and work experience to enable them to get back into a position to participate in the labour market.  That is what we have been doing for the past ten years and it is working.  I am not sure why we would stop doing something that is working over and above trying to tweak it, make it better and deliver a better service, and that is what we intend to do.</p></speech>

That is what the Minister is imposing on young people.  </p> <p> If other arguments do not sway her, she should consider the fact that we need to get our young people back to the country.  Having a discriminatory reduced rate is not exactly an incentive or encouragement for the many young people who are leaving this country to come back.  It, alongside the housing crisis, is also contributing significantly to overcrowding in many family homes because young people simply cannot afford to leave home.  There is unacceptable overcrowding in many households. </p> <p> The Minister should end this blatant discrimination based on age.  There is no other way to define it.  It was never justified.  Even its architects are now acknowledging that, but in the era of so-called economic recovery, it is completely obnoxious and unacceptable.</p></speech>

He said that young foreign people come to these shores, get off aeroplanes and are able to find themselves a job, and asked what our young people are doing.  There is a train of thought within Government circles that our young people are lazy, are sitting at home on PlayStations and are not willing to get out and work, which is a disgusting view.  That is the root of this ideological position.  It is not about what is working.  Unemployment levels are down across the board.</p>  <p>  I have welcomed the YESS initiative, but this discrimination has to end.  I asked about the report that was committed to under the pathways to work strategy.  It was supposed to have been produced three years ago.  The Minister has said this policy is working, but is not backing that up with her commitment to produce and publish that report.  Saying the report will be published in the near future is not satisfactory because I have been told that every time I ask the question.</p></speech>

Deputy Brady shares Deputy Boyd Barrett's view, but I do not.  I am not sure others in the Chamber share my view, but that is widely known.  It is also a view shared by the OECD and the European Union.  The EU youth charter has worked.  Ours is a policy which is working.  I am not sure what part of the numbers do not work for Deputy Brady.</p>  <p>  The policy was introduced in 2009 when 450,000 people were on the live register, many of whom were aged under 25 years.  We have halved that number due to the policies we have deployed for the past number of years.  I wish things were working faster, and that the 10% of people aged under 25 years who are still on the live register would engage and avail of training, work experience, employment or a return to full-time education, but we will continue to provide supports for them.  I do not believe there they are lazy.  It is cheeky, to put it mildly, to try to interpret somebody else's words or view.</p>  <p>  My view is based on reality.  If Deputies do not know this, they need to be in their constituencies more often.  Our young people are far from lazy.  They have difficulties based on the environment and the communities in which we live today and need support services to be wrapped around them to enable them to be able to overcome those difficulties.  That is what we do in my Department and will continue to do with the community and voluntary sectors.</p></speech>

There are currently 60,635 beneficiaries of this payment.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that claimants are receiving their full and correct entitlements, ongoing reviews of means tested payments are carried out annually.</p>  <p>  In the case of increases for qualified adults, IQAs, for those in receipt of the State contributory pension, the primary claimant is contacted by my Department to notify him or her that his or her continuing entitlement to the means tested IQA payment is currently being examined.  In addition, details of the means of the qualified adult are requested.  Just over 10% of the 60,635 IQA cases are reviewed every year.  These review letters have been approved by the National Adult Literacy Association, NALA, and were sent out recently.</p>  <p>  Where a qualified adult has weekly means of less than &euro;100, the maximum rate of IQA is paid.  Where his or her weekly means is between &euro;100 and &euro;310, a reduced rate of IQA is payable.  If the qualified adult has means of more than &euro;310 per week, this exceeds the means limit and, therefore, no IQA payment is paid.  Only the means of the qualified adult are taken into account for claimants of contributory pensions.  In the case of joint bank accounts or joint ownership of land or property, apart from the family home, only half of the value or amount is, therefore, assessed as means for that qualified adult.  It is open to claimants to contact my Department regarding the return of any of the information requested.  Flexibility can be and often is provided if there is difficulty in replying within the requested 21 days suggested in the letter.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by a number of people who have received this letter, who fear they will lose the payment, and wording of the letter has created that fear.  The Minister needs to clarify the position.</p>  <p>  My office spoke to officials in her Department about the number of letters being issued, and was told that 60,635 people are in the system and letters will be issued on a phased basis.  So far, 10% of the letters, or 6,000, have been sent and they have generated concern.  The remaining letters will be sent out in phases in the near future.  The first to receive letters are those who have not been reviewed for a long time. There is major concern.  Perhaps the Minister could answer that question first.</p></speech>

Just over 60,000 people are in receipt of this particular allowance.  We apply control measures every year, and 10% of those in receipt of the payment are randomly selected and receive the letter, and that is what has happened.  I do know what the Deputy means by "phased basis" and "the rest of them will get it shortly."</p>  <p>  We carry out control measures across all of our schemes every single year.  A percentage of claimants are randomly selected every year across every scheme for inspection.  The number of people in this scheme who have been selected for inspection is just over 6,000 recipients, which is 10%.</p></speech>

The first round of letters have gone out to the 10% concerned and I took the response of the Department to mean that the rest will go out in the near future.  What has caused the most concern is the wording of the letters.  People have been given 21 days to respond.  There is a fear that if they do not respond or provide all of the necessary documentation, the payment will be stopped.</p>  <p>  I again ask about flexibility.  When I raised the matter with the Minister yesterday, she told me that there is no flexibility whatsoever.  I received a letter from the Department, which states that there could be flexibility in different scenarios.  She is now saying that there is a little flexibility, but that is not stated in the letter.  There is no indication that the Department will work with recipients to ensure all the necessary documentation is in place.  They need to be reassured that their payments will not be stopped.  That needs to be communicated not just to me, but to all 60,000 recipients.</p></speech>

I assume what my officials meant to tell him is that we do not send out 6,000 letters in one go because we do not have the staff to receive 6,000 responses in one go.</p><p>The 6,000 letters are sent out on a phased basis and we respond to people as they send the stuff back to us.  There is no documentation to be returned.  I do not know if the Deputy has read the letter.  There is a form to be filled out and people do not have to give us copies of anything.  Either people's circumstances have changed or they have not.  If they have not changed, people have nothing to fear whatsoever.  If they have changed, they have an interview with somebody to ascertain what the new payment is or if the payment will stay exactly the same.  This is a control measure to ensure that people are getting the correct payment.  If the Deputy has met people who are fearful that their payments are going to be changed, he should explain that all we are trying to do is to make sure that people have the right payment and that they stay on it, which is the remit of the Department.</p></speech>

The reference to 2020 should be to 2022.  Nevertheless, this is a critically important matter.  As the Minister is aware, there is significant pressure on the State pension system due to demographic changes and longevity, among other issues.  Only 35% of people in the private sector have their own private pensions.  Auto enrolment is a partial solution to this problem.  Naturally, we are very anxious that the Government would be in a position to proceed with auto enrolment as quickly as possible.  I am concerned about some slippage in the Government's timetable that it set out in the pension document some years ago and I seek clarification on that.</p></reply>

Therefore, if measures are not taken to address this issue, many future retirees will experience a massive cliff and a reduction in their living standards, which none of us want.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that by international standards, a 2022 delivery for automatic enrolment is very ambitious given the level of design work to be done and the complexity of legislation that this House will have to pass and the organisational and procurement arrangements to be implemented.  Nevertheless, given the low level of occupational pension coverage, the view of the Government, which I hope the Deputies share, is that an ambitious timeframe is appropriate and we will continue to work towards the 2022 commencement target.</p>  <p>  Automatic enrolment will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt out.</p>  <p>  An extensive national public consultation process on automatic enrolment finished earlier this year.   A Strawman Public Consultation Process for an Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System in Ireland was launched in August 2018 as the basis for the consultation.  It set out a plausible approach to the design of an automatic enrolment system for Ireland, with the intention of generating discussion and, hopefully, improving the original ideas we had.  I chaired a series of consultation seminars around the country, in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  In March, my Department and the Pensions Authority held a series of focus groups with the target population intended for automatic enrolment.  My officials continue to regularly meet various stakeholders and representative groupings, of which there are many, as the Deputies well know.</p>  <p>  The Department has completed the analysis of the substantial material collated from the consultation process, in order to determine how the feedback received may assist with the design process.  The ESRI has completed research we commissioned on the economic impacts of introducing automatic enrolment.  My Department is continuing its research and consultation with experts from around the world to further build the evidence base in a number of specific areas over the coming months.   I recently updated the Cabinet committee on the economy on progress with the design of the automatic enrolment system, including an overview of findings from the consultation process and the ESRI's macroeconomic impact assessment.  A report on all the progress to date on the matter will be brought to Government for consideration in the coming weeks to facilitate the next steps for implementation of the scheme in 2022, as planned.</p></speech>

The basic design was supposed to have been ready by quarter 1 of 2019.  As the Minister is aware, that deadline has already passed.  In view of that, is the Minister still confident that she will be able to bring in her legislation on target in 2022, because, as I have said, it is a matter of the greatest urgency?</p></speech>

The Minister referred to complex legislation.  Could she give some indication of the nature of that and the preparation that has been done for it?  Could she also indicate if IT systems need to be developed?</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea referred to response to the national consultation which the Minister carried out.  Will there be widespread public information campaigns as well, because while a certain amount of people engaged in consultation, the public probably does not know very much at all about the issue?</p></speech>

I am getting a reputation for it.</p>  <p>  I meant that in a good way.  I referred to the number of people who came to us and said it was great but suggested we do this and tweak that.  We got good feedback in response to the consultation, not just from the big insurance companies.  A 16 year old boy came to Galway who was interested in his pension.  I was blown away by the people who came to the open days and who gave their input.  That is what I meant by ripping it to bits.  They gave us some great ideas.  I have said consistently in this House that no one party or Department has a monopoly on wisdom.  What we want to do is deliver a service for the people that gives them exactly what they need, which is a few extra bob when they get to 66 to be able to do stuff they want to do in their retirement.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I hope the design will be finished in the main at the beginning of next year.  The complexities around the central processing authority, CPA, will probably take us a little bit longer.  There will be a requirement for a brand-new IT system.  We do not know who is going to manage the system.  There are still several things that remain to be designed.  The roadmap for pension reform gives a clear indication of when we are going to do what we are going to do.  There will be a public information campaign long before we ever press a button on day one, so as to socialise it and to make sure that people are happy.  We have done a public consultation with employees and people within the industry in the past year and it has really yielded some positive changes to the system.  I hope to be able to bring those changes to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The Government's roadmap proposals suggest the private sector.  A number of companies in the private sector are interested.  I received strong representations to the effect that this should be done by a State body such as the NTMA.</p>  <p>  The roadmap document promised the establishment of a full-time automatic enrolment programme management office that was to be established immediately.

That has still to be determined.  We are considering some of the suggestions that were made on how we look after that.  I want whoever manages it to have the full confidence of both this House and the people who will give it their money.  That is probably the most important thing for me to do.</p>  <p>  The full-time management team is in my Department.  It is not until it becomes a separate body and we determine who will be the ultimate manager of the CPA that a separate agency will be established.  It may not end up being a separate agency; it may be a body that is already in existence.  Those decisions will be made as per the timetable in the roadmap.</p>  <p>  The international experts that we have are from the countries the Deputy can imagine they are from, who are world leaders in this area.  It is just to try to help us.  We could just copy and paste from somewhere else but it simply would not work.  We want to learn from the experiences other countries have had.  We have three international experts working with us to make sure that we get something that is suitable for us.  There were some difficulties initially when the system was introduced in the UK and I want to make sure that we recognise them before they hit us in order that we plan for them and we can, hopefully, head them off at the pass.</p></speech>

The term "habitually resident" means that a person has to have his or her "centre of interest" in Ireland.  The term also conveys permanence; that is that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here.  It is a definition used in some of the schemes sought in the past number of weeks.</p> <p> As the Deputy will be aware, eligibility for employment permits is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, who has just sat beside me.  However, people on non-EU work permits who lose their job may be eligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, subject to satisfying all of the qualifying conditions, including the PRSI contribution requirements.  We ensure they get those entitlements.  Those who do not have enough PRSI contributions to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance where other conditions apply, including a means test and the requirement to be habitually resident.  Any claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in the case of involuntary short-term lay-offs represents a transient need for support.  We look after that slightly differently and there are different conditions.  The main aim with the specific cases raised by the Deputy was to get our teams to ensure that if a person qualified for an existing scheme, the payment was made.  If that was not the case, we tried our level best to look after the person in the interim.</p></speech>

The savagery and inhumanity involved reveals the continued existence of a minority criminal underground across the Border region that acts with impunity beyond the law, undermining the rights of the vast majority of decent and law-abiding citizens in the region.  This assault on Mr. Lunney is the latest in a long series of attacks, including arson, intimidation, murder threats, destruction of property and endangerment to workers since 2011.  It is worth reminding the House that in this region in recent years, two garda&iacute;, Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and Garda Tony Golden, were murdered in 2013 and 2015, respectively.  These criminals have no respect for State authorities or the law and they operate in a twilight zone of their own with savagery and murderous intent.</p>  <p>  When I heard of this savage assault on Mr. Kevin Lunney and the circumstances surrounding it, my mind went back to the savage murder of Mr. Paul Quinn in October 2007.  He was a young lad who was lured into a barn.  I subsequently met his parents, Stephen and Breege, and their campaign for justice has continued.  They were in no doubt at that time who was responsible for the murder their son.  They blamed the IRA at that stage.  I am not connecting that to who is responsible for the attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney but the nature and similarity of the attack is the point of comparison.  In Mr. Quinn's case, a team of approximately 15 people was involved in the murder, and he too was lured to an isolated barn.  Six or seven individuals clad in overalls and surgical glove beat him to death; they were trying to avoid leaving forensic clues.  His mother said to me.  "They broke every bone in my son's body.  If we fast forward some years later, groups of people are again trying to avoid leaving forensic clues, getting a person into an isolated location and beating him almost to death.</p>  <p>  There is a terrible legacy in the Border region and we must face up to it.  These acts did not stop after the Good Friday Agreement and certain paramilitary elements have carried on regardless in enforcing for and protecting a criminal financial empire.  Operation Loft, which was undertaken by the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in 2015 revealed a paramilitary financial empire of up to &euro;70 million per annum with approximately &euro;500 million in assets.  The 2018 cross-Border threat assessment prepared jointly by the Garda and Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, estimated that 43% of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-Border dimension.</p>  <p>  The time has come for both the British and Irish Governments, as well as the Northern Ireland authorities when they return, to establish a statutory cross-Border multidisciplinary agency with a specific budget and personnel to once and for all root this evil out the Border region.</p></speech>

I was horrified to hear about the attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, a decent, hard-working man whom I have known for many years.  As a director of the Quinn group of companies, he supports the employment of more than 800 people in the Ballyconnell area.  It is important that people should be able to go to and return from work without this type of horrific intimidation.  What happened to him was absolutely outrageous.  My thoughts remain with his family and friends and I wish him a full and speedy recovery.  Of course, I urge anybody with information to come forward to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am assured a full criminal investigation is under way.</p>  <p>  I worked in Ballyconnell for many years and I am familiar with that part of the country.  As a local Deputy and member of the Government, I stand behind the workers and with the directors of the company.  They are Mr. John McCartin, Mr. Dara O'Reilly, Mr. Liam McCaffrey, Mr. Kevin Lunney and the plant manager, who is Kevin's brother, Mr. Tony Lunney.  We will ensure the necessary resources are in place to bring to justice the perpetrators of this absolutely horrific attack.  On a personal level, when I first heard about this, I was terribly upset to think a human could do this to another human.  It was absolutely awful.</p>  <p>  It is abundantly clear that these criminals are not supported by the communities in the region.  Deputies will appreciate I am limited in what I can say about the incident, given that it is the subject of a significant investigation by both the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In Cavan last week, Deputy Garda Commissioner John Twomey stated that every resource and the full weight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its specialist units have been placed at the disposal of garda&iacute; in Cavan.  Both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are conducting a major inquiry into this incident and they are determined to find those responsible.  Deputies will have heard the Garda Commissioner during his appearance before the justice committee here last week speaking of the ongoing close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI in response to this horrific attack.  He confirmed the determination to bring these perpetrators to justice.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Garda Commissioner are in Cavan today attending a cross-Border conference.  The Minister plans to visit Quinn Industrial Holdings headquarters just outside Ballyconnell.</p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about setting up a task force.</p></speech>

It was a special statutory body.  It is something to which the Government will give consideration.  There is currently a task force in place to tackle cross-Border crime.  The joint agency task force was established by the Fresh Start agreement and it is led by senior officials from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and people from revenue and customs services in Northern Ireland.  CAB and the National Crime Agency have also been involved.  The Minister will address the task force today.</p></speech>

However, it will no longer cut it.  The point made in my presentation was this has gone on for decades at this stage.  The existing operation is not working.  The PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operate well in tackling paramilitary violence and foiling bomb attacks and so on but, fundamentally, there is an alternative world in the Border region.  There is considerable fear and a culture of omerta across the region which has its roots in the corrosive legacy of violence which has been ongoing for 30 or 40 years.  It did not stop after the Good Friday Agreement.  People have empires there.  The murder of Veronica Guerin sparked the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I was in this House at the time when Fianna F&aacute;il produced the relevant legislation while in opposition because the murder demanded such a response.  The assault on Kevin Lunney is the last straw.  We must provide protection and quality of life for people in the region and its economy.  We must safeguard their livelihoods and provide pathways to attract investment.  Above all, we must protect human life and property.  That is why a statutory agency is needed.  We are going to reintroduce the legislation.  I want the Minister to go back to the Taoiseach and the Government for them to have an open mind, with a view to working to establish such a statutory cross-Border agency to, once and for all, take on the thugs and criminals and send the message that the only authority is that of democratic law and order and that no other will rule or reign on any part of the island.</p></speech>

This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable and puts fear into the heart of everybody.  The Deputy mentioned Mr. Paul Quinn.  I drove past an area not far from where he was tortured not too long ago and somebody pointed out to me the spot at which Mr. Quinn had been killed.  It puts the hair standing on the back of one's neck thinking what happens to people and what happened to Mr. Kevin Lunney.  So bad was it, it is hard to describe, or even to think about, what they did to him.  It was horrific.  Every effort is being made to ensure the criminals are brought to justice.</p>  <p>  The issue of a statutory body was raised again by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, but there is a very good cross-Border task force in place.  I must say the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working together and that all necessary resources are being put into investigating the case to bring the criminals to justice, ensure it will not happen again and stamp out this type of behaviour on the Border.</p></speech>

He is the father of six children.  I met him in recent months to discuss Brexit.  As others set out, the attack on him was utterly vile and criminal and every effort must be made to bring those responsible to justice.  It is also worth saying the attack does not represent the standards or spirit of people who live in the Border region.  Those who acted in this way did so of their own accord.</p>  <p>  Yesterday we watched as the latest chapter of the Boris Johnson Brexit circus unfolded in London.  The Supreme Court in Britain ruled that Mr. Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful.  The British Prime Minister was caught out in his latest bluff by the courts.  Let us be in no doubt that he is wedded to his Hallowe'en Brexit strategy, come what may.  He refuses to accept the democratic decision of the people in the North who voted to remain in the European Union.  It is clear that he lacks the maturity or skill necessary to deal with the complexities of his country's departure from the European Union.  His international credibility is in absolute tatters after the latest debacle.</p>  <p>  The real challenge for us in Ireland is to ensure we do not become bedazzled, or distracted, by the latest instalment of the great Westminster soap opera.  If the British Prime Minister wants to disrespect his office and duties, that is his problem, but we cannot allow it to become Ireland's problem.  His stupid and dangerous Brexit fantasy cannot become Ireland's nightmare.  Despite the chaos that is enveloping the British political system, he has said he will push ahead with Brexit on 31 October.  He has also said he has an operable alternative to the agreed backstop.  He has stated he has an operable plan to avoid the reimposition of a hard border on this island.  We have all waited a long time for the British Government to produce workable solutions that are grounded in sense and reality.  If Mr. Johnson does, in fact, have such a plan, this is the time for him to produce it, but I do not believe he has a plan.  His behaviour in the past two months, since he entered 10 Downing Street, suggests such pragmatism is beyond him.  I believe he has deluded himself into believing he can hoodwink Ireland and the European Union.  It is the Taoiseach's responsibility to call his bluff because far too much is at stake for the sense of entitlement of the British Prime Minister to be entertained.  The peace agreements, the economy and the rights of Irish people are on the line.  In his arrogance Mr. Johnson perhaps believes Ireland will be the collateral damage in the Tory Brexit.  He needs to be put straight that that will not happen.  He needs a dose of reality.  The Taoiseach met Mr. Johnson yesterday - Athena and Hercules in conclave - in New York.  I want the Minister to confirm for the D&aacute;il that the Taoiseach  has reiterated to the Prime Minister that the backstop remains the bottom line, that the guarantees contained within it cannot be bartered away and that there will be no circumstances in which we can countenance the return of a hard border.  The people of Ireland, North and South, need that reassurance today.</p></speech>

Given the current political uncertainty in London, there is a significant risk of a no-deal Brexit.  We do not want such an outcome, but Ireland cannot move away from an agreed and negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution.  The responsibility to avoid a no-deal outcome lies with the United Kingdom because it will never be the choice of the European Union.  Ireland and its EU partners stand by the withdrawal agreement.  We are committed to finding a way forward and, as we have said repeatedly, open to hearing any credible, fully worked out proposal from the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  We have, of course, noted the findings of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom and continue to monitor developments closely, but it would not be appropriate or helpful for me to comment on the internal workings of the British Parliament or courts.  I will say, however, that any proposal from the United Kingdom must achieve the same outcome as the backstop.  This test is crystal clear.  A solution must avoid a hard border, fully protect the Good Friday Agreement and North-South co-operation and preserve the all-island economy, as well as the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  To date, there is nothing on the table that would achieve the same outcome as the backstop.  As the Taoiseach said when he met Prime Minister Johnson in New York on Tuesday, the gaps between the European Union and the United Kingdom are still very wide.  Unless and until it is shown that any alternative arrangement could pass the test, the EU position remains that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is the only way forward.  Proposals which would not achieve these aims, or which would only partially achieve them, are unacceptable.  Media speculation suggesting otherwise is simply incorrect.</p>  <p>  We welcome the intensification of discussions between the European Commission and the United Kingdom.  However, meetings are not enough, with only a handful of weeks remaining until the European Council meeting in October.  The United Kingdom must match its stated aspirations with actions and present fully worked out solutions.  Prime Minister Johnson has floated the idea of an all-island sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, area, but, while SPS alignment will form an essential part of any solution, it is not enough in itself.  Agreeing to this limited approach would have considerable negative impacts on life on both sides of the Border and such a proposal does not meet the test of having the same outcome as the backstop.</p></speech>

It is very important, as the clock ticks down and people become very anxious about what might happen at Halloween, that the Government, as well as political leaders across the D&aacute;il Chamber generally, remain firm in their resolve to secure and deliver the bottom line, the least worst option, which is the backstop.  No one here is pretending that it is the all-encompassing answer to Brexit which was always bad news for us.  We should not be led into a cul-de-sac in having to choose between the Single Market and the Good Friday Agreement, the all-island economy and citizens' rights.  The task for all of us is to secure all of them.  When does the Taoiseach intend to brief Opposition leaders again about his conversations with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the political plan for what might happen if Britain crashes out of the European Union?  All of the things the Minister listed - the avoidance of a hard border, protection of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation, the all-island economy, to which I would add citizen's rights, and our position in the Single Market - are still imperatives if and when Britain crashes out of the European Union.  We need a plan to secure them come what may.</p></speech>

It is important that people know that there is an agreement in place, that they can travel over and back every day to their place of work or to see their friends along the Border.  We are an absolutely committed member of the European Union, membership of which has served the country extremely well.  We will remain a committed member.  As a member of the European Union, we must protect the Single Market and the customs union.  Therein lies the difficulty in making sure we will not have a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  I am very familiar with the area and the last thing I want to see is a border between us and Northern Ireland such that we could not continue to do what we do every single day in going over and back across the border.  We do not notice it any more as it is seamless.  We want that to continue, which is why the backstop is in place and we believe the withdrawal agreement is the best option on the table.  We remain committed to it, as do our European partners.</p></speech>

Those us across the House, both in government and opposition, who come from counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, as well as from north Cork, depend on the University of Limerick Hospital Group.  On Monday, 23 September, 81 patients were on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Can the Minister imagine what it will be like on 23 January?  This is the highest the figure has ever been and we are only in September.  That is despite the best efforts of management and staff.  I plead with the Government to make a direct intervention.  I was on the telephone to Mr. Paul Reid this morning.  He knows that it cannot continue, but he needs the Government's support to do what needs to be done.</p>  <p>  The constant high number of trolleys, the lack of bed capacity and the outrageous spending on agency staff all contribute to a situation which is the worst I have seen in my political career.  Since I stood here last week, the INMO has highlighted that there are over 100 nursing posts unfilled.  Behind the bluster and spin on the capital plan which was buried by the Minister for Health during the summer, there has been no real progress in building the necessary 96 bed block.  Amazingly, University Hospital Limerick, unlike other model four hospitals, has only one MRI scanner.  It is 14 years old and was donated by a local philanthropist.  It constantly breaks down.  The hospital cannot afford to buy a new one - it would cost &euro;6.5 million - because of the overrun on the national children's hospital.  It would cost &euro;1.2 million to rent one, something it cannot afford to do.  </p>  <p>  Slaintecare funding was announced with further fanfare last week.  The mid-west got nothing.  Patients' well-being is suffering greatly.  Staff are going on sick leave at record levels because they cannot cope.  Compared to other groups across Ireland, University Hospital Limerick needs 130 more doctors, 200 more health and social care professionals, 150 more nurses, 160 more beds, about an extra 50 transitional care packages, in addition to a new MRI scanner.  Its spending is &euro;40 million below that of other groups.  The people of the mid-west who are represented by me and others in this House are being discriminated against at a level not seen before.  They are suffering.  People in their 90s are on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Their families are crying on the telephone to me.  I am not talking about one or two calls, but calls made every single day of the week.  The issue takes up more time than any other on my political calendar.  </p>  <p>  I have three questions for the Government.  When will it remove the recruitment ban which is stopping over 100 nurses from being recruited in the UHL group?  Will it, please, bring forward work on the 96 bed block and include it in the capital plan?  Will the Minister commit to bringing a new MRI scanner into the hospital?  Of the 81 patients on trolleys, at least 30 would not be there if the hospital had a scanner that worked.</p></speech>

It is acknowledged that the numbers on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick are unacceptably high.  The HSE is working actively with the UHL group to ease congestion in the hospital, with the focus on facilitating transfers to level 2 hospitals, providing assistance at rehabilitation units and primary care services and the prioritisation of diagnostics to aid patient discharges.  In addition to the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, a further 25 beds have been opened since 2017, including eight as part of the winter plan in 2018-19.  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.  The new modular block will include three wards, comprising 20 single rooms with en suite facilities, two of which will have full isolation facilities and provide care and treatment for patients, from admission to discharge.  The HSE has advised that the enabling works are complete and that the main contractor is commencing work.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that while there is no recruitment embargo or moratorium, there is a priority requirement for all HSE services to get to and maintain an affordable staffing level that will be sustainable through 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services.  In the light of this, the HSE advises that it has introduced control measures related to staffing and recruitment to ensure it will live within the resources provided.  This means that in some hospital groups and community health organisations the filling of non-critical replacement posts will be paused.  The preference is for the controls to remain in place for as short a period as is necessary, with an ongoing review, until there is satisfactory evidence of traction and delivery of balanced financial plans from hospital groups and CHOs.</p>  <p>  The UHL group reports that it has recruited 68 staff in the past five weeks, 48 of whom are graduate nurses and midwives.</p></speech>

I remember the Hanley report and the Teamwork report.  They were the reports that were put in place to justify creating the model 4 hospital in Limerick.  The issue was the resources and the capital required were never put into it.  The amount of funding for staff such as doctors, nurses and health professionals was never in tandem with what was required.  It has now come to a crisis.</p>  <p>  Will the Government publish the report on the inequity in the funding of acute hospital groups in Ireland by Dr. Anne Dee, which has been buried by the HSE?  It shows the discrimination that is happening to all of us in the mid-west.  Will the Government publish it?  It is a couple of years old but it still stands.  It was buried.  If the Government does not publish it, I will publish it and put it out there.  Will the Government please publish it?  It statistically shows how we are being discriminated against.</p>  <p>  The situation in the mid-west needs direct intervention now.  Can the Minister imagine what we are facing into over the winter?  We need more staff.  The recruitment embargo exists; it is real.  I could name tonnes of people who have been offered jobs but cannot take them up.  Will the Government please make a direct intervention to ensure those staff can take up their jobs?  Will the Government please ensure we can get the capital resources needed, such as the scanner I outlined?  Will the Government please ensure that in the budgetary process that is coming forward, the mid-west hospital group will not be discriminated against as it has been?</p></speech>

The hospital system is operating at close to full capacity.  The number of patients attending emergency departments continues to increase year on year.  Attendances in 2018 were up 3.5% on 2017 and this reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 and over age group.  Planning for winter 2019 to 2020 is under way.  Although trolley numbers were lower over the 2018 and 2019 winter periods than the previous winter, attendances and admissions were higher than expected.  Consequently, the HSE has commissioned an independent expert review group to identify the factors that contributed to performance over the winter period.</p></speech>

There is certainly a wide gap between Boris Johnson's understanding of the UK Supreme Court judgment and what the judges said.  I will borrow from that language in a different area and, while we are talking about gaps, talk about the even wider gap between the Government's commitment to deliver a public health system and the reality on the ground.  As the Minister knows, I have raised the matter of University Hospital Galway on many occasions in a constructive manner and I have repeatedly highlighted that the hospital is not fit for purpose.  The previous Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said in 2015 that the accident and emergency department was not fit for purpose.  The current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il has repeatedly endorsed this same stance.  It is a hospital with 43,000 people on waiting lists.  Two theatres were closed in September 2017, of which one is still closed and consultants are writing to us about the catastrophic regional waiting lists.  There are 64 nursing vacancies.  Today alone, 47 people are on trolleys.  I invite any member of the Government to go onto a trolley, even for a day.  They should remember the words of Dr. Fergal Hickey in Sligo University Hospital when he said there are 300 premature deaths every year that are directly related to the time patients spend on trolleys.  On this day last week, there were 49 people on trolleys in University Hospital Galway and in August, 655 people in total were on trolleys.  There is an options appraisal for the future, which is positive, but it has gone into abeyance.</p>  <p>  I mention all of that by way of background to the question I will ask.  The Minister can relax because it is a simple question.  That is a hospital and a public health system creaking at the seams.  I will look at primary care now, and according to the Minister for Health, he will focus on developing a strong and efficient primary care system.  These words have been used over and over.  We look at Galway in relation to primary care, which is essential of itself, but it is also essential to take the pressure off the hospital.  Let me give the Minister a specific question and I might get a specific reply.  We have 11 posts open in Galway.  My colleague, Deputy Pringle, has a letter which details over 100 posts open in Donegal.  The list starts with the post of a senior occupational therapist, an audiologist, a physiotherapist, a dental surgeon and so on.  The point is they have gone through the process and the Garda vetting and they have got their jobs.  Can the Minister imagine that?  They have celebrated the fact they have got their jobs but what happens?  They are told they cannot take up that position because sanction is needed from Dublin.  That is from the letter me and my colleagues have been shown.</p>  <p>  Please do not give me rhetoric or something I do not understand.  Can the Minister tell me why those people cannot take up their posts if we are seriously interested in providing primary care?  As I speak, i gConamara, i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta, n&iacute;l post ann don fhisiteiripe.  T&aacute; orthu dul isteach go dt&iacute; an chathair.  There is nobody covering Connemara and all of the patients seeking physiotherapy have to go into the city.  Specifically, is there an embargo or not?</p></speech>

Since 2017, however, an additional 267 acute beds have been opened.  The capacity programme for 2019 provides for a number of increases, namely, the provision of 75 acute beds and 70 community beds under the winter plan.  Some 47 additional beds will include four high-dependency unit beds in Cork University Hospital, three in the Mater Hospital and a 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital, which is due to be operational in the first week of January.  Some 202 additional beds, of which 16 are critical care beds, will be provided during 2019, with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in quarter 1 of 2020.</p>  <p>  On home care, which the Deputy mentioned, over &euro;1.8 billion is available for 2019 for older persons' services.  Of this, &euro;985.8 million is available specifically for nursing home support schemes and &euro;862 million is available for older persons' services.  Despite the significant level of funding and service provision, demand for services continues to grow.  The HSE is required to manage its budget and service provision throughout the year to ensure a balanced budget for 2019.  As outlined in the HSE's national service plan for 2019, the HSE maximises the utilisation of current resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals and significant resources and services have been targeted in 2019 to facilitate timely access.  In the winter of 2018 to 2019, the immediate focus was on reducing delayed patient discharges through mobilising the additional resources made available and ensuring that social care measures were effectively deployed to enable older people to move to a more appropriate care setting, including to step-down care or to transitional care in their own home with the supports they need.  The Department of Health is engaging extensively with the HSE in the context of planning for winter, including consideration of the response to dealing with the current challenges, such as the high level of delayed transfers of care.  While this engagement continues, the HSE has been authorised to undertake immediate action to mitigate the challenges.  Engagement will continue over the coming weeks, having regard to the process for the 2020 Estimates.</p></speech>

We know that from recent events in Oughterard.  Part of the democratic process is for the Opposition to hold the Government to account in language the ordinary person understands.  I have asked the Minister a simple question.  I refer to 11 specific posts in Galway - there is list of over 100 unfilled posts in Donegal - where people have received their positions for vital posts in a vital pillar of the Government's health policy, namely primary care, which I agree with.  Did the Government direct the director of the HSE not to fill these posts?  Has it had a role in that?  Has it been drawn to the Government's attention prior to me drawing it to the Minister's attention?</p><p>The Minister refers to balanced budgets.  Is the Government telling us that the budget will be balanced at all costs and that these posts will not be filled in the interest of balancing the budget and having a surplus?  Is that what I am to tell the people of Galway, the patients on trolleys and the 43,000 on waiting lists?  I have made it easy for the Minister because I am asking her about this issue specifically.  They have gone through the process.  I do not like to repeat myself, but I wish the Minister would answer my question.  How can she stand over having 11 empty posts which are only the tip of the iceberg?  She should state whether she is in favour of filling these vacancies, or that she does not know anything about them and will look into the matter, but I ask her to, please, just give me an answer I can understand.</p></speech>

I speak with a degree of knowledge.  In 1997 or 1998, prior to my becoming Minister for Education, an attempt was made to remove history as a compulsory subject.  I vetoed it on that occasion and stopped it.  I am not normally one for interfering and understand the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, must go through its processes.  However, history is inextricably bound up with our sense of society, our sense of the past, and has application in a parliamentary democracy.  It is imperative that we cultivate and nurture the study of history in schools.  If it becomes non-compulsory or is not a core part of the junior certificate cycle, the level of follow-through to the leaving certificate will be even lower.  As the humanities are losing out within the education system, I ask the Minister to speak to the Minister for Education and Skills to tell him that there is precedent for him not to take on board the advice of the NCCA in that regard.</p></speech>

The Department received the NCCA's report in July and the Minister is giving it full consideration within his Department.  It includes consideration of some very useful proposals made by the NCCA for how we can promote the study of history.  I take the Deputy's concerns on board and will pass them on to the Minister.</p></speech>

It is reported that last year alone, over &euro;500,000 was spent in hiring debt collection agencies.  Patients are telling some very upsetting stories about harassment, threats, and strong arm tactics being employed.  They talk about being frightened.  They are mainly vulnerable people who are recovering from illness or surgery and the reported behaviour of these agencies is completely and utterly unacceptable.  No hospital should be engaging debt collection agencies to pursue in this manner vulnerable patients, many of whom might be in some financial distress.  Will the Minister for Health come before the D&aacute;il to make a statement on this issue?  I believe it would be merited as this is a serious matter.  Will the Minister join me in demanding that hospitals desist from the practice of using debt collection agencies to harass patients?</p></speech>

Having said that, I do not agree with the type of behaviour about which the Deputy has spoken.  There is a need for compassion.  People's personal circumstances need to be accounted for.  This type of heavy-handed approach is not acceptable.  There are those, however, who can pay but will not pay.  Some patients also opt for private inpatient services in public hospitals and are liable for a range of private accommodation charges, from which there are no exemptions.  We have increased medical card limits in order that many more people can avail of medical cards.  We have also introduced free GP care for the under-sixes and over-70s to assist families with medical costs.  However, I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

Ten times as many people die by air pollution than in road accidents in the European Union.  The United Nations has stated the failure of governments across the world, including Ireland, to ensure their citizens can breathe clean air is a violation of the rights to life, health and well-being.  The Clean Air Alliance claims that four people die in Ireland each day from the effects of air pollution and that approximately 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland are attributable to air pollution.  The Minister previously told me that up to 6 June, 98 breaches of the daily air quality limit had been recorded in the State, of which 65 had occurred in Dublin, including two in the Phoenix Park.  The Government is all talk and no action about air pollution, its impact on the ecosystem and climate change.  When will we see some action, as opposed to mountains of verbiage?</p></speech>

My Department is sitting down with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local authorities to identify measures we could take in the short term to tackle the issue.  As the Deputy knows, the climate action plan has at its heart the dramatic reduction of our dependence on fossil fuels, which causes much of the air pollution.</p></speech>

However, that is clearly what the Taoiseach did when he arrived at the UN summit to announce that he favoured banning the exploration of fossil fuels, or one fossil fuel, namely, oil.  That is not possible.  The Taoiseach received flawed scientific advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council and thinks he can do something he cannot.  The only way to leave fossil fuels in the ground, which is what the movement is asking us to do and about which I am sure he heard them screaming right around the planet, is to allow the climate emergencies Bill I put before the D&aacute;il to be passed.  As the majority in this House have twice voted democratically in its favour, I ask the Government to issue a money message and allow the Bill to be passed.  Otherwise, the Taoiseach's statement is hypocrisy, based on a Damascene conversion, which is no good to anybody.  The Government must allow the Bill to be passed if it is serious about banning the exploration of fossil fuels.</p></speech>

He and I wrote to the Climate Change Advisory Council to receive the best scientific advice.  It has advised clearly that there is a case for ceasing the exploration for oil but continuing the exploration for gas.  The reason is that as we transition from a figure of 30% to 70% for renewable energy and eliminate major polluting fossil fuels such as peat and coal, we will become dependent on gas when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.</p><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council has clearly cited the supporting evidence and we are going to act on it.</p></speech>

A Fine Gael Government forced through A Vision For Change and left those us in County Tipperary bereft of a single long-stay bed for persons with mental health issues.  St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny cannot take them.  A Vision For Change promised a lot but delivered nothing.  The people of County Tipperary will be taking to the streets in Clonmel next Saturday to demand that the Minister for Health reinstates beds.  We have met the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who I believe is doing his best, but we have got nothing.  The crisis house that was promised is not yet complete and we do not have a single nurse.  People are being left on the street or sent home to die.  In many cases, they take their own life.  What is happening to people with mental health issues is a scandal out of all proportion.  They are forced into overcrowded emergency departments, not treated or rejected and sent home.  Many of them have spoken to me.  Fr. Michael Toomey has spoken out on the issue, as have Maurice Cagney, Caroline Tobin and countless others.  There are countless stories.  We need action now because we cannot wait any longer.  We are losing people on a daily basis, including young people.</p></speech>

The HSE's mental health budget has been increased by more than &euro;276 million since 2012.  An additional &euro;84 million for mental health services was announced in budget 2019, bringing the total available close to &euro;1 billion, of which some &euro;55 million was provided to progress new developments.

In the budget to be announced on 8 October can we expect to see the same of level of support for Irish businesses and jobs which was around &euro;300 million to be continued in 2020?  Despite some recent more hopeful signs, has the Minister's Department costed the worst-case scenario of a crash-out Brexit?</p></speech>

I continue to work with the Minister in preparation of budget 2020.  Significant funding has been put in place to support Irish businesses as they prepare for Brexit.  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland provided &euro;74 million in grant aid for firms that would be impacted on by Brexit.  Two funds are available - the Brexit loan scheme fund of &euro;300 million and the future growth loan scheme fund of &euro;300 million.  The Deputy knows that I am acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs.  I have established an early warning co-ordination process for firms experiencing difficulty.  Working with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, the Intreo offices stand ready to work with employers who are experiencing short-term difficulties.  I welcome the announcement made by the European Commission that it proposes to use emergency funds to help countries badly hit by a no-deal Brexit.  It follows the engagement between Ireland and the European Union on the matter.</p></speech>

It can often take up to two hours to travel the 30 miles from Navan to Dublin, which means a four-hour commute every day for families.  This is on the occasions the bus actually arrives because there are many occasions it will not arrive.  When it does arrive, it is full, leaving dozens of people wating at bus stops unable to get to work.  This morning the majority of workers left County Meath to work elsewhere.  This happens in no other county.  Navan is the largest town in the State which is not served by a rail line.  We have a serious situation where families are being stuffed in commuting in County Meath.  Before the Minister steps into any further photo opportunity on the issue of climate change, will she ensure bus services to my county actually work?</p></speech>

That is why as part of the future jobs initiative, a whole-of-government initiative, I have been looking more at the issue of remote working and developing hubs to where people can come to work in co-working spaces.  I accept the Deputy's comments about the difficulties which I will raise with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  It is about how we can reduce commuting times and improve quality of life.  That is why we will put a strong focus on remote working in hubs with co-working spaces.</p></speech>

A Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to reduce waiting lists and trolley queues.  Yesterday there were 600 patients on hospital trolleys, most of whom were elderly people with complex needs.  There were 80 patients waiting on hospital trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Emergency measures are needed to address the specific and unique issues in Limerick.  Deputy Kelly referred to the unique structural difficulties.  There has been disproportionate underinvestment at Limerick University Hospital - by a figure of 20% - compared to other model four hospitals.  As the Minister said, we cannot wait for the winter initiative to address these issues because it will not kick in for three months.  I ask the Minister to pass on four requests to the Minister for Health.  There is a need for a lifting of the embargo on nurse recruitment at University Hospital Limerick.  There is a need for immediate provision of a second MRI scanner in Limerick which is absolutely essential to allow patients to flow freely through the hospital.  There is a need for an immediate release of funds for short and long-term step-down facilities.  The Minister also needs to address the consultant manpower deficiency that is slowing down the health service.</p></speech>

It is a national disgrace and the Minister for Health should intervene personally.  He attended the emergency department on 21 August.  He told nobody that he was coming; he snuck in and snuck out.  Nothing has got better since.  In fact, everything has got worse.  On Monday there were 81 patients waiting on trolleys; on Tuesday there were 80 and today there are 66.  University Hospital Limerick has had 1,200 patients waiting on trolleys in September, 33% up on the figue last year, and the month is not yet over.  We want to know what actions the Minister will take.  He has said there is no recruitment embargo at the hospital, but obviously there is.  We need 100 nurses and want to know when the embargo will be lifted.  We want to know when MRI scans will be available as delays are being caused.  We want to know when proper homecare facilities will be available in order that patients can leave hospital when they are ready to leave.  We want a proper answer to that question.  The Minister has not come into the Chamber to answer any of these questions, but for the past few weeks he knew that they were coming up.  He knew that they would also arise during the Topical Issues debate, but he did not turn up.</p></speech>

The HSE is working actively with the University of Limerick hospital group to ease congestion at the hospital, with the focus on facilitating transfers to level two hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and primary care services and the prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.

The qualifying criteria for a primary medical certificate are very strict.  Essentially, a person has to be severely and permanently disabled, must be without limbs or without the use of both arms to qualify.  In my constituency of Cork West I have come across dozens of constituents with severe disabilities, many of whom have been unsuccessful in qualifying for a primary medical certificate.  One of the people in question is a lady in her late eighties who is suffering from dementia and is doubly incontinent.  While she is not completely wheelchair bound, she suffers from advanced osteoarthritis and is restricted by stiffness.  She cannot get into an ordinary car and has to travel by wheelchair taxi to hospital and dental appointments and so on.</p><p>Her family were devastated when she was refused a primary medical certificate.  They were told they could appeal the decision but this would require the elderly lady to hire a wheelchair taxi, at great expense, to travel the long and arduous journey from west Cork to Dublin and, having done so, the appeal would most likely be unsuccessful.  I am calling for a review of this scheme on the basis that the criteria are too strict and exclude genuine cases of serious disabilities.</p></speech>

On the appeal, I understand that occasional appeal sittings are held in Cork, which might be more convenient.</p></speech>

This scheme needs to be re-opened and redefined in terms of eligibility.  Many suckler farmers cannot participate in this scheme because one of the criteria is that they must reduce the size of their herd.  The average suckler herd farmer in Ireland has approximately 18 cows, with most of those living in and around where I live having only ten or 12 cows.  To be eligible for the scheme, these farmers would have to reduce their herd which, in turn, would reduce their income.  This disadvantages the smaller farmer.  There are also issues arising in regard to the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  There are many farmers who, when their contracts under this scheme ended, could not access a green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  These farmers are now outside of both schemes and they are precluded from entering into the BEAM scheme.  The Minister needs to re-open the scheme, change the criteria, reduce the onerous conditions attached to it and ensure that farmers, particularly suckler farmers, have equal access to it.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to re-open the GLAS scheme to allow these farmers access to it because many of them are losing out on income as a result of not being in it.  As stated by Deputy Kenny, they were also precluded from entering the BEAM scheme if they do not meet some of the other criteria as well.  There have been problems with this scheme.  Following the local elections, it became clear that there was going to be a 5% stock reduction requirement and that take-up has not what it should be.  I would appreciate it were the Minister, Deputy Creed, to update the House on how much of the &euro;100 million has been used in respect of applications to date.  Will he give an assurance that the Government will now seek a fund from Europe to cover the period from May until now, when losses were heavier than the reference covered under the BEAM scheme, which was September to May?</p></speech>

The beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, was approved by the European Commission.  Like all measures under the Common Market organisation, CMO, regulation, it comes with specific terms and conditions.  We were faced with a requirement at EU level to have a supply reduction element attached to the terms of the scheme.  We felt it was best to approach this by way of a reduction in organic nitrates rather than, as portrayed by the Deputies, a simple head count reduction.  This allowed for on-farm individualised management of organic nitrates rather than a head count reduction, which, I think, is the most efficient way for farms to benefit under the scheme without being obliged to reduce their herd size.  For example, they can manage this by way of selling stock earlier or buying in stock later in order that their organic nitrates load matches the required reduction of 5% over the referred period.</p>  <p>  With regard to the requirement that applicants be in an environmental scheme, the criterion is participation in an environmental scheme or a quality assurance scheme.  Bord Bia has confirmed that it will accept participation in any quality assurance scheme to enable people to be eligible under the terms of the scheme.  </p></speech>

I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, an anomaly in regard to particular sites.  There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of sites around the country where there has been a developer-led sewage treatment system that Irish Water currently will not take in charge.  Therefore, the local authority cannot take them in charge and they remain in limbo.  This will have detrimental effects in the future because any estate that is not properly maintained or taken in charge by a local authority will ultimately deteriorate.  I ask the Minister to address this anomaly.</p></speech>

On the broader point regarding vacant sites, since the vacant site levy came into force at least 40 sites have moved from vacancy to construction.  Only two years ago, we more than doubled the size of that levy.</p>  <p>  In regard to water treatment and developed sites, I am meeting officials today in regard to a couple of investment projects that are under way with Irish Water and some priorities that need to be reset to ensure there are no delays in development because of Irish Water connections or responsibilities not being met, either by that body or by the local authorities, following which I will update the House on the matter.</p></speech>

Currently, there are 15 whole-time equivalent vacancies in the maternity unit.  I appreciate that given the nature of this unit, it is difficult to predict how busy it will be on any given day.  According to reports, last week there were insufficient birthing suites to meet need, including a number of emergency cases.  The midwives and nurses in this unit are beyond amazing.  They dealt with the situation and the care they provided was top class.  Demand for this service is ever increasing, with people from all over the region seeking to access it.  At the very least, the vacant posts need to be filled without further delay.</p></speech>

I appreciate that a carer's allowance application takes longer to process owing to the level of documentation to be assessed but carer's benefit applications are based on PRSI contributions and medical evidence and, therefore, should be processed quicker.  I have been contacted by a constituent who was granted carer's benefit and was hoping to return to work this month but, sadly, her husband is sicker than they had wished for and she must remain at home longer to care for him.  In early July last, she submitted new medical evidence in support of her application and to date she is still awaiting clarification on it and her payment has ceased.  The Minister's response will be to submit the constituent's details but that is not good enough.  Every Deputy has a list of constituents who have been waiting up to four months for decisions on carer's allowance and carer's benefit applications.  This is too long given the people who have given up their jobs to care for their loved ones are in receipt of no payment while they wait.</p></speech>

Yesterday, families gathered outside the Attorney General's office expecting an announcement, which they had also expected over the summer months.  These families have been seeking answers and an independent inquiry for a long time.  They are getting older and they want answers now.  I hope that the response of from the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will be positive news.</p></speech>

I will give some figures in this regard.  According to the HSE, on Tuesday of last week the number of delayed discharges was 745, which is more than the number of people on trolleys.  At that point, approximately 360 of that 745 had been waiting more than a month for discharge and 79 people had been waiting for more than six months.</p><p>Let us picture it.  Last Tuesday, 79 people who had been ready for discharge before St. Patrick's Day were still in hospital.  The problem is significant.  In previous replies, the Minister mentioned increased capacity.  These people want to move on.  They do not want to be in hospital.  They want to either move home with the support they need or move to nursing homes or step-down facilities.  There are people on delayed discharge for extended periods, not a day or two, which I could understand.  Half of that number - 360 people - had been waiting for discharge for more than a month while 79 people had been waiting for discharge since before St. Patrick's Day.</p></speech>

Home care supports provide the wraparound service that means people are not in acute hospitals and long-term nursing homes.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions not just with the Minister but with the Taoiseach.  People in Cavan-Monaghan are waiting months and somebody has to die before home care supports are put in place.  What will this Government do to take those 325 people off the waiting list for these supports?  </p></speech>

By July, that figure had increased to 227, which is an increase of 122 or 120%.  I am sure the numbers have not fallen since then.  Yet I speak to people employed full time by the HSE to provide home care whose hours are being reduced.  I cannot understand it.  It is time for the Government to say whether it will provide home help because that seems to be the way it is.  No hours are being provided in Sligo-Leitrim for anybody.  As Deputy Curran noted, people have been in hospital for months and cannot get out of there because they have nobody to mind them.</p></speech>

I know of several people who are waiting for home help.  One lady tried to come home but could not manage on her own and went back into hospital, which added to the hospital's waiting list.

He is doing things he was not asked to do such as giving people a third chance before they are arrested if they have drugs in their possession.</p></speech>

Despite the fact that an electoral commission has been promised since 2006 and was recommended by a joint Oireachtas committee in 2016, it is not part of the Government's priority legislation for publication.  The Taoiseach has indicated that four by-elections will take place at the end of November, the Government has also published a Bill for a referendum for extending voting rights in presidential elections and there will be a general election as soon as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin stops supporting the Government so the establishment of an electoral commission would be an important step in modernising an outdated system and maximising citizens' participation.

Currently, it is effectively illegal to use electric scooters on Irish roads and such vehicles are liable for seizure by garda&iacute;.  Furthermore, there is a requirement that these vehicles be taxed and insured as mechanically propelled vehicles, which is an onerous and expensive requirement.  This Bill removes the requirement for electric scooters and electric bicycles to be taxed and insured by altering the definition of mechanically propelled vehicles.  </p><p>The Bill permits the use of electric scooters on Irish roads but also lays down a number of fundamental safety requirements.  First, the Bill sets a maximum speed of 25 km/h for electric scooters and requires all electric scooters to be fitted with a speed limitation device designed to prevent the vehicle from exceeding the limit.  This speed limit is similar to those laid down in other European countries that have successfully regulated for the use of scooters.  The Bill also makes it an offence to ride an electric scooter without due consideration for the safety of others, which is an offence for bicycle users, so the regulations are very similar.  This places a requirement on all users to drive in a manner that is safe and respectful of all other road users.  Electric scooters users would also be required to wear helmets at all times on public thoroughfares.  </p><p>The Bill will amend the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 to expand the remit of the Road Safety Authority to make recommendations regarding the safe use of electric scooters.  Furthermore, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would be empowered by the Bill to make any necessary regulations regarding electric scooters.  This would enable the Minister to draw up safety guidelines and laws relating to scooters as new research emerges.  We have seen the increasing use of scooters and it is incumbent upon us as legislators to provide a statutory footing where they can be used safely and successfully.  I commend the Bill to the House and hope all Members will be in a position to support it.  </p></speech>

This Bill will ensure that residents of private nursing homes receive their full medical card entitlements and have recourse should a nursing home attempt to deny them those entitlements. </p><p>I have heard numerous cases in my constituency clinics where elderly people are being charged for basic medical equipment and therapies, despite having a legal entitlement to them free of charge under the medical card scheme.  Items and services for which people have been charged include wound dressings, prescription pain-killers, bed sore creams and services such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  In one case, a resident was billed more than &euro;2,500 for these services over a 15-month period.  This is an outrageous cost to families. </p><p>To add insult to injury, there appears to be little or no accountability on the part of nursing homes that engage in these practices.  There is no recourse for residents or their families.  I have spoken to families who have contacted nursing homes to question these charges and who told me that they were told in no uncertain terms that if they did not like the services offered, they could go elsewhere.  This is unacceptable.  Telling residents to pack up and go elsewhere is an outrageous response.  </p><p>Earlier this year, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, raised this issue publicly when it published guidelines for nursing homes outlining the entitlements of residents.  During media interviews on the matter, the CCPC said that it could not investigate individual complaints as it did not have those powers under the law.  Our Bill aims to fill the gap relating to which body is responsible for investigating individual cases and to clarify and strengthen existing laws and regulations. </p><p>This Bill has three main functions.  First, it will require the Minister for Health to compile a report on the effect that putting existing regulations on a statutory footing would have.</p><p>If the report shows that giving residents their medical card entitlements would impose a cost on the State, then so be it.  The State cannot give people an entitlement to certain medical items and treatment and then decide it does not want to pay for them because that person happens to live in a nursing home rather than their own home.  </p> <p> Second, the Bill will give the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, additional powers and oblige it to investigate complaints against a nursing home by residents or their families.  Third, the Bill creates a new offence under the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 where a contract of service between a nursing home and a resident is broken.  The Bill also puts forward penalties that are in line with the Companies Act 2014.</p></speech>

They are all procedures associated with the provisions of the medical card scheme and therefore should not have to be factored into the planning of care. </p>  <p>  This Bill also seeks to tackle the very obvious question that arises out of the current situation, namely, how is this allowed to happen?  It establishes a clear line of responsibility and commensurate punishments for the breach of existing regulations.  This may not appear to be of equal importance to issues such as the review of the fair deal scheme or the efforts to have home care provided on a statutory basis.  It is, however, a matter of making rights real.  Rights contained in existing primary and secondary legislation that are rendered inert by a lack of regulatory bodies to enforce them are effectively rights denied. </p>  <p>  This Bill will identify and empower those entrusted with ensuring these rights are real and exist for patients of nursing homes.  We remain committed, in the words of the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to the care and support of Ireland's aging population, "who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration".  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I thank his Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann for the good work they have done in recent weeks in north Cork and in Ballyduff in the Minister of State's county of Waterford.  Issues regarding school bus transport have been resolved in those areas.  A similar issue remains in Mallow, however, regarding the St Joseph's Road catchment area for children attending Gaelscoil Thom&aacute;is D&aacute;ibh&iacute;s.  In areas such as Castlelands, for example, more than 20 children have been left without public bus transport.</p>  <p>   Gaelscoil Thom&aacute;is D&aacute;ibh&iacute;s, Mallow, is a successful school in north Cork.  It continues to grow and attract increasing numbers of pupils.  One of the provisions of its planning approval some years ago was a stipulation that there be an attempt to reduce the number of children dropped off at the school by parents.  Providing school bus transport would be one solution.  School bus transport was available to all the families who had children going to the Gaelscoil in recent years.  This year, for some reason, there has been an increase in the number of pupils seeking to avail of the public bus transport on this route.  We now have a scenario where parents have to change their work practices and times and to cope with other forms of disruptions in order that they can get their children to school, which in the case of many such parents is more than 2.5 km away.   </p>  <p>  This has been a concessionary area in previous years.  We must, however, think outside of the box regarding restrictions and qualifications.  In the past week, climate change has been the topic of much conversation, as has a reduction the amount of transport on the roads but to do that will mean having buses.  I ask the Minister of State to intercede in this case because it is an emergency.  This concerns primary school children aged up to 11 or 12 years.  The Minister of State has interceded in similar situations recently and made money available for areas including north Cork and west Waterford.  I commend him on doing that.  He needs to intercede in this case as well because this situation has been causing major problems for parents in recent weeks.  I am still receiving telephone calls from parents.  They are telling me that they have had to give up their day jobs because their working hours conflict with the need to bring their children to school.  </p>  <p>  The other major issue is the general traffic disruption caused in Mallow.  It is not an easy town to get through.  There have been recent repairs to the bridge in the town, which created unnecessary extra journey times.  We must remember that Mallow is a big town.  I will leave this issue in the hands of the Minister of State after I make one final point.  Bus companies find it hard to get people to work for just a few hours a day.  One of the restrictions affecting Bus &Eacute;ireann is that the company will not employ drivers who are older than 70.  That is a major anomaly.  We are encouraging people to work longer and yet this type of restriction exists.  The Minister of State knows that it is difficult to get people to take up a job for only a few hours a day.  That type of employment would, however, suit elderly people who are capable and keen to drive our buses.  I ask the Minister of State, therefore, to intercede in this issue regarding Gaelscoil Thom&aacute;is D&aacute;ibh&iacute;s in Mallow. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500022#Z00100"><p>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this matter today and for his kind opening remarks.  Before I address the specific issue, I will provide Members with an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources and finance, to support the transport to and from school, particularly in rural areas, of children who reside far from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In the 2018-19 school year, more than 117,000 children were transported to primary and post-primary schools twice a day throughout the country, including almost 14,000 children with special needs, in 5,000 vehicles.  A total of 100 million km a year were travelled at a cost of more than &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>  Believe it or not, the scheme is regarded as being one of the best in Europe.  All eligible children, including children with special needs, for whom the scheme is designated are carried through this school transport system at a very reasonable cost.  A primary school child is transported twice per day at an annual cost of &euro;100.  A value-for-money review carried out by an independent group stated the cost would be more than &euro;1,200 per year by car.</p>  <p>  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  Children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the current school year where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport but who completed the application process on time are considered for any spare seats that may be on the bus.  Where the number of applications for school transport exceeds the number of spare seats available, tickets are allocated using a general selection process.</p>  <p>  On an annual basis, Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for non-eligible children after all eligible children have been accommodated on school transport services.  This exercise normally takes place after the closing date for receipt of payment, with a view to ensuring maximum use of capacity of school bus services.  This cut-off point is necessary in order that effective planning of routes and allocation of tickets can take place in a timely manner in advance of the start of the school year.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that a number of children attending the school referred to by the Deputy were not allocated a ticket for the 2019-20 school year due to not having completed the application or payment process within the timeline or who were unsuccessful in the allocation of concessionary transport.</p>  <p>  The very good scheme for eligible children and children with special needs was put in place by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Rather than leave a few spare seats on a bus go empty, children who were not eligible were allowed travel on it.  They received concessionary tickets.  At the beginning, there were 300 such tickets and now there are 28,000.  The scheme is creaking at the seams.  Every year we invest substantial money in the scheme.  This year, we were successful in getting an extra &euro;1 million from the Department of Education and Skills and we are looking for more money in the budget.  The problem we face is that every year, more eligible children, more children with special needs and more concessionary children come into the scheme.  This requires more buses and more money.  Children with special needs require carers.  Garda clearance is required.  Sometimes a child with special needs has two carers.  It is a very difficult scheme to manage and run.  It is very complicated and over the summer months, it kept staff in my office here until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. as they ensured those who were eligible and children with special needs were accommodated on buses throughout the country.</p>  <p>  On the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I am prepared to sit down and speak to him to see exactly how many children are involved and their circumstances.  I have no problem doing this.  I have met any Deputy or family who has asked to meet me.</p></speech>

He outlined the positive side.  Every day, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is inundated with requests for new classrooms to be added to existing schools.  One of the reasons such requests are made is that pupils come to the school from outside the area.  Does the Minister tell those parents and teachers to tell those children not to go to that school in order that there would be no problem with overcrowding?  No, he does not.  The same approach should be taken with regard to the provision of school bus transport.</p>  <p>  Gaelscoil Thom&aacute;is D&aacute;ibh&iacute;s is in a major catchment area.  Mallow is a growing town and I accept that it is sprawling.  Payment as such is not a problem.  The Minister of State mentioned there were late applications, of which I was not aware, but I am sure this can be addressed.  One way of addressing it is to open the programme sooner, in conjunction with the schools and Bus &Eacute;ireann, to know in advance what numbers are projected to attend each school and from where the children are coming.  Then we would not have Bus &Eacute;ireann telling parents one or two days before the school opens that their children will not have a place on the bus for the coming year.  We need to overcome these issues and forward planning and forward thinking are needed.</p>  <p>  Many parents accept the circumstance.  Bus services have been working positively for a number of years.  A bus was put in place for Gaelscoil Thom&aacute;is D&aacute;ibh&iacute;s to overcome planning difficulties and travelling congestion at the other major schools in the same catchment area.  I acknowledge the offer of the Minister of State to speak on the issue but it is a problem.  More than 20 children have been disenfranchised and more than 40 adults have been affected with regard to getting to work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500022#Z00300"><p>The Deputy made a number of points, including advertising the scheme.  I have spoken to the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have often spoken to school principals.  We have a website and we contact all of the schools to tell them when the application process is beginning and when people need to apply.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about extra school buses.  If I had my way, all concessionary children would be on buses.  The scheme has been legitimately and legislatively put in place for eligible children and children with special needs.  I am not aware of any case at present, unless one or two have slipped through the system, where an eligible child or child with special needs is not on a bus.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might be aware of the rural grant.  Children who cannot get on a bus can apply for the rural grant.  The difficulty is that dealing with concessionary tickets requires substantially more funding.  It would mean completely revisiting the scheme and putting a new scheme in place whereby children would not need to go to their nearest school.  The Deputy would then be coming in here in two years' time looking for a budget of approximately &euro;300 million and certainly &euro;220 million.  The argument would then be made that all of this money is being spent on bringing a child to school, while prefabs are falling apart.  I am not stating this is correct.  I believe children need to be brought to school and I am the Minister of State with responsibility for making sure they are.  We are over budget this year.  Last year, we went &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million over budget.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has already had us in to tell us we are over budget.  I have resisted increasing the price of the scheme and I have resisted taking buses off the routes.  The reason is we are able to get all eligible children and children with special needs on buses.  I will meet the Deputy on this particular issue and if he wants to bring representatives with him I will be delighted to meet them.</p></speech>

Last Friday, we had the unprecedented situation of school secretaries going on strike.  They had a one-hour strike that morning and went on a work to rule.  They do a very important job and are the first port of call for parents.  They do the administrative work for the schools.  They are central to the efficient running of schools.  There is a two-tier system.  The minority, who are employed directly by the Department and education and training boards have Civil Service rates and conditions, while the majority are employed directly by boards of management.  There are hundreds throughout the midlands, including counties Laois and Offaly.</p><p>I met some of them at the protest on Friday morning and heard them outline the very precarious situation they were in.  They are on lower pay than anyone else; some of them are earning just above the minimum wage.  They have to sign on during the school holidays.  They are officially unemployed for 14 or 15 weeks of the year.  They clock up no pension entitlements from employment.  They have no real job security and many of them are on short-term contracts.  They have asked me to tell the Minister of State that they believe they are being taken for granted.  Without them schools would not work.  Obviously, a few hundred are employed by the Department.  They start on a salary of &euro;24,000, against which I am not arguing.  It is the basic starting rate for a clerical officer and low enough in itself.  However, the people concerned are not earning within an ass's roar of it.  Some are earning as little as &euro;12,000.  F&oacute;rsa officials have told me that there have been no meaningful negotiations on the part of the Department and no serious engagement.  It is a long-standing injustice.  I know that the Minister of State will support their becoming unionised because they have been picked off one by one and we need to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

I do not believe this situation would be tolerated in any other workplace or occupation.  The facts are stark.  About 300 or 10% of school secretaries are entitled to holiday pay, sick pay and pension entitlements.  Therefore, the Department of Education and Skills is discriminating against 90% of school secretaries in State schools.  It is ironic that this is taking place in cradles of learning - schools.  This is very bad not only for the secretaries but also for everybody involved.  Last week F&oacute;rsa organised a one-hour stoppage which was supported not only by their colleagues - the other 10% - but also by the teacher unions, parents and, most importantly, students.  It is a great anomaly that amounts to pay apartheid in schools and the secretaries want the Department to address it immediately.</p></speech>

Deputy Stanley is right that they should be unionised.  I agree that all workers should be unionised.  The staff in my office are all unionised.  I ask them to do this when I employ them.  I recognise the very important work done by these and other support staff in the running of schools.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.  I have met them and received correspondence.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year the Department relaxed the moratorium for community and comprehensive and education training board, ETB, schools with an enrolment of 700, allowing them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.  There are 91 schools in the community and comprehensive and ETB sector that meet this criterion based on the information available to the Department.  It is an initial step and has immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  They have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grants scheme was agreed to in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress which was published in 1991.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under the grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support these functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, in 2015 the Department engaged with the unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process.  The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  The arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower paid secretaries and caretakers.  For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration process has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour, which represents a 50% increase in that individual's hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.  In May officials from the Department had discussions with F&oacute;rsa representatives as part of a planned meeting.  F&oacute;rsa took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  It was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019.  The Department issued surveys on 10 July to establish the full current cost of the trade union's claim.  This is standard practice.  F&oacute;rsa's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis.  I subscribe to the view that anybody has the right to take industrial action.  We are asking that until the arbitration agreement expires in December industrial action not be taken by F&oacute;rsa members.  Officials from the Department met F&oacute;rsa representatives last week.</p></speech>

I am aware of the increase of 10% that was awarded, but I question whether the majority caught in this situation as direct employees of boards of management have received it.  I came across one secretary who was working in three separate schools, something she does not mind doing, but she should be on the same rates of pay.  Secretaries in different schools can be on different rates of pay.  They have taken on additional responsibilities such as the use of computers, extra administration work and paperwork.  New grades were created in local authorities at the stroke of a pen during the boom years.  New grades have also been created in the Civil Service.  We need to recognise that the people in question on the front line are providing a very important service in primary and secondary schools.  Negotiations held last Wednesday morning did not deliver on the issue of pay and conditions.  Having to sign on during the school holidays, the lack of pension entitlements, the lack of job security and pay are the four key issues that need to be addressed.  Boards of management also need to recognise their trade union, F&oacute;rsa.</p></speech>

That is slightly odd because this issue has been ongoing for 41 years.  If the Minister of State was to find that a colleague of his was on higher pay for the job they were doing, it would cause him grievous mental torture.  It is an odd statement for the Department of Education and Skills to make.  Some 90% of school secretaries are being discriminated against, while a further 10% of their colleagues who are employed directly by the Department of Education and Skills are receiving much higher financial rewards.  This issue needs to be addressed urgently or there will be further industrial action in the coming months and years.</p></speech>

Representatives of management bodies representing the employers, schools impacted on by the action, were also in attendance at the meeting, the purpose of which was to explore further the details of the pay claim as presented by F&oacute;rsa and the nature of the industrial action.  The Department restated to the trade union that the claim would be fully considered once the current costings had been determined.  It is standard practice for the Department to establish the full cost of a trade union's claim, including hours worked and the current rates of pay.  A survey of school secretaries closed on 20 September and departmental officials are analysing the findings.  They received 2,000 responses to the survey.  The Department is fully committed to acting on the findings.  Contrary to what might be said, it remains fully open to further dialogue with F&oacute;rsa on completion of the survey work.  The Minister and I have met secretaries and do have some compassion, although perhaps that is not the word to use.  I believe they work hard and should be paid for their hard work.  My view which I think the Minister shares, but he will have to say so is that secretaries should not be laid off for a period.  They should be in employment from the time the school opens until it closes.  Further discussions with F&oacute;rsa would probably be productive.</p></speech>

There were 81 patients on trolleys last Monday, the joint highest number ever. That figure was also reached in April and July and we are not even close to the winter which people are dreading.  I want ministerial and Government responsibility to address this issue to be taken, first to acknowledge that there is inequality in the allocation of resources for the mid-west region.  Deputy Kelly gave the figures today during Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  The region is under-resourced for the provision of beds and staff across the spectrum.  That needs to be acknowledged and addressed.  When the numbers of staff were increased in recent months, the region did worse than others which are much better resourced.  That has to be acknowledged, accepted and acted on.  Owing to the embargo in effect on recruitment, although the Minister described it this morning as control measures, there are 100 nursing posts unfilled, as well as several doctor and ancillary posts.  It has come to my attention this week that there are people employed as home helps who are waiting to have their contracts renewed, while others who have been interviewed have not been told that they will offered work.  There are patients who could leave hospital if they received support at home and get out of beds which are urgently needed in the emergency department.  All beds in the region should be opened and staffed, including in geriatric and lower tier hospitals.  Wherever there are beds, they should be opened and resourced to take the pressure off University Limerick Hospital.  We are talking to people in their eighties.  What they are going through in the emergency department is intolerable. A second MRI scanner which is urgently needed should be provided.  We should have progress in providing the 60-bed modular unit and the 96-bed unit.  We need all of these actions urgently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500024#BB00400"><p>The situation in Limerick is disgraceful for patients and staff.  It has a knock-on effect on recruitment and retention.  Working in the conditions in Limerick burns staff out and they become disillusioned.  That is one of the reasons for the problems in recruitment.  To have between 60 and 80 patients awaiting admission is intolerable.  They are mostly elderly people with complex needs.  The longer they stay in the casualty department on a trolley the longer their stay in hospital will be and the poorer their outcomes.  That has been scientifically proved.  What is happening in Limerick is adding to the torture and problems these patients are suffering.</p>  <p>  We are waiting for the 60-bed modular unit to be provided.  If everything goes well, it will be available by the end of next year.  However, the 90-bed unit is as far away as ever.  Unfortunately, there is a suspicion that the national children&rsquo;s hospital will soak up the funding for the 90-bed unit and that it will not be delivered for many years.  There is a need for immediate recognition that what is happening in Limerick is unique to the region.  As Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan said, there is unique under-resourcing and a lack of beds in Univeristy Hospital Limerick.  It is 20% down on the number of beds it should have for the catchment area that it serves and 20% down on the number of staff, nurses, consultants and other health professionals, it should have.  This is leading to long waiting lists and long delays. </p>  <p>  The most immediate problem is the provision of an MRI scanner.  I visited six patients from my practice in the hospital a few weeks ago.  Four of them were sitting on beds bored to death waiting for scans and a consultation with other doctors, while down the corridor there were 70 patients on trolleys waiting for admission.  There is a huge problem in the provision of diagnostics, staff and beds.</p></speech>

I speak on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who cannot be here and sends his apologies.  He acknowledges the distress overcrowded emergency departments cause for patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  The number of patients attending emergency departments continues to increase year on year.  For the first eight months of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital emergency departments increased by 2.9%, while the number of emergency department admissions increased by 1.7% compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country.  As such, the hospital and community health organisation mid-west were identified as one of the nine focus sites which required additional investment and support last winter.  In University Hospital Limerick there was a 13.3% increase in trolleys in the year to date in August 2019 compared to the same period last year, while there was a 5.9% increase in August 2019 compared to the previous month.  It is acknowledged that this is unacceptably high and the Health Service Executive, HSE, is working actively with the University of Limerick Hospital group to ease congestion in the hospital, with the focus on facilitating transfers to level 2 hospitals, assistance provided by rehabilitation units and community health organisation, CHO, services and the prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.</p>  <p>  The health service capacity review, published last year, highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity.  Progress has been made in increasing capacity in University Hospital Limerick.  The average number of open inpatient beds increased by 4% between 2017 and March 2019.  Since 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick, including eight as part of last year's winter plan.  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital LimerickL, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.  The new modular block will include three wards comprising 20 single occupancy rooms with en-suite facilities, two of which will provide full isolation facilities and care and treatment for patients from admission to discharge.  The HSE has advised that the enabling works are complete and that the main contractor is commencing work.  In addition, the national development plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block at University Hospital Limerick.  Capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project.</p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019-20 has commenced.  The Department of Health has been engaging actively with the HSE in planning for winter 2019-20.  In that respect, the HSE has been asked to consider actions and initiatives over and above non-funded actions, building capacity and the options available to it to alleviate the expected overcrowding.  The Department expects to receive a draft winter plan in the coming weeks.  I will bring the Deputies' other points to the Minister's attention.</p></speech>

We need him to take action.  One simple action would be providing the &euro;6.5 million required for a properly functioning MRI scanner, which would address the issue of patients occupying beds and waiting for scans for which others could be in the hospital.  No other region has such an inadequacy.  There is a need for a particular focus on the region, given that it is clear it is under-resourced and underfunded.  The health system is supposed to be fair to everyone, no matter what part of the country people live in, but we do not currently have this in the mid-west.  That is the strong, factual point we are making.  We have made it repeatedly and need a response.  The extra beds need to be delivered as quickly as possible.  One action that could be taken in respect of the 60-bed unit is ensuring the recruitment of staff alongside the resourcing of the building in order that when it is open, it will be ready and able to be staffed and occupied immediately.  They are practical steps that could be taken, but we need to pull out all the stops to ensure the winter will not be terrifying for people who are ill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500025#CC00200"><p>The issue in Limerick is much wider than the emergency department.  It appears in the emergency deparment, but the problem is not confined to it.  Rather, it is much wider within the hospital.  There is a need for an expansion of the number of consultant staff in the hospital and ophthalmology services.  One can wait three and a half years following the diagnosis of a cataract to see a consultant, not to mention waiting for a surgical procedure.  In urology, one can wait six months for an investigation when one has symptoms that indicate a high likelihood of cancer.  There is only one endocrinologist in the mid-west for 400,000 people, which diminishes the treatment of diabetes, in particular, and all other endocrinology problems.  Ear, nose and throat, ENT, treatment is a case in point, where there is a significant problem.  Limerick Regional Hospital has lost its recognition for higher professional ENT training since 2014.  One can wait an inordinate length of time just to have one's tonsils removed or grommets put in one's ears.  One of the issues that needs to be resolved is the devolution of services to model 2 hospitals within the mid-west, particularly in Ennis, where two modular theatres should be provided to allow for the provision of day care services.  I refer to ENT day care services, in particular, which are essential to relieve the pressure on Limerick Regional Hospital.</p></speech>

Deputy Harty is correct that it is widely agreed that an important part of the solution in Limerick is the provision of beds, other services and staff.  In the past two winters an additional 25 beds were opened in Limerick, including eight as part of the winter plan last year.  The new emergency department that opened in May 2017 provides modern, safe and fit-for-purpose facilities which meet the expectations of patients and their families, while at the same time providing high quality accommodation that better protects privacy and dignity.  In addition, the new 60-bed ward block was established to provide a rapid build internal solution to the hospital capacity issue in response to the health service capacity review carried out by the Department of Health.  University Limerick Hospital group has welcomed the commitment in Project Ireland 2040 to build a new 96-bed ward over the emergency department and a design team has been appointed for the project.</p>  <p>  Improving timely access for patients is part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Building on the progress made in recent years in the area, the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan for 2019, published by the Department of Health, includes a specific work stream on access and waiting lists.  In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in the action plan will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.  Progress has been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare action plan access actions for this year.  </p>  <p>  We all acknowledge, including the Minister, that the challenges we face are significant.  It is the Minister's firm belief, however, that all Deputies want to find the right patient-centred, evidence-based, results focused and sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the health service.  Investment alone will not deliver the health service to which we all aspire, but neither will reform or productivity improvements on their own.  All three actions, including the provision of additional capacity, as Deputy Harty pointed out, must be delivered in tandem if we are to stand any realistic chance of meeting healthcare needs in the coming decades.</p></speech>

The case is well known and what happened in Se&aacute;n Walsh Memorial Park has been well outlined in traditional and social media in recent days.  My party leader raised the issue of the same wetlands in the House yesterday when he called for an inquiry into the matter, to which the Minister responded.  It is now time to move to the next stage beyond what was justifiable outrage, anger, disappointment and frustration at what had happened in Se&aacute;n Walsh Memorial Park.  It is time to move to a more actionable response to determine exactly what response can be made at both central and local government level.</p>  <p>  My colleagues on South Dublin County Council raised the matter at the meeting of the Tallaght area committee on Monday.  It was interesting because, unlike in the press release issued by the council, the council officials seemed to fess up to the fact that what had happened was a poor case of miscommunications and a mistake.  They were asked to reflect this in a fresh press release, although that did not happen.  The incident shows the best and worst sides of the council.  On the one hand, the heritage side of the council demonstrated great enthusiasm and concrete, practical support for what was happening on the wetlands and in the reserve area, whereas on the other side of the council, it was clear that there was complete ignorance of what was happening.  That needs to be addressed.  If a local authority wants to retain the aura of authority for the public it serves - in this case the people of south County Dublin - it must act, not least in this case, with a degree of transparency and integrity in bringing to the fore what exactly happened.  If it has to stated it screwed up.  That would be better than hiding behind a banal press release.  It is the very least the public in south County Dublin can expect.</p></speech>

There was a murder in the area and the Garda needed to dredge it.  Silt was taken from the pond and put on grassland which over a couple of years fostered the creation of an ecosystem.  I was one of those involved in clearing the lake, removing plastic bags and so on.  I am active in the area and involved in environmental issues.  The environmental vandalism was described by one person as being like a punch in the gut.  It demotivates and demoralises not only environmentalists and volunteers who help in the park but also park staff.  It is clear that we got it wrong.  The area regenerated over the years and was bursting with life.  There were newts, bats and even critically endangered European eels.  Over the weekend people were devastated to learn that the wetlands had been destroyed.</p><p> The Minister has said there will be an inquiry, which is positive.  It was a case of miscommunication rather than a malicious decision.  Nevertheless, the environmental destruction is unacceptable and it cannot happen again in any part of the country.  Serious lessons must be learned from this disaster.  We are asking for something positive to emerge from this catastrophe.  Will the Minister confirm the investigation is going ahead and when it will be finished?  Will she liaise with local representatives on this?  Does she have a similar view in that we should learn from this catastrophe to ensure it never happens again?</p></speech>

Their colleague, Deputy Colm Brophy, has also raised the issue with me.  I was disappointed to hear of the incident that occurred in Sean Walsh Memorial Park in Tallaght recently as any loss of biodiversity is regrettable.  Deputy Lahart mentioned that the local authority issued a statement to the press and published it on its website, giving details of what occurred.  As I mentioned to his party leader yesterday on the Order of Business, my Department is investigating the matter.  We have been in touch with the heritage officer for South Dublin County Council, its chief executive and the director of environmental services.  We have requested a report on the matter from them.  Officers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of my Department are arranging a visit to the area together with the heritage officer from South Dublin County Council.  Following that site visit, I expect to receive a report from them for review.  We should not be prejudicial or premature in establishing facts until we see the report in detail.  We will then take any required further action arising from those findings.</p>  <p>  As the Minister with responsibility for the protection and conservation of Ireland's natural heritage and biodiversity at a national and governmental level, I am very aware that we are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history.  The number of plants, insects, mammals and birds that are threatened or endangered is increasing every year.  The land, ocean and atmosphere are being altered to an unparalleled degree.  The Government is responding to the biodiversity emergency and the drivers of its loss and is making progress.  My Department is working hard and achieving real and substantial results on a number of fronts, with the NPWS leading this work.</p>  <p>  We have committed in Project Ireland 2040 to investing &euro;60 million to protect Ireland's natural heritage and biodiversity.  We are now on our third national biodiversity action plan.  This speaks to the long-running commitment that this Government attaches to this matter.  The current plan runs from 2017 to 2021 and is the key national overarching policy for our work.  It sets out actions that a range of government, civil and private sectors will undertake to achieve Ireland's vision for biodiversity, which is that "biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society and that Ireland contributes to efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems in the EU and globally".</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in consultations with all Departments, agencies and state owned companies, as well as farmers, landowners, other sectors and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to set out our priorities for action between 2021 and 2027.  We will focus on the habitats and species protected under EU directives, special areas of conservation and the special protection areas designated under those directives.</p>  <p>  We have also undertaken a comprehensive range of meaningful and productive actions in recent years.  For example, we have secured approximately 17% of the terrestrial area of Ireland within the protected area network.  We will continue to increase the areas under protection.  We have invested a significant &euro;50 million since 2011 on a major conservation and restoration effort for our raised bogs.  I can make the rest of the reply available if the Members so wish.</p></speech>

None of this policy matters and none of what the Department does as guardian of the wildlife and natural habitats of Ireland matters if a local authority drives a coach and four through it by dumping on and landfilling what had become a natural habitat and wildlife area.  If the Minister cannot address this, some other Minister must do it.  The local authority must be asked how communication broke down to such an extent that one arm of the local authority did not know what the other arm of the authority had done, culminating in what is essentially the vandalisation of a natural habitat.</p>  <p>  Does a local authority require a licence from the EPA to dump silt and soil in particular spots?  This happens widely in Ireland.  Constituents have raised with me the provision of play spaces in the Dodder Valley and there are concerns that the biodiversity impact on one of those play spaces was not taken seriously by the local authority with respect to the Part 8 submission.  The ESB, which is the apparent jewel in the crown of semi-State bodies, has not responded publicly in any meaningful way to its pollution of the River Dodder.  An "RT&Eacute; Investigates" documentary covered that.</p>  <p>  The Minister's reply outlined her responsibility but she has serious questions to ask of the local authority as to how this came to happen.  I urge her to make the point to the local authority that there is serious and significant goodwill among local conservationists, who maintain that significant mitigating measures could be taken immediately to undo the worst of what was done.  Part of her response should be to indicate how that can be done and force the local authority to move to address such mitigating measures immediately.</p></speech>

I realise the Department will carry out an inquiry but we would probably like some answers on that inquiry.  How long will it take, who will be interviewed, etc?  The most important issue is for something positive to come from this catastrophe.  What can we learn from this?  We do not need an inquiry to know that one section of the council did not seem to communicate with another, and this is the result.  This came about by accident rather than design and a lesson can be learned from that.  We have learned that putting silt in an area results in a positive response in the ecosystem.  Other local authorities can learn from that.  We want a quick response from the Department on this and an assurance that this will not be repeated in south Dublin or anywhere else.</p></speech>

As I said in reply to the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I have commenced an investigation, rather than an inquiry, into the matter.  The Deputies may rest assured that I will leave no stone unturned to establish the full facts in this regard but I will not prejudge the outcome of the report.  It is in train.</p>  <p>  It is important to say this is not designated land.  It is an area where silt is usually dumped.  It is a silt deposit area or, if one likes, an occasional ecosystem.  It can create a temporary habitat but it is not a formal wetland.  The Deputies mentioned facts so we should clarify that.  I do not speak on behalf of South Dublin County Council but it should be afforded the opportunity to respond to my Department on the chronology of events and what transpired.  If I am found wanting in terms of reassurance, I reiterate to the Deputies in a persuasive way that I will take this seriously.</p><p>My interest lies with protected species, of which an unspecified number, including frogs, newts, eels and bats, are alleged to have been buried by South Dublin County Council when its employees spread silt on this area.  I stress that is an allegation and I must take it as such until I see it established as a fact.  I will be checking that and we will be talking to all the people from South Dublin County Council who are relevant to this investigation and I will give the full report to the House when I have it to hand.</p></speech>

384 children are in receipt of the Home Tuition Grant, many because they have not been able to secure a school place;<br /><br />&mdash; the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has already informed the Minister for Education and Skills that parents in South Dublin and Cork are having trouble securing school places for their children;<br /><br />&mdash; in the Dublin area, the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) schools, provide a disproportionate number of school places by comparison with non-DEIS schools;<br /><br />&mdash; in the neighbouring regions of Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 6 West, the ratio of available places to children with ASD is 1:782, while the national average is 1:100;<br /><br />&mdash; in all areas of the country there are children who travel very long distances to secure suitable school places; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Home Tuition Grant scheme application forms were published a full two weeks later in 2019 than the previous year;<br /><br />further notes that:<br /><br />&mdash; there are no official figures on the number of children with special needs who do not have an appropriate school place;<br /><br />&mdash; 22 per cent of special schools are on a list for large-scale projects by comparison with 9 per cent of mainstream schools;<br /><br />&mdash;

n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le mo chomhghleacaithe i Fianna F&aacute;il de bharr an cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar an &aacute;bhar seo inniu.  Is d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.  This issue of special education is not going away.  It is to the fore of what Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to be about in education.  It is crucial to ensure that the constitutional right to primary education, and education in general, is upheld and vindicated for each and every one of our children.</p><p>It is worth recalling how farsighted Mr. de Valera was when the Constitution was being written that this particular right was inserted.  It was not a common right at the time.  It was inserted in the Soviet constitution the year before and there were also some mentions of it in German legislation in the previous century but this was a radical departure and it remains the only socioeconomic right that is directly justiciable from the Constitution.  We should bear that in mind at all times when we talk about a child's education.  This is not like what the Corbynites in the UK are proposing in a national educational service they want.  We want to make sure that each child has their right to education, granted to them in the Constitution, vindicated in the type of society to which we aspire in this country.  There is a continued failure within our education system.  Many children with special needs are experiencing a system which was described by parents and a teacher on &quot;Prime Time&quot; as a containment policy, one which focused on containment rather than education.  That is a devastating analysis by the parents and teacher in question but it is a fact for many children in our education system.</p><p>This motion seeks to create a pathway to a system where all children vindicate their right to education through the introduction of increased monitoring, better planning for future demand and the completion of reforms to which the Government has already said it is committed but upon which it has not yet acted.</p><p>I have no doubt that the Minister will talk about the funding that he has allocated but that is the easy part.  Funding is paid by the taxpayers and provided to the Government, people have no choice but to pay and the Government allocates the funds.  The key test of a Government is how it spends and plans for that money and ensures the best value for the taxpayers and citizens of this country.  This Government is failing to do that in special education.  For example, we do not know how many children with special educational needs are in the educational system, nor how many are on reduced timetables.  We do not know how many parents failed to secure a suitable place for a child in a given school year because the Government is not monitoring the situation.</p><p>Each Deputy in this House has come across many children in those types of scenarios.  It was not difficult for &quot;Prime Time&quot; to find parents at the ends of their tethers, financially in one case, because of the special education system.</p><p>The evidence we have is thanks to the work of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, journalists and parents.  Parents of children with special educational needs, or special needs in general, are used to constant struggle, hard work and weariness, constantly fighting to obtain not only what their child is entitled to but what he or she needs to be a citizen who can partake fully in our society.  The system is failing badly.</p><p>According to the AsIAm charity, one in four children with an intellectual disability is being put on short school days, in some cases illegally.  That number jumps to one in three for children with autism.  The Minister has issued guidelines but they do not go far enough.  The Minister needs to stick to the basic premise that every child is entitled to be there for the full school day except under exceptional circumstances as advised by a medical or other professional.  If one veers from that at all, we are then veering from that constitutional right.  Fianna F&aacute;il would have a much shorter circular if it was in government.  That practice of shorter school days for children with intellectual disabilities must end now.  The Minister must do that without ifs or buts.  Every child is entitled to an education and the schools and teachers must be resourced to provide that, particularly for training.  Short school days cannot be an answer for children with learning difficulties.</p><p>Over 850 children with special needs across the country were receiving home tuition last year because a space could not be found for them in schools.  The amount paid for home tuition for these children has increased by almost a quarter in the past two years and that is a devastating indictment of our educational system.  Annually parents of children with special needs and autism face considerable difficulty securing school places for their children.  That was especially acute in the Taoiseach's constituency and is in the process of being dealt with to some extent but many of the classes in the special schools that have been announced are not yet open.  Despite the progress that is being made and despite the powers that Fianna F&aacute;il insisted would be put into the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act, not all children in Dublin 15 have a school place.</p><p>The system is too reactive.  I have met some impressive people at the National Council for Special Education but the administrative structure does not seem to be there to ensure that the system knows what is actually happening, rather than an <i>ad hoc</i>approach reacting to the latest particular child, or the latest particular problem as it is sometimes seen, which is wrong.  The issues do not even begin to cover unsuitable placements.  One parent, who lives in the constituency of Deputies Lahart and O'Callaghan, talked about how badly serviced their area is in Dublin 6 where there are 31 schools in the surrounding areas and, incredibly, only one of those schools has an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class.  There are 30 other schools, serving over 9,000 primary school children, that are without an ASD class.  That is in one part of the country but also happens in many others.</p><p>I will yield to my colleagues.  I am delighted that many other Members who have taken an interest in this motion and proposed amendments which we will consider very carefully.</p></speech>

My heart sinks when parents of children with special needs who are at the beginning of their journey come to my office - not because the child has special needs but because I know the battle that they are going through to face every step along the way in getting that to which their child is entitled by way of education and special supports.</p>  <p>  There are not enough school places, particularly in areas of rapidly expanding population.  Children in Cork are being forced to go across the city at peak traffic time in the morning, travelling for between 40 minutes and an hour to get to an appropriate school place.  That is a terrible start to the day and should not be happening.</p>  <p>  The ASD waiting lists are appalling.  The waiting times in Cork for an assessment are unacceptable.  Many children are waiting two years or more and, at the end of that, they find that there are no services.  Speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy are virtually non-existent for children with autism in my constituency in Cork South Central.  That is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Home tuition is not a substitute for an appropriate school place.  The child is missing out on the social skills, mixing with other children and all the benefits that come from that.  The Minister must bear in mind that home tuition is not a solution because it can be very disruptive in the home environment as well but, principally, it is not right for the child.</p>  <p>  I know of many schools in the area of my constituency that do not have adequate facilities.  One example is St. Gabriel's special school in Bishopstown, a remarkable school with outstanding staff and special children.  The circumstances in which teachers have to teach and children have to learn are simply not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The system is not working.  The Government is putting the money in and resources are being provided but the child is not at the centre of what needs to be done in special education.  I ask the Minister, in whatever time he has left in this D&aacute;il, to deal with these issues.</p></speech>

These include housing, health, roads, grants and care packages but the ones I find the hardest to hear about and to deal with concern parents whose children with special needs cannot get a place in a school for love or money.  Sadly, these stories are all too common because of the current system.  As a former teacher, I have been familiar with this problem for many years.  Hundreds of children in Ireland who have autism or special needs are still without appropriate school places, although it is now almost October.  Approximately 850 young people receive home tuition rather than attending school, which is at a cost of &euro;5.6 million to the taxpayer.  This is not good enough.  Schools are not only places of academic learning, but also are for socialisation and are places where children can develop in areas of emotional and social intelligence.  These children, along with the children on reduced timetables - something that was discussed at length at committee yesterday - are invisible in our system and our statistics.  Parents of children with special needs are used to advocating and fighting for their children but they are tired.  They have been fighting all their lives.  I meet them every week and speak to them by phone every day.  There is no greater love than that of a parent for a child with special needs who is vulnerable.  They want to do their very best for their children but feel they are failing them because they are unable to secure a place.  The State is failing these children.  We call on the Government to radically improve the system with increased monitoring.  We also call for better planning.  We need a five-year plan, as schools should be equipped with forward knowledge and statistical projections.</p>  <p>  Last night, I spoke to a parent whose son is in first class in a junior school.  While he should be going into second class in the senior school, which is part of the same school on the same campus, he cannot.  There are three children in the ASD unit but only one place in the ASD unit in the senior school.  The school is accepting a child who is coming down from Dublin.  The parents have applied to 25 schools but have got nothing.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

The motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, enables us to reinforce points that the Minister might be missing.  They are things that may have come across the Minister's desk but we have the opportunity to point them out to him.  I have ten pages of notes before me but I have only a minute and a half to make some salient points.  In my constituency, which includes Dublin 6, Dublin 6W, and Dublin 12 - although part of that is in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan - there was no ASD unit until this year.  Some body is not doing its job properly.  Our party leader mentioned the role of the old inspectorate to go out into individual schools and ask what they were doing could be really valuable in this regard.</p>  <p>  Many parents have referred to new schools.  This country has never had such a large school building programme but surveys of the families in the areas must be conducted prior to planning permission being given in order that schools know what proportion of children with special needs will be attending the school.  New schools are being constructed without any special needs provision in them.</p>  <p>  If a special needs child joins the school midway through the academic year, as is often the case, the time taken before the school gets sanction for special needs assistants can take months, which creates its own anomaly.  These are things that the Minister can address.  </p>  <p>  A teacher told me how she was a big fan of inclusion and how she worked with special needs children every day.  She constantly questions whether she is doing their best for them and colleagues do likewise.  She noted that while she would not be without them, she felt that teachers are being taken for granted because no teacher will leave a special needs child behind or not give him or her the chance to achieve his or her full potential.  We need more resources and more people.  I have spoken to others about access to therapy of any kind, speech, occupational and so on, and the waiting lists are shameful.</p>  <p>  I know of someone who, after being on the waiting list, was given three speech and language therapy sessions under the HSE.  The box was ticked and the person was removed from the list.  While that person might have needed 30 or 300 sessions, they have ticked off the Government's waiting list only to have to wait years to join the bottom of the queue again.</p></speech>

When parents come to the constituency clinic, one's heart sinks as one knows they have had a battle already, which will continue after they have left.  Assessment of need must be addressed in order that children can get the right help, care and supports.  Getting the place in school is important to enable them to have an education.  The statistics show that some children are absent from schools because there are no places or supports for them.  The special needs assistants, SNAs, are a critical part of the debate.  While they are important to special education, they feel undervalued and unappreciated by the Department of Education and Skills.  They go from one academic year to the next on short contracts without being paid during summer holidays.  Mainstream class teachers would be unable to conduct their classes in the smooth, inclusive manner which they do, without the all-important SNA in their class.  I ask the Minister to look at these things.</p>  <p>  I also wish to acknowledge the good work that is being done.  The Holy Family school is under construction in Cootehill.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for his visit to Cootehill to see the fantastic work being done there by the teachers at first hand.  Hopefully the Government will ensure that the school and facilities needed are delivered there.</p></speech>

I compliment those involved, including special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who we work with every day, whose level of knowledge has been built up over 20 years since special needs assistants were first brought in by the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the growth of the sector which has followed.  However, we must look at where we are in 2019.  This House has had many debates on what happened to children in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s but I challenge D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today to ask whether whoever is around in 50 years' time will be having a debate on us and on whether we did right in our time.  All we can do is ensure that we are doing right, which is what we are doing now.  There is a huge crisis right across the disability sector from cradle to grave.  There is a huge challenge.  The waiting lists for needs assessment are deplorable.  Whoever is in this Chamber in 50 years' time will be talking about the waiting lists in 2019 and 2020, and how nothing was done about it.  Assessments of needs for young kids are taking between 18 months to two years.  If they are transferred into the system, it will be 24 months before any therapy comes on stream, so that means it is heading for four years.  I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills before the 2007 general election when we were getting the international information on this, which was hugely important.  We are not taking the challenges facing our young kids today seriously.  I challenge the Minister that we should be doing more to ensure that everything is being done for kids with special needs, in order that Members do not need to have a debate in the future to apologise for previous Administrations.  That is what will happen unless we take this seriously.</p></speech>

This House must ensure that all children, particularly those with special needs, are provided with the supports and resources they need to reach their maximum potential because this motion is about each person reaching his or her maximum potential.  We must acknowledge all the school principals, teachers, SNAs and others doing such wonderful work in this area.  As my colleagues alluded to, one of the greatest problems is the assessment of need.  There is a significant waiting time of more than two years for these assessments.  There is another problem, namely the assessment of children starting school at primary level, going up to post-primary level or even moving within primary or post-primary classes, who need further assessments carried out as part of their development to ensure they get the proper supports and services.  There is no alignment between the AONs and the school being able to make the application to the Department by the set date for the additional resources and supports because the assessment is sometimes not carried out until the child has started school or is halfway through the school year.  When the child's need is then identified, he or she has lost valuable time.  The child is the most vulnerable and he or she is falling behind because of this.  It is much slower for the school to make the application and sometimes it is refused.</p>  <p>  School principals and boards of management tell me that it would be good if that could be better aligned when they are make their applications in the first four or five months of the school year for the following school year.  That is something that needs to be examined.  There is a problem with the application process to the Department for additional supports and services for children with special needs coming into the school.  That is mainly due to the AONs not being carried out in time and the lack of alignment between the assessments and the schools making their applications to the Department.</p>  <p>  Special units need to be included in new builds at the planning and design stage in primary and post-primary schools, which does not happen all the time.  As my colleague said, families and children have to travel long distances to special education units because they are none near them.  That needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  We had a serious problem with the special intervention units in my constituency earlier this year.  I thank the Minister for meeting the families involved and assisting us to overcome that issue but there needs to be a better system for the parents of the children to be listened to.  That issue went on for more than eight months and it was unnecessary.  They were not listened to and who was suffering but the most vulnerable people, namely the children involved.  There has to be more accountability and responsibility given.  People need to be made aware and they need to be made accountable for those units.</p></speech>

Their tone has not been lost on me in this afternoon's debate.  This is a serious issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants this Chamber to reflect on and debate this important matter and we are on the same page when it comes to the parents and children who are not having their needs met and we are trying to work through that.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis An Teachta Thomas Byrne f&aacute; choinne an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; inni&uacute; agus f&aacute; choinne an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta labhairt leis na Teachta&iacute; fosta.</p>  <p>  Every child is entitled to an education and the State has a role in vindicating that right.  At local level, schools have a vital role in serving their communities by being open to enrolling children with special educational needs.  In that regard, our schools have a strong track record of inclusiveness and of encouraging their students to achieve their potential.  The motion comprises a mix of current issues, including the planning arrangements for adequate education provision for children with special needs; construction of special schools; provision of funding and training; consultation with stakeholders; communications and; inspection arrangements for special classes.  The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for Government.  Currently, we spend 19% of the total education Vote, or &euro;1.9 billion, on supporting children with special needs.</p>  <p>  The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and SNAs are at unprecedented levels as is the number of children receiving support across the continuum, which includes mainstream classes, special classes and schools.  Over the past two years alone, we have added 540 special education classes, which gives an indication of the intensity of demand at this level.  An additional 1,050 specialised places have been provided this school year, with 167 new special classes.  This brings the total number of special class places to in excess of 9,700, almost a trebling in provision since 2011.  Some 125 special schools also provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs.  These schools now provide more than 8,000 places compared to 6,848 in 2011.</p>  <p>  Our policy is informed by evidence-based advice provided by the independent National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which is an agency of my Department.  Well established structures are in place to plan and co-ordinate special education provision throughout the country.  Normally, special classes are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required.  The NCSE has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs.  This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in areas with identified need.  The council works with families and schools to ensure that advance planning is in place so that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  The council also collaborates with other bodies, including the HSE, in terms of numbers of children accessing its early years disability services and Tusla's educational welfare service.  Details of the location of special classes are published on its website.</p>  <p>  There is legislative provision in place where schools refuse to make the necessary provision for children in their areas.  The motion refers to section 37A of the Education Act 1998, which gives the Minister power to direct schools to make additional places available where this is required and where schools in an area refuse to make the necessary additional provision.  This legislation provides for a series of transparent steps involving school boards of management and their patron bodies, which can lead to the issue of a binding direction on schools.  This legislation was first invoked by the NCSE back in April when it formally advised me of the need for 88 new school places for children with special needs in the Dublin 15 area.  Since then, we have worked hard with the schools and patron bodies concerned to ensure the new places came on stream quickly early in this school year.</p>  <p>  We have made progress.  A new special school has been opened under the patronage of  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire education and training board, ETB, which will ultimately accommodate 40 students.  Following the serving of notices under section 37A on 18 schools in the area, six schools have agreed to open special classes, each accommodating six students, bringing the total of classes opened to seven in the area for this school year.  A further class is required and work is ongoing in this regard.  I am grateful to the schools concerned for taking on this additional challenge and we will continue to work with them over the coming months.  Reading between the lines in the communications coming from schools and school principals, there are issues we have to meet head on relating to fears about capacity and training, and we are working with them to ensure that goes hand in glove.  The legislation is a necessary tool to vindicate a child's right to access a suitable education where all reasonable efforts to provide for the necessary places have failed.  However, we will keep its operation under review to ensure that it is effective.  I assure the House that the legislation will be activated where necessary and appropriate in any part of the country.</p>  <p>  The motion references training for teachers and information for schools.  The NCSE is responsible for advising and supporting schools on special needs.  For example, in the case of schools opening special classes for the first time in the Dublin 15 area, the teachers in those classes will receive ten days' training.  Information on funding, teaching resources and guidance for schools are published on the NCSE website.  The NCSE has established structures for consulting with schools, parents and other stakeholders.  On an ongoing basis, the council, through its national network of special educational needs officers, SENOs, engages with relevant stakeholders on the ground with regard to planning for future provision and engaging with the Department.</p>  <p>  The Department's school building programme is focused on providing the additional school places needed to ensure that every child, including children with a special need, has a school place.  This includes opening new schools and extending existing schools in areas where more school places are needed to meet the increasing number of children living in these areas.  Some 44 new schools are planned to open in the between 2019 and 2022 in priority areas of need.  The Department prioritises the delivery of special needs places and the inclusion of special needs provision is now standard in all new builds and major extension projects.  The Department's inspectorate is committed to supporting continuous improvement in the provision for students with special education needs.  The model of inspection at both primary and post-primary levels, which have been updated recently, have a clear focus on the quality of teaching and learning and on the use of resources allocated to schools to support children with special education needs.</p><p>Where a child does not have a suitable place available to him or her, home tuition is available to the family as an interim measure while efforts are made to secure a suitable placement.</p> <p> As I stated at the outset, my Department's policy is evidence-based, with the primary objective of ensuring that each child with special needs is facilitated in accessing education that meets his or her need.  We aim to make things better for every child and we are open to change and doing things differently.  I again emphasise the importance of holding a debate in this House to help us work in a more efficient and productive way.  In this regard, the NCSE is leading an innovative pilot programme involving 73 schools, which, if effective, will see the introduction of clinical supports into schools in collaboration with the HSE.  I have also requested that the NCSE review the current policy on special placements with a view to ensuring that our provision is in line with international standards and best practice.  I have no doubt that the work of the education committee, the contributions in this House and the ongoing vigilance relating to the NCSE review will help shape future direction as well.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the unprecedented investment, I am aware that issues remain.  In some parts of the country, increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system.  In these areas, some parents are experiencing difficulty securing a suitable place for their children.  This will continue to be a major concern for me and my Department.  I again thank the Deputies for raising these important matters.  I receive ongoing communication through various channels about individual, difficult issues and it is important that we be honest about them.  We are trying to build capacity at a fast rate, and have increased the number of SNAs by 51% since 2011, up to 16,000.  However, we still need more SNAs and more classes.  Approximately 30% of our 720 post-primary schools have at least one special class, so we need to continue to build on what we have been doing.  Momentum is important, but it is also important to target resources in an efficient and correct way.  I appreciate the Deputies' contributions, and the tone in which this debate has been presented because we have to work collectively to get this right. </p></speech>

I commend Deputy Thomas Byrne for bringing forward the motion.  The amendment we have tabled is constructive and intended to strengthen what is in the proposal.  In 2012, the people passed the referendum on the rights of children, and the principle that the best interests of the child are paramount in any situation where children and their supports are being discussed or legislated for was inserted into the Constitution.  The more years have passed, the more it seems that the referendum was more show than substance, particularly for children with special educational needs, as the State has failed to apply their best interests.  It is not in the best interests of children with special needs in our education system to languish on waiting lists for assessments indefinitely; for their parents to be frustrated at every turn; that the additional supports required by children with speech needs are inadequately resourced; for ASD units to be promised only for such promises to be broken time and again; and that there is a deficit in transparency and information from the Department, the NCSE and various other bodies. </p><p>The frustration felt by parents of children with special educational needs, who have to fight for every inch, has been reflected in some contributions.  During the recent local election campaign, I met a quietly spoken woman in the western part of Cork city.  She was initially reluctant to talk to me, but once she got in the front door, she did have some things she wanted to say to me.  She broke down because of the frustration of the issues she had been dealing with and the challenges she had to work with for her children.  I refer to the sacrifices people make.  Deputy Crowe told me of a constituent of his from west Dublin who is the mother of a child with special needs.  She has moved to Wexford, where there is less, though still significant, pressure on the system because there simply was no capacity in west Dublin.  She now sees her husband at the weekend and they are trying to move things back and forth.  These are the sacrifices people are making.  Over the summer, I dealt with a constituent who had been refused by ten different schools over a range of 30 or 40 miles, which covers many schools in the Cork city area.  All the units were full and the schools told the family that they were on a waiting list, or did not have the capacity, and so on.  It is extremely frustrating.  I acknowledge that the Minister is now directing schools.  However, both the motion and our amendment state that should have happened a long time ago.  We need to plan on a long-term basis the same way we do for new schools, although that process is not perfect either.  We need to plan on a long-term basis for where the capacity is required and where the spaces will exist because we simply do not have the capacity, particularly in our major cities.</p><p>The Minister mentioned special schools, which are an important component of the education system.  There are serious issues with special schools due not only to the Department of Education and Skills but also the Department of Health.  Parents whose children are in special schools have told me they were nearly better off in ASD units, because they no longer benefit from speech and language or occupational therapy services and so on.  Much of that is now the responsibility of the HSE and a number of service providers.  I refer to Cara junior school, just outside Cork city, about which I have met with the Minister, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and other Deputies on two occasions.  This school has had an ongoing issue for three or four years.  According to the National Disability Authority's report on disability services in Ireland, this school should have between 1.5 and 3.3 whole-time equivalent employees for psychology, speech and language and occupational therapies for the 66 children attending the school.  The actual allocation is 0.4 for both psychology and speech and language therapy, and 0.3 for occupational therapy.  The reality on the ground is that children who cannot speak get no access to speech and language therapy, potentially for years at a time, which is unacceptable.  The HSE needs to ensure that when these schools are established, service providers such as the Brothers of Charity and others get another allocation for the additional needs these schools have.  It is just not good enough and much more is needed in order to vindicate the promise made to the children of Ireland by constitutional amendment in 2012.  There is a serious need to act on it. </p></speech>

Caithfimid an rud ceart a dh&eacute;anamh d&oacute;ibh.</p>  <p>  Politics has failed children with special needs throughout the country.  As an elected representative, I am ashamed that we are at this point.  The opening line of this motion states: "...parents of children with special needs are facing considerable difficulties in securing school places for their children."  I would go much further than this.  As I address the motion, there are families all over the country in despair.  They are at their wits&rsquo; end.  It is scandalous and unacceptable and this Government has been fully aware of this for a long time.  Dublin and Cork have been specifically mentioned in this motion, which is understandable given the population pressures in both areas.  I stress, however, that we are experiencing a national crisis in the provision of education for children with special needs.  The situation in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is no less concerning for the children, parents, and families involved.</p><p>More than 12 months ago, I wrote to the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, regarding the expulsion of an eight year old child from a school in the midlands due to behavioural issues that were directly related to a lack of therapeutic supports available within that school.  Some 12 months later, I again wrote a letter on behalf of the same child who is still without a school place and whose parents - like so many other parents - are at their wits' end.</p> <p> In my constituency a similar case was highlighted to me recently where two children within the same family, and both with special needs, have no school place and their parents simply do not know where to turn for support.  I wish to reinforce this point. The issue of the lack of special school places is not specific to Dublin and Cork.  It includes cities, towns and villages across rural Ireland.  It demands immediate and critical redress.</p> <p> The current framework that parents are requested to follow when seeking a special school place is not working and it has to change.  SENOs cannot find school places for children if there is simply no capacity within schools currently.  The Government does not seem to understand that the only way to address demand is to build capacity by investing.  This is the case whether it be in housing, in health or for home supports.  All of these social crises demand address and this is not happening, as it must.</p> <p> Access to education is a human right.  That the Government stands over the denial of our most vulnerable children accessing their academic, social and cognitive development, is reprehensible should be a matter of deep shame.</p> <p> I have referred to the fact that the Government has been aware of this disturbing matter for a long time.  Last April, on World Autism Day, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a framework to take politics out of this issue.  Five months ago, we proposed and succeeded in getting agreement from this House to establish an all-party committee on autism tasked with developing an autism empowerment strategy within six months.  The Minister's party acceded to that request.  Provision of education was a major anchor of that motion and perhaps if steps had been taken back then, and if that motion and decision had been acted upon, we might not be looking at a situation as bad as it is today.</p> <p> I appeal, in the strongest terms possible, to the Minister to please let us establish this committee with immediate priority.  Please let us all in this House take ownership and responsibility for providing our vulnerable children with the best possible prospects for their development, and please let us stop this disgraceful situation together.  I ask the Minister to let us start working together.  What is so undoable about working together in this House in the interests of those who deserve it most?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500031#JJ00200"><p>It is a little like Groundhog Day here as we discuss the issue again of the two-tier system that currently exists in our education system for children who have additional needs.  I have two boys and if I decided not to send them to school, the educational welfare officer would contact me after 20 days to ask me why I had not sent my kids to school.  If, however, a child with an additional need is not given a place in an ASD class, or does not have the adequate SNA or resource hours and is told that he or she cannot attend school, nobody is held to account be it 20,30 or 40 days or half of the school year later.  There is a two-tier system in our education system.  We cannot address the problem unless we first acknowledge that there is a serious problem.</p>  <p>  I do not know how many motions or Private Members' Bills will have to be tabled, or how many Topical Issue debates or stories will have to be told - people's very personal stories and lives are thrashed out here in the D&aacute;il - before something is done about it.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on 2 April on World Autism Day, which related to establishing a committee.  I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle is in the Chair and I appeal to him and to the Minister, Deputy McHugh, to please try to get the proposed committee up and running.  Five months have passed and still we have had no word on what exactly is happening in that regard.  It would be a small step, but an important one that we need to happen.  It would be a cross-party committee that would include everybody.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, it would take the politics out of the matter.</p>  <p>  There is no data or information available on how many children are on reduced timetables, how many children do not have a school place or how many children have issues with school transport.  I believe that not having the data is deliberate; if the data were there and we were able to see the figures and see the reality of how many kids do not have a school place, or do not have a full school day, or how many are trekking to and from school, the Government would have to do something about it.  I appeal to the Minister to speak to the NCSE about getting the data and the information together.  The issue is raised in the Chamber time and again.  The Minister cannot get away with saying there is a problem in one constituency, one county or one area; it is a nationwide problem.</p>  <p>  There are difficulties everywhere.  It has got to the stage now where people are contacting me about next September because they are so panicked.  They know exactly the battle that is in front of them.  When one hears that a child gets a place in an ASD class, one is delighted, but that this is just the start of the battle.  It might not always be suitable and it might not work out.  There will still be serious issues ahead for parents, children and teachers.  There is the issue of access to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  In many areas - when one finally gets access to these services - a family could find that an occupational therapist or speech and language therapist might go on leave and not be replaced.  The child may go six to eight months without access to that service and regress, which is a serious setback.</p>  <p>  I say this time and again - and I am sick of hearing myself saying this, so I am sure that everybody else is sick of it too - that we have consistently failed children in the State.  We all know the stories of the industrial homes and the Magdalen laundries and yet here we are failing children again.  I believe that 20 or 30 years down the road everybody will wonder, "How did we let this happen?"  We are letting it happen and we need to decide if we are going to do something about this and address it.  The Minister will say that funding is in place but on the ground, people cannot access school places, school transport or a bus escort or SNA and resource hours.  The two things do not match up.  We need to be much stronger, not only in providing ASD class places, but also ensuring they are resourced with teachers who have training, have the interest and who want to be there doing that job.</p>  <p>  There is also significant responsibility on some schools that we all know, unfortunately, are trying to turn a blind eye to this issue.  This is another reason so many kids are on reduced timetables.  It is time we started to use the legislative powers in place to ensure that ASD classes are built.  The Minister may say that he does not want to enforce schools to do that, but I believe it has come to the stage where we have to look at that and say to those schools that it is not acceptable.  Members will be aware of various new school builds in their constituencies.  These schools must have ASD classes and it should not be up for negotiation.  They should have to have an ASD class.  Many new school builds currently do not have an ASD class in their plans, which is unacceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500031#JJ00300"><p>I would like to especially thank parents in Dublin West who over the past year have mounted a series of public campaigns through meetings, social media and through reaching out to journalists and other media to explain the story of their lives and their children's lives, and what they want in access to education, and what they want from a functioning system.  I also thank Fianna F&aacute;il for putting forward a comprehensive motion, which genuinely gives a flavour of the different problems at different stages in various parts of the country.  It is important.  This is a whole-of-life approach for the child and for the parents and family of the child.  We have to become much more realistic in acknowledging that.  I believe there has been a running away from that approach in the system.</p><p>We sometimes believe that if we partly address a problem it will be enough and we will not hear about the problem again.  </p> <p> I would like to give a specific mention to AsIAm, a group of young adults affected by autism and, therefore, knowledgeable about spectrum issues, which has been lobbying on this issue and is very much a part of what has been happening in the UN in terms of the contribution being made by people such as Greta Thunberg to make us aware of the immediacy of the situation from the point of view of children.  </p> <p> The Minister corresponded with a number of schools in Dublin 15 in west Dublin to generate the education legislation.  He will be aware of the shock of some schools, and the willingness of others, at being asked to provide additional provision.  Some of these schools are DEIS designated schools that are not massively well resourced and are dealing with a number of children who have specific needs, not necessarily all in the autism area.  I find the refusal of the Department of Education and Skills to put in place a proper schools budget very strange.  No school should be asked to give up two of its resource rooms, as happened when the Minister's officials visited two schools in Dublin West.  He will be aware that such rooms facilitate special teaching.  The schools in Dublin West often have hundreds of children in need of special teaching and, therefore, these rooms are important.  It is reasonable to request schools that have grounds and so on that they construct additional facilities but the Department needs to fund them.  Schools do not have the funds to generate the special facilities required.  </p> <p> Scoil Mhuire in Blakestown in Dublin 15 is a DEIS school.  The principal of the school set out the resources in terms of grants and so on to equip a special room.  The school is to receive a set-up grant of &euro;6,500, &euro;2,500 for loose furniture and equipment and &euro;5,000 for ICT equipment.  The Minister will be aware that if he and his wife wanted to upgrade their kitchen and all the electrics therein, they would not be able to do it with such a small amount.  Schools want to meet the requirements set for them but they are unable to do so with such small grants.  There were floor to ceiling windows in one of the rooms I visited.  I am sure the Minister's officials are aware that it is not appropriate to have such windows in an autism adapted room, which is supposed to be a sensory and safe environment.  He will also be aware that replacing full length windows costs an awful lot more than the grants being provided.  There is a need for detailed discussion between the schools and the Department of Education and Skills regarding what is required and how it can be funded.  The grant for tables or chairs is approximately &euro;2,500 per classroom to cater for six children plus a teacher and, possibly, one or two SNAs.  It is not possible to provide the type of specialised furniture required with that level of grant.  That is the reality.  If the Department knows of companies that will provide it for that amount, the Minister might identify them to the schools.  </p> <p> On training for people wishing to work in the ASD or special class environment, according to the Minister in many replies to parliamentary questions I have tabled, the Teaching Council is the body responsible but it does not recognise people who have specialist ASD training, perhaps from other countries.  The Department passes the buck to the council, which passes it to the schools, which, in turn, pass it back to the Department such that we are going around in circles.  There are people who want to train and work in this area.  The Minister has proposals to bring this area into the programme for the degrees in education.  He needs to progress those proposals.  There are people who were home tutors last year and would like to be home tutors this year but neither the Department nor the special education needs organisers, SENOs, have not yet communicated with them in that regard.</p> <p> The Minister should declare that two hours per day in a primary school is not a full education.  It is not possible with the kind of immersive programme we have for primary education, particularly at junior-senior-infants-first class level, for a child to be in a school environment for only two hours per day.  In many cases, parents are required to be in the school for those two hours as well.  This is not a provision of service.  It is a patch, which is not good enough for people's precious children because they will only get one chance at education.  I commend the Minister for the interest he has shown in this area and his desire to improve it.  We need to make serious provision for this area in the upcoming budget.  Many companies are making a lot of money in Ireland and paying no tax.  The Minister and his colleagues in government should give consideration to some of them being asked to contribute to the education sector so that we can do what we want and need to do, particularly in the area of special needs.</p> <p> We are making progress.  The Dublin West model is one that could be used in the future.  When Minister for Social Protection, I initiated a review by the chief medical officer of the Department of the domiciliary care allowance paid to families of children with autism on a monthly basis.  As a consequence of the changes, the demand and payments per annum increased by approximately 20%.  The same is waiting to happen in the education sector at primary level but even more so at secondary level.  As a country, we have focused on provision at primary level but the Minister will know that the resources at secondary level are only 30% of what they are at primary level.  The children who complete primary level have to move on to their next level of education when we have an inclusive programme.</p></speech>

This issue has been debated many times over the past three and a half years.  The motion is comprehensive.  It identifies what is good in the system of special needs provision in Ireland and the faults therein.  Like other Deputies, during the summer months I was contacted by many parents on this issue.  The stress endured by parents in accessing provision for a child with special needs is incomprehensible.</p><p>The fact that there is no provision for them when they need it is unforgivable.  This has been happening.  I do not wish to be completely negative and I note that over the past decade, there have been improvements regarding SNAs and ASD units.  I am very familiar with one unit in St. Peter Apostle junior national school in Neilstown, which is a really good unit for which there is over-demand.  It is a really good way to allow children with special needs to source education in a mainstream school.  As the system seems to be based on postcode or seems to be arbitrary when it comes to ASD units, there is a crisis under way and a need for special needs provision.  In one case, children had to wait two and a half years for ASD provision, which is unacceptable in 2019.  We must uphold a child's right to an education.  It cannot be just about containment.  It must be a meaningful education where children can flourish like any other child.  They should not be discriminated against because of their needs.  </p> <p> The financial hardship endured by parents sometimes goes under the radar.  "Prime Time" exposed not only the stress but the financial blow-back experienced by people with regard to their mortgages and their own relationships when provision was not there.  It comes down to the "R" word - resources.  I know money is being thrown at this issue but we need more money and resources.  This should be seen in the wider context of special needs provision in Ireland.  Other Deputies and I have frequently said that under the Disability Act 2005, the Government is breaking its own law.  Parents are bringing the Government to the High Court because it is breaching its own legislation, which is incredible.  It is happening because of the lack of both assessment of needs and provision of speech and language therapy, psychological assessment and occupational therapy.  It is remarkable that this has been allowed to happen in quite a wealthy country.  Other individuals have stated that provision is needed but it comes down to resources.  Hopefully, the Minister can get the ear of the Minister for Finance and tell him that this situation must be addressed immediately.  No child or family should be left behind because every child is the same in this country.  </p></speech>

Knowing how best to address the needs of children with special needs is difficult and challenging.  It is not just about their educational needs.  It includes their social and psychological needs.  Is the answer a special school, a special class in a mainstream school, withdrawal from class for learning support or home tuition?  There is also a challenge in identifying the particular need because it could involve Down's syndrome, the wide spectrum involving autism of which there are different types, including Asperger's syndrome, or the challenge of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  I am critical of the latter label being used indiscriminately to target quite a number of children.  Alongside all of that, the other children need to be educated in a calm and positive atmosphere.</p>  <p>  I know from my own years in teaching that children with particular special needs can be challenging in a mainstream school.  Some of them want to be in a mainstream class because they do not want to be seen as different.  Foreign national children can present a challenge, as many arrive without English and some also have special needs.  In the middle of all that, one finds the impact of homelessness on children.  One can imagine the terrible effects of being homeless on a child with special needs.  </p>  <p>  How can the educational needs of all children be addressed because they all have a right to education?  There is a need for real and accurate data.  There could be more information on the forms that go in from primary schools at the end of September with the resource hours on them in order that we know the facts.  </p>  <p>  We must ensure that this applies to all schools.  Children with special needs are not confined to particular areas because it has been too easy for some schools to say that they do not have the resources but X school down the road does.  All schools have a role to play.  Schools' admission policies must recognise this.  We also need a whole school approach led by the principal or post holder that includes all staff, SNAs and ancillary staff.  While there a postgraduate diploma in special education, most teachers will not have that.  As all teachers will have children with special needs in their classrooms, however, there is a need for continuous professional development.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the curriculum, particularly for post-primary schools, educational needs need to be balanced with the academic ability of the child because students cannot be set up for failure.  I know the junior certificate school programme and the leaving certificate applied play a really important role here but that is difficult in small schools.  Time is another issue.  There are times when a restricted timetable and reduced hours are in the best interests of the child and we need to be realistic about that.  </p>  <p>  One point I took from the motion and the amendments is the need for an Oireachtas committee on autism, which must directly engage with those teachers at the coalface who are dealing with this.  I will mention ChildVision, a special school known to me that caters for children with multiple disabilities and visual impairment.  It is a centre of excellence and a model for a special school because all of the facilities and services are on a single campus.  </p></speech>

I have been following up regarding CHO 7, the area covering south Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow, and the school age team.  One of the replies I received was that there are 298 children on the Dublin south west school age team waiting list, a further 18 children are awaiting transition from the early intervention team to the school age team, the waiting time for the school age team is 41 months and is growing monthly because the team does not have the capacity to safely take on additional cases and there has been no movement in the waiting list for the past ten months.  That is a terrible indictment.  Families cannot access those assessments of need, which are crucial when it comes to entering school, and are forced to get private assessments and private hearing and language therapy.  This is supposed to be provided by the State.  The Government is failing these children.  It is good to see that in many areas, groups of parents are coming together in solidarity to start campaigning for support for their children.  Parents in areas like Dublin 8, Dublin 10, Dublin 12, Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W have done this in response to the Government's failure to provide that.  I spoke to a woman from the Dublin 12 group who told me that four of the children in her group did not get access to ASD classes or an ASD school.  They are aged six and seven while there are two five year olds.  Three of them got preschool through home tuition while one is still at home.  As a public representative, I cannot stand over accepting that a child is at home because he or she cannot get access to a class or special school.</p>  <p>  I have tabled questions about Scoil Colm, Armagh Road, Crumlin a number of times.  This school building is vacant.  The parents concerned have approached the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, which has told them there would be no problem with having an ASD-specific school there.  The parents approached the principal next door where there is a special school that does not take in children with ASD.  He was reluctant.  I am trying to figure out who is responsible for deciding that an area needs an ASD-specific school.  Is it the NCSE or the Minister?  Who is responsible for it because these parents cannot get past that level?  They do not know where to go to raise the issue.  </p><p>There are some very good points here and I support the motion.  I particularly support Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment calling on the Government to immediately establish the all-party Oireachtas committee on autism, as agreed to on World Autism Day.  That has not happened.  It was supposed to be set up in six months but it has not been.  To allow a collective response from the D&aacute;il and the parties and groups in it, the committee should be set up very quickly.  The Government should compile statistics on how many children are still not in school and the number of children requiring an assessment of needs in an area in order to match those children with local school units and special schools.  </p></speech>

I wish to mention the realities of the Department's transition from a generalised education allocation model for learning supports at primary and post-primary schools to the revised allocation process we have today.  The former dealt with the assessed needs of individual children, whereas the new model allocates special education teachers to mainstream schools based on the needs profile of the school.  While this works in some ways for children who display so-called "high-incidence" special educational needs, it does not work for those with multiple diagnoses or complex educational needs.  They fall between the cracks when a mainstream school cannot support them and the nearest special school can be a four-hour round trip away.</p>  <p>  This is the reality facing a child whose mother has come to me in utter frustration at the lack of progress in her daughter's educational situation.  Despite the fact that she is unable to cope at the level of many children who have an autism spectrum disorder, the Department has classified her as having a mild intellectual disability.  Her multiple diagnoses require supports for her behavioural, emotional and intellectual difficulties, which were not provided for by mainstream schools due to the lack of training and educational supports.  This mother has been asked by the mainstream school to keep her child at home for certain activities.  Her parents then made the difficult decision to move her to a special school.  The Department's new model did not look at the way the school could be better resourced to cater for the child's educational needs.  Instead, the only option was one that was not ideally suited.  It has led to lengthy travel, which has exacerbated some of her problems.  </p>  <p>  Schools need more resources to address the educational needs of individual children within the community in order that they can integrate into mainstream schools.  Moreover, if a school cannot cater to certain individual children, the Government must make provision for special schools or special classes that are accessible within the local community.  While I welcome this motion, more needs to be done for those with complex educational needs and for children who consistently fall between the cracks and are left behind by the Department. </p></speech>

For many parents, it is traumatic to find out about these needs for the first time.  From that point on, they want to do the best they can for those children.  We need to assist them in any way we can.  Given the small amounts of money involved, we should not be penny-pinching in providing funding for children with autism and their education.</p>  <p>  Many parents lack support when their children are first diagnosed.  It is vital that we support them when they find out for the first time that their child has a little problem.  I have very little time.  There is still a delay in the provision of home tuition hours.  We are now in the third week in September.  That is not satisfactory, and I would like the Minister of State to deal with that.  That cannot be allowed to happen because continuity is very important for these children.  If there is a delay and they are left behind for even a short while, they will go back to where they were again.  In that regard, we should be making provision in July for children with Down's syndrome as well as all the other children with intellectual disabilities.  We are not doing that at present, and that is very unfair on these children.  That group of children should be entitled to July provision as well.  That is very important.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, we make no provision at all for children when they reach the age of 18.  From that point on we do not assist parents who are sometimes very elderly and do not know where their child will end up.  We are doing nothing at all in that regard.  In our county, we are left totally behind.  </p></speech>

I speak about people with different types of intellectual disabilities, little problems as we call them, as someone who is profoundly dyslexic.  I have no problem in the world with admitting that.  I know at first hand the difficulties it can create when it comes to learning.  I know that when parents first receive diagnoses such as dyslexia or other intellectual problems, it is very upsetting.  That is why the work of teachers, the early intervention of the special needs assistants, SNAs, various supports and interventions and diagnoses of the problems are all very important.</p><p>One of the most common things any person in this Chamber hears in their work as a public representative is that a constituent is looking for a diagnosis for his or her child's problem.  Parents know there is a problem.  To find a solution, one has to know exactly what is wrong.  We cannot know what is wrong without a definition of the problem.  There is one big mystery which I must put to the floor of this House.  I would love to be smart enough to know the answer to it.  What has gone wrong in this country in the past 20 years to give rise to all these various diagnoses?  They are 100% real existing conditions.  What is causing this in our children?  What is the problem?  I do not want to be alarmist but the first thing I think of is smartphones.  Is this caused by new forms of modern communication?  Are they affecting pregnant ladies and having an adverse effect on children?  I do not mean to take away from what Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to highlight in its motion.  We have to look at the cause of the intellectual problems and difficulties which our children have now but which they did not have previously.  Alternatively, is it the case that we are smart enough now to be able to put a label on everything, whereas in the past we were not and simply thought that one child was not as good as another?  Is that what has made the difference?  It is one of the mysteries I would love to know the answer to.  I would love it if people could get to the bottom of it. <i></i>I am sorry if I am eating into anyone else's time.  I wish to support the motion in every way.  </p></speech>

It is appalling to note that at the end of March, 3,568 children were awaiting a first assessment of needs nationwide and more than 850 children with special educational needs were receiving home tuition while awaiting school placement.  This is shocking.  I know the Minister of State is not the Minister for Health.  As is usual now, like when the Minister of State addressed Topical Issue matters, the Government is running scared and will not answer questions.  It is a shocking disgrace that it cannot look after the most vulnerable children and those with special needs.  I salute the SNAs and the work they try to do, as well as the schools for the way they try to cater for, accept and look after children.  The Government's record is abysmal.  It is one of absurd failure and neglect.  It passes legislation here calling for equality for this and equality for that.  Where is the equality for these people, who are mistreated, neglected and abandoned to the point that their parents have to scrounge, beg and implore to get their children assessed?  They have to put the money together themselves to get a private assessment.  It is appalling.</p><p>Members of the Government should hang their heads in shame.  This is nothing short of a national disgrace in a first-world country.  The Government should get out of office as soon as possible and let people take over who have an interest in and the ability to do something for children with special needs.  </p></speech>

In July 2017, the Department of Education and Skills informed me that it was working closely with Galway County Council on the acquisition of a site for the school.  The school is included in the Department's six-year capital programme.  That was announced in 2015 and is due to go to construction stage between now and 2021.  We still do not have a commitment regarding funding, however.  As of 8 May this year, the Minister informed me that his officials, working with Galway County Council, have identified a suitable site.  I was told that as soon as they have possession they will proceed with the architectural planning.</p>  <p>  We still do not have any progress on that.  It is imperative, however, that there is movement and that this project moves to construction without delay.  The school is currently located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the former psychiatric hospital at St. Bridget's in Ballinasloe.  We need a clear commitment of funding for this project.  The Minister for Education and Skills will be aware that there was an issue before the summer regarding insurance costs.  That was because we do not have a purpose-built school in Ballinasloe for children with special needs.  For far too long children with special needs have had to travel great distances to access education.  We now have a facility on our doorstep and we need a commitment that capital will be put in place to allow for the construction of a purpose-built school for the children of Ballinasloe, east Galway and south Roscommon.</p></speech>

It is a very poor reflection on the political system in this country that this is still the case.  Some 13.5% of people have disabilities.  That is about 640,000 people.  This group is at significantly greater risk of poverty, exclusion and unemployment because of their disabilities.  That should not,and does not have to be, the case.  Many of us in this House will have seen the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme last Tuesday night.  We heard from a family who challenged everybody who was watching the programme and, in particular, challenged the Government regarding its failure to address the basic needs of this family.</p>  <p>  Darren Milne and his partner, Gillian Bolger, have twin boys with autism, and another child.  They spoke about how they went through an entire year without any support whatsoever.  They had no school placement, no home tuition and both of the parents had to stay at home to care for their two children with autism.  That was not all, however.  Darren spoke very poignantly and emotionally about what that actually meant for the family.  Apart from the huge emotional, physical and mental drain that caused the family, it also meant that Darren had to spend long periods away from work.  Luckily, he is with Dublin bus and that was facilitated.  Spending those long periods away from work without an income, however, meant the couple fell behind with all of their bills, got into mortgage difficulty and were facing home repossession. </p>  <p>   They spoke in public about all of their experiences and it is shocking that they had to do that.  All of what they suffered came about because of the State's failure to provide basic health and education services for their two children with autism.  That is a scandal by any standard.  It should cause members of the Government to hang their heads in shame.  We talk a great deal about equality and inclusion.  A situation such as this, however, is the hard face of the lack of action by the Government and the lack of priority being given to the whole area of disability.  That is particularly the case for people with autism.  The twins' mother, Gillian, spoke about having to fight for everything.  Not only was she exhausted from caring for the children, but she was also exhausted from having to fight for every single service they needed.</p>  <p>  This story is replicated many times all around the country.  There is no doubt many families face what is, in effect, a post code lottery when it comes to accessing school places or the basic therapeutic services that simply do not exist in many regions.  The denial of those basic services results in a denial of those children's basic human rights.  This Government should be ashamed of that.   AsIAm, the very good advocacy organisation working in this area, has regularly drawn attention to these shortcomings.  I also acknowledge Mr. Graham Manning, who has done so much work in identifying the dearth of data and information about this area.  The basic fact is that if we do not measure things, those things do not matter.  This is the case in this situation.  We have put forward a number of amendments and I hope the Fianna F&aacute;il party will accept them to strengthen its good and comprehensive motion.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will also raise this issue in the budget negotiations.</p></speech>

It outlines clearly how the State is failing so many students in this country.  Many good and inclusive schools across the country welcome all children, regardless of educational need, socio-economic background or the financial situation of their parents.  We still have a long way to go, however, to ensure our schools are as inclusive as they should be.  DEIS schools teach a much higher proportion of students with special educational needs than non-DEIS schools, and many of them are hugely oversubscribed with students requiring special classes.We still have a long way to go to reach a stage where schools stop cherry-picking students because they are thinking only about the school league tables and not about the child.</p><p>It is appalling that there is no secondary school with special educational classes in the Dublin 2, 4, 6, 6W or 8 areas.  The situation is not much better in my area of Dublin Rathdown.  Many parents find it difficult to secure supports for their children in local secondary and primary schools.  I received a letter from a parent in Dundrum before the summer.  The person concerned stated that he was contacting me about his son who is five years old and has a diagnosis of autism. He stated:</p><blockquote>He currently attends a special pre-school applied behavioural analysis, ABA, class in Shankill.  He has a recommendation in writing for a placement in an autism unit in a mainstream school for 19 September.  We have tried many schools in the area and cannot get him a place.  Either the unit will not be ready for September or there are no vacancies.  We are under huge pressure.  If we do not get a place for him, we will have to break up the family.  My son and myself will have to move to Laois during the week to access an autism unit while my wife and my teenage child stay in Dublin.  As you will understand, this would be a huge problem for us in every way and living away from the rest of the family could cause him more trouble ultimately&quot;.</blockquote><p>This is where things stand.  A family is seriously considering separating and renting a house in Laois so that it will be possible to access an autism unit for their child.  I spoke to that parent, who was in tears while telling me that they are actually considering emigration to keep the family together.  They have endured sleepless nights and have been distraught, anxious and worried.  That child will be six in January.  He is still in a pre-school and the parents feel that if he stays here he will still be in a pre-school next year.  He will turn seven the following January.  It is wrong and shameful.  A two-tier system is in place in our schooling for children with special education needs.  That has to end.  Schools are an essential part of shaping who we are and who we will be.  We have an extraordinary duty of care as a State, not just legally and constitutionally but morally, to all children, whoever they are or wherever they are from, to provide them with full and fair education shaped around them and not something that forces them to be shaped around it. </p><p>It is awful for people to be made feel they are a burden, that it is a huge amount of hassle for them to be accommodated and that they should have to adapt because they learn in a different way.  This is how it feels for many children and their parents and it is not right.  The current situation is not fair on those children who are denied a full and fair education because there is no place for them at their local school.  It is not fair on their parents who feel helpless, anxious and abandoned.  This is not what our education system should be about.  Our education system should welcome diversity.  It should be based on inclusivity and be welcoming.  For this to happen, the Government needs to properly resource the provision of education for children and students with special educational needs.  I call particularly on the Minister for Education and Skills to use his powers under the recent Education (Admission to Schools) Act to ensure schools provide for the children in their areas with reasonable notice periods and the necessary levels of support.<br/><br/>In his opening statement, the Minister of State referred to home tuition being available.  All Members of the Oireachtas are inundated with emails because this is not the case.  I received an email from a home tutor still awaiting a return to work.  The email states:</p><blockquote>I was due to return to work on September 2nd but I am still waiting to receive confirmation from the Department of Education telling me that I can return.  Without pointing out the obvious, we are now midway through the third week of September and Primary Schools have long returned for the new school [year] since the end of August.</blockquote><p>What is happening here?  The system is completely broken and needs to be fixed.  As for telling parents not to worry because in the meantime they will have access to home tuition, that is not happening.  The Minister was copied in on the email.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for tabling the motion.  I acknowledge the invaluable work of special needs assistants, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units and special schools.  All of us acknowledge this and see it in our communities.  The problem is that on a regular basis, all Members of the House meet parents and children who cannot access the services.  Children are unique individuals and every day we deal with cases.  This is not anecdotal evidence or me saying it.  It is in the replies we receive.  The outcome has been home tuition for 800 or 900 children.  I have no doubt that if the facility were available many others would be availing of it.  We urgently need to invest in this sector.  Too many of our children have no access to the facilities required.</p></speech>

The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is the body charged with looking after the special educational needs of children.  It operates under the special education review committee, SERC, report of 1993.  That guideline is 26 years old and in dire need of updating to meet modern day requirements and standards.  The criteria set out in the report call for a 6:1 pupil-teacher ratio and two special needs assistants.  This is hugely outdated.  The profile of students has changed and many students have profound medical and intellectual needs.</p><p>There is no standardisation of nursing supports for special schools.  They operate on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis for each individual school.  For example, the Nano Nagle school in Listowel fought a three-year campaign to have a permanent nurse to assist children with profound medical needs.  There is a lot of work to be done.  Most schools are underfunded and require fundraising to allow them to operate on a day-to-day basis.  We need to get ourselves up to modern day standards, update the SERC report and have the NCSE deliver on it immediately.</p></speech>

Every year, many parents of children with special needs meet difficulties in securing the school places they need for their children.  In County Wexford there are lengthy waiting lists for special needs education.  This compounds an already very stressful situation for parents.  Our Lady of Fatima national school in Wexford provides an outstanding service but is constantly oversubscribed.  Its principal, Rita Waters, does a fantastic job under difficult circumstances.  Recently, a building dating from 2008 that was next door to the school was flattened to become a car park.  The HSE would not hand it over.  It was a total waste of State money by the Government.  St Patrick's special school is finally being built, under the guidance of the school principal, Lee Rogers, but it is more than two years behind schedule.</p>  <p>  There are no official figures on the number of children with special needs who do not have an appropriate place but if the number of parents coming to me every week in my constituency office is anything to go by it is significant.  The lack of special educational needs places and delays in diagnosis lead to great concern among parents as to whether their children will get the places they need.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of parents for children with disabilities.  My sister has spina bifida hydrocephalus and my goddaughter has Down's syndrome.  I am very aware of the particular circumstances and challenges faced.  No child should experience a delay to the start of the school year because of administrative issues.  There is a fundamental failure on the part of the Government and the Minister for Education and Skills to provide the necessary places for children with special needs.  Why are children with special needs not being prioritised?  Why are they being left behind?  Why must parents fight constantly to get basic services?</p></speech>

Where they do have access we hear that the emphasis is often more on containment than on education.  There are significant challenges for people trying to get into the system through an assessment of need and to get up and running.  There are considerable delays, particularly in Cork, where parents are constantly raising the issue with me.</p>  <p>  While there are places with schools where everything is up and running and working well, and it is important to acknowledge this, there are significant gaps in other areas.  Ballincollig has a population of almost 20,000.  It has five primary schools and two secondary schools but no ASD unit.  Children must travel for miles to another school, often separately from their brothers and sisters.  I ask the Minister of State to see if there is some way to focus on ensuring that in places where there is demand, ASD units are available, such as in Ballincollig.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; faill&iacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh ar ph&aacute;ist&iacute; go bhfuil riachtanais speisialta acu agus t&aacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;n ann d&oacute;ibh.

I mean no personal offence to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, but the Department of Education and Skills has a Minister and two Ministers of State and it is not acceptable they cannot be present for the debate.  When Deputy Curran was Chief Whip, a Minister from the relevant Department was present for debates.</p>  <p>  As we returned after the recess, the Proclamation of 1916 was restored to its natural place.</p><p>It is the same Proclamation that guarantees equal rights and opportunities to all citizens and promises that it will cherish all the children of the nation equally.  These words ring hollow to the parents of children with special needs who are seeking education or health services.  For some reason this country conspires to make an incredibly difficult journey even more difficult at every possible opportunity.  Challenges are put in front of parents, grandparents and other loved ones in seeking basic services in education, as we are discussing, health and across a range of other areas.  This has to stop.  It cannot be allowed to be the standard in Ireland in 2020.  We need to make the pathway much less difficult.  We need to help parents, instead of hindering them.  As a nation, we need to live up to the standards set in the document to which we all subscribe, copies of which all Deputies and Senators give to their visitors.  However, does it live out in the daily lives of the citizens of this republic?  In this case it does not.</p> <p> The State and its services are not designed to provide care seamlessly for people who give their entire lives to their families and are under tremendous stress.  The State does not seem to have a problem with therapist positions not being filled and with therapists on sick leave or maternity leave without providing cover.  It does not seem to have a problem with a lack of or having zero education places.  It is time to call halt and live up to the aspirations of the Proclamation.</p></speech>

I know - I do not look it.  At the time many of the conditions of which we are aware today were not recognised or known.  Dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, autism, ADD, ADHD, various forms of depression and so on were not widely known in schools at the time.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we have learned a lot in the intervening years and continue to learn.  We have come a long way.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I share their view that children with special educational needs should be supported to access the education system.  I was deeply involved in the debate which led to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  In fact, I think I christened it with the then Minister, Noel Dempsey.  We had a very good debate on it.</p>  <p>  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system and nowhere is it more important than in the case of children with special educational needs.  Government policy on supporting children with special educational needs aims to ensure all children with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  The policy is to provide for inclusive education and ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  All new school buildings and significant refurbishment projects now incorporate provision students with for special needs as standard.  There seemed to be some confusion about that aspect in the debate.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special classes or special school placements are also provided.  Very significant levels of financial provision are made each year to ensure all children with special educational needs can access education.  Some speakers mentioned home education.  I am told that the Department is processing applications within 15 working days.  To date, 544 applications have been approved.  Just 83 are being processed, mostly for children under six years.</p>  <p>  The Department spends approximately &euro;1.5 billion, or almost 19% of its total education budget, annually in making additional provision for children with special educational needs.  We have significantly increased the availability of specialist placements for children with special educational needs, as well as bringing more children into mainstream education.  An additional 1,050 specialised places have been approved during this school year, with 167 new special classes.</p>  <p>  The number of special education teachers has increased by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011 to over 13,400 at present.  The number of special needs assistants has risen by 50%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,950 at present.  A total of 124 special schools also provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs, including autism.  These school now provide over 8,000 places compared to 6,848 in 2011.  The number of children benefiting from these supports is also at an all-time high.  Other supports include an assistive technology scheme for students and funded transport arrangements to get children to school.</p>  <p>  The motion references the need for planning for children with special needs in the context of the EPSEN Act 2004.  Under the Education Act 1998, schools are already required to "provide education to students which is appropriate to their abilities and needs" and to "ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other educational needs, are identified and provided for".  We have a very professional teaching workforce in schools who take pride in the education of the children in their care.  Planning is a normal part of a teacher's work and planning tools such as the student support file have been created as a resource to help schools provide for their students.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has a key role in front-line planning and the co-ordination of education provision for children with special needs.  Some colleagues referred to difficulties they had experienced with children.  SENOs are available to assist, while educational welfare officers also do considerably good work.  The NCSE's remit includes responsibility for building school capacity through continuous professional development and specialist training and promoting a continuum of educational provision which is inclusive and responsive.</p>  <p>  Some of the ESPEN Act provisions which have not been commenced have been overtaken by new policy and the expanded range of supports now in place for children with special needs.  Currently, there is a particular focus on supporting schools that are setting up a special class for the first time.  The focus of professional development is on enhancing teachers' understanding of the nature of the special educational need and the learning and teaching implications for each individual student and teacher; enhancing teachers' use of a variety of interventions and teaching approaches for students based on the assessed needs of students and taking account of empirically based research; and enabling teachers to assess, plan and implement effective and differentiated teaching strategies, with a view to meeting the needs of students through individualised planning.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers in recent years.  I am sure colleagues have read many of them.  They have made recommendations aimed at developing better education services for children with special educational needs.  Policy advice reports include the NCSE policy advice paper, Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013; the report of the working group on a proposed new model for allocating teaching resources for pupils with special educational needs, published in 2014, and the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme, published in 2018.  Deputy Brassil might also look at them.  They are very interesting and make some very good points.</p>  <p>  In developing such policy advice papers the NCSE consulted widely with stakeholders, disability representative bodies and parents' bodies.  In bringing forward proposals for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the reports the Department also consults widely with education partners and stakeholders.  Following intensive consultations with education partners, a new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools was introduced from September 2017.  Under the new allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education teaching support based on a school's profile.  Schools are front-loaded with resources to provide support immediately for those pupils who need it without delay.  This means that children who need support can have it provided immediately, rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  It also means that under the new allocation model, children do not need to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.  It gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p>  <p>  The ongoing prioritisation of special education funding, in conjunction with policy developments, will see continued improvements in the provision of education for children with special educational needs.  As a Government, we are ever conscious of the need to support such children and have responded through the continuation of and the introduction of a significant level of relevant supports.</p>  <p>  Not having a suitable school placement for a child is a serious concern for any parent.  The NCSE is working with families in a number of areas of the country to resolve individual situations.  Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 has been invoked and may need to be used again.  However, the Minister's stated preference is for schools to engage with this challenge on a voluntary basis because it is the right thing to do for the children in their community.  The Department, together with the NCSE, will continue to work with schools, patron bodies and teachers in order that they can establish special classes, where required, with confidence.</p><p>We want them to do that. In that way we will continue to seek to meet the educational needs of children in their local schools insofar as possible.  I thank the Members opposite for raising these issues, which has provided an opportunity to outline to the House the Government's commitment to ensuring that children with special educational needs are provided with every opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the educational system.  I confirm that the Government will not oppose this motion but will not support the amendments to it. </p></speech>

The national ratio of special needs places to mainstream places is 1:100.  In Dublin, the ratio is 1:119.  In Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 6W, it is 1:782, which identifies my constituency as a pocket of extraordinary educational disadvantage for children with special needs.  If the national average applied in the areas of Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 6W we would expect to have approximately 94 places or 15 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms.  Instead, in Dublin 6 there is only one national school with two ASD units, in St. Clare&rsquo;s in Harold&rsquo;s Cross.  It does an excellent job but it cannot deal with the demand for special needs places in that area on its own.</p>  <p>  Why is the lack of special needs places so great in this area?  One major issue is the NCSE&rsquo;s lack of planning and its reliance on the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, to plan for them.  The SENOs get their information from schools and unfortunately, it appears to be the case that some schools do not want ASD units within their schools for reasons that are hard to explain.  It is in respect of this that the Minister can intervene under the Education Acts.  </p>  <p>  I commend the parents who fight so strongly for their children&rsquo;s rights, particularly Miriam Kenny and Alan Power, who have been vigorous in pursuing their children's entitlements.  They should not have to fight in this way.  They have a right to have this provided by the State.  </p></speech>

Since then, children's access to healthcare and housing have deteriorated and we are failing in many cases of child welfare and protection.  This evening, we are considering the failures of Government in respect of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  I met a parent yesterday evening who travelled from my constituency to meet me here in Leinster House because he was so frustrated.  His five year old boy started at national school on 2 September.  He had a full-time special needs assistant, SNA, in Montessori school but now only has part-time access to an SNA, despite the fact that two reports were submitted by the occupational therapist and the psychologist supporting his need for full-time access.  Since 2 September, and we have not reached the end of the month, the child has been segregated from his classmates on numerous occasions.  He has been sent home and it has been suggested to his parents that he have shorter school days.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing the motion before the House, it is imperative that the sound policy proposals of Deputy Thomas Byrne be implemented because there are gross failings in the system for children with special educational needs.  I have cited one example but I do not wish to name the school or the child, as that would be unfair.  I hope these proposals will be implemented and that we can look forward to a day when the rights of all children will be exercised. </p></speech>

These children need to be nurtured with special supports and assessments and a clear pathway set out in order that they can receive every opportunity to grow and be the best they can possibly be, to attend school, play with their friends, enjoy life and receive an education.  Some parents of children with special needs experience a system that seems focused on containment rather than education.  They battle every day to get the correct resources and wraparound supports.</p>  <p>  The first challenge parents and teachers face is to get the correct assessment for the child.  Schools get an annual allowance to have two children assessed.  If I were to make one request it would be that schools be enabled to assess more than two children per year.  A school principal told me recently that it is like playing God.  He has to decide which children to pick out of which classes and he has to determine which parents might be able to afford support, or borrow the money to get it.  If a child is assessed, a clear pathway can be signposted for the correct supports to be put in place.  </p>  <p>  It is unfair to the child, the teacher, the SNA and the parents, to put a child with special needs in a mainstream classroom without an assessment.  The child may be in the wrong class in the wrong school.  Early intervention is vital.  Two assessments a year in a national school is certainly not enough. </p></speech>

I wish to express my thanks and those of the parents for the great work that the school and its staff do.</p>  <p>  The best chance these young people have is early intervention.  At the moment the school is waiting for a speech therapist.  Interviews took place on 31 July and 1 August and thankfully there was a great response to the advertisement for people to work in the school.  A qualified panel is in place but unfortunately it is still waiting for the national approval to hire the staff.  We are almost halfway through this part of the school term.  It is very unfair.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure that this school gets the approval to hire the staff it so badly needs.  </p></speech>

I thank my colleagues who spoke and showed an interest in this motion.  We are appealing to the Government to get interested in this.  Fine Gael has shown time and again its lack of interest, with only a Minister and Minister of State speaking today, and the record of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills will show that too.  That is part of the problem.</p>  <p>  The only thing this Minister has done was to go in at the last possible moment to the Taoiseach's constituency, using powers that the previous Minister did not want but which we forced him to take on, to tell schools to open classes, although some of the schools were willing to do so and had classes open already.  By and large those classes are not yet open.  The Ministers have never put that on the record.  The special school that was announced is not yet open either.  The idea that this is some sort of victory for children with special needs is wrong.  Many of these children needed that school last year and certainly at the start of the school term this year.</p>  <p>  The parents in the constituencies of Deputies O'Callaghan and Lahart, as well as in Cork, Kildare and other parts of the country, including my constituency, also need schools.  The 800 or so children who are receiving home tuition or are in other private educational institutions using home tuition grants, need, and most of them want, to be in State schools with the appropriate resources.  If I were Minister for Education and Skills, I would be sitting at a table and banging it to find out what is going on for next September and trying to plan for that or, as our motion proposes, for five years' time.  That is what we are looking for, not to have the mad dash in which this Government has engaged.  It is an outrageous way to deal with children. </p><p>There seems to be no way to plan ahead, which is what our motion seeks.  The Government repeatedly tells us about the resources but that is the easy part.  It is not right, as Deputy Michael McGrath noted, that in Cork some children must travel for 40 minutes through traffic to go to school, while in my constituency, one child travels 15 miles one way and his sibling travels a similar distance in the other direction.  It adds to cost and stress and it is arguable that such children are not in the ideal place because they should attend their local school.  The Government needs to get to grips with the issue, relieve parents of the stress and ensure that the constitutional rights of all the children of the country, which Eamon de Valera rightly inserted in the Constitution, are vindicated.  Children should receive the education that is appropriate for them and to which they are entitled. </p></speech>

It was provided for in legislation in 1998, when it was introduced alongside the personal public service number, PPSN, to replace what were previously the revenue and social insurance, RSI, number and the social services card, SSC.  The clear and stated objective, as articulated in the Oireachtas at the time, was that the PSC was not to be confined to welfare services but that the PSC and the PPSN were to be used widely throughout the public services to assist people in their dealings with public sector organisations.  Successive Governments have reaffirmed the policy, both in Government decisions and through legislation.  At each stage, Ministers were always clear as to the purpose of the legislation.  Various Members welcomed the development of the PSC and on occasion inquired as to why its functionality and role were not extended further.</p>  <p>  The PSC is now used by a number of specified bodies as a means of authenticating identity.  The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged the Department's position that the main benefit of the PSC was in saving time previously spent re-verifying identity when a member of the public accesses a public service.  Although some critics have described the PSC as a national identity card, it is not, given that nobody is required to carry it at all times, nor to produce the card at the request of any civil authority such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In fact, such a request would be illegal.</p>  <p>  On 27 October 2017, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, initiated an investigation into the Department's compliance with its responsibilities as a data controller in respect of the PSC's related matters, including the legal basis for the processing of personal data and compliance with EU law.  The Department co-operated fully with the investigation, including through the provision of detailed responses to a draft report provided to the Department.  The final report, relating to the legal basis and transparency issues, and containing eight findings, was received by the Department on 15 August 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has carefully considered the report and the letter received from the DPC, and sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  It is clear to us, based on the advice received, that the processing of personal data relating the PSC complies with legal requirements, that the document retention is lawful and that the information provided satisfies the transparency requirements.  The Department sought to meet the DPC on two occasions since the receipt of the report, with a view to outlining the basis for its conclusions and seeking to clarify a number of matters.  The request for a meeting was declined on both occasions.</p>  <p>  Given the strong legal advice received, the convenience offered by the PSC to users and organisations that rely on its use, and the high levels of public satisfaction with the PSC, it is considered it would be inappropriate to withdraw or modify its use in the manner requested by the DPC.  The DPC has been notified of the decision and has indicated that it intends to initiate enforcement proceedings.  When an enforcement notice is received, I, together with my officials, will give it careful consideration but at present, my legal advice indicates that the only option available to me is to appeal an enforcement notice, should it be received.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise and respect the role the DPC plays in our society.  The issues in question relate primarily to correct interpretations of social welfare legislation.  As practice has borne out, it is not unusual for bodies to have divergent views on correct interpretations of legislation.  When that happens, as it has done in the past, it is entirely valid and reasonable for one party to challenge the other if it disagrees with the decision.</p></speech>

From the Minister's response, as well as from her contributions earlier, I detect that the only way she will comply with the directive she was issued by the DPC is if she is dragged into court, at the expense of the taxpayer.  She stated that is her only option and earlier stated it would be illegal to comply with the directive issued by the DPC, but there is no basis for that.  What reason does she have?  I asked earlier to see the legal advice and it has now emerged the legal advice did not come from the Office of the Attorney General.  Instead, it came from an external lawyer who was given the brief after the DPC had reported and who was able to conclude, in a short space of time, that two years of research meant nothing.  I again invite the Minister to publish that legal advice or at least a summary or analysis as to why, how and in what way the DPC was wrong.  I do not want a private briefing with officials in the Department but rather something that can be put into the public domain.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that a number of other public bodies, such as the Road Safety Authority and the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Foreign Affairs and Trade, have decided not to insist on the production of a public services card to access the services they provide.  That indicates that those bodies are much less certain of the legality of the matter than is the Minister.  She must also be aware of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2016 that was highly critical of the public services card, and that the report by the DPC we are discussing found, and demonstrated clearly, that many of the so-called benefits claimed for the public services card were illusory.  The report is exhaustive and crystal clear, and I have no doubt it will be vindicated legally when the time comes.</p><p>The Government's approach damages Ireland's reputation as a good location for international tech companies.  As Professor Eoin O'Dell, an expert in the subject, put it in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on 23 September 2019, &quot;A government in such open conflict with the DPC can have no credibility in seeking to ensure that such companies comply with the commission&rsquo;s decisions.&quot;  The conflict between the Government and the DPC, despite the protestations of respect and so on, creates the impression to outside observers that if a company is ruled against by the DPC, the company could enlist the aid of the Government and get the commissioner's decision overturned.</p><p>That is an unhealthy state of affairs.</p> <p> A number of other investigations are under way.  There is an investigation into the biometric qualities of the photograph on the card.  There is also an investigation into whether the independence of one of the data protection officers was compromised by a directive he received from above.  There is a draft report on that matter and my information is that it finds that person's position was compromised and the Department is at fault.  In view of the detailed report from the Data Protection Commissioner, could the Government not cease the practice of allowing public bodies to insist on the production of a PSC for essential public services?  None of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Road Safety Authority is insisting on this so why should other public bodies insist on it?</p> <p> The Minister quoted at length this morning about the popularity of the PSC.  I agree and I do not deny for a moment that the card is popular.  Many people find it useful but why must it be mandatory?  This question has not been answered.  Will the Minister specifically address it in her reply?  If somebody can produce the requisite proofs to get a passport or whatever else, why is it necessary to go through the process and hand over the data to obtain a public services card before having to produce it?  There are many jurisdictions in Europe with an identity card but the systems operating in them have safeguards that are much more secure than anything in this country.  I ask the Government to cease this headlong rush towards what in effect is a national identity card.  There must be a proper debate on this in the House rather than statements limited to five-minute contributions.  That should happen not only in political spheres but in civic society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500040#SS00200"><p>This morning, during Question Time, the Minister rhymed off examples of how the PSC is so convenient, citing the 70,000 citizens who used the card to apply for passports while failing to mention the fact that they had no choice but to apply for the card if they wanted to get passport.  Other examples cited included further services that could not be accessed without a card, including SUSI, the National Driver Licence Service and the national childcare scheme.  It is not so much choosing the public services card for convenience but rather having no other option.  It was in no way convenient for people needing to apply for a passport to first have to apply for and wait to get a PSC and it did not result in their application being processed any faster; moreover, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated that introducing the card as a mandatory requirement for all passport applications would have a &quot;significant negative impact&quot; on processing times.</p><p>I welcome the move by that Department to remove the card as a requirement to apply for a passport, as was the case in some instances.  The Department clearly does not share the confidence of the Minister and the Taoiseach in the legality of the card beyond social welfare supports.  I also welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments that the card will not be a requirement under the new national childcare scheme.  I understand the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is exploring an alternative to the card, albeit late in the day.  The Minister might be content with the position she has taken but other Departments are clearly not as content.</p><p>Every time she talks about the card, she mentions high levels of satisfaction based on a survey of 1,000 people.  This tiny sample equates to &quot;strong public support&quot; according to the Minister but a survey does not excuse illegality.  Convenience is not an excuse for the Government to violate a citizen's right to privacy.  Popularity is irrelevant when required use of the card has been found to be illegal outside the Minister's Department.  The Department has argued to the DPC that there is<b></b>&quot;no evidence of dissatisfaction with the SAFE process and public services card&quot; but this is contradicted by the Data Protection Commissioner in her report and a long list of media reports.  The Minister knows that this statement is untrue.  Her Department received complaints, along with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Foreign Affairs and Trade, and issues came to light with citizens who were adopted and who were unable to access the card without providing an adoption certificate.  There were long delays for people applying for the card in order to be able to apply for another service.  Instead of making access to public services easier, the card excluded people from accessing basic public services and cut people off from their legal entitlements where they did not have a public services card.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the despicable attitude of the Minister and her Department towards the Data Protection Commissioner by threatening legal proceedings when she did not get her way on seeking additional time to respond to the draft report.  The Minister sent 470 scanned pages to the commission as a response and has continuously raised the fact that the commissioner has refused to meet her as requested to discuss the report.  She has been corresponding with the Data Protection Commissioner on the matter for over two years.  We have seen the correspondence and the Minister was given the opportunity to respond to her findings in the draft report.  It was not enough and nothing provided to the commissioner made a difference to her findings.  It is clear she has no intention on backing down from her position and I hope she knows the consequences if she is wrong.</p><p>The Minister has stated that her only option is to appeal any enforcement notice issued by the Data Protection Commissioner, which is fundamentally wrong.  It will expose the taxpayer to serious financial penalties and legal costs.  There is another logical option available, which is to abide by the findings of the commissioner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500040#SS00300"><p>I will start by reading from the report of the Data Protection Commissioner.  It states, "The law does not confer power on a specified body to insist upon the production of a PSC for the purposes of a transaction with it where a person does not already have one."  This means that if a person is conducting a transaction with such a body, that person does not legally have to agree to have the data of the Department of Employment and Social Protection used to get a PSC for that transaction.  The body cannot refuse to deal with the person because he or she does not have a card.  The report indicates the indefinite retention of personal information by the Department is illegal and the Department is breaking the law by not informing people of how information kept by one public body may be shared to another.</p>  <p>  The Minister is refusing to accept the ruling of the commissioner and is prepared to go to court with public money to contest that ruling.  To most people, that seems like a fairly sound judgment on the misuse of data from individuals in the country.  It is probably simple enough to adjust this if she examined other legal means rather than going through the courts.  This will not make her very popular and, needless to say, there will be much public money spent on this exercise.  The big questions are why is the Minister doing this and why is she persisting with this?  There were other cases where she was warned that the card did not comply with the law.  According to her, the commissioner is wrong and she must take the commission to court on that basis.</p>  <p>  We can look at how the DPC has been beefed up quite seriously.</p><p>Its annual budget grew from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;15.2 million in 2017.  Over the same period, staff numbers grew from 31 to 180.  That was a serious investment in the role of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Minister is about to tell the commissioner that she does not accept her recommendations, she is taking her to court and is unwilling to believe her findings.  The Minister is not telling us why, only that she has legal advice that counters the commissioner's opinion.  On the other hand, there must be other options open to her but she is refusing to take them.  I contend that the reason for that is that this State, this Government, is bent over backwards to send a message to the data corporation giants across the world that they should open headquarters in Dublin because the regulations are lax and the taxes are low.  Those companies can do what they need to do because low-touch data regulation will be the order of the day for Google, Facebook, LinkedIn or any of the other tech giants based in Ireland.</p> <p> The Taoiseach addressed the digital summit in Dublin last week and many of the giant tech companies were present.  In that address, he extolled the virtues of the digital revolution and a keynote speaker, one of the heads of Google, commended the Government on its tremendous leadership on digital policy.  That is not apparent from what the Government is doing at the moment.  The Government is signalling to the giant companies that it is okay and they are in safe hands if their data protection issues go wrong.</p> <p> The Minister is undermining the office of the data protection commission and the general idea that data protection is important and, indeed, she may embolden the giant technological corporations to refuse to comply with data protection concerns in the future.  It is clear that there are other avenues open to the Minister.  She needs to explain clearly why she is contesting the finding of the commissioner.  She must tell the House not just that she has legal advice that disagrees with the commissioner but what that legal advice is telling her.  The Data Protection Commissioner is very clear that people cannot be forced to accept this card they have been told they must have it if they want to get a passport, driver's licence or other day-to-day necessities.  The Department cannot indefinitely hold on to the personal information.  The Department is breaking the law.  The Minister says that is not the case but has not told us why.  It is outrageous and there must be a political reason behind it.  That reason is to signal to giant tech corporations that they are in the safe hands of a Dublin Government, led by Fine Gael, which is willing to spend public money needlessly and ignore the advice of the independent data commissioner.  It is an outrageous decision but the Minister has time to pull back from it and she should.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500041#TT00200"><p>I sought a copy of the Minister's speech but none was available so I am not 100% au fait with its contents, although I heard her refer to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If one is referring to the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is a duty to read all of his report and there are 15 pages in that chapter.  When I hear somebody quoting the Comptroller and Auditor General, without looking at all of the relevant chapter, I must take them to task.  His report points out that a key element in project planning is the development of a business case, setting out the objectives to be achieved and explaining the basis for the decision to proceed.  There is no single business case documented for the public services card, PSC.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is very fair and says that elements of a good practice business case were included in several documents; however, there were a number of omissions or partly-addressed matters.</p>  <p>  The conclusions of the Comptroller and Auditor General are also interesting and are covered in the data protection commission report, to which I will come.  There was a contract for three million public service cards to be delivered.  It was originally intended, the Comptroller and Auditor General states in his conclusion, that three million public service cards would be produced by the end of 2013.  That did not happen and I am not sure what happened about that breach of contract but, by the end of June 2016, that amount had reduced to two million and it was clear that target would not be reached.  The Department, at that stage, expected the cost to be &euro;60 million to develop and issue the cards.  That did not include activating or renewing them and those were the costs applied when this chapter of the report was done in 2015 or 2016.  The &euro;60 million was to apply up to the end of 2017.  The Minister might update us on the total cost to date and the future cost envisaged and whether a business case has been done in the meantime.</p>  <p>  The report of the data protection commission quotes some of those facts from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am not sure whether I am more shocked by the findings of the commissioner or the reaction of the Government because they both shock me.  I have read the report and some of it with difficulty because it is a full report.  The Data Protection Commissioner tells us that the introduction of the public services card has implications for all members of the public in data collected, required, stored and shared and so on.  It is not only about privacy but also about control and foreseeability, that the person knows and has some control over the information being collected.</p>  <p>  Prior to this, my colleagues and I repeatedly raised our concerns about this card.  We were derided, laughed at and, at best, ignored.  It has taken this very detailed document to outline the concerns.  There were significant gaps in the legal basis.  There was no legal basis under the Acts for the Minister's Department, or any other Department, to process personal information.  It would be helpful if the Minister would listen when she is finished having a chat because I have only a few minutes and this is an extremely serious issue.  The report also stated that the blanket retention of information is not acceptable and that there are huge problems over transparency and so on.  </p>  <p>  How will I use the minute and a half I have left to get through to the Minister?  Rather than trying to rush through it, let me say that a sensible Government would realise that the concerns raised by those of us who were put on notice by organisations outside the D&aacute;il have now been set out clearly in this report from the commissioner.  A wise Government and Minister would look at that report and ask what they can do and take it on board to improve the system.</p>  <p>  I see not only denial but an arrogant justification.  The response of the Department was nothing short of contemptuous when it gave back some 700 unpaginated pages in response to a draft report.  The Minister had that draft report in August 2018.  She was on notice for years before the data commission, or whatever it was called at the time, had serious concerns.  Each year, in its annual report, it put the Minister on notice that it was concerned about the functional creep, the failure to outline a policy and the failure of legislation.  The Minister has made much play of the legislation.  I do not have the time to tell the Minister how many amendments have been made to the legislation in a piecemeal, fragmented fashion.  The office of the commissioner was obliged to put a consolidated version together and publish it on its website to help the public to, in some way, understand what was going on.  The Department subsequently decided to publish an informal consolidated document.</p>  <p>  At this stage, all I can do is use my voice in the D&aacute;il to say it is contemptuous of democracy for a Government to proceed in this fashion.  It has the most serious implications for us when we go out and ask people to believe us on the street.</p></speech>

In fact, as she noted in her report, it involves a far broader area of law that in many cases have less to do with privacy, as the term might commonly be understood by people, including me, and more to do with how people exercise control over their own information.  That highlights the key issue for me, quite apart from the estimated cost of the card project to date of around &euro;60 million.  The commissioner also highlighted another extraordinary fact that has been commented on little, namely, that no public sector body has invested in the technology capable of reading the chip that contains the encrypted elements of the public sector identity dataset on the card.</p> <p> It has been bizarre to watch the very public squabble between the Data Protection Commissioner, the Minister and the Department, it seems each taking their own separate view, although I suppose that is not bad.  It seems the Government has a habit of pushing ahead with projects that may have a shaky legal basis.  I understand new smart CCTV camera schemes which have the potential to provide for facial recognition have been introduced in cities such as Limerick and towns such as Duleek in County Meath.  Some 14 towns in County Limerick are to have 44 smart CCTV cameras, the information from which will be linked with data from environmental footfall sensors, as well as number plate recognition systems.  As a result, the Data Protection Commissioner has stated her intention to appoint a special investigation unit later this year to conduct a comprehensive nationwide investigation into CCTV camera schemes.  The Minister might tell us if it is another project that is doomed to fail?</p></speech>

I refer not only to what has happened with the public services card but also to more far reaching issues which have not yet come to light.  The simplest things we deal with in day to day inquiries involve people's sensitive information.  It is one thing every public representative in this House has, whether it be names, PPS numbers, dates of birth, personal details and other information people living in their houses would not have, but we have it as part of our work.  We need it.  In our interactions with the Department of Employment and Social Protection, for instance - it could also be the Department of Health - we must discuss people's very private business.  Every one of us is responsible in the way we hold and store that information.  However, I can foresee difficulties that we do not yet realise and it is all due to data protection.  It is the big elephant in the room or the monster that is out of control.  It will be problematic and cause major difficulties.  It will disrupt us in trying to do our job properly to help people and communities.  I can see it being a big problem for us in the future.  How we deal with it will be a problem for all of us.</p></speech>

In some of it she repeated mantras about access to public services.  However, it is important to note what the Data Protection Commissioner said that instead of it being an enabler for citizens to receive their entitlements, the public services card was being used as an impediment.  We need to pay attention to this.</p><p>The Minister also said it was not a national identity card.  If it will be required to apply for public services - it may have other uses, something highlighted by the Data Protection Commissioner i it will <i>de facto</i>become a national identity card by stealth.  If we are to have a national identity card, let us have a debate on the issue and consider the legislation that would be required.  The report sets out clearly that there is no legal underpinning for the card.</p><p>The card features a chip, yet no public sector body has invested in technology capable of reading it.  There may be incorrect information on the card, yet people are not in control of this information that is being held on them by public bodies.  Anyone seeking a public services card must provide forms of identification such as utility bills.  That is understandable.  What is not understandable is the Department's need or desire to hold onto these validation documents instead of destroying them.  As data controllers, we are all required to destroy information we do not require.</p><p>Fears about what data might be held on file by the Department are very real and well founded.  Today's society is acutely aware of the value of data and the importance of being digitally aware.  This is National Fraud Prevention Week during which there have been advertisements on television and radio warning people to be careful with their data.  </p><p>I have asked about 70 questions about this issue in the past few years and engaged with the Minister in the House on various aspects of it.  There is a feeling a dismissive attitude has been taken towards concerns that have been raised by me and others and which were subsequently raised in the Data Protection Commissioner's report.  We await hearing the Data Protection Commissioner's view on whether photographs and how they are taken and stored are biometric data.  </p><p>The job of legislators is to look below the surface.  The card might be presented as being useful in accessing public services, but what if something goes wrong?  That is where our scrutiny is important.  State bodies are key targets for hacks and data breaches as they possess so much valuable data on citizens.  We need the upmost security in that regard.  Holding onto data that are not necessary is part of this question.  We must also be mindful of the State's exposure for losses incurred.  Has a contingency amount been set aside if the State is exposed?  What consideration was given to this aspect of the scheme?  </p><p>I reiterate points raised by others, including the dissatisfaction felt by people who believed they had no choice.  To use the Minister's words, it might not have been compulsory but it was mandatory.  People cannot access services in the Department of Employment and Social Protection without it.</p><p>It is mandatory from that point of view but it is not compulsory to have it.  It is not compulsory if one does not want the payments.  This is a serious report that has been presented.  The Data Protection Commissioner has been hugely undermined by the Department's response and this has a long way to play out.</p></speech>

She mentioned this policy was instigated by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Is she aware the legislation we introduced is the legislation which the Data Protection Commissioner found does not provide any legal underpinning for extending the public services card to other bodies?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister accept the open conflict between the Government and the Data Protection Commissioner sends out a bad signal to people looking in from outside the country?  It sends a signal that the Data Protection Commissioner is not particularly well got with the Government and it sends a signal that if people locate in this country and the Data Protection Commissioner rules against them, they can enlist the Government to help them out.</p>  <p>  Does it remain the Government's policy to extend the public services card on a mandatory basis to anybody who is trying to access essential public services?  Will there be no choice and will it be fully mandatory?  Is that the Government's policy?  Can we have a clear and unequivocal statement on that?</p></speech>

No other meeting before those requests has every been refused.  We had extensive engagement on this investigation and on a number of others over recent years since the inception of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I do not accept there is an open conflict.  I accept the legislation that was passed by this House gave us the authority and ability to do exactly what we are doing, as it gave anybody else who had adverse findings made against him or her by a quasi-judicial authority such as the Data Protection Commission the authority to challenge those findings in the legal courts, particularly if he or she does not agree with them.

We know &euro;62 million has been spent on the roll-out of the public services card so far.  We also know that in the region of &euro;2 million was ploughed into the project of making the public services card a requirement for getting a driving licence.  Can we have an overall figure for the roll-out of the card across all Departments?</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, said his officials were vindicated over the stance on the public services card for driving tests.  Did the Minister get legal advice on withdrawing the requirement for driving tests?  Did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade get legal advice before it withdrew the requirement for passports?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor and General estimated the costs of the public services card project to the end of 2017, which are the only current data figures we have, came to &euro;59.7 million.  That cost is made up of &euro;30.9 million for the managed services contract, the software, the hardware, support, maintenance and administration of the card itself.  An estimated &euro;28.8 million was for the Department's staff costs, based on the Department's request for 200 additional staff for a four year period.  The estimated staff costs only covered those directly involved in the public services card project and did not include the staff costs of anybody else from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as those involved in the internal upgrade of our IT systems that would have had to accompany the contract we issued.  That is how the &euro;59.7 million was made up.</p>  <p>  I cannot say why the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, said what he said other than to say I am not responsible for the delivery of policy-----</p></speech>

The Minister is trying to talk down the clock.  Are there still plans to explore the replacement the medical card with the PSC, and has the Minister had any involvement in such discussions?  How does the Minister define low risk categories?  It seems some people who received the card did not go through the SAFE 2 process.</p></speech>

I cannot answer a question about plans of which I was not aware in the first instance.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's previous question, a scanned PDF document was sent to the DPC to assist it in searching the document.  That is why it was sent.  I do not have data on how we classify people of risk, because we want to treat everyone equally.  That is why 3.9 million people have volunteered to come in, go through the SAFE 2 process and have their identities authenticated.</p></speech>

The Department's response to the report was 470 scanned pages.  The reference is on page 20 of the DPC report, in paragraph 13.  It notes that the response was unpaginated and included 28 appendices.</p><p>Has a business case been carried out in respect of this project?</p></speech>

Not only was there a business case, but the supporting documentation on the questions and answers, transparency, and privacy was laid before the commission as a response to the initial draft report in 2018.</p></speech>

If so, where is it and on what date was it done?  I refer to the report's findings.  Is the Department appealing all the findings?  I presume it will not challenge the first finding, which finds in its favour, but is it appealing the other seven?</p></speech>

However, I am not currently in a position to appeal anything as nothing in the report is legally challengeable.  At this stage, all we can do is say we disagree with all eight findings as presented to us on 15 August.</p></speech>

There was no business case at the inception.  The Minister stated that 3.9 million people now have cards.  Can she explain when the business case was done?  Did it set out the benefits, savings, and so on?  If so, when was it done, and what was the total number of cards given out?  Have the activation and renewal costs been included, as the cards run out after a period?  Is that all set out in the business case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500044#WW01400"><p>My response is the same as previously.  I do not have a date for when the business case was established but I can come back to the Deputy with it later today.  The total number of cards issued to date is 3.9 million, which have been issued to 3.2 million people.  Some people lose their cards and need to get a second one, and others reach an age where they need to change their cards to add free transport, and so on.  There are 3.2 million active users, and 3.9 million cards have been issued to date.  The card production company has been paid &euro;29.2 million; the staff costs associated are estimated at &euro;36 million; the facial matching company, Gemalto, has been paid &euro;294,000; and the miscellaneous costs are &euro;2.3 million.</p>  <p>  In response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings - I ask the Deputy to stop me if this is of no use to her - the Department stated that the project was innovative and given the lack of existing comparators, it was not possible to properly estimate the costs at that time until market testing via procurement processes had taken place.  That gave rise to some of the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings at the time, which have subsequently been established through practice and further information.</p></speech>

The business case is vital, because the Comptroller and Auditor General's report should not be used in the way it is being used.  The Minister should read all of it.  She is quoting arguments that were put by the Department at the time in response to concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  One of those concerns was that this was a new technology.  Surely at some stage that would be tested through a business case.</p>  <p>  I am not reassured that the Minister is taking any of the concerns set out in this detailed report on board.  There are serious concerns in respect of the retention of data without a legal basis and other Departments using the card or demanding it without a legal basis.  Surely at this point the Minister, separate from the Department, would have some sense to examine this and see what is happening here.  After all, the Government has been aware of this for a long time.  The commissioner has made his concerns known every year in his report.  I have mentioned some of those concerns and I ask the Minister to address them.</p></speech>

He found that the Government made decisions in 2004 and 2005 that formed the basis of the PSC project, and that a business case or project plan was not developed at that time.  However, following examination of key project data and documents that were supplied to our Department by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General then found that the elements of a good practical business case were included in several documents he had examined.  Despite this, he found that there were still a number of omissions relating to a comprehensive estimate of the total projected cost, including the allocation to existing Departments.  It has since been provided and I have just provided it to the Deputy.  There was no initial assessment of the Department's ability to deliver the project, and a formal assessment was not provided at the initial stages of the project.  It has since been provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General and been accepted.  He also highlighted that there was no plan setting out how the project's benefits would be measured.  We have replied to that, noting how recipients feel about the card and how valuable they find it.</p></speech>

Subsequently, <i>The Irish Examiner </i>asked for the publication of the report in a freedom of information, FOI, request and was told that it would not be in the public interest to do so.  The response also said that publishing the report would have serious adverse effects on the Government's ability to manage the economy and financial interests of the State.  The Department then published the report within a few days of that FOI response.  How can the Minister account for the significant variation in responses?</p></speech>

The people who reply to FOI requests do so in the best interests of the Department and according to the established legal plan that sets out our response.  I take a slightly different view insofar as I feel we should robustly defend the policy we have instigated over several Governments.  I am proud to do so, because I believe in it.  In an era of transparency for both Members and the public we serve, I think - and have said previously - that we should have published the report.  However, I was in a position to do so only when I was completely satisfied we had fully established our plan.  That is why it took until last Tuesday.</p></speech>

If I attempted to question his or her direct response back to the person who requested it, we would be in a whole different space here.

Presumably that Department went to and received advice from the Attorney General on such an issue.  Would the Department go outside for advice on it?  It is extraordinary that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and now the Passport Office, are at variance with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner.  That is certainly how it reads.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p></speech>

It is not my business what other Ministers do around the rolling out of their policies.</p>  <p>  I disagree with the Deputy that there is a variance with any Department on the assistance that a PSC gives when delivering public services.  We are all at one when saying that if people have a card, it makes the delivery of public services through eGovernment much more efficient.  People only have to prove their identity on a one and done basis and it makes access with all of the other Departments using eGovernment services much more efficient.  It is, however, not exclusive.  There are ways of dealing with Departments outside of the PSC, as is the will or the wish of the relevant line Minister.</p></speech>

There is a challenge in the report about the card not being an enabler.</p>  <p>  On a couple of occasions the Minister commented that she was very surprised the Data Protection Commissioner was not acceding to a request for a meeting.  Did the commissioner not say that this was a final report?  Once a report is final, one either accepts it or does not accept it.  There is not a meeting because it is a final report.  From reading the report it appears that the commissioner was heavily engaged with the Department during her consultations, and that was the time for engagement with her.  Does the Minister agree that the reason no meeting has happened is because it is a final report?</p></speech>

If I have ever been dismissive of any Member, I give an apology right here and now.  That was never my intention.  I understand that we have differences of opinion on a wide variety of policy delivery in the State.  That is okay.  It is healthy and normal.  I do not, however, believe that I have ever disrespected any Member in the House.  I have certainly never disrespected the DPC or any of the staff members in the commission's office.  I asked twice for the meeting, not because I wanted to challenge the legal findings in the report, but because there were inconsistencies in the directions in the report, the directions in the letter that accompanied the report and the utterances made by Data Protection Commissioner in three interviews.  I am at a loss to know what exactly I was supposed to comply with and all I wanted to do was sit down and have a conversation so I could rule out the inconsistencies and know exactly what the directions are, so when I was deliberating on what we were going to do around the directions, I would know exactly what I was deliberating on.  I do not think this was too insulting.  I do not believe it was questioning the commissioner's authority, and it was not questioning the findings in the report given that there were inconsistencies across the three mediums.</p></speech>

That would give legal authority to it and we do not want to find ourselves in a position of not being able to legally challenge.

There was no change.</p></speech>

The fact is that the card had its genesis back as far as the 1990s.  The purpose was very clear then, but it is also very clear to me today, that it was to provide a means of verifying a person's identity when accessing public services.  There has been no mission creep, as the intention was clear from the outset, and we have delivered on our mission.</p><p>There are now approximately 3.2 million active users of the PSC, representing more than 80% of the adult population.  The PSC provides citizens with the convenience of only having to submit information to verify their identity once.  In this context, it should be noted that every week payments valued at approximately &euro;150 million are made via post offices to more than 600,000 people whose identity is verified on each and every occasion by use of the PSC.  Every week, approximately 600,000 people make free travel journeys using the card.  Every year, approximately 70,000 people over the age of 18 apply for a passport for the first time using the card to avoid having to resubmit identity data to that Department all over again.  Almost 400,000 PSC holders - and growing, thankfully - have verified their identity to standard that enables them to access a wide variety of online services with the bodies mentioned above via <i>MyGovID.ie.</i></p><p>I reiterate - and I must be getting through because Members have mentioned it on several occasions - that the PSC has strong public support.  Almost 89% of the adult population hold a card and research commissioned from a reputable research agency by my Department published on 1 March this year shows that 96% of cardholders surveyed were either very satisfied or fairly satisfied with the process.</p></speech>

Of those surveyed, 88% felt that they either had access to the right level of information in respect of the SAFE-PSC process or had access to more than the information they needed.  Almost eight out of ten people, which is 77%, understand the requirement to retain personal information and do not mind that their documents are retained.</p>  <p>  The public service identity, PSI, dataset can only be shared with public service bodies set out in legislation, called "specified bodies", and where that body has a transaction with a person and can be shared only to the extent necessary for that transaction to authenticate the identity of the person concerned.  Specified bodies are, in all cases, required to process and store data in accordance with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.  The personal data associated with the PSC are the basic identity data as set out in legislation.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that I fully respect not only the commissioner but also the Data Protection Commission.</p><p>At all stages in its interactions with the commission's office my Department has sought to co-operate fully with the investigation.  </p> <p> I note that the opinion has been expressed that the State should not be contesting the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner, that it should just accept them and implement the measures required.  In that regard, it is important to note that the Oireachtas specifically provided - not all of us were here when this happened but some of us were - that bodies subject to first instance decisions of the Data Protection Commissioner would have, in accordance with standard principles of due process and natural justice, the right to appeal such decisions.  It would be extraordinary, therefore, if the State where to deny itself the right to exercise this right, particularly in a situation where there is strong legal advice to underpin the card as initiated in 1998.</p></speech>

It has been a long time coming, but there are aspects to it that need clarification or amendment on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Housing associations play an important role and could play an even more important on in the future.  At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts they stated this legislation was needed to assist them in the delivery of more housing, in the main because it would enable them to access significant additional funding.  I accept that they have been around for a long time.  Most of them, in particular the Iveagh Trust, predate the former Dublin Corporation in local authority housing provision.  Much of the first clearance work occurred in and around the Grey Street-Brabazon Square area of the south inner city and is still evident today.</p>  <p>  Housing associations are not new, but there is a variation between local authorities and housing associations where they exist on the same site.  In that situation people on the same waiting list are allocated housing but in a different way.  It might be possible to address this issue by way of regulations.  As the housing associations and local authorities are not regulated by the same entity, it is not difficult to see how that can happen.  I know of situations where people who did not make it through the selection process for approved housing body housing were allocated a house in the same area based on their place on the housing waiting list, which is questionable.  Also, where courses for new tenants are provided by housing associations but not the local authorities, despite both having housing on the same site, this causes confusion about rights and responsibilities.  This matter requires further consideration.  My concern is there could be cherry picking.   </p>  <p>  In 2009-10, given a shortage of funding, there was a shift in how housing bodies were funded.  I am concerned about costs in the context of market rents which, as we know, are unacceptably high in parts of the country.  Approximately 80% of the market rent is allowable in approved projects involving private leasing.  From that point of view, the value for money aspect may well need to be revisited.  Whatever funding we have available must be used to the maximum in producing additional housing.  At the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts with the Irish Council for Social Housing we discussed the interim regulator.  There is additional oversight in this area in the form of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB; the Charities Regulator; the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in respect of people with care needs, and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>  <p>  Of particular concern is local authority funding for the maintenance of housing association properties.  I have come across more than a couple of situations where there was a sizeable amount of money in their bank accounts.  There may be a requirement for a sinking fund for the maintenance of, say, a lift or a combined roof over a number of properties in an apartment block, but the need for maintenance of a relatively new house will be low in the first ten years.  The scheme may well need to be examined in the context of the achievement of value for money.  I am in favour of ongoing maintenance to ensure the housing stock remains in good condition, but this issue requires consideration.</p>  <p>  It will be for the regulator to do more than regulate governance.  If we are to dramatically increase the number of tier three housing associations, in particular, we should do so in a way that will enable us to achieve a cost rental model for a mixed community.  That would be a very good outcome.  </p>  <p>  As I said, the Bill was a long time coming.  The interim arrangements introduced by the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, need to be put on a statutory footing.  I recall that when they were being introduced, we had a robust exchange on the need to put them on a statutory basis and the reason it was necessary to do so.  The Bill makes provision in that regard.  This is not legislation about which people will be excited, but it is important nonetheless.  As I said, there are aspects to it that will need to be clarified or amended on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Like every other Member, as a local public representative, I am keenly aware of the housing difficulties in every constituency.  It differs depending on whether one is in an urban or rural area but there are problems everywhere.  I have a particular interest in this legislation because up to early last year, the Minister and I had extensive discussions on housing at the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am Chairman.  We had three or four public meetings regarding the funding of housing and part of that work focused on AHBs.  Departmental officials appeared before the committee on a number of occasions along with people from social housing agencies as well as some city and county managers so we had a broad discussion to get a full picture regarding expenditure by the State in this area, which was useful and helpful.  We came up with specific recommendations regarding AHBs and the need for statutory regulation, which was being carried out on a non-statutory basis.  I am, therefore, keen to endorse the legislation.  The principle underpinning it is good.  Members on all sides of the House have called for it.  Nobody should question the principle of the legislation, although, obviously, there are matters of detail.</p>  <p>  I will not stray too much into the overall local authority housing issue but it is linked to AHBs.  I do not have the exact figures and I do not know if they are even available.  Some useful information has been produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service along with the work done by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I also have knowledge of the area.  AHBs are independent not-for-profit housing bodies with a housing stock of approximately 300,000 units, which is a fabulous number of houses throughout the country.  I do not know the gross value of the total assets owned and controlled by AHBs.  Perhaps the figure is available but if we take the average value of a house to be &euro;250,000, their value is at least &euro;8 billion.  Over the next two years, in its drive to deliver 47,000 new social housing units targeted up to 2021, the Department hopes that one third of these, which is approximately 15,000 units, will be delivered by AHBs.  It is only an estimate but is as good an estimate as any of which I am aware but based on the average value of those houses being &euro;250,000, they would be worth &euro;4 billion.  We are talking about organisations that control housing assets worth well over &euro;10 billion.  That is an important issue.  Wearing my Committee of Public Accounts hat, I know people will appreciate that it is important that we have proper regulation, processes, controls and governance to ensure this money is invested wisely for the purpose for which it is voted from this House.  I have no issue with that.  </p>  <p>  It is a big change and some might say that it might not be the intention of the draft legislation but if we are going to regulate the organisations that will own and control 30% of the new social houses to be built in the next three years - organisations that already own 30,000 houses - we must regulate the local authorities that own the remaining houses.  A local authority might have built a number of houses on a new estate while the houses on the opposite side or next door have been provided by an AHB.  Some houses will be regulated while others will not.  There is no logic to this.  Perhaps officials in the Department were afraid that the local authorities would unhappy with being regulated but if we are going to regulate AHBs, which will, hopefully, have good governance procedures, there is nothing wrong with having the same control over senior unelected council officials throughout the country who are making equivalent decisions on spending money on houses, deciding where they will be located, who will be allocated houses, maintenance and dealing with tenants thereafter along with other people in the area.  It is not right to hive this off on its own.  What is here is good but it is only a fraction of what needs to be dealt with.  The Minister could say that people can go to the Ombudsman, which they do but there should be a better system in place so that this is not always the default.  Local authorities do not always like being brought to the Ombudsman and regularly try to deal with issues before they get an unfavourable decision from him or her.</p>  <p>  There has been a move in recent years away from the State providing what it should provide, namely, housing in favour of asking somebody else to do it.  I know it was bit of a trick.  The Government probably thought it would be regarded as off-balance sheet funding.  That was what we heard here for years but EUROSTAT has called our bluff on that and said that all these tier 3 agencies must be on the State's balance sheet.  Their borrowings will be rightly on the State's balance sheet.  Anybody in Ireland who tried to argue against that was not arguing from a logical position.  A third of these funds are directly provided by the local authorities.  Most of the balance of the funding is obtained from the Housing Agency and sometimes it can borrow on the private market but the bulk of these houses and the income received by AHBs comes through local authorities through the payment and availability scheme.  All in all, what is good for one is good for the other and if it is important to regulate AHBs, we should also regulate the same activity when it is carried out by local authorities.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities have done a good job over the decades.  Many local authorities will feel that AHBs are effectively surrogates for them to do the job they have always done.  I am pleased the Minister is present because he will enjoy this story.  He visited Portlaoise last year to open a lovely housing development in the town.  It was probably one of the few that was in train at the time and was well worth a ministerial visit.  We were delighted that he visited that development of 33 houses that day.  It was a local authority scheme.  It was pointed out to him that Laois County Council does not have one acre of ground in Portlaoise town on which to build another scheme because it has been starved of money.  However, AHBs can come in from anywhere; I do not mind where they come from.  If they are not based in Laois, they could be from Dublin or Carlow.  These AHBs can come in with a scheme, find a development with planning permission that is not selling in the private sector because the private sector has no money and be allowed to build that scheme with a builder.  Why can a local authority not do the same?  We should not just facilitate AHBs.  Local authorities also have a track record.  The Minister will recall that trip during which he made a brief visit to a neighbouring farm and saw a number of cows.  I enjoyed the joke but many people did not see the joke.  He saw all these wonderful cows in the field just over the wall from where this housing development was located.  I hope his shoes did not get too dirty in the farmyard.  He took a picture and posted it on Twitter with a caption stating that he had now found out where the latte for a coffee came from.  Many people thought this was dreadful and that it was a city Minister making a joke of people in the country but I saw the humour in it.  If somebody is giving out about it-----</p></speech>

Was that not an excellent housing scheme and a perfect development strategically located at the centre of Portlaoise delivered by the local authority?</p><p>We should continue to support local authorities.  They feel as if they have been sidestepped.  When I visit my local authority, as every Member can do, I find that all housing is being delivered by AHBs.  That is just how things are.  I agree that there should be regulation, but I must make the case for local authorities to be allowed to continue their work.  If they are doing it, they should be regulated, just like AHBs.  That is the main point I wish to make, although I have many others to raise. </p> <p> A lot of the funding comes through the capital allowance loan facility and the Housing Finance Agency.  There is one important point around which people cannot get their heads.  The Committee of Public Accounts was informed that the local authority allocated a property to a household the rent contribution of which was determined in using the preferred differential rent method.  The local authority contributes to the approved housing body the difference between the household's contribution and the agreed rent, as agreed between the local authority and the approved housing body under the payment and availability scheme.  The Department then reimburses the local authority.  As such, the funding is still going through the local authority which has a key role to play.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned that some of them were cash-rich organisations.  That issue needs to be looked at.  If they are doing exceptionally well, this has to be taken into account when they are being funded.  We know that substantial maintenance payments of &euro;480 per annum are made.  Things would be a lot better if local authorities could be given a budget to spend &euro;450 in the maintenance of their housing stock.  Perhaps then people would not be as quick to criticise them for not looking after the developments they have built.  Part of the problem is that they are being starved of funding for maintenance, although it seems to be easily available to AHBs.  I understand there is a need for it, but it seems that a lot of money is available.  </p> <p> We must recognise that the current non-statutory regulation has improved the situation in the last couple of years and been very important.  We all know that a large number of AHBs have registered with the Housing Agency.  We were informed that 260 AHBs were registered out of a total of 547.  The recent briefing note states this figure has increased to 273.  That means that some 245 bodies have not singed up to the voluntary code.  They have assets of approximately &euro;570 million, but only represent about 5% of the housing stock.  That gives an indication of what is available.  There is a certain undercurrent.  There are a lot of small housing agencies.  Some were founded for a specific purpose many years ago and are functioning well.  They might provide housing for elderly or disabled persons in a town centre to prevent them from becoming isolated.  These bodies are very good and run by volunteers.  Some of the organisations do not have professional staff, but they will have to meet all of the regulations if they register.  The implication is that they may be forced to merge.  We have seen this happen in other walks of life.  We are going to say to the people who did this wonderful job in their own area, whether it is an urban area or a small city, that owing to the requirements of the new regulations, they are not fit to continue and that the only option is for five or six bodies in a given area to merge.  Perhaps there would be some benefit in that, but there would be a definite downside.  I would not like to see organisations forced to amalgamate, unless they were satisfied that it would be in the interest of the people living in their houses. </p> <p> The Minister might be a little surprised to hear me call for the regulation of local authorities.  The regulation would not be too onerous because they have systems in place and should be able to handle it.  We are, however, getting into an unusual situation where AHBs are concerned.  There will be five statutory agencies with oversight of various aspects.  The first is the local authority.  Local authorities provide funding for AHBs to ensure they meet the criteria to receive State funds.  Cearly, they have an oversight role in that respect.  Second, AHBs are registered with the RTB and their tenants have rights which are overseen by that body.  They are all charities.  As such, they are regulated by the Charities Regulator which ensures they meet the criteria and have the correct memoranda in place to provide social housing, including a clause to prevent them from selling a property on.  Furthermore, some of the AHBs are regulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, insofar as their tenants have specific medical or disability needs.  AHBs will now have a new regulator overseeing their activities, as well as the local authorities, the RTB and, in some cases, HIQA.  I hope when all five state bodies charged with ensuring oversight are paid for, there will be some money left for social housing provision.  This is something of which we want to be mindful whenever we add an extra layer.  All of the bodies are probably useful in their own right.  That said, it would be great if the new regulator could assume some of their functions, rather than telling a tenant who comes to us with a problem to go to the approved housing body; then, if they are not happy with it, the Residential Tenancies Board; and if they come back again, the Charities Regulator.  If they do not get satisfaction there, we can tell him or her to go to HIQA, on top of which there will be the new regulator.  I pity the tenants who will have to go through all of these bodies if they have a problem.  I wonder if we ever think things through when we start to deal with these issues. </p> <p> They are the main points I want to make.  I say all of it constructively.  I support the Bill which is long overdue.  It has been mooted for six years.  The Committee of Public Accounts was very strict and black and white in calling for this legislation to be implemented as urgently as possible.  Some &euro;10 billion worth of assets will be available shortly, most of which have been financed by the State.  I really believe that when push comes to shove, the State should own those houses, not AHBs that are not accountable to the Oireachtas, a point to which I did not even get.  The bodies will only be governed by a regulator that will be required to come before the committee.  They will receive billions of euro of State funds between them.  They will not be answerable in a council chamber and certainly will not be answerable to the D&aacute;il because they are private charities.  There is a major gap.  I will address this issue in Private Members' legislation in due course.  We are handing out billions of euro of taxpayers' money to build social housing.  This should have been and was traditionally done by local authorities, but it is now done on a surrogate basis by AHBs.  However, there is no Oireachtas oversight or accountability, which is a particular problem.  </p> <p> I will have to confirm this on Committee Stage, but I assume that every one of the bodies that receives funding will have to provide in its memoranda that its properties will always be used as social housing.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where some of them will fold up and something else will suddenly happen when they are in administration.  An administrator or a liquidator might come in as things go wrong and we might find that insolvency rules supersede the memoranda and that the properties would no longer be used as social housing.  Some of the housing bodies have other properties.  There are community and semi-commercial facilities in some of their developments.  Since they have been financed so much by the taxpayer, I think the taxpayer is entitled to own them, notwithstanding the good work done by the AHBs.  It would be better if the bodies which will receive the majority of their funds from the taxpayer through voted expenditure were answerable in some way, whether through the Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  They cannot receive all of this money from the taxpayer every year without there being any accountability to the House.</p></speech>

I agree very strongly with the comments made by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to the effect that State-funded properties should ultimately be owned by the State.</p><p>That should apply to all voluntary projects, which many Members have been involved in over the years.  It has to be ensured, however, that either the memorandum and articles or the granting of moneys ensures that the State, and the people of Ireland, are the owners of the properties.  I echo that point because people have often been fearful in community projects, such as housing co-operative developments, that somehow or other the co-operative could be alienated into the private sector, with the State and community losing out.  </p> <p> I commend the general work of  AHBs and voluntary housing organisations.  I want to highlight their estate management in particular.  Our experience over the past quarter of a century in Dublin Bay North and my old Dublin North East constituency has been that AHBs have an outstanding record in estate management.  That can be compared with the record of Dublin City Council.  The Minister will be aware, as he represents a Dublin constituency, that its record has generally been poor.  It has not been up to standard and that has allowed the development of anti-social behaviour in districts where that should never have started.  It would not have happened if a proper estate management and maintenance system had been implemented by the council.  That is a large housing authority, of course, with about 28,000 properties, nearly as many properties as all of the voluntary housing bodies put together.</p> <p> Dublin Bay North has an impressive history in this area.  We have had housing co-operatives all over the country, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know.  I remember an important co-operative in Kilbarrack going back many years.  The past 25 years saw the arrival of the National Association of Building Co-operatives, NABCo, and the Housing Association for Integrated Living, HAIL.  They were followed by other similar organisations.  The then Minister for the Environment, Michael Smith, went to the UK in the mid-1990s.  He asked some of the voluntary housing bodies there to visit Ireland.  St. Pancras arrived here at that stage.  That organisation was set up after the First World War to provide housing for soldiers returning from the horrors of the Western Front.  St. Pancras later became Cl&uacute;id, a body with which we are now very familiar in Dublin.  We also have other outstanding bodies such as Respond, which was originally set up by the Capuchin religious order.  We also have the Tuath Housing organisation and Fold Ireland, which the Minister and I were happy to inspect just a few weeks ago in my constituency.  That body provides wonderful accommodation for senior citizens in Dublin Bay North on the Tonlegee Road.  There is a long history and many other housing bodies have done very well over the years.  Many of those are not in Dublin Bay North.</p> <p> I have always been impressed with the management of those estates, which has generally been far superior to the similar services of Dublin City Council.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined a key housing policy in his recent book and I share his view that we should return to properly funding and resourcing local authorities.  They could be directed by a national housing executive to embark on a major plan to build local authority housing.  Deputies will agree that there is no other way to address the horrendous housing crisis.   Week in, week out and day in, day out, that crisis impacts badly on many people.  Some 551 bodies are listed on the register of housing bodies with approved status.  It is disappointing that only 273 of them signed up to the VRC.  Those that did sign up, however, oversee some 95% of the total housing stock.  According to the Housing Agency regulation office report of 2017, some 18 tier 3 housing bodies share 23,517 units of the total number of AHB homes.  The Minister stated in his opening contribution last night that there were 552 AHBs, of which 274 were on the register.  That again means, however, that just under 50% have registered.</p> <p> This Bill provides for the establishment of the approved housing bodies regulatory authority.  This is long overdue.  We have been requesting this for many years.  I recall asking the Governments of former taoisigh, Brian Cowen, Bertie Ahern and Enda Kenny, to do something like this for many years.  We thought it was necessary because of the significant expenditure.  I, like the Minister, am a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, in two previous D&aacute;ileanna.  We felt there had to be serious regulation of the sector.  I am delighted that the regulator will be placed on a statutory footing and that a full legal regulatory regime will be put in place.  There were various moves in this direction in recent years.  These include the VRC, the regulation office in 2014, the financial standard and objectives in 2015, the governance standard in 2017 and the performance standard in December 2018.  We still needed this legislation, however.</p> <p> The Minister has given the AHBs ambitious targets as part of Rebuilding Ireland.  Those bodies are expected to access finance and provide at least one third of the 50,000 homes targeted by 2021.  Statutory regulation is important as well in the context of these bodies being the employers of many housing aid agency staff, as well as being landlords.  This statutory regulation is, therefore, important and long overdue.  That is the case not just for the tenants but also for the organisations themselves.  Since 2011, as another colleague mentioned, the CALF has been providing 30% of funding to AHBs.  Other reported funding streams include the HSE, at 40%, the Dublin Regional Housing Executive, DRHE, Tusla, and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That underlines the point being made by the Chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Fleming.  There is a necessity for regulation and to ensure that this great tranche of State property remains in public ownership.  Section 9 in Part 2 of the Bill sets out the functions of the regulator, which will include preparing draft standards, monitoring and assessing compliance and collecting and publishing information concerning AHBs.  The regulator will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is valuable.  </p> <p> At the end of February this year, Dr. Donal McManus, CEO of the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, presented to the Committee of Public Accounts regarding AHBs and social housing provision.  As part of that submission, the council stated that there were approximately 33,000 AHB homes across the country.  It is a huge estate, bigger than the holdings of Dublin City Council.  The Minister will be aware of the size of some individual housing estates owned by the housing bodies.  I recall when Cl&uacute;id had just slightly more than 5,000 units.  That is a larger number than many county councils.  It is a major responsibility for the regulator to manage and maintain those properties all around the country.  </p> <p> The submission I referred to included a summary of the results of the 2017 housing association performance management, HAPM, survey.  That gave us some valuable information.  It is impressive to note that less than 5% of rent receivable was outstanding as rent arrears.  Only 33 of the 69 bodies reported having rent arrears.  As former city councillors, we are familiar with the issues regarding rent arrears on the Dublin City Council and Fingal estates over the years.  There were also impressive findings under the heading of "repairs completed or responded to within target timescales".  It compares favourably with the performance of Dublin City Council under its present management structure.  There is also very good estate management.  The average time for voids was 8.3 weeks in 2017.  I recall when a large voluntary housing body contacted me last year.  It asked me if I could pursue the local authority because it was so slow in making nominations to a newly-built apartment complex.  More than 50 apartments were available, which was a precious resource for people desperate for rehousing. Those apartments were lying idle for approximately four months.</p><p>The housing body turned to me to ask the local authority to get a move on.  That should not happen.  It should be progressed very quickly.</p> <p> Housing associations have an impressive history in many countries.  In the UK, the National Housing Federation has 2.5 million homes.  The UK went through a similar experience when Mrs. Thatcher tried to get rid of the national housing stock.  She refused to allow local authorities to build estates.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case, we copied the UK and embarked down the same road, and the Minister is now wrestling with 140,000 people on housing lists and in receipt of HAP while and 10,000 citizens are homeless tonight.</p> <p> We should embark on a new local authority national housing programme.  It should be the key priority of the next Government.  I welcome the  belated appointment of a regulator for this territory.  It is amazing there has been a build-up of such a large number of homes and that we have not had a formal regulation system.  Although it is late. I welcome the fact the Minister has introduced the Bill.</p></speech>

My colleagues on the Committee of Public Accounts have pointed out this was raised at a number of meetings.  We recognised the absence of regulation.

Unless they have been updated, according to my figures, there are 547 voluntary housing associations of which 273 have signed up.  My thought when I saw that was that we are reliant on 547 voluntary housing bodies to provide housing but they are completely unregulated.  It was an extraordinary moment on the road to Damascus, as I said at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>I am very familiar with voluntary housing bodies having spent 17 years on a local authority but I did not realise the number was 547 and that they were completely unregulated.  I did not realise that they fell between two stools as even though they receive 100% public funding, they did not come under the European Convention on Human Rights or the RTB.  This has been rectified since then to a certain extent with regard to the RTB.  Are they public bodies in the same way as a local authority for the purposes of the European convention?</p><p>I cannot believe so few have signed up, although I acknowledge the interim regulator said those who did sign up account for a substantial number of the houses.  I do not see why the others did not sign up.  Of those that did, 83% demonstrated substantial compliance but 9% required further written clarification.  I welcome that we are doing this but I have concerns that it is creating another layer of bureaucracy.  I realise we need to regulate it but at more than &euro;800,000 per year, do we need it?  I agree with the legislation but did the Minister examine whether we could regulate this in another way without adding this extra expense?</p><p>I have great concern about the Government's aim to provide 50,000 new houses with one third of them to be provided by the voluntary sector.  The aim is to allow people to purchase houses, with which I have no problem if they are in the name of the person.  People will also be allowed to lease houses.  My understanding is that at one time tenants of AHBs had the exact same rights to lifelong tenancy and controlled rent as local authority tenants and that the only distinction related to the ability to buy  the house.  This is what I was told repeatedly and what I believed.  This has become more complicated because different durations are involved.  Some of the voluntary bodies have five-year and ten-year contracts and others have longer contracts.  They have bought or acquired houses and clients do not have tenancy for life.  I ask for this to be clarified.</p><p>The amount of loans taken out by AHBs is &euro;1.683 billion.  There has been a significant increase since 2016.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its digest, which points out that the increase since then is 469%.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to it being teased out on Committee Stage.  I am not a member of the committee.  Matters regarding the independence of the regulator, reporting back to the Minister, fees and so on need to be teased out.</p><p>I am using this opportunity to highlight what has happened in housing policy in this country.  Significant money has gone into this sector over the years but I sat on the city council in Galway and there has not been a single euro to build a house since 2009.  A housing crisis has been deliberately created in Galway.  It is a consequence of repeated Government policies.  If a local authority house has not been built since 2009, it stands to reason that there will be a crisis.  What decisions were made to channel money to voluntary housing bodies that were unregulated?  The local authority was starved of funds, leading to an essential part of the crisis.  A number of games were being played.  One was accountancy, of course, to take the AHB money off the books and state it was not Government debt.  Another was the complete outsourcing of housing provision to voluntary bodies.</p><p>We have to accept that voluntary bodies are an essential part of the solution and regulation is appropriate but I will not accept going down the road of the Government abdicating its responsibility and putting an onus on these bodies.  They have been unregulated until now and have not even seen fit to join up to the voluntary code in 273 cases.  Putting this forward as Government policy is unacceptable.</p><p>I welcome the Bill but I am putting on record my most serious concerns about Government housing policy despite the Minister's rhetoric.  Galway has a serious housing crisis.  It has no master plan.  I have said repeatedly that we have public land but it is being developed in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  Ceannt Station, the docks and the Dyke Road all have separate plans, with some of them being led by private developers.  Imagine that in a city that has a housing crisis, with people on a waiting list since 2002.  It is not clear how the voluntary bodies take applicants.  I understood they all came from the housing waiting list but that does not seem to be the case.</p><p>There is a role for AHBs in a regulated and controlled environment and as an add-on to a housing policy where the State is the main player in the provision of social housing.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; riachtanach ach cuireann s&eacute; fait&iacute;os orm freisin mar, go minic, buna&iacute;tear rialaitheoir&iacute; agus b&iacute;onn ruda&iacute; r&eacute;as&uacute;nta ag an dt&uacute;s agus ansin tosa&iacute;onn na riachtanais p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; agus n&iacute; dh&eacute;antar aon idirdheal&uacute; idir bheag agus mh&oacute;r.</p><p>I welcome the Bill, but I have a concern about regulators.  Unlike many Members, I do not think that everything that is independent is necessarily good.  When something is independent, whom is it independent of?  What we mean to say is that it is independent of this House.  I have no problem with that for individual cases.  However, I have problems when the House stands back and the regulator of an entire sector starts acting in a way that is not in the public interest.  We have seen this with the water regulator where Irish Water is now charging &euro;20,000 for 100 m of pipe to one house, which is unreasonable.  Of course, nobody will pull the regulator up because we will be told that the regulator is independent.</p> <p> Independence in dealing with individual cases is no problem.  On big policy issues regulators should not run the State; we are elected to do that, and we should never cede that power.  Ultimately in terms of the overall policy and how it is working and reporting, it is important that it is answerable to the Minister.  If it is answerable to the Minister, it is answerable to us because otherwise we cannot get at what is happening.</p> <p> There are some large multinational AHBs and some small local housing bodies in a small parish fulfilling a local need.  I live in such a parish where we have a cluster of eight houses under the auspices of a local AHB and there is never any big issue.  It is a voluntary committee in the truest sense of volunteerism.  None of the people running the little scheme gets any payment.  One of the great mistakes regulators make is that they regulate those small entities with the same level of bureaucracy and red tape that they regulate a multimillion euro business.  I hope that point is taken on board and nailed down.</p> <p> It was a major consideration and concern of mine when we were introducing the charities regulator that a small charity would not be regulated like a big charity.  I do not know if that has fully worked but it is a concern I have generally with regulation.  We seem to have lost a sense of proportionality.  Any damage a one-off AHB with eight, ten or 15 houses might do if it ran amok is quite different from a multimillion euro professional organisation with professional management.  The capacity of smaller bodies to comply with unnecessary paper regulation might not be great, but their ability to deal with the needs of people is first class.</p> <p> There is very interesting recent phenomenon in this country from which many legal people and accountants are making a fortune.  I can never understand it.  The European Union and EUROSTAT make regulations and then all the people in the EU try to find out how to get around these regulations.  A massive industry has built up around making the regulation and then getting around the regulation.  In this case, it is time we got around the EUROSTAT regulation and got it off-balance sheet.  However, is there something wrong with the world that all the countries in Europe have to unwind a European regulation.  Why was it put in place in the first place if we all spend money paying experts to unwind it again by getting it off-balance sheet?  Obviously if we get it off-balance sheet, it allows us to build more houses.  With that caveat and that nonsense of the modern world I will move on.</p> <p> We have a housing crisis the likes of which I have never seen in my life in politics.  Every week I have the finest of decent people coming to my office to discuss housing, particularly in the city.  The term "homelessness" is unfortunate.  Most people associate homelessness with somebody sleeping on the streets.  It seems that the wealthier a society is, the more people seem to sleep on the streets.  That is something we need to examine because it seems that in wealthy societies, we also have great poverty living cheek-by-jowl.  One of the problems of the modern so-called great economy is that the gap between rich and poor is widening, and it is everybody for themselves.</p> <p> There are also what I call the hidden homeless.  The people who are technically homeless may be in bed and breakfasts.  They may be staying with a family in an overcrowded situation.  They are in all sorts of unstable and uncertain circumstances, which do not provide the most important thing, particularly where families are involved - a family home.  Why do I say they are invisible?  It is not what most people imagine when we talk about homelessness.  It is totally tragic.  These are people who do not need significant social supports; all they need is permanent accommodation.</p> <p> I might be old-fashioned because I still believe that the stability of a society if we are looking to the future is measured by family stability and what creates family stability is permanent tenancy or ownership.  The model where the vast majority of families and people own their houses is far superior to any renting or letting system.  We will see the fallout of the move away from that concept in the future.</p> <p> One of my concerns about AHBs is that they are not allowed to sell the houses to the tenants.  I know economists will argue about this, but it is fine for economists to argue because they own their own houses.  The reality is that most people aspire to own their houses.  When they get to own their houses, they tend to look after them very well.  Any of us who ever went into the housing estates where houses have been purchased, we will always have a good idea which houses were purchased.  I believe it is a social value in society that is well worth the price to allow for ownership of houses.  I do not agree with the modern trend that suggests that is old hat because it is done differently somewhere else.</p> <p> I have tabled one parliamentary question at regular intervals.  I do not know if the Minister of State ever has an opportunity to read the replies given to me.  I keep asking when the review of the 2016 tenant incremental purchase scheme will be published and when the Department will revise the scheme.  It was designed to fail and the small numbers attracted to the scheme indicate it has failed.  Someone may be living in a local authority house with a net valuation of &euro;80,000 after a reduction.  Even if they can put the &euro;80,000 on the table in cash, under the rules of scheme they cannot buy the house.</p><p>The argument I would make to whoever dreamt of that one is that these people have been paying rent every week and would be able to maintain their house, keep it painted and mend a leaky roof.  I have seen cases where the people could have paid to buy the house but were not allowed to do it.  The reasons given often stretch credulity.  I do not believe that people should be borrowing money beyond their capacity.  Therefore if the Government said, irrespective of the source of the funding as long as the person is satisfied it will last into the future, they could borrow up to a certain amount, depending on the price of the house, otherwise they would have to prove they had the resources to pay the balance, that would be very rational.  That is the same for anybody who borrows money to buy a house.  If they have 100% of the cash they just buy it, no question, no problem.  If they have only 30% of the net price they have to prove how they will pay the 70% but in all cases, if they borrowed the money at 3% the repayment would be less than the rent they were paying yet still they cannot buy.  There is a great value in ownership.  It is time a decision was made on that and that this D&aacute;il was informed of the decision.  I hope there will be a radical reform of that scheme to make it work because it has not worked.</p> <p> Housing is an utter nightmare.  I cannot believe the bureaucracy involved in dealing with local authorities or approved housing bodies.  To extend a house worth over &euro;100,000 or &euro;125,000 a person has to go back to the Department to get permission.  Why would the Department officials think that engineers and administrators, who went to the same colleges as they did, are so incompetent while they are so competent?  If a person wants to do anything with an approved housing body they must go back I think four times, as must local authorities doing big schemes.  That was the way for years when a county council wanted to do something about water and sewerage it had to keep going back to the Department for permission.  Can the Minister of State remember those days?  No doubt he was on the local authority and tearing his hair out, asking why the officials were not given the money at the beginning of the year and let get on with the job because they would be audited at the end of the year and have to account to the Government for the gross spend.  Instead, the local authority has to go back to the Department at every step.  Suddenly Irish Water was set up, is given all the money on 1 January and is told to spend it and does not have to go back at all.  Why does the Government now trust officials, many of whom came from the local authorities, in Irish Water but did not trust them when they were working for the local authority?  If the local authority staff are so untrustworthy they should be abolished and somebody trustworthy put in their place.  I do not believe they are untrustworthy.  I think it is just a part of the control freak syndrome that Governments have always been party to in respect of local authorities but never with the semi-State bodies they have set up.</p> <p> To use the old saying, some people see things and say why and others see things that never were and say why not.  I am saying to the Minister of State why not say we will give you the money at the beginning of the year.  It is up to the councillors to make sure that it is well looked after and it is up to the officials to make sure the spend is in accordance with the guidelines and answerable to the auditor, just as for any other body.  If the Government did that and let them get on, it would immediately speed up the building of houses in this country because much of the time it is not a lack of money that is holding us up, it is incessant bureaucracy.</p> <p> We have an unprecedented housing crisis.  In Galway city it is getting worse by the day because people are moving in and there is more home formation in all the guises, from singles to families, but this particularly weighs heavily on families.  Private and public houses are being built in the city.  There are no affordable houses.  It is short of private houses.  A person cannot get anything through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and even those who want to buy a house are paying escalating prices.  The local authority is building very few houses.  It is way behind the increase that has occurred in the past ten years.  The national figures paint a very sad picture.  Between 2004 and 2010, 33,705 local authority houses were built but between 2011 and 2017, 7,421 were built.  The Minister of State might say that approved housing body houses are being built, but 10,542 were built between 2004 and 2010 and 4,809 between 2011 and 2017.  I find it impossible to understand why it is so hard in this country to respond to crises and to do anything anymore.  We need to consider the logjams because in many cases money is not the problem.  The Government has often assured us that the money is available.  If it is we have to consider what processes we have in place, including referral to the Department and planning processes that are failing to deliver. </p> <p> Perfection is a very fine thing in life but it is also the enemy of getting anything done in the real, human world.  I guarantee the Minister of State that the people I meet every week, one after another, those who ring me all the time - it would break your heart - families where there is someone with a disability who need a house rapidly with downstairs facilities, would settle for the job being done rather than eternal perfection such that nothing would ever go wrong.  If the Minister of State was living in a hostel or a bed and breakfast he would be saying get on and give me a house or an apartment or a place that I could permanently could call home.</p></speech>

Housing issues are nearing crisis point.  The proposal in this legislation will not improve that.  As a country we are over-regulated to the extent it is crippling business people, contractors and entrepreneurs.  The proposal to create an approved housing body regulator, although well-intentioned, would mean further hindering progress and would introduce an extra layer of bureaucracy.  The Government should put its efforts into building houses for the homeless people around the country as it set down in its rebuilding Ireland programme and the programme for Government.</p><p>There have been many discussions on housing in the Chamber since I was elected.  It is a significant issue that affects every constituency and I do not have all the solutions by any manner or means.  When the programme for Government was being created, we had many discussions with those who would form the Government.  One of the ideas we put forward that the then incoming Government seemed to show an interest in, although it has never acted on it, was a rural resettlement scheme.  It would not resolve the issue and is not the be-all and end-all, but it would tackle the issue if a rural resettlement scheme was available throughout the country.</p> <p> Rural towns and villages throughout west County Cork have lost people for whatever reasons.  The more rural one lives within rural Ireland, the more difficult it is to gain employment.  Most people have moved either abroad or to other cities, which has caused closures of shops, pubs, banks and credit unions in many towns and villages.  Throughout the country there have been numerous closures but it has been particularly bad in west County Cork.  In the space of two months, approximately eight or ten businesses and post offices closed in rural parts of my constituency of Cork South-West.  If there was a proper rural resettlement programme, it could have helped tackle the issue of homelessness in the country.  While it would not have resolved all the issues, it would have gone some way in that regard and certainly warranted further consideration, although that did not happen.  It happened in County Clare many years ago, when a proper rural resettlement programme was attempted.  Homeless people were moved to County Clare and it worked.  I spoke to a person earlier who told me it did not work perfectly but was quite effective.</p> <p> The Government has set its eyes on continual proposals for new buildings throughout the country but I do not believe that is the correct approach.  It is one approach but it is not the correct one.  The purchase of houses has been considered but in many cases people have been evicted as a result.  Constituents of mine have competed with the council to buy houses but were unable to buy because they were unable to compete.  Approximately two weeks ago, I received a call in that regard from a lady whose son was trying his best to start off in life.  I can only assume that what she told me is true.  She stated the council outbid her son, although it is an open market and anybody is entitled to buy a house.  In many cases, people who live in such houses contact me because they have received a letter to the effect that the council has bought their house and they will become homeless.</p></speech>

If a council intends to purchase a house where people live, I assume they are not allowed to stay in the house.  Where do they go?  They receive a letter to tell them they must leave.  It has happened numerous times in my constituency.  I will search the archives for letters related to the matter.  I am not raising something that is not a fact on the ground in my area.  It makes common sense to me that if a house with someone living in it is purchased, he or she can be either left to remain or evicted.</p>  <p>  I return to the issue of rural resettlement programmes.  Whether it is in Rosscarbery, Goleen, Allihies, Ballinspittle, it does not matter.  The bottom line is there are many vacant properties in towns and many vacant rooms above shops.  There should be an incentive for the owners of such properties to make them available.  It does not matter what country the people are from, whether they are Irish or some other nationality, but if there is a potential home for them, it should be explored.  It could remove many of the thousands of homeless people from the crisis they face.  They would be able to live in a local rural community where there are plenty of spaces in the schools, and fabulous playgrounds and community spaces, instead of sleeping rough or being piled into a hotel room in difficult circumstances that should not be accepted.  It is just one measure that should be more seriously examined.  It was discussed at great length when creating the programme for Government but it has not been worked on since the formation of the Government.  The Government showed interest in it but did not follow through on it.</p>  <p>  Another difficulty is that people who want a loan to start off their life with their own home cannot secure one.  They are in a trap.  Banks will not give them a loan because their earnings might not be the best and many of them pay rent in any event.  Unfortunately, not all the schemes the Government has introduced to enable people to secure loans have been very successful.  Some of the schemes have been successful but more have not.  It is very difficult for many families and puts them into the social housing bracket.  Many such families do not want to be in that position but are forced into a corner and cannot secure a loan from the banks.  The banks have been tough.  They have evicted people and have been tough on them at the most difficult time in their lives.  Every day I speak to people who face losing their home.  Nothing could be worse than to think that after one has set up one's home with one's partner or children, one is undergoing difficult circumstances but is being played.  Circumstances are being made very difficult for people.  They are being brought close to the edge, perhaps over the edge in many cases.  The Government needs to have a stronger voice against the banks and stand up to them.  It needs to tell them that what they are doing is not acceptable.  There are ways and means of stopping such tactics being used against ordinary people.  </p>  <p>  While we often speak about social housing, nobody is ever worried about social housing on the islands, where there is often little or none.  Island life is dying.  There are eight islands off the coast of west County Cork but I do not know when funding was last made available for social housing on them, whether on Bere Island, Whiddy Island, Long Island, Cape Clear Island, Sherkin Island or any of the others.  People are crying out for social housing on the islands but cannot get it and are being forced to the mainland for housing.  Residents have a vision of a future in rural Ireland and want to live there, including on the islands, because there is a great way of life there but the supports to allow them to live there are not provided.  It would be another way to take the pressure off the cities and larger towns, which are under great pressure.</p>  <p>  We must also examine county development plans which, in my constituency, allow ten additional houses in a rural town and village.  That is perfectly natural and in some cases, the allowance might be for 50 or even 100 houses.  Let us take Ballinspittle in my constituency as an example.  A number of additional houses will be allowed in the lifetime of the plan, which is approximately five years.  It is good because Ballinspittle is close to Cork and has great potential.  There is an issue with the sewerage facilities, however, and the houses cannot be built.  A does not talk to B, from what I can gather.  There is no point in having someone drawing up a plan and spending all those hours.  Another is probably being drawn up but it is fantasy land.</p><p>It is wasting the time of councillors and officials.  In a town like Ballinspittle, a very simple solution has been proposed and it could resolve the issue but it has not even been examined.  The proposed solution would not cost an arm and a leg and it could be replicated throughout west Cork.  There are small towns and villages that want to grow and bring people back to the town in order to save the existing facilities but there is no aid from the Government to do it.</p> <p> We really are lacking the vision to go forward.  We are contemplating the purchase of more land and houses, as well as building more houses, but there will never be an end to this.  The people who want planning permission to build in their home areas cannot get the loans to allow them to get their lives together.  We have been aiding and abetting this process instead of tackling the problem.  There is crisis in rural planning permission applications.  Young people are finding it increasingly difficult to get approval for planning permission and if people get a job in a small town or village and want to build, they are told they need to be there for seven years before doing so.  They cannot establish themselves in the area.  It is the same story for people who have spent all their lives in an area; if the authorities can find any excuse to prevent planning permission, they will do everything in their power to bring that about.  These couples or individuals are being forced towards social housing.</p> <p> What else can they do?  The list of 10,000 people will stay at 10,000 next year and in the years that follow.  The figure will probably grow; it certainly will not decrease.  We will not be able to sustain the building of houses.  We must look at what is there already.  I stated earlier that there is ample housing in rural towns and villages and that is what we must look to in order to resolve the problem.  I accept that this approach will not solve the problem completely.  I am not as foolish as to say that.  It will certainly knock many people of the list that the Government has been trying to defend over a number of years.  I saw a school shutting in Goleen and post offices closing in Ballineen and Allihies recently.  I could speak about them all night.  A credit union in Drimoleague and a butcher shop in Ballinspittle have also closed, along with a shop in Kilbrittain.  There are plenty of examples in the bigger towns as well.  Those towns are not avoiding the chop either.  There is no vision to repopulate these places.</p> <p> This vision could have been developed during the discussions that led up to the formation of the Government if Fine Gael had worked with people who have done this already in County Clare and other places.  They were hungry to make a success of this.  Mistakes might have been made along the way and we might not have housed 10,000 people; we might have housed 3,000 or 4,000.  We could have given people back their lives, their dignity and respect.  We have little or no respect for the people on the street.  I will meet them when I walk along the street tonight in Rathmines.  They want &euro;5 for food or &euro;9 for the Internet caf&eacute;.  It is the same story in my county of Cork.  They will come from everywhere to my constituency clinics in Cork South-West.  They will come from the more populated areas of Clonakilty, Bandon, Skibbereen and Castletownbere in particular.  It is the same story of people sleeping in a camper van or car because they cannot get on a social housing list, or if they can, they have been on it for years.  There is a plethora of issues and we are inundated with them.</p> <p> We are trying our best to resolve this issue.  We work very closely with the council and to the best of our ability so people can be rehoused.  I do not like naming people but there is a Mr. Healy in west Cork who has done tremendous work to help those who are homeless.  He is a saint in his own right.  Although I should not name individuals, he works very hard and he has been so good to people in dreadful circumstances.  I pity those people because I am human.  I assume the Minister of State is the same.  We would like to resolve these problems.</p> <p> The Government has not tackled this issue properly.  It should approach it from several angles rather than just one, which the Government is doing in planning for and building houses while nothing is really happening on the ground.  The Minister of State might indicate that will happen next year and he should please tell me if it will.  The Government should have looked at rural resettlement, as those towns and villages would have taken thousands of people right through the country.  It was an awful mistake not to do this.  There was an interest in this while the programme for Government was being negotiated but I did not join the Government because I did not think Fine Gael was genuine.  I was right.  This is one of my highest priorities and while one Minister may have shown interest, others were not.  I am not pointing a finger at the Minister of State but the reason for this lack of interest was that there was not much rural blood in the Government.  That is still the case.  The Government still has an opportunity to act, although we are in the dying hours of its time in office.  Most people accept that.  There is still a chance to turn this around.  I would like the Minister of State to be around the Cabinet table looking at the opportunity and seeing if rural resettlement is an option.  It is certainly a way of helping to alleviate the current crisis.</p> <p> There must be close examination of legislation to help young people looking for planning permission to build.  Why is the Government making it so difficult?  People cannot get loans and they are on bended knee because they do not want to look for social housing.  I accept not everybody is like that.  They are getting no assistance from banks and the planning decisions in this country are questionable.  A couple came to me recently in my constituency office who put their financial position before me.  They had no alternative only to go on the social housing list despite not wanting a council house.  They wanted to see if it was possible for them to get a loan from the bank to buy a house.  I am no expert but I knew they could not do it.  They wanted to see if they could buy a site and build but because of the current position with banks, they were unable to do so and sort out their future.  This is what we should have been doing from the word "go" and not just in the years since I was elected.  This is something that should have been seen coming down the line.  We should have known we would be in a position where hundreds or thousands of people face homelessness.</p> <p> The Government has left this unfortunate situation spiral out of control.  Unfortunately, we are where we are.  Nothing the Government has tried to date has worked as the numbers have stayed the same.  The difficulty I have is to try to help people in my constituency.  I have no problem with anybody following me on Friday when I will have ten clinics from Kinsale to Castletownbere, taking in Clonakilty, Bandon, Skibbereen, Bantry and Schull.  It does not matter where it because I am guaranteed that 50% of my time will be spent on housing, trying to see if I can resolve people's problems.  These people are eight or ten years on housing lists and at the end of their tether.</p> <p> In the eight years that Fine Gael has been in government, the housing crisis and homelessness has reaching an alarming level.  Little to nothing has been done in real terms to improve this position.</p></speech>

There were wide and varied matters raised and although they may not all relate to the Bill, I will try to address some of them.</p>  <p>  I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate, particularly those who put the work in to see what is in the legislation and what we are trying to do.  We are not seeking to add red tape, rather we want to reinforce the voluntary code that already exists, improve the housing body sector and make it easier for these to do business and raise finance.  It is about having trust in the system and protect these organisations, as well as taxpayers' money.  Most people understand what we are trying to achieve and accept it.  I hope the Bill will get through the House quite quickly in order that we can get on with other debates and business.</p>  <p>  I welcome and am encouraged by the level of support for the Bill and the recognition of the important work done by the interim regulator, the regulatory committee and approved housing bodies in advance of statutory regulation.</p><p>I also recognise the voluntary code that they all accepted and worked with over the past couple of years.</p> <p> I am confident that, working with Deputies, this important legislation can be progressed quickly to build on the momentum of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and work in the social housing sector.  Some Deputies expressed a fear last night that the housing bodies are the only option and are taking over.  I often hear that concern at council level too.  That is not the case.  Housing bodies work in tandem with local authorities and, very often, under the direction and guidance of local authorities, along with our Department, on many sites.  They are an addition to the system and have proved effective in many cases, certainly when it comes to managing their housing stock and tenants.  We can work with them and learn from them but they are not a threat to local authorities.  I know that some councillors feel they have less power in this area.  I have asked the approved housing bodies to engage more with councillors, through council meetings and so forth, to build that relationship.  I have also stressed to councillors that they need to develop relationships with approved housing bodies, get to know them and work with them closely.  I sometimes think it is a throwback to previous times when councillors felt that they owned council houses and could dish them out to their people.  It is hard for them to understand that proper housing legislation and methods for dealing with the allocation of housing mean decisions on housing allocation are not for individual councillors or politicians to take.  The system must be fair to everybody.  It is important we recognise that.  Housing bodies, working with local authorities, help us to increase the delivery of houses on and off balance sheet, which is what we are trying to do.  It increases the supply of social housing and that is what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p> I will address some of the important issues raised during the debate last night and tonight.  A number of Deputies last night raised the important issue of the classification of approved housing bodies following the EUROSTAT decision.  This Bill will not be an impediment to reclassification.  It was being designed long before the reclassification issue arose.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have been clear that the classification treatment of AHBs will not affect ambitious plans under Rebuilding Ireland as AHBs are earmarked to play a critical role in contributing one third of the 50,000 social homes due to be delivered under the plan, and more thereafter.  It is important to examine what measures could be taken in the medium to long term to develop the AHB sector which could lead to reclassification.  My Department has been engaging with the sector and the Department of Finance on this important issue for the past 12 weeks or more.  It must be accepted, however, that this will most likely be a longer-term objective.  It is not the most urgent issue in the Department, although we recognise that it must be addressed.  Many issues remain to be teased out.  Some of the proposals extend beyond housing policy and will require in-depth analysis.  I compliment the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, which is doing a large amount of work in this area, including with Department officials as they try to progress the issue.</p> <p> The issue of credit unions was raised last night.  Deputies Cassells and Jan O'Sullivan referred to credit union involvement in funding special purpose vehicles.  The House has discussed this matter on a number of occasions.  I would very much welcome the involvement of credit unions and their funds in social housing.  There are other projects where there is scope for credit union involvement.  As I have stated numerous times, there is a great match between the provision of housing for older people and credit union funds.  I hope we will be able to match up these two areas much better.  The credit unions have been pushing to do that.</p> <p> The Department, aware of Central Bank changes, has supported this initiative in conjunction with the ICSH and encouraged engagement between the sector and the credit unions.  The framework is in place and it is primarily a matter for the credit unions to progress.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan indicated that the Government needed to do more to bring these two sides together but we are not allowed to do that as this is private money that is separate from the Government.  We cannot put the two sides together or make this happen.  The Government must stand back slightly.  We designed the framework and funded the ICSH to design different solutions and research different models.  We worked with the sector.  The Central Bank can make changes but the Government cannot force this to happen.  It must happen naturally because it involves access to finance that is not taxpayers' money.</p> <p> I want to be clear on this issue because people are probably beginning to doubt me.  I have met representatives of the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, numerous times and they have indicated that they have completed all of the work necessary to underpin an investor special purpose vehicle, SPV, but have not yet formally established it as a corporate entity as the cost involved would not be justified until such a time as a clear investment opportunity is available.  The SPV is ready and can be switched on in a matter of days.  It is not a complicated business and the work on it has been done.  I have said this for months and I have encouraged some of the players and stakeholders to engage with them and try to draw down that money.  It is not that the case that the credit union movement is not ready.  There is a model in place if some of the AHBs are of a mind to avail of it.  I cannot be any clearer on that.  It is important to note that the reclassification decision does not prevent AHBs from accessing private finance and I want to be very clear on that.  Three AHBs have been successful in securing private finance.  Oaklee Housing has done so through a German bank and two others have done so through Allied Irish Banks.  We are not impeding the AHBs in that regard.</p> <p> I will revert to Deputy &Oacute; Broin if I do not cover all the points he raised last night.  He noted that local authorities are not included in the Bill.  As statutory bodies in their own right, local authorities should not be covered by this Bill and it would not be appropriate to include them.  The focus of the Bill is the regulation of the AHB sector.  AHBs are not statutory bodies.</p> <p> The established practice in appointing board members to the regulator is to use the Public Appointments Service process and that is the clear intention here.  We can clarify that matter further should the Deputy require but that is the plan.</p> <p> The Deputy's point on regulatory co-operation was well made.  Our view was probably that this issue had been covered under the memorandum of understanding between the regulators.  We tried to avoid complication, conflict and duplication but I will be happy to discuss with the Deputy whether we need to strengthen the wording or revisit the issue. </p> <p> On tenancy management, the regulator will look at the policies of AHBs in respect of their tenancies, whereas the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, will continue to deal with the relationship between AHBs, landlords and tenants.  The RTB was empowered to initiate investigations of its own volition and, as such, restricting the regulator in this area would not make sense.  If I misunderstood Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I would be happy to tease out the issue with him.  The Deputy and other speakers referred to bringing the whole regulatory system together, including social housing and the general housing stock.  The local authorities do a good job in this area, which is well managed.  If there are issues the Deputy wants to tease out, we can look at them, although not in this Bill.  I understand the point he makes.</p> <p> Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised the important issue of the merging of AHBs.  While the Department acknowledges that the merger process has been slow and few mergers have taken place, we support and encourage mergers.  We will be happy to discuss suggestions as to how to do encourage it further.  Mergers would make sense in some cases.  We are happy to allow for that over a period of time.</p> <p> Fees were also mentioned by a few Deputies, including Deputy O'Sullivan.  While the Bill does include provision for the charging of fees by the regulator, it is not intended to charge fees in the initial stages of the operation on the grounds that this would be a further regulatory burden.  However, fees will be discussed with the regulator at some stage.  I do not believe it is intended to apply excessive fees, which will probably just cover costs.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked last night what kinds of figures were being bandied about.  I have heard large sums mentioned by others but the Department has not discussed the matter.  Charges will be discussed at the appropriate time but we do not believe it is necessary to charge fees now.</p> <p> Deputy Pringle raised the issue of duplication of regulators and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others raised a similar issue when they stated there were too many regulators.  I assure the Deputies that there will be no duplication.  A system is already in place under the voluntary code through the agency and we do not seek to add more red tape.  This is a transition from voluntary to statutory regulation which will build on existing infrastructure in the housing agency.  Provision is made for the transfer of staff from the housing agency to the regulator.  There have been excellent examples, and we all know them, of housing associations and housing bodies up and down the country doing great work.  They also need to be protected and there have been odd cases where these bodies have not had best practice in operation.  We are trying to encourage best practice.  The sector wants this regulation and it is not a case of introducing more red tape that it does not want.  Housing bodies want to be protected in a system that everybody trusts and has faith in and helps them to raise money and carry out their business.</p> <p> Deputy Mattie McGrath, as usual, made a very passionate contribution about an AHB in his locality.  I am familiar with the AHB in question and the work it does and there are many other AHBs in Tipperary and around the country that have done good work.  I assure the Deputy that the Bill respects the size of AHBs and the compliance requirements will be proportionate to the size and scale of the AHB sector.  Section 38 of the Bill provides for this and it was raised again by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v tonight.  It is recognised that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation is not suitable for the AHB sector as there is a wide diversity of organisations in terms of aims, objectives and ambitions.  While a minimum level of regulation will apply to all AHBs, more intensive regulation will apply to the larger housing bodies, which is common sense.  This will depend on the size, scale and level of financial risk associated with the development plans of the individual AHB.  Some of the AHBs are large and we encourage that.  Some of the major players intend to do much more in conjunction with local authorities, councillors, public representatives and public bodies.  We will facilitate that but it also highlights the need for proper regulation.  Those were some of the issues that were raised last night.</p><p> On the issues raised this evening, I will try to deal as many as I can.  Deputy Michael Collins is still in the Chamber and I will answer his points.  The issue of islands was raised.  We support social housing if the local authority wants to do that.  We, as a Department, do not lecture local authorities or tell them where to put each individual house or what scheme to bring forward.  We work with them on that, but they bring forward suggestions to us about where the need is and who needs the homes.  We are happy to work with them on that.  There have been schemes on one island that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v represents where an approved housing body wished to remove itself from the provision of housing because there was not a demand for its housing.  There are different situations on different islands, but it is something we would support when needs be.  It is, however, a local authority decision by councillors.  I am sure Members have councillors working with them on that.  If there is need for housing on a certain island, the case should be brought forward.  The funding is there to roll out social housing.  That is what we are trying to do.  We have encouraged local authorities everywhere to increase their pipelines of projects and bring forward more projects.  If there is a specific area that Members wish to mention, they should bring it through their local authority and bring it to our desk or consult an AHB which might be glad to work with them on such a project.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, recently established an interdepartmental group to consider island issues in general.  One issue raised was social housing, so the issue has been flagged and we are happy to respond to that, if there is a proven need.  There is money there for it.</p> <p> On islands and their needs, something that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae often raises, and he raised it last night again, is that there is no rural social one-off housing.  There can be but that is a request of a local authority.  Officials in my Department cannot work out where an individual one-off rural house is needed, but the schemes are there.  Some local authorities choose not to bring them forward, or rather they concentrate their efforts on larger-scale developments of ten or 20 units.  They can bring them forward if they want, and the various schemes exist under which one-off rural social houses can be built, if need be, whether on an island or anywhere else.  Last night Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said there were only 12 in the whole of Kerry in recent years.  That is a Kerry decision, not a Department decision, and I want to be very clear about that.  If people have issues, they should engage with the local authorities to see what the real issues are behind that.  The Department does try to facilitate things where there is a need for housing in a certain area.</p> <p> In fairness, Deputy Michael Collins did mention the rural resettlement scheme, and I totally agree with him on that.  There is scope there.  We did engage with one of his colleagues and other, but I have not heard him mention it before.  Maybe he did and I missed it, but if it such a big issue for him, I am happy to work with him on it.  There is a scheme in place.  It was mentioned during the Government formation talks - I was not there - and some of the Deputies who mentioned it no longer form part of the Government, but some of them did pursue it afterwards, kept in touch with us, and we have worked with them on it.  We looked at the Clare model and who was engaged there.  About 800 households would have been facilitated over a long number of years through the rural resettlement scheme.  It might not be the thousands the Deputy said but maybe it could be.  It is something we would like to put on a more formal footing.</p> <p> Resettlement is catered and allowed for under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, where it is possible to transfer.  If someone is in Dublin and wants to live in Mayo or Cork, for example, he or she can use the HAP scheme to do so.  The limit is slightly different between counties but movement is facilitated.  If it is not working, then we would be happy to engage with the Deputy on it.  We want to make it more formal because there is a lot of potential there.  If families do not have a home in Dublin, Meath or Cork and want to move to a different county, we are very happy for them to engage with us and express an interest.  We will work with them to do that.  I want to be clear on that.  It is not just a housing matter.  Other services need to be put in to make it a viable option for people, but it is something that we should do and encourage.  We are looking to develop the passport model whereby people would be able to be on waiting lists in a number of different local authorities and they would be notified if something that suited came up in a different area.</p> <p> The Deputy made the point that there are vacant houses in some counties and areas.  We now have vacant homes officers in every county and there is a target in the vacant housing plan.  There are a range of schemes that the local authorities can avail of or use if there are vacant properties.  These properties are generally owned by people privately.  If the Deputy wishes to spend his time finding 20 or 30 vacant properties and encouraging the owners to come forward to avail of our schemes, we are very happy to do that.  I keep telling everybody - councillors, Deputies and so on - that if they are aware of vacant properties in their areas, they know who owns them, the history behind them, and the complications that go with that, the Department is happy to work on solutions if they want to bring them forward to our vacant homes officers.</p> <p> There are a range of schemes in place that are being underutilised.  I scratch my head sometimes why this is so when I see vacant properties, because there are some very attractive schemes in place.  The repair and lease back is one of them that is very attractive.  If a person has a vacant home, and it could one of those over the shop premises on a street that could need &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 to bring it up to standard, we can provide that with a grant and the owner can repay that over the years with the rental income.  It is a very attractive scheme, and yet there is a very small uptake of it.  We may change it to make it more attractive.  The Deputy may or may not have heard of the scheme, but perhaps he could encourage the people he knows who have these vacant properties to take up the scheme.  Likewise, local authorities can become involved in the purchase and renew scheme.  Whether on a high street or rural area, if there is a need for social housing and there is a house that is dilapidated or in poor condition, resources are provided for the local authority to buy the house and draw down resources to bring it back up to a high standard to make it a home.  Absolutely we would like to see vacant properties back in use.  It is total common sense, and we are all for it.  None of us likes walking down any street or driving through any town, village or rural area and seeing vacant properties.  We are very much engaged in that space.  We do not have the resources to go chasing after every property - I wish we did - so we need people like the Deputy to bring the properties forward.  We have asked local authorities that if they have someone who needs a house on the one hand and someone on the other who has a house, they should bring them together.  That can be looked at as well.  The Deputy should get involved in that if he wants to raise it as well.</p> <p> I took issue with the Deputy earlier and do so again.  I do not believe that any local authority has evicted anyone from a private house that it has bought.  If the Deputy has proof of that or has a letter saying that, I want to see it and he should bring it in.  I ask him please, not to come in here and tell me that local authorities are buying houses and evicting people to put someone else in.  I do not think that is true.  If it is true, I want to know about it and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, would also like to know about it.  Local authorities are encouraged and facilitated, and money is provided, to buy vacant properties and places.  They generally do not compete with the private sector.  I certainly would not believe that they are buying up houses with people in them and putting them out.  The Deputy has a chance to take it back if it is not true or he does not have proof.  If he has the proof, he should bring it in, but it is unfair to say it if it is not true.  It would be wrong and a very wrong statement to make.  In many places where a house can be bought cheaper than it would cost to build or replace and no one else is chasing it or wants it, we encourage local authorities to buy it.  It makes common sense.  In other cases they are involved in turnkey properties or in purchase and renew, but we ask them to focus their efforts mainly on building new houses, which is what they are doing.  Naturally, if there are good deals for taxpayers and there are vacant properties or houses lying empty, it makes sense to acquire them.  Not everyone agrees with that policy.  I agree with it because to me it makes total sense.  It makes sense in many areas where it would cost more to build a house than buy one.  It should not be at the expense of someone else, and they always try not to compete.  They would be very slow to buy a house in most cases and would hang back to see if anyone else wanted to buy it first.  If the Deputy has different information on that, it is something we will look at again.  Certainly with vacant properties, funding will be provided if local authorities want to buy the houses and renovate them.</p> <p> The Deputy referred to planning permission.  There are guidelines.  I am often in rural Cork where there are many houses built.  I keep hearing people say in the House that there are no one-off houses or that planning has been stopped.  An average of 5,000 one-off houses have been built every year in recent years.  It is not true to say that there are none, that we are against it, or that Fine Gael wants to stop it.  Yes, it has got more complicated because there are many more houses being built in rural areas.  It is harder environmentally to pass every field.  There have been changes on the social and economic need to live in a rural house.  There is an encouragement and the planners' philosophy is to group houses together.  Tipperary brought forward a lovely scheme recently to encourage a rural housing scheme as a solution to building one-off houses.  There is a high cost to individuals of one-off houses to provide water, sewerage and everything else to the site, so sometimes the Government has a duty to provide other options.  We look at all options, but it is not true to say that there are no one-off houses.  I was in the Deputy's area recently and I know that is not true because I saw many one-off houses being built, some of them fine houses.</p> <p> There are issues of the public accessing finance and so on, which we are trying to work on, but it is untrue that the loan scheme we brought forward has been unsuccessful.  It has been more than successful and has been too successful in the drawdown.  It does not suit everyone - I accept that - and I know the point the Deputy was making.  In some cases people argue that the banks are not making money available.  The Central Bank rules are independent of the Government but they are there to protect people against overborrowing.  All of us here know far too many people who overborrowed.  I certainly know people of my generation, left, right and centre, who were lured into overborrowing and into paying far too much for a house.  We are trying to avoid that, which is why the bank rules are there.  That is not to stop someone with a viable proposal to build a house.  We have affordable housing schemes.  Cork brought forward a lot, not to mention Kinsale, where there are great developments with affordable housing.  We want to do more of that.</p><p>Naturally, when we can use State-owned land to build affordable housing, we should do so and we will.  We will do more on that issue.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made a point earlier, and he was nearly boasting at one stage which I was surprised by, when he quoted the figures from 2004 to 2011.  I would be embarrassed if I was in the Government from 2004 to 2011 because it only built 33,000 social houses in boom years of high level activity.  In one year alone some 90,000 houses were built and the Deputy could stand there and nearly say it was a great achievement to have built 33,000 social houses.  It is because there were so few social houses built in those years that we have a problem today.  Social housing should have been kept at a high level of activity all the way through those years.  Policies were changed to stop more or less local authorities building social houses in many cases.  When we got the finance together - Deputy Jan O'Sullivan started this when she was in that Department along with Deputies Penrose and Kelly and ourselves when we got a hold of that brief - we tried to turn that around to put local authorities back in the space of building social houses.</p> <p> A commitment was made, in conjunction with this House, to build a minimum of 10,000 social houses.  I accept some Members want to build more and that is fine but we made a commitment to build a minimum of 10,000.  That meant going from practically zero up to 10,000.  That is what the level was at in some of those boom years.  In the year that 90,000 houses were built in this country, less than 5,000 of them were for social housing.  That is not something to be proud of.  It is something the Government tried to fix and I hope future Governments, be they Fine Gael-led or not, will also make sure we stick to a certain level of social housing builds every year.  We have a plan to deliver 10,000 social houses a year.  That is this year.  I know they are not all brand new builds.  Over 6,000 will be brand new builds and some will be acquired or leased but there will be 10,000 additional social houses available this year.  Next year, it will be up on 11,000 and under Project Ireland 2040, with the ten-year capital money set aside, it goes to 12,000 social houses a year.  That is our commitment and I ask everybody else to match or go beyond it because nobody else has matched it with commitments.  We are trying to make it happen but for Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to come in here and try to compare 2004 to 2011 with 2011 to 2016, when the country was broke and when he handed us over an overdraft of &euro;20 billion per year in spend and to try to claim that from 2011 to 2014 the Government did not build enough houses is not being realistic.</p> <p> We started building houses again the first chance we got when there was money available, and rightly so, and we are still playing catch-up.  That is why tonight there are still far too many families who do not have a house.  It did not happen overnight.  It happened because of housing failures for many years in this country.  Land was managed in the wrong way and the wrong approach to building social housing was taken.  It will take time to correct that fully but we are going in the right direction.  We need to keep doing this and keep adding 10,000 to 12,000 social houses a year every year.  That is how the housing shortage will be addressed.  That is only social housing.  State-owned land and State resources also need to be used to finance and make affordable housing available.  When we do that, we must also try to activate private land with resources.  We have to do that for a long number of years with long-term plans.  To build 33,000 social houses in seven or eight of the busiest years for housing construction is an embarrassment and we would not have 1,700 families without a house today if that was not the case in those years.  They were wasted years when it comes to housing and at the same time people were paying &euro;0.5 million for houses that were not worth that money and being choked with mortgages for 30 or 40 years.  I am surprised that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made that point.  I might agree with other parts of what he said but not on that point.</p> <p> The discussion was also about approved housing bodies and their roles, the housing supply in general and homelessness versus rough sleepers.  I am glad Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v tried to make the distinction there and I agree with him on that because those matters are often confused.  Again, I see that some of our non-governmental organisations, NGOs, when they discuss homeless families, produce pictures of someone living on the street.  There are not families living on the street.  Sadly, there are far too many people sleeping rough who are on the streets.  They are individuals in different situations with different stories and we have the housing first approach which is a great help to try to encourage those people to come in off the streets, avail of the services and eventually live in a house.  There is no reason for anyone to be living on the street or for anyone to be living in a van.  I am not saying we have a house for everybody but there are a lot of other supports that are a lot better than living on the street and if we keep intervening enough, there is no reason for anyone to be living on the street.  It happens for different reasons but it does not happen to families.  There are far too many families in family-hubs or hotels.  I know that and I am not trying to deny that.  We try to find them a family home but there is no reason for someone to be living in a van as Deputy Michael Collins has said, or for someone to be living on the street.  If the Deputy knows someone living on the street, he should ask him or her to engage with our services.  There are an extra 20 care workers on the streets on a nightly basis trying to ask people to come in to avail of our services.  Wherever we think there is a need we provide more emergency beds.  That is not the end solution, it is just the start of getting someone back into a house.  Naturally, while we build more houses and increase the supply of housing, we can provide even more solutions.</p> <p> Other issues were mentioned around water, sewerage and investment, which were also mentioned last night.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has raised the issue with Irish Water and Deputy Brassil raised it last night as well.  There are complications there and we have seen that on a lot of social housing sites.  Again, Deputy Michael Collins might have said nothing is happening but there are about 300 social housing sites open today with over 6,000 social houses under construction.  People can see that.  They are not fools and they know things are happening.  It might not be quick enough but it is certainly a lot more than nothing.  We have got reports of delays with Irish Water from a lot of those sites.  We have got reports of delays or complications at private sites and in some cases we have tried to service these sites as well.  We acknowledge there is a lot of progress to be made there.  Irish Water has a capital budget and it is spending it but we need to do things more quickly in some cases and we need to change it and catch up.  Irish Water is catching up and we can do that.</p> <p> On the control issue that Deputy Michael Collins raised, it is not that we mistrust local authorities.  There was a scheme in place to allow local authorities do housing schemes of up to &euro;2 million, without having to go through all the stages in the Department.  They chose not to use that in most cases.  That was their choice.  There was a discussion last year to bring it up to &euro;6 million but that has not happened yet and it is still being discussed.  We are not convinced it is the right way.  Everyone keeps telling me the four stage process is causing all the delays in social housing but it is not because we have changed that process to a possible 59 weeks.  The majority, about 80% of proposals, are coming in a little bit over that at about 60 weeks but it is not taking years as it did years ago.  We have changed that process.  I have seen schemes that took four to ten years in the past.  I believe those days are gone and they should be gone because we track every scheme now.  Local authorities are not telling me the four stage process or the rules therein is causing the delays.  If all those stages were taken out, six weeks might be saved in some cases.  There might be genuine disputes and disagreements between our officials and local authority officials in some cases and there might be toing and froing on that.  I often say we should forget the emails and phonecalls and meet in the middle to sort it out and they generally do so.  That might cause delays but on the majority of sites there is no reason why it cannot go through quite quickly.  Even if the control mechanism was changed and the four stage process was moved away from, it would not give us houses any more quickly.  We can have all these discussions but I am not sure it would achieve anything.  We have reformed the system, which is making changes and allows for change.</p> <p> I have only touched on some of the issues that were raised and there are probably others as well.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Broin had more questions and I had a note on them but I do not know where I left it so if I have missed anything I ask that he let me know.  The last thing I will mention is the tenant purchase scheme, which was raised by a few Members.  It has been dragging on far too long.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and a few others raised that as well as some of the Members speaking last night.  It is proposed to bring that forward in the coming weeks around the social housing package.  I strongly believe there should be a tenant purchase scheme, and a tenant purchase option for people to buy a house.  The current scheme says that one has to prove an income of over &euro;15,000 to qualify.  It is a generous scheme in terms of the discount one gets on the house but the &euro;15,000 is a block to some people who might have the money from winning the lotto or who might have otherwise found the money to buy the house.  We are trying to find a way for that to be encouraged.  The science behind the &euro;15,000 requirement and the reason it is there is because generally, to be able to maintain a house after buying it, one would need to have an income of some sort over &euro;15,000 in most cases and that is well proven.  We are trying to see how we can facilitate that and if we can find a way that if a family or an individual can prove they can finance the purchase of a house and maintain it thereafter, we want to find the space to do that because we want to encourage tenant purchases where it is at all possible.</p> <p> There were probably more matters raised but I will leave it at that because my time is probably nearly up at this stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500057#KKK01000"><p>I am pleased to present the Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019 to the House.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the exchange of criminal record information between Ireland and other EU member states.  The Bill will transpose Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from the criminal records between member states.  It will also transpose the associated Council Decision 2009/316/JHA on the establishment of the European criminal records information system, ECRIS, in application of Article Il of the framework decision, which provides for the format and other ways of organising and facilitating exchanges of information on convictions.  These EU instruments provide for this information exchange between member states.</p> <p> The key framework decision to be transposed within this Bill was developed and agreed at member state level in response to the wishes expressed by the European Council a number of years ago.  At the time, it was agreed that significant value was to be derived from a system allowing the reliable exchange of criminal record information between member states, particularly in the context of free movement across borders.  The need to share such information and the guiding principles for doing so form the basis of the relevant framework decision, while the format and detail involved in the transmission of criminal record information is set out in the associated relevant Council decision, which established ECRIS.</p> <p> ECRIS was designed to achieve an efficient, uniform exchange of information on criminal convictions between EU member states and to ensure that an individual's criminal conviction was effectively communicated and stored regardless of where in the EU that person was convicted of the offence.  The ECRIS Council decision implemented the principles underpinning its associated Council framework decision in order to build and develop a computerised system of exchange of information on convictions between member states.  The framework decision required the establishment of "a standardised format allowing information to be exchanged in a uniform, electronic and easily computer-translatable way".  The resulting ECRIS was ultimately established in April 2012 in order to improve this exchange of information on criminal records throughout the EU.  All EU countries are currently connected to ECRIS.</p> <p> The Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill which I am introducing to the House today transposes these European instruments into Irish law.  This system allows for the transfer of criminal record information between member states for use in criminal investigations and proceedings, and for other relevant proceedings and matters where the sharing of this information is warranted.  It also creates a specific obligation on each member state to inform other member states when their citizens are convicted of criminal offences.</p> <p> In a European area of freedom, security and justice, every effort must be made to ensure an effective European response to criminal activities, in particular serious cross-border crime and terrorism.  The European agenda on security highlights the need to maximise EU measures on information exchange and operational co-operation.  The rapid and efficient exchange of information extracted from criminal records between competent member state central authorities is important if we are to avoid national courts passing sentences on the sole basis of past convictions registered in national criminal records, with no knowledge of convictions in other member states, thus allowing criminals to escape their past by moving between member states.  Within the ECRIS framework, each EU state is responsible for establishing a central authority for operating the information flow relating to criminal records within their state.  The national vetting bureau, NVB, of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been designated as the central authority for Ireland.  Pending legislation, the NVB exchanges this information with other member states on an administrative basis and in accordance with the framework decision.  This Bill will put these procedures on a statutory basis.</p> <p> The proposed Bill would not give the Garda new powers, but rather codify the procedures which apply to the exchange of criminal records information on EU nationals with other countries in the EU.  Currently, the NVB conducts four core actions within this framework.  It submits requests to the central authorities of other member states for extracts from their national criminal records in respect of nationals of the member state concerned in instances where the information is required in connection with criminal proceedings in this country; responds to requests from central authorities in other member states for extracts from Ireland's criminal records database in respect of Irish nationals, in instances where the information is required in connection with criminal proceedings in the other member state; receives, stores, and updates where necessary Ireland's criminal records database with relevant information received from central authorities in other member states in respect of Irish nationals convicted in those other member states; and transmits information, and any necessary updates, in respect of criminal convictions imposed in Ireland on all nationals of other EU member states to the central authority of that member state of the convicted person.</p> <p> Something as sensitive as an individual's criminal record should be subject to the most stringent protections available when it comes to translating, transmitting, and using the information contained therein.  The coming into force of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, and the law enforcement directive have established new data protection standards and provided for significant reforms to previous data protection rules.  Ireland's Data Protection Act 2018 has given effect to GDPR and transposed the law enforcement directive.  The material impact of this new data protection regime on our careful transposition of this ECRIS framework and Council decisions has been considerable, and this Bill has been subject to extensive and detailed consultation with both the Office of the Attorney General and the European Commission over the past 12 to 18 months.  I note that the Data Protection Act 2018, and the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, as retained by the 2018 Act, apply to personal data held by the national vetting bureau in respect of any criminal record information that may be transmitted under the provisions of this Bill.  This Bill and its parent framework decision also allow any person to obtain information on their own criminal record, and to have any incorrect data corrected or deleted.</p> <p> I turn now to the contents and provisions of the Bill itself.  The Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill consists of fifteen sections and four schedules.  Section 1 is a standard provision defining words and phrases used in the Act.  Section 2 provides for the designation of a central authority as required by the framework decision.  The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is designated as the central authority.  Section 3 provides for the recording, when available, of the nationality or nationalities of EU nationals who are convicted of an offence.  This information is necessary to ensure relevant central authorities throughout the EU can have up-to-date information in relation to a person's convictions.</p> <p> Section 4 provides that the Irish central authority, when available, must transmit criminal record information to the relevant central authority in the member state of a person's nationality.  Any update and subsequent change, including deletion of this information, must also be transmitted to the relevant member state's central authority.  Section 5 provides for the storage of information received from other member states relating to convictions in member states of Irish nationals.</p> <p> Section 6 provides for the circumstances in which the Irish central authority may - and in some cases must - request information on convictions from other central authorities.  This section also provides for the format in which these requests should be made.  Section 7 provides for responses to requests from other central authorities and the related categories of information, which can be transmitted in relation to a person who is a national of the State.  It also provides for any limitations on the retransmission of information.  Section 8 provides for responses to requests from other central authorities and the related categories of information which can be transmitted to other central authorities in relation to a person who is not a national of the State.</p> <p> Section 9 provides for deadlines to respond to requests for information.  Section 10 provides for the electronic transfer of information, which will be referenced in accordance with the common codes agreed by member states and contained in the implementing Council Decision 2009/316/JHA.  This decision and these codes are included in schedule 4 of the Bill.  Section 11 provides for safeguards on how and when personal data which is received and transmitted can be used.  This section provides that such transmissions are in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act of 2018.</p> <p> Section 12 provides that when the Irish central authority receives a request for information on an Irish national from a country other than an EU member state, the Irish central authority can only provide information subject to the limitations outlined in section 7 which relate to any limits placed on this information by other member states.  Section 13 provides that this Bill does not affect any obligation or power to provide or request information under any other law.  Section 14 is a standard provision providing moneys for the administration of this system.  Section 15 is a standard provision which provides for the short title of the Act and its commencement.</p> <p> Schedule 1 includes the full text of the relevant framework decision.  Schedule 2 lists the information which can be provided on request.  Schedule 3 lists the other purposes, in addition to that of criminal proceedings, for which information can be exchanged.  Schedule 4 includes the full text of the implementing Council decision.</p> <p> The implementation of ECRIS can clearly be seen as a positive step from the previous administrative approach to the sharing of criminal conviction information between member states, and I am pleased that this Bill will place our use of ECRIS on a statutory footing.  It must be noted that a degree of urgency is now attached to the full enactment of this legislation, given that in July 2019 the Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion on account of the delay in our notifying measures for the transposition into our national law of Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA.  This transposition was delayed due to domestic legislation which was a greater priority at the time, and regard needed to be taken of the EU Commission's proposals to change ECRIS and how these would progress.</p> <p> Ireland is now required to inform the Commission of the measures we have taken to facilitate transposition and I am confident that I will have the support of this House in this regard, in order that this Bill, which gives effect to full transposition, can now proceed through it as soon as possible.  The transposition of these ECRIS decisions is a matter of high priority not only so the transposition may be faithfully completed as soon as possible, but also because this system and its future development is part of a package of measures to enhance law enforcement, judicial co-operation and information exchange in the European Union and counter the increasing threat of terrorist and organised criminal activity across Europe.</p> <p> The European Parliament and Council's political agreement on the Commission's proposal to create a central ECRIS-TCN system to improve the exchange of criminal record information on convicted non-EU citizens, third country nationals, and stateless persons through the existing ECRIS has further underscored the importance of placing the use of this system on a statutory footing as soon as possible by giving effect to the relevant European instruments.  Accordingly, I am pleased to present and commend this Bill to the House and I very much hope that it can quickly progress to enactment.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the decisions we seek to transpose are of some antiquity.  The comments I will make are not a criticism of the Department of Justice and Equality, but it would be remiss of us if we did not reflect on the fact that it has taken us ten years to start to transpose these decisions into Irish law.  Such is the antiquity of these decisions, as with the framework decision, that we no longer have framework decisions as they were finished as a result of the Lisbon treaty.</p>  <p>  Both decisions seek to regulate the exchange of information around criminal records within European Union member states.  Both of the decisions are very beneficial and of use to the Irish criminal justice system and to the co-operation that goes on between EU member states.</p>  <p>  Although the decisions were made ten years ago, in fairness to the former Minister, Alan Shatter, he announced in 2012 that legislation was being prepared to transpose the decisions in to Irish law.  It was seven and a half years ago when Alan Shatter announced that the legislation was being prepared, but it is only being introduced in the D&aacute;il today.  I suspect that part of the reason it is being introduced now is that, unfortunately, in 2018 the European Commission had to send a warning letter to Ireland saying it was in breach of its obligations around the transposition of these decisions, and that it needed to hurry up and do it.  I welcome the fact they are now being transposed but we need to reflect on the fact that in respect of the many decisions and directives that we need to transpose into Irish law, there is huge delay on the part of the State.  This is not a criticism of any individual Department.  In fairness to the Department of Justice and Equality, it has to deal with a huge amount of legislation.  Even though we do not adopt all the justice issues that emanate from the European Union, much law comes through the criminal justice brief, which requires us to transpose decisions into Irish law.  We need to reflect on our delay and try to get a system in place to speed it up.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said, the purpose of the Bill is to try to introduce co-operation with the exchange of information about criminal records.  The Minister of State referred to the European criminal records information system, ECRIS.  Part of the reason there has not been huge urgency in bringing legislation like this forward is that since 2012 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has applied ECRIS and has used it, to all intents and purposes, the way it will be used after this legislation is enacted.  On one level, Ireland was not at a huge disadvantage as a result of the non-transposition of these decisions.  As an earlier debate in the Chamber has taught us, we have to be very careful about the State engaging in any administrative action or any Executive power when it does not have a legal basis for doing so.  The Government got into difficulty with the public services card, PSC, in seeking access to details on the card from citizens when accessing other services such as passports.  The Data Protection Commissioner stated her opinion recently that this was an unlawful use of the public services card because there was no legal basis on which it was required.  Similarly, we have to be careful about exchanging information about criminal records when we do not have a legal basis to do so.  I welcome that this will be rectified when the legislation is enacted.  I am not suggesting there would be legitimate legal challenge to the system operable at present but the State must be careful to ensure it always has a legal basis for carrying out State actions.</p>  <p>  As I said, ECRIS is currently operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda national vetting bureau acts as the designated central authority for criminal records in Ireland.  Under the proposed legislation this function will pass to the Garda Commissioner and he or she can delegate it to another section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The purpose of ECRIS is that the Garda can make requests of the central authorities in other EU member states to find out information about citizens or persons from other member states to see whether they have a criminal record.  Requests can be made to Ireland from central authorities in other member states asking for information, probably about Irish citizens or people who have been resident here, to determine whether they have a criminal record.  We store much information on people who have committed criminal offences.  It is important we do so, especially in respect of the more serious criminal offences.</p>  <p>  The issue as to the purpose of a criminal record arises.  Criminal records can be a huge disadvantage to people who accumulate them when they are younger, as the Acting Chairman is aware from his work.  Many people come to us as Deputies when applying for a job with the State or a job in the private sector and they are required to give details of any criminal record they have.  It can be very debilitating for them because although they may have completely rehabilitated themselves, it can act as a serious deterrent to employers and others when they find out the person they are about to hire, or to use for another sensitive purpose, has previously engaged in a criminal act and has a criminal record.  This is why it is important that we seek to develop our law on spent convictions.  I do not believe somebody who has rehabilitated himself or herself and has reformed his or her life should live permanently under the shadow of a criminal conviction he or she obtained when he or she was young and in circumstances from whence he or she has long since departed.</p>  <p>  There is, however, a benefit to criminal records that arises at two stages, namely, when police authorities are investigating a crime and when it comes to a court imposing a sentence on a person who has been convicted of a crime.  With the former, obviously if there is an ongoing investigation in another EU country of an Irish citizen, and that citizen suspected of a criminal offence, it would be of benefit to the police authorities in that European Union country to know whether the individual has a previous criminal conviction for a similar offence.  It does not mean that because a person has a previous criminal conviction, he or she is responsible for the subsequent similar offence being investigated, but it is of benefit to a police authority and investigator to know that a person has previously committed a similar offence.  When a case comes to trial, and certainly in Ireland, one would not be able to reveal to a jury or a court that a person had previously committed a criminal offence similar to the one with which he or she was being charged.  That would be unfair and it would prejudice a jury and would affect the judge in the assessment of whether the person had committed the offence under investigation.  Criminal records are of benefit when it comes to the sentencing.  If the person has a string of previous convictions in another country, then it will be of benefit to the other EU country to know the person has other convictions.  It indicates a propensity to commit these offences.  This is taken into account when a court comes to sentence the person.</p>  <p>  There is huge benefit in co-operation between member states around the exchange of information about criminal records.  It serves a public purpose and Ireland should be involved in this.  Also relevant is the issue of what is going to happen when Brexit arises.  Unquestionably, when one looks at the statistics, one can see that the United Kingdom seeks a huge amount of information from other member states in respect of offences committed in the UK.  The UK also provides a considerable amount of information to other member states on UK citizens or residents who have committed, or may have committed, offences in other EU member states.</p><p> Another issue of concern to us all in the context of Brexit is what will happen when the United Kingdom is no longer part of the ECRIS system.  Concerns have been expressed as to the future position of the UK, particularly because, at present, only EU member states are permitted access to ECRIS.  Even the non-EU Schengen countries are excluded.  In 2018, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, suggested that the UK should seek to continue its strong stance of co-operation with the EU in regard to matters relating to counter-terrorism and security.  One wonders how he would get on if he stood up this evening in the House of Commons and suggested that the UK continue its strong stance of co-operation with the EU regarding certain matters.  He would get a negative response, especially from members of the Tory Party.  We need to recognise that there will be a gap, particularly if the UK leaves the EU on 31 October without a deal.  We will have to prepare for that.  It is another example of how this State and the United Kingdom will suffer as a result of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p> As stated, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the legislation.  It is important that we share information relating to criminal records with other members states.  We also need to continue to update our legislation in respect of spent convictions and to recognise that people can be rehabilitated.  Unfortunately, the statistics revealed yesterday by the Central Statistics Office show a very high rate of recidivism, particularly among young men.  It appears that 50% of men in their 20s reoffend within three years of leaving prison.  This is a significant problem.  It shows that if young men become involved in crime at an early age, it is difficult to get them out of it before the age of 40.  Research shows that once they reach 40 years of age, men stop committing crime.  The recidivism rate drops considerably.  Unfortunately, if a young boy of 14 or 15 years gets involved in minor criminal activity, it is difficult to get him off that pathway and the likelihood is that he will end up in prison.  If he ends up in prison once, there is a significant chance he will return to prison.  This should encourage us to do all we can to deter young men from getting involved in criminal activity at an early age.   To achieve this, we need to ensure that there is greater educational attainment among these young men and we need to direct them down other avenues such as sport and vocations so that they feel a sense of worth and do not feel it necessary to get involved in crime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-09-25a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500060#NNN00200"><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill but the question that begs to be asked is why it has taken so long to come before the House.  ECRIS has been in operation in Ireland since 2012, which means that there has been some level of failure in terms of the bringing forward this legislation.  That is disappointing.  However, as has been stated, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been operating this system without this legislation in place to underpin it.  While this has not caused any difficulty up to now, it could potentially have done so.  It points to a slipshod attitude in terms of allowing it to continue in that manner for so long.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan highlighted an issue in the context of Brexit that will need to be addressed.  Currently, all EU member states are in ECRIS.  In circumstances where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the data passed to the British authorities since 2012, which is covered by EU data protection legislation, will no longer enjoy that protection in the British jurisdiction.  This means that we have passed on data over which we have no control in terms of its use in the future.  That issue needs to be addressed.  We are all aware of the British Government's failure to negotiate in regard to a Brexit deal, which is really only about an interim arrangement.  The full arrangement is not due to come into effect until a later date but we need to see that happen as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I want raise a number of issues with regard to activities that are criminal offences in some states but not in others.  For example, a person in this State can be convicted for possession of fireworks but in many other jurisdictions, this is not a criminal offence.  There may be other examples.  The Minister of State might enlighten us as to the arrangements in that regard.  Do the records of people from outside the EU who become citizens in other member states and then come to Ireland follow them from their countries of origin?</p>  <p>  There are also concerns in respect of the storing of data.  The Bill sets out the requirement for competent storage of documentation to ensure its availability for sharing, if required.  We are all conscious of the tribunal of inquiry documents lost over the last number of years.  While only a small number of cases have been examined through that lens, it causes one to wonder if, perhaps, portions of files relating to more than 50% of the criminal justice cases in this country may be missing.  I would like an assurance that our system is sufficiently robust to ensure that such documentation is properly retained and that there is full accountability in that respect.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be the central authority for the exchange of records.  We are all aware of the staffing shortages within an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is hoped that the civilianisation of the service will help to alleviate those difficulties.  However, we would like an assurance that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have adequate staff to perform this task.  The timescale relating to the delivery of information requested by another EU member state is 20 working days.  I am informed by people who regularly seek access to information from various agencies of the State, including the criminal justice system, that if they took receipt of that information within 20 months, they would feel they had done well.  The concern is that 20 working days is an ambitious deadline in light of previous experience in this area.</p>  <p>  Another issue arises in the context of the infringement proceedings that are in place,  In November 2018, the European Commission issued a formal notice to Ireland in this regard, which I assume brought urgency to putting this legislation in place.  While we appreciate that, it is difficult to understand why it has taken so long for it to come before us.  We need answers in that regard.  I understand that the EU Commission has stated that if Ireland does not act within the next two months, it may send a reasoned opinion.  The latter would put is in a difficult position.  We should not be in that space.</p>  <p>  In regard to how this matter is being addressed in other countries, the Netherlands has put in place a provision to ensure that data is passed between member states in the event of change of nationality of an offender.  Where people change nationality when they come to Ireland or another EU member state, how will this be dealt with?</p>  <p>  As already stated, the storage of information is our main concern.  Is it proposed to have separate registers for storing convictions for the purposes of retransmission or will all information be stored on a central database?  The bureau in Tipperary that deals with the vetting is one of the sources from which this information is currently taken.  Will that be duplicated or will the bureau continue to store the information?</p><p>When citizens from all over the country apply to that agency for vetting, they find that getting answers can be a very lengthy process.  A level of efficiency that was not there heretofore needs to be brought to bear on this.  I reiterate that we will support it.  This situation should be brought into play as quickly as possible.  </p> <p> The issue of spent records is one about which we must be careful.  At different times in their lives, many citizens may engage in something that would generate a criminal record and this may not be something they should carry with them all of their lives.  I am thinking in particular of people who are travelling.  A recent case involved a young man from the Minister of State's county of Cork who got into a serious situation in the US because of something that happened in his youth.  I am sure that most other European states believe we need to look at how we deal with that in an efficient and effective manner.  Having said that, if a criminal incident happens and a person gets a record and moves to another country - in this State that conviction is considered a spent conviction - and re-offends in the other country, will it come back to us in a negative way?  We must think that through and be careful.  The issue of spent convictions needs to be dealt with and clearly thought through in respect of this legislation.  </p> <p> The general thrust of what is being done here is admirable and needs to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  Both Ireland and other European states need to be conscious that there is a serious issue regarding the protection of people's data with regard to the exchange of information so that it is not open to hackers and cannot be accessed by people outside the very tight confines of the criminal justice system here or in other European states.</p></speech>

I may not have all the answers to questions raised by Deputy Martin Kenny this evening.  I thank him for all the work he has done on this and the consideration he has given it.  I will ask for the questions he raised to be considered seriously and will get responses to him before the next Stage because they are important.  The issue of delay was mentioned.  Transposition was delayed because of domestic legislation, which was a greater priority in the intervening years since the Government approved the drafting of the Bill on 7 April 2012.  A lot of legislation that had priority has been dealt with since then.  Regard must also be taken of the new European Commission's proposals in the form of a directive of 2016 and a regulation of 2019 that were designed to adapt the ECRIS system so that it could be extended to facilitate the exchange of criminal record information relating to third country nationals.  This Bill does not transpose those instruments but we need to be mindful of their progress.  The Deputy is right that we need to move this on quickly and get it done.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the EU justice issue, which is not really part of this.  I remind the House that we are putting together a new EU justice strategy and are very mindful of the issues raised by the CSO on that matter.</p>  <p>  I affirm that the Government is committed to transposing the two relevant European instruments that give effect to ECRIS in the form of this Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019, which I have introduced to the House today.  The importance and value of ECRIS cannot be overstated.  Ireland continues to agree with the principle of expanding ECRIS to improve the exchange of information regarding those persons with criminal convictions.  The exchange of criminal record information between Ireland and other EU member states, which this system facilitates, is vital for enforcement authorities to more effectively do their job and stop criminals evading the law throughout the EU and beyond.  I know that many Members of the House may be considering the implications of Brexit, which was mentioned by Deputy Martin Kenny, in respect of how criminal record information may be shared under this system with our neighbours in the UK.  Of course, it would be preferable if the UK was to remain connected to the ECRIS system but that is a matter for the UK authorities and its Government to discuss in the course of its deliberations with the Commission on the nature of its exit from the EU.  It is a matter for Her Majesty's Government and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate in this regard, but we are acutely aware of the value and importance of a co-operative relationship with the UK authorities in the sharing of this type of information and efforts continue to focus on ensuring that a mutually-beneficial relationship continues in that respect.  </p>  <p>  This Bill essentially provides for the transposition of European instruments that give effect to a system designed to provide competent authorities from one European Union member state with access to information from the criminal records of individuals from another member state.  Its stated purpose is to facilitate the exchange of information from criminal records so that individuals' previous convictions can be taken into account if they become involved in new criminal proceedings.  Ultimately, our objective is the same as that of all other member states in providing for this system, namely, to assist our agencies to enforce the law, to minimise crime and to combat terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality agreed that pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill was not required.  I re-state that I am hopeful that this Bill can quickly progress through the D&aacute;il.  This Bill is based on two technically complex and detailed European instruments.  It has been subject to thorough and comprehensive legal scrutiny both in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General in the past two years.  It has also been subject to several rounds of consultation, particularly in conjunction with our national central authority that will operate the ECRIS system, namely, the national vetting bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am pleased that we arrived at a point where the Bill received Government approval and was published on 31 July.  Given that our non-transposition of the relevant Council framework decision is currently subject to infringement proceedings, I am confident that the steps we have recently taken and the passage of this Bill through the Houses will address any outstanding concerns of the</p>  <p>Commission in this regard and I again commend this Bill to the House.  I will get the answers to some of the very technical questions asked by Deputy Martin Kenny.</p></speech>
