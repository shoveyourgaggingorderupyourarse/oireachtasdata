Does he have a sense of the powers he intends to confer on that authority?</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware the programme for Government includes a commitment for a new office of a national food ombudsman or equivalent to enforce the unfair trading practices, UTP, directive and to have a role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  The establishment of such an office requires primary legislation, which we are progressing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that Directive 2019/633 on unfair trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain, which involves, as the Deputy noted, the establishment of an enforcement authority, was required to be transposed into national law by 1 May 2021.  I am happy to advise him that in April this year, before that deadline, I signed a statutory instrument to transpose the directive directly into Irish law and establish the enforcement authority.</p>  <p>  I have established a UTP enforcement authority in my Department as an interim measure pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new office.  However, I assure the Deputy the enforcement authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the UTPs defined in the directive.  The authority is undertaking an awareness-raising campaign on the UTP regulations and is engaging with relevant stakeholders in the agricultural and food products supply chain. </p>  <p>  With regard to the establishment of the new office of food ombudsman or regulator, preparations for the general scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation are well advanced, and I hope to bring a memo to the Government on the issue early in the new year.  Once the primary legislation has been finalised and the new office established, the enforcement authority functions will transfer to it in line with the programme for Government commitments.  In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the enforcement authority on any concerns they may have in regard to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  Increasing transparency throughout the supply chain is something I believe is very important.  The new office will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, including, importantly, for the meat sector.</p></speech>

In May, in response to a question, the Minister told us the legislation would be before us by the end of this year.  He is now saying he plans to bring a heads of Bill to the Government in the early part of 2022.  HIs response indicates he recognises the importance of an authority having strong teeth in terms of enforcement powers, but it has to be asked why there has been a delay up to this point.  The consultation process was completed several months ago.  People are now asking themselves when they are going to see the meat and the bones, if I can put it that way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900003#A00900"><p>There is a tremendous thirst within the agrifood sector, particularly among farmers, to ensure transparency will be brought to the food supply chain.  I have taken that very seriously since I was appointed and, as the Deputy pointed out, I completed a consultation process, which he contributed to, at the end of the summer.  Over the course of the autumn and into winter, much work has been ongoing within the Department to put in place the framework and the preparatory work for that legislation.  I have kept Cabinet updated on progress on it.  I plan to go to the Government with a memo at the start of next year, from where I will bring forward the legislation.</p>  <p>  In budget 2022, I allocated &euro;4 million in the Estimates for the establishment of the new office.  The UTP enforcement authority in place within the Department is an important interim measure but its functions will come under the auspices of the new food ombudsman or regulator once the office has been established on a legal basis.  It will be important for the sector in the years ahead.</p></speech>

In May, the unit had three full-time equivalent posts, filled by four staff.  Progress was being made on appointing a head of unit but by September and through October, it had only two full-time equivalent staff, again with the promise of a head of unit.  It has not received, as far as I am aware, or initiated a single case and not &euro;1 has been spent, other than on the staff costs.  The &euro;4 million budget allocation is, of course, welcome but it will be meaningless unless it is used with good effect.  The Minister referred to our consultation, in which we outlined the need for an independent meat regulator with real teeth to tackle unfair trading practices and other cartel-like behaviours.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister elaborate on what the unit is doing and whether, in its current guise, it has the ability to challenge processers for unfair trading practices?</p></speech>

It has undertaken over recent weeks and months a significant engagement process with those in the food supply chain and those who will be affected by the unfair trading practices directive to inform them of the responsibilities on them to ensure that fair play, proper regulations and structures are in place in their engagement with all suppliers.</p>  <p>  In the context of the unfair trading practices directive and any practices that in any way undermine the relationship with suppliers, the authority ensures there is absolute clarity on the responsibilities on all those within the supply chain.  Similarly, it ensures suppliers are aware of the opportunity to make a complaint to the enforcement authority too.  All of this will be transferred to the new regulator or ombudsman's office once it has been established next year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900003#A01500"><p>I apologise.  I am asking this question on behalf of Deputy Sherlock.  How many afforestation licences were issued for the entire industry in November of this year and will the Minister of State make a statement on matter?  This is in the context of concerns about delays and shortfalls in the issuing of licences for afforestation.  There is concern targets will not be met and that this will have an impact on us meeting our ambitious but necessary climate action targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900003#A01600"><p>Tackling the backlog in forestry licences remains a key priority for me and the Department.</p> <p>I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made in the past year, particularly on felling and roads.  However, afforestation is a crucial part of this and we are actively addressing it all the time.  Regarding the prioritisation of afforestation licences in recent times, in the month of November, 50 afforestation licences were issued and the total to date for the year stands at 476.  We have dedicated more ecologists to deliver afforestation licences.  Investment in resources and continued improvements have had a positive impact with a significant increase in licensing output across the board.  This has brought our total licensing output this year to 3,718 and my officials tell me that we will meet our target of 4,000 licences by the year end, which will be a 60% increase on last year.  Our road licensing output for this year will be double the target set for us in the climate action plan.  The volume of timber licensed will be approximately 8 million cu. m this year.  This is 60% higher than last year and the highest volume ever licensed in a single year.</p> <p> There are many issues in the system that still have to be fixed.  We are working on that and the establishment of Project Woodland has that as one of its chief aims, as well as looking at the future model for forestry and a fit-for-purpose, multifunctional strategy for forestry for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900004#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the update and the confirmation of figures.  The number in November appears to be very low if we are to meet the target of 4,500 licences by the end of this year.  She might elaborate on how many she anticipates will be issued this month.  The Minister of State also acknowledged that there are still many issues to fix.  We are hearing concerns about delays and bureaucratic obstacles, such as applicants being asked for Natura impact statements even though they have already proposed forestry plans.  It is welcome to hear that more ecologists have been appointed, but there is still a concern about whether we will meet targets.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to Project Woodland.  I would like to know more about the nature of the forestry licences that are issued and how that impacts on the biodiversity crisis we are facing along with the climate crisis.  Will the preponderance be native woodland and native tree species?  Will there be an emphasis on that rather than the emphasis we have seen for far too long on commercial species?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1661" speakername="" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900004#B00300"><p>The target is 4,000 licences by the end of the year.  It was originally 4,500 at the start of the year, but a statutory instrument introduced for the Department out of the blue in the middle of the year set us back by about two months during the summer.  We were on course up to June with a sizeable increase in licensing output.  It was low in July and August but we picked up the pace again in September.  It has been acknowledged that it put our original target out of reach.  We adjusted the target during the summer to 4,000 and we are confident we will meet it.</p>  <p>  As regards the future strategy for forestry, we will undertake an extensive public consultation, including having focus groups.  That work has started already.  Irish Rural Link is engaging with communities, particularly those most affected.  We have to examine what the future of forestry looks like, how it fits with communities, how it provides amenities, how it delivers for the timber sector, which is a crucial part, and helps us meet our climate and biodiversity targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900004#B00400"><p>I welcome the acknowledgement that the target has been reduced to 4,000.  As recently as August, it was still being publicly spoken of as 4,500.  I also welcome the Minister of State's outline of the public consultation.  What has been lacking to date, and the Minister of State has acknowledged this previously, is a co-ordinated, joined-up afforestation policy that fits within our ambitious but necessary climate action targets and within the climate action plan.  I have spoken a number of times to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about the lack, to date, of publication of the detailed annexe with timelines that was to accompany the climate action plan to outline how to meet the targets for forestry, biodiversity and other matters.  The latest figures I have from the forestry licensing dashboard show that the total number of afforested hectares is 3,498, but it is over 24,000 for felling.  We are cutting down more trees than we are planting.  We are felling more trees and granting more licences to fell than we are granting licences to plant.  Indeed, Deputy Sherlock told me that for every acre of forestry we plant, we are cutting approximately 6.7 acres, so that has to change if we are to meet those targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1661" speakername="" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900004#B00500"><p>With regard to the Deputy's last point, any land that is felled is replanted so it is not a net loss of area planted unless there are circumstances in which the land must not be planted, perhaps if it was planted in the wrong location originally.  On the whole, the vast majority of lands that are felled are replanted.</p>  <p>  I accept and agree with the Deputy that a joined-up policy is needed for forestry for the future.  I appreciate her support for a public consultation.  We will extend that, and between now and the new year we will hopefully see that activated with much engagement across the country.  The annexe to actions on the climate action plan will be due very shortly, before the end of the year.  That will give more detail and give people something to check against to see if the Government is delivering in that regard.  It will be useful for everyone.</p></speech>

The most common question farmers ask is what this will mean for them.  It would be useful if it were possible to carry out a full audit of the carbon storage and capture that is taking place on every farm in order to reward farmers who are involved in good practices and to encourage others to follow suit.

Such an approach will require the establishment of baseline data, auditing, the development of voluntary carbon codes, leveraging of private financing through public-private partnerships and putting in place governance structures.  The development of a carbon farming model of this nature would require the establishment of baselines to ensure that measures taken on farms deliver the additionality required and that farmers are recognised and rewarded for the improvements they have made.</p>  <p>  I have provided funding for initiatives such as the establishment of the national agricultural soil carbon observatory, the pilot soil sampling programme and the farm environmental scheme, along with a number of European innovation partnership, EIP, research projects, to provide the required data for the development of future policy options in this area.  The approach I am taking is in line with the EU&rsquo;s policy direction and I will look forward to further direction in the Commission&rsquo;s communication on sustainable carbon cycles, which is due on 14 December.</p>  <p>  Carbon farming is an area that will become a crucial part of the future of farming in this country.  This will be an opportunity for farmers to derive a new income stream for their farm and I will drive this very exciting opportunity forward at every turn.  I look forward to engagement, co-operation and support across the House for something that can be of tremendous benefit to farmers over the years ahead, as well as being important for our emissions reduction targets.</p></speech>

I asked this specific question regarding the baseline studies as to whether it is possible to carry out a farm-by-farm analysis and audit so each farmer would have a clear view of what sequestration, storage and emission is taking place on his or her farm and the farmer can then trade or be rewarded for improvements in that regard.  Essentially, the response from the Department's officials and Teagasc was that this would prove to be incredibly difficult and challenging.  We accept that.  The Devenish Global Innovation Centre in County Meath indicated that it was very doable if there was the political will.</p> <p>The value of having something like this can be seen.  The issue we need to overcome is the viability of being able to do it in the short term.  Farmers are today carrying out measures to reduce emissions, but we need to ensure that is recognised, not only this year but in years to come.</p></speech>

Teagasc is doing significant research work on how to assess that.  I have provided it with the funding to do that.  Flux towers across the country are assessing in detail what is happening at farm level, what is going into the soil, what is coming out of it, and developing a toolkit to be able to implement it on a more widespread basis.</p>  <p>  Along the lines of what the Deputy is suggesting, I announced the soil sampling scheme some weeks ago.  I have invested &euro;10 million in the scheme this year and it will continue next year.  That is about having an assessment at farm level to establish the baselines for carbon content in soil and organic matter in soil.  It is important for that to happen on all farms in the coming years.  Once we have the toolkit to measure how additional sequestration is captured, we can develop the monetisation of that carbon sequestration and provide a return to farmers for it.  It is important work with great potential and something we are developing.</p></speech>

We need to ensure we do not repeat our mistakes.  I have lost count of the number of people who have pointed out to me things which they were paid to do on their farms and which now they are being paid to undo.  The important work farmers are carrying out today, whether that be in afforestation, moving to organics, improving hedgerows, planting trees or reducing nitrate inputs, needs to be recognised for a long time to come.  However, we cannot reward something if we cannot measure it.  I ask the Minister to prioritise this area to ensure all farmers, those who are carbon neutral - there are some - and those whose emissions are higher than they need to be, are audited and those who change practice for the better are rewarded.</p></speech>

The CAP plan this time around is structured to have eco schemes to reward existing good practice.  For example, the 7% of space for nature within Pillar 1 in the eco schemes already recognises good practice.  Farms that use less chemical nitrogen are also recognised in the eco schemes.  Pillar 2 is about rewarding additional actions to build on that.  We will have a blend and a balance - rewarding existing good practice and incentivising and monetising measures in the time ahead.  The Deputy has made his views on the issue clear today.  We can all agree on the importance of this matter over the time ahead.</p></speech>

As the Minister comes from Donegal, he will know from first-hand, as many of us do, that if something is not monitored it does not happen.  Why does he want suckler farmers to sign up to the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme?</p></reply>

This is a commercial transaction between the farmer and the meat processor.  However, Bord Bia has confirmed that the vast majority of all beef processed in Ireland comes from quality-assured farms.</p>  <p>  Overall, there is great value in the quality assurance structure, which enables us to market our beef abroad.  It gives assurance to customers as to provenance and how the product is produced.  That will become increasingly important in the coming years to maintain the markets we have and develop new ones.  Bord Bia will be engaging with processors and farmers on that.  The more ways we can show a monetary return to farmers at all levels whether they are selling sucklers or finished cattle to the factory and the more ways it can be directly translated into the price that farmers are getting, the better.  We need continuing engagement on and assessment of that.</p>  <p>  It helps in selling our product internationally to give assurance to customers about exactly how it was produced and the steps taken at farm level.  Having a verification audit of quality assurance strengthens our overall product.  It has been an important plank on which we have developed our beef sector over recent years.</p></speech>

I have asked him a very straightforward question.  We all know how oral parliamentary questions are compiled.  His failure to furnish that information here clearly indicates that he is not being given that information from Bord Bia.  It brings into question the whole ethos behind the marketing, promotion and sale of Irish beef once it leaves this country.  Clearly, quality assurance is not being prioritised by the meat plants.  It is not being prioritised in terms of getting a return to the farmer.  It seems to me that the quality assurance bonus that farmers are getting is the base price and those who are not achieving the Bord Bia standards are facing cuts in the prices they are being paid.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, will attest, in the meetings we have with existing customers for Irish beef we see how important quality assurance and providing verification to their customers are for them in making purchasing decisions.  It is an important aspect of the offering we have.  That is why it is important we continue to develop it and continue to ensure that as many farmers as possible partake in it and are quality assured.  It is also important to get continued acceptance from farmers as to the value of it.  It also needs to be worthwhile through a monetary return to farmers.  As Minister, I very much understand that.  I will continue to engage with all stakeholders in the sector to ensure that the importance of quality assurance is made clear.  We also need to look at every option available to ensure that farmers are rewarded for their participation.</p></speech>

However, the Minister has been asked to provide that verification to Parliament and he cannot do that.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the system if he cannot provide Parliament with the figures that he says are being provided to customers.  They are being provided to customers but not to the elected representatives of every farmer throughout the country.  That is fundamentally flawed.</p>  <p>  The Minister is asking suckler farmers to sign up to the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.  As he knows, the vast majority of suckler farmers do not finish cattle.  They do not get a quality assurance payment for culled cows which is usually the only animals they bring to a processing facility.</p> <p>Why then is the Minister asking them to do this now?  Will he explain why the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme does not transfer from farm to farm?  They have to be left for 60 days.  It seems to me that when a carcase spends 60 minutes in the back of a truck, it is quality assured.</p></speech>

The reason is that it enhances the overall offering and strength of our beef sector.  It also enhances its marketability and, thus, its profitability.  It takes everyone working together collaboratively to achieve that.  I know it can sometimes be hard for individual farmers to see that.  Everyone benefits from our sector being strong overall, and from the offering we have being strong and by getting hold of those markets and maximising the value of beef overall.  That benefits everyone at farm level, be it a suckler farmer or a finisher, and that is important.  I have taken this step to encourage more to go down that avenue because it will add to the overall strength of the sector.</p></speech>

As he knows, this issue is very important to me and is one on which I have worked very hard, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to make progress.  I know it is an issue for Donegal fishers, particularly those in Greencastle and Killybegs.  It has been an important and strategic fishery for many years and one which we value very much and seek to protect.</p>  <p>  I received the report of the seafood task force, Navigating Change, in October.  The task force estimated that the total squid fishery around Rockall is valued at about &euro;6.6 million based on 2019 landings, and the total impact of the loss of that squid and other fisheries at &euro;7.7 million.  I launched a Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme in September this year on foot of the task force recommendation.  The scheme was established as a targeted measure for certain segments of the fishing fleet to mitigate the loss of income in 2021 arising from the significant quota reductions under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or Brexit agreement.  In line with the task force recommendations, I extended this scheme for an additional month to cover vessels that could not participate in the Rockall squid fishery.</p>  <p>  In relation to Rockall, Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall, nor has it ever recognised British sovereignty claims to Rockall.  Accordingly, we have not recognised a 12 nautical mile territorial sea around it either.  This remains the position of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities on Rockall in recent years and intensively so since the beginning of the year.  Through this engagement, the Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the long-standing fisheries tradition we have in this area.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, as well as our respective officials, continue to consider all options for further engagement on the issues involved and are working closely together.  While engagement continues, there remains an increased risk of enforcement action being taken by Scottish fisheries control authorities against Irish vessels operating in waters around Rockall at present.</p></speech>

For the British authorities to block fishermen from the North and South of this island from accessing their traditional fishery grounds at the loss of millions of euro is an absolute outrage.  I just do not feel the anger from the Government.  If this happened to Macron and the French fishermen, there would be serious high-level engagements, threats of sanctions and so on.  This must be escalated a year on.  I have received repeated responses from the Minister for Foreign Affairs around dialogue and discussions.  When the Maritime Jurisdiction Act went through the House earlier this year, I said to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, that we were again conceding Rockall to the British authorities.  The fact that this issue has not been resolved is evidence that we have conceded British control over Rockall.  Until I see decisive action from the Government, I will not be convinced otherwise.</p></speech>

I am working with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in every way possible to ensure we resolve this issue diplomatically.  Access to the fisheries around Rockall is strategically important to the Irish fleet and we are determined to maintain it.  It has always been a traditional fishery for us.  We continue to work to resolve this.  I understand the importance of this to fishermen, our national sector and, in particular, Donegal fishers, be they in Greencastle or Killybegs.  In recognition of the income impact of the squid fishery in particular, which is inside the 12-mile zone, I put in place income support for fishers affected by that this year.  That is important.</p>  <p>  My objective is to ensure we have and maintain access to that area and continue to fish within it in the future.  In working with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, the Department and I are taking every step we possibly can to achieve that.  I am also maintaining close contact with the fishers concerned regarding the efforts we are making.</p></speech>

We have been given access to 15% of fish in Irish waters, under the Common Fisheries Policy.  The British now have 75% of the fish in their waters.  How in the hell can it be justified that they would also keep us out of Rockall, an area with traditional fishing grounds for Donegal fishermen and, indeed, fishermen from Castletownbere?  It is sickening that we have allowed this to happen for a year.  They have control of 75% of the fish in British waters, while we have 15% of the fish in our waters.  How can it be that this continues to be allowed to happen?  Why is the Taoiseach not bringing this matter to the level of Boris Johnson?  I asked if this would happen with Macron.  It would never have happened with France.  Why are we allowing this to continue a year on?</p></speech>

Despite the fact that they have now left the European Union, the agreement reallocates 25% of what international fleets catch in their waters in the coming years.  Some 75% of what the EU, including Ireland, caught in British waters prior to Brexit will still be caught afterwards, despite the fact that they pressed the nuclear button and left the European Union, and will continue to have access to each other's waters.</p>  <p>  There is obviously a particular challenge around Rockall.  It continues to be a point of disagreement between us, about which we hold very fast to our traditional rights.  We assert those rights strongly and are determined to ensure we maintain them.  We are taking every action and intervention possible to ensure the matter is addressed.</p></speech>

First, what are they because it is not entirely clear and we have not seen the annexe?  What is his understanding of the commitment?

Ireland's forests are a net sink of carbon dioxide and the timber produced also stores carbon in long-lived harvested wood products.</p> <p>It is for this reason that the climate action plan recognises the importance of maintaining our forest areas, preventing deforestation and increasing the amount of wood used in construction.  It also highlights the importance of afforestation.</p> <p> The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets an afforestation target of 8,000 ha per year, which builds on the significant amounts of afforestation carried out since the 1990s.  This target is ambitious when compared with recent afforestation rates and will be challenging to meet in the next decade.  However, it something we must achieve.  My Department is committed to addressing the current barriers, particularly with regard to licensing - especially afforestation licensing - which have, as we have seen, resulted in low afforestation rates in recent years.</p> <p> Project Woodland, which I established earlier this year, is examining a number of work streams.  This includes a focus on reducing the backlog in licensing, which is having an effect across the board in respect of licence output.  It has also initiated a regulatory review, through which we will be looking at efficiencies in work processes with regard to how we deliver on licences.</p> <p> Key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is the building of confidence among landowners and farmers regarding the benefits of forestry.  The forestry programme has a wide range of generous grants and premiums to incentivise landowners to plant trees.  I am aware that some stakeholders are calling for higher afforestation targets, in excess of 8,000 ha.  That may well be required but we have to try to get on the right track and start planting the trees we need to plant.  That is where we need to get to.  That is what we aspire to.</p></speech>

That means that this is incredibly important and that we have to get it right if we are to have any hope.  The plan states that land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, emits a net total of 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year, although there is work still to be done on those figures.  We are entering a period of carbon losses from forestry as harvesting outstrips growth and regrowth.  We have missed our targets since 1996.  There is something fundamentally wrong here.  The State needs to lead from the front on this.  What is the current backlog for licensing?  How many hectares have the State and its agencies planted this year?</p></speech>

It may be worth noting that in the region of 5,000 ha are currently licensed for planting that are not being planted, for whatever reason.  It is important that we understand those reasons and find out why landowners who have been issued with licences to plant have chosen not to.  That is also a concern.  I ask that landowners who have received licences to plant to please do so.  We are entering the time for planting at the moment.  It is important that we get those trees in the ground.  It would be worthwhile to reach out to those individuals to ask why they have not planted because others are scrambling to get licences which are not forthcoming.</p></speech>

We know that the decisions and measures we take today will have an effect in the future.  The chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, clearly told the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action yesterday that there is a need to act quickly, to get this done correctly, to be ambitious and not just to wonder why we are reaching our targets, but to actually deliver on them and increase our ambition.  We also heard these comments in the media.  I ask again, what is the backlog in respect of licences?  Are the State and its agencies leading from the front?  How many acres have they planted?  Forward counting was provided for by the CCAC.  Is this something the State is going to do?  This has been reported in the media.  I have concerns about that.  Is the State going to begin forward counting in respect of forestry?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for confirming that the detailed annex to the climate action plan, including a timeline, will be published before the end of the year, which would be within the next three weeks.  Will she confirm whether it will be published next week, before the D&aacute;il finishes sitting next Thursday?  It is crucial that climate spokespersons in the Opposition have a chance to look at that, debate it and see how we propose to reach those ambitious targets on forestry, afforestation, Project Woodland, the development of farm forests, as endorsed by Teagasc, and so much more.</p></speech>

There is not a hope that we will reach that goal.  The Minister of State asked why farmers who have licences are not planting.  She has asked that question three times that I am aware of in D&aacute;il debates.  She has said it would be interesting to find out why.  Why has she not asked them?  I can tell her what those I know who have such licences are saying.  They tell me that the experience of ash dieback has had a big impact and acts as a disincentive for even those who have licences to enter forestry.  There is also a backlog in felling and roads licensing for those who have previously planted.  The potential to enter into the agri-environmental scheme is particularly important.  There is also a need for a specific payment to encourage the planting of broadleaf species, which are much more popular within communities.  Is the Minister of State going to do any of those things or resolve any of those matters?</p></speech>

We are looking at incentivising small-scale planting.  These would be non-commercial plantations of native species.  These could be counted towards our carbon inventory.  I am hopeful that we will have something on that very soon and that we will be able to roll out something for landowners, perhaps next year.  This will not involve the jumping through hoops required for forestry licensing, which is onerous.  The independent regulatory review is also looking at the concerns and the delays in the system from the day a farmer or forestry company decides to plant trees onwards.  It will examine the process and try to identify where the issues are.  We have tried to address the issues.  We have put in more resources and more people.  While there have been net improvements, we are not where we need to be.  That is why this regulatory review will be crucial.  It will hopefully uncover where those backlogs are throughout the system.  I do not have current figures on the backlogs with me but I will have them sent on to the Deputies.</p></speech>

This is one I have answered on many occasions previously.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify this matter again.  I hope this information will be helpful to everyone.</p>  <p>  Under the CFP, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds, subject to allocated fish quotas and the rules of the CFP.  There are restrictions on access within the 12-nautical-mile zones of member states, including ourselves.  Quotas for the various fish stocks are allocated for management areas, as set out by the scientists of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, who assess stocks and detail ICES areas.  The quotas for various stocks are allocated for those ICES areas, rather than for member states' EEZs.  For example, the total allowable catch for the hake stock is in ICES areas 6 and 7, and that area stretches from the north of Scotland down to the northern coast of Brittany and into the English Channel.  This area includes parts of the Irish, UK and French EEZs and some international waters.  Ireland's quota for that stock may be fished in any part of this area.  In addition, Ireland's main mackerel quota covers ICES areas 6 and 7, stretching from the north of Scotland to the north coast of Brittany.  The full quota may be fished in UK waters off the northern North Sea, and normally is, because it is fished primarily early in the year and in that area.  Access to the northern North Sea in particular is economically important for our fleet for that reason.</p>  <p>  Regarding Ireland's 200-mile zone, and the fisheries catch taken there, the Marine Institute has estimated the landings from the Irish EEZ for the top 25 species from 2015 to 2019.  These figures show that, overall, Irish vessels take 35.5%, by weight, and 38.8%, by value, of the landings from the Irish EEZ.  The total value of Ireland's fish quotas for 2021 is approximately &euro;229 million.</p></speech>

If we look at the stock book from the Marine Institute from 2020 and at the total tonnage taken, and its overall value, it will be seen that the total value of the Irish catch was &euro;251,563,000.  That was out of a total catch taken from Irish waters by all the EU fleet of &euro;1.62 billion.  This is where this 15% comes from.  I just checked the stock book for the most recent year, and the catch for last year was even lower - down to &euro;180 million.  This is the problem.  If the Minister's officials cannot get their head around what we are getting out of our waters for our Irish fleet, how can we ever resolve this issue?  We are in serious trouble here if they do not accept the scale of the injustice.</p></speech>

I am fighting the battle all the time at European level to try to maximise our fish quotas.  I will be in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, once again fighting the battle regarding our national fish quota.  We were also fighting that at the last Council meeting.  Ireland was the only EU member state to vote against the proposal.  I voted against it because I disagreed with it.  I will fight that battle at every opportunity to do the best we can for our fishermen and to try to maximise our quota.  That has been my form at every opportunity since I was appointed as the Minister.</p>  <p>  The facts and the figures are important.  It is important that there is clarity in this regard if we are fighting that battle.  The scientists at the Marine Institute are the people who keep these figures.  I have outlined to the Deputy today, as I have on many occasions before, what the figures are, namely, 35.5%, by weight, and 38.8%, by value, of the landings from the Irish EEZ.  That amounts to two thirds of our total catch, because the other one third is caught in British waters.  That is the factual position as established by the authorities that monitor this aspect and that do the fullest and best possible assessment of the reality.</p></speech>

However, I ask if he will sit down with the four main producer organisations, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, and the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, his Department's officials and representatives of the Marine Institute to reach agreement as to what the percentage is in this regard.  Those organisations produced the stock book for 2020 for me, and it does not make for good reading concerning the most up-to-date figures from 2020-2021.  That is where we are at right now.  The situation is even worse after Brexit, as the Minister is aware.  This is critical because the Minister is about to go into the December Council meeting and this is the year when the quotas are agreed.  There was no burden sharing after Brexit and there was no fairness.  The Minister must try to rebalance this situation.  Will the Minister engage with those producer organisations, try to get an accurate and agreed number and then go and fight for it in Europe?</p></speech>

I outlined the challenges in that regard in my response.  The quota areas, which are based on ICES areas, do not reflect economic zones.  Regarding the most accurate assessment possible in respect of calculating this figure, the Marine Institute, which is the body that does that task, has calculated that we take 35.5% of the volume and 38.8% of the value of fish caught in 200-mile EEZ.  On top of that, we catch an additional one third in British waters.  That was why continuing to have access to British waters was so important coming out of Brexit and such an important strategic objective as well.</p>  <p>  I will never believe that this share is enough and I will always fight for us to have more.  I have fought that battle at European level every time and I have fought it consistently since I was appointed.  However, this is the starting point in respect of the best possible assessment of what the figures are and what the reality is.</p></speech>

Some 4,000 farmers participated in the scheme and the specifications set out for the scheme involved the construction of new, impermeable slurry tanks and dirty water storage tanks in compliance with the EU nitrates directive.  That code required that all concrete structures designed and constructed under its terms must pass the seven-day leak test before use.</p>  <p>  It is alleged that what was then the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North of Ireland illegally gave a waiver allowing for construction without a seven-day test.  I understand that this happened under the former Ministers for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle Gildernew and Michelle O'Neill, and continued up to the current Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots.  Has the Department here investigated the possible damage being done to watercourses in the south of Ireland by leaks from the slurry tanks in the North?  Has the Minister spoken to the Department in that regard or sought to have this investigated?  This matter has been raised with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, but it has said that it is not investigating it.  I have also raised this question with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and it stated that it is not investigating this topic.  I raise this issue with the Minister because he is from Donegal and this concerns the watercourses in his county.</p></speech>

It is a matter best addressed to the Northern Irish Administration since it is a question specifically for the latter.</p> <p> On our work on protecting water quality and ensuring the appropriate management of all farmyard nutrients, we have put massive investment in through the targeted agriculture modernisation, TAMS, on-farm investment schemes.  Farmers across the country have put in significant resources of their own, assisted by Government supports through those grants to radically transform the facilities on each farmyard in the country over the last two or three decades.  A very different infrastructure is in place now.  It is something we continue to build on because it is really important that while we farm and produce food really well, it is done in such a way that water, our natural environment and biodiversity are protected.  That is fundamental to our approach.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this matter may not have come across the Minister's desk so far.  This is why I am raising it with him today.  This crisis in the North could be as big as the cash for ash scandal.  Some 4,000 farmers were told that they built correctly and &pound;121 million of grant funding was given.  A total of &pound;212 million was spent on these tanks.  If they are leaking they will have to be fixed, which will cost hundreds of millions of euro.  There were be pollution damage which will cost millions of euro to ameliorate.  Farmers may have to reduce their stock while the tanks are fixed and so on.  This is an all-Ireland issue.  Watercourses do not stop at the Border.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices.  Gemma Brolly, an Aont&uacute; representative for East Derry, has already questioned the Minister, Mr. Edwin Poots MLA, on this and he has not answered the questions.  Given how serious this is, will the Minister hold conversations with the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in the North?</p></speech>

We give massive grants of between 40% and 60% to support farmers to put in place slurry tanks, sheds and appropriate handling facilities.  Farmers take it really seriously.  It is something I take very seriously.  Our environment is absolutely crucial to us and central to that is the appropriate use of organic manure and fertilisers and appropriate storage of them.  We will continue to take that very seriously here and I have no doubt that the Northern Irish Administration will do so also.

I particularly acknowledge his representations on ensuring eco-schemes are available that will serve all farm types.  I am glad to inform him that following the consultations I have done with him and other Oireachtas representatives, and considering the various ideas and suggestions put forward, I was able to announce an additional five eco-schemes.  I also carried out extensive public engagements across the country and held a public meeting with farmers in every county to assess their ideas and suggestions, receive their feedback on the draft CAP plan, and discuss how we needed to update it to ensure it would serve the sector and farmers well over the coming years.  There is now a range of eco-schemes in place which will serve agriculture, farmers and, importantly, the environment.  These include: leaving aside a certain percentage for space for nature on farms; rewarding extensive livestock production; limiting chemical nitrogen usage; planting native trees on farms; soil sampling and appropriate liming; enhanced crop diversification; and sowing multispecies swards.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of milk recording within eco-schemes.  The European Commission is very clear in its guidance that eco-schemes designed solely for the purpose of collecting data do not seem appropriate.  That is the feedback we had from the Commission in respect of milk recording.  We did explore the matter, and the Deputy and many others raised it with me.  It was not regarded as being appropriate.  However, I do believe there is a very strong suite of measures in place having taken on board the Deputy's representations and feedback from farmers across the country.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he has taken feedback on board and made modifications and extensions with those five options, making the process more accessible and meaningful for farmers.  Can he outline the options that were considered and did not make it?  One of those schemes focuses on working in co-operation with neighbours on adjacent farms.  There are areas where it will not be possible to get all of the farms around involved in the scheme.  Maybe somebody is letting out land or neighbours are not seeing eye to eye.  We will end up with some farmers being excluded.  Is there some measure to get the maximum benefit in an area so that people would not be excluded in that situation?</p></speech>

I want every farmer to participate.  It is really important on every farm type that the interaction with the environment, the synchronicity between agricultural production and the environment are fully considered and taken cognisance of in terms of farming practice.  The objective behind the CAP is to further improve that environmental ambition while also ensuring that we focus on farm profitability.  We want farmers to participate in the eco-schemes.  We wanted to make a range of measures available which would provide options for everyone.  The suite we have in place now provides real opportunities for everyone, including those who may be leasing land.  For example, reduced chemical fertiliser user and enhanced crop diversification in the tillage sector are really important.</p></speech>

It is going to give much more meaningful environmental benefit if there is a larger number of people involved and the action is being taken across a wider area.  There are situations where it may be on commonage or the landowner may not be interested in engaging.  Not only are we losing the environmental benefit in that case but also the other farmers may not be able to go in on that scheme.  That is the one that pays better but they will end up having to be on the individual action scheme.  If there was some way of ensuring that people who wanted to get on that wider area with a large number of participants would be able to engage and would not be locked out because of somebody not wanting or being unable to participate.</p></speech>

Up to a maximum of &euro;7,000 will be paid to those in the standard environmental scheme.  The range of options in the eco-schemes in Pillar 1 will give opportunities to everyone.  We encourage everyone to participate, make an environmental contribution and, importantly, draw down 25% of the Pillar 1 payment.</p>  <p>  Under Pillar 2, there is also a really strong suite of options.  Farmers will be paid to address further our biodiversity challenges, on which they will continue to lead.  There are also incentives to reduce emissions.  Overall, the CAP is a really strong one that has farm incomes at its core and that fully supports the effort to address our biodiversity and emissions-reduction challenges.</p></speech>

However, Brexit has changed the trading situation utterly.  What efforts are the Minister of State and his Department making to diversify the trading destinations of Irish agrifood produce?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900010#H00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question and ongoing interest in this area.  While the immediate threat of Brexit may have passed, we must continue to prepare for the full reality of our new trading relationship with our nearest neighbour.  The promotion of Ireland's high-quality, safe, nutritious and sustainably produced food is a core objective of my Department and the relevant Government agencies, especially Bord Bia.  This has been a particular interest of mine since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for new market development.  Along with developing new markets for Irish produce, we must protect our strong position as a trusted nation in existing markets.</p>  <p>  Encouragingly, despite an extremely challenging 2020 and 2021 as a result of Brexit and Covid-19 issues, Irish agrifood export performance has remained very resilient, with exports for 2020 totalling &euro;14.3 billion and exports in 2021 to date, including those to the United Kingdom, continuing to grow.</p>  <p>  My Department, in close collaboration with industry, has invested significant resources, both financial and political, in developing new markets for Irish food in a wide range of places, including continental Europe, the United States, China, Japan and the Middle East.  The Government's commitment to this strategy is clearly demonstrated by the additional funding that has been provided to Bord Bia in recent annual budgets.  This funding has supported Bord Bia's extensive marketing and promotional activities, in addition to individual companies that are establishing and expanding their presence on international markets.  </p>  <p>  Another component of our strategy to develop and diversify markets is ministerial trade missions.  Despite the challenges presented by Covid-19, the Minister and I have led several virtual trade missions and other key customer engagements in 2021.  These have focused on Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, China, Singapore and West Africa, in addition to our traditional markets in the European Union and the United States.  In 2022, provided the public health situation will allow us to implement our plans, we will have an extensive schedule of in-person trade missions in several key target growth markets for Irish food exports.</p></speech>

A couple of really interesting points have been raised but, considering the difficulty that Covid-19 presented to trade missions, we are only scratching at the surface of the potential of a wide range of new markets.  I would like to ask about co-ordination and co-operation between Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am referring to the notion of Ireland House model, whereby officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the traditional agriculture counsellor, and officials from Bord Bia could work with Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Irish embassies to realise all the opportunities, particularly in the agrifood export sector.</p>  <p>  I would like to tease out the opportunities associated with existing and potential trade deals involving Irish agrifood exporters.  In this regard, we are talking about the roll-over, the deal with Mexico and the opportunities relating to desiccated milk.  We are also talking about the opportunities presented by the huge trade deal with Japan, as the Minister of State mentioned, and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada.</p></speech>

There are significant synergies.  There is a need for interdepartmental co-operation and co-operation with our State agencies.  I am aware of several Ireland House-type arrangements, particularly in the EU, whereby the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia are all in under the one area.  In recent years in my Department, there has been a really significant investment in agriculture attach&eacute;s, who are based in embassies in our key markets.  When travelling or participating in virtual trade missions, we see the important work they do on the ground to help to make progress on the local intricacies in every area for Irish companies that are seeking to enter or expand in a market.  We are trying to navigate the local political circumstances also.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the many opportunities we have, including in Mexico and Japan.  These are all places where we have agricultural attach&eacute;s working with our diplomatic teams in the embassies and Bord Bia, which has great staff all around the world.</p></speech>

It is really drilling down into the importance of the entire brand of Ireland.  Ireland is known as a good food-producing country, a sustainable food-producing country with very high standards.  We saw the great opportunities that existed in respect of getting people into markets such as China and the United States over the years.  It is a matter of considering co-ordination in the coming years, identifying export markets that are environmentally and economically sustainable and ascertaining how they relate to our overall political objective of maximising the potential of EU trade deals and, crucially, the potential of the EU Internal Market.  The latter tends to be undermentioned.  Despite Ireland&rsquo;s having been a member of the EU for nearly five decades, it is not getting the most out of the EU Internal Market.  We must remember this.  Going into 2022, we might double our efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

On his final point, I agree we did not utilise the EU market outside Britain sufficiently.  There is scope for growth in the EU market.  This must be based on a premiumisation model whereby we compete based on the quality and sustainability of our food rather than on price or the quantity exported.  We cannot win a race to the bottom but we can win a race to having top-quality, sustainable food produced a relatively short distance from where we can have the biggest impact.  Crucially, we need to ensure that, when we find and open new markets, the people who benefit will be our primary producers.  It is all for naught if it just results in our processors the big retailers securing more profit, which has happened in the past.</p></speech>

Already, about one third of our food and drink exports go to the EU.  There is potential for further growth.  I witnessed that at first hand when I attended the Anuga Food Fair in Cologne in October.  The European team of Bord Bia was there engaging with many companies across the spectrum.</p>  <p>  When Deputy Carthy talked about the premiumisation of the market, he was absolutely right.  It is the Government policy, as outlined in Food Vision 2030, which refers not only to environmental sustainability but also to economic sustainability for our primary producers.  We intend to grow the value of our exports from &euro;14 billion to &euro;21 billion during the lifetime of this plan, not necessarily based on quantity but on quality, premium markets and the objective of getting a higher return for our produce for our primary producers and agrifood businesses.  This is interlinked with our approach to the climate and improving sustainability even further.  We are aware that we produce some of the best and most sustainable food in the world but we have to do so even better because, in the premium markets, that will be the higher level of ambition that will be expected.</p></speech>

Brexit has presented a range of challenges for the agrifood and fisheries sectors.  The trade and co-operation agreement reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom at the end of 2020 did, however, provide some welcome certainty around the future EU&ndash;UK trading relationship, including in respect of tariff-free trade.  The fact that the UK is no longer in the EU Single Market or customs union still creates significant extra challenges for Irish food companies trading with the UK.</p>  <p>  Both within my Department and across Government, we have prepared intensively, in collaboration with the agrifood industry, for these changes.  In particular, we have invested significantly in assisting the industry to meet the new import and export requirements that do now, or will in the near future, apply to agrifood trade with the UK.</p> <p>This investment has included recruitment of additional staff, provision of new port infrastructure, development of new and enhanced IT systems, provision of detailed training programmes for food businesses and provision of financial supports to help businesses to adapt to the new arrangements.</p> <p> Most recently, on 15 October, along with Government colleagues, I launched the Brexit impact loan scheme, which makes up to &euro;330 million in lending available to eligible businesses in Ireland.  This followed the launch earlier this year of a &euro;14 million capital investment scheme to support the food processing industry and comes on top of regular increases in funding to Bord Bia over recent budgets aimed at helping the industry to pursue market diversification opportunities.</p> <p> I acknowledge the Irish agrifood sector's resilience despite the challenges associated with Brexit.  I assure the Deputy that the Government remains fully focused on supporting the industry as it seeks to grow into the future.</p></speech>

The UK has been changing the goalposts by pushing them out.  It has postponed the next stage of the import control regime on two occasions, including on 14 September.  The most significant element of the most recent UK announcements was that the requirement for pre-notification of agrifood imports will be introduced on 1 January 2022 as opposed to 1 October 2021.  The new requirements for export health certificates, which were due to be introduced on 1 October 2021, will now be introduced on 1 July 2022.  Phytosanitary certificates and physical checks on sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, goods at border control posts due to be introduced on 1 January 2022 and 1 March 2022 will now be introduced on 1 July 2022 instead.  The requirement for safety and security declarations on imports will be introduced on 1 July 2022 as opposed to 1 January 2022.  I reassure the Deputy that our Department, despite that, continues to drive on with the original dates that were in place to have our staff in place and to make sure that the required officials and veterinary staff who are needed are there to process documentation and to support Irish business.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State could follow up with some extra information, it would be really useful.  He might in his supplementary reply refer to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund and its potential targeting in the agrifood sector.</p>  <p>  The last point I wish to make, which is tied to both the previous question and this question, is that a lot of these problems that are emerging are not of our creation and there is nothing we can do about them.  As the Minister of State said, they are in the hands of the British Government.  When it comes to exports, a lot of goods will still go to GB, but looking at the diversification of export routes is vital.  As Deputy Carthy said, it is a matter of maximising the continental market, but that requires the encouragement and engagement of the Department.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on how this is being done to encourage exporters, producers and everyone else to use direct shipping models, straight to the Continent, straight to our biggest market, to go around the potential and existing issues with the GB land bridge.</p></speech>

To respond first to the Deputy's last point, we have seen exponential growth in sailings and movement of Irish goods directly to mainland Europe, specifically France, because of the challenges with the land bridge, but the land bridge is still important.  That is an example of everything we are doing in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which aims to recognise that the UK is still a very important market for us.  Its presence is hugely important to us and provides that competition, but we also need to diversify, to become more flexible and to work on other markets because there is now a medium-term threat from Brexit as the UK opens up more trade deals.  That is where the focus needs to be from a trade perspective.  That is why we have continued to invest even more money in Bord Bia, with a &euro;4 million increase in its budget for last year and a further slight increase for this year.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the Brexit adjustment reserve and our asks from that.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I will continue to keep a close focus on that to make sure it is targeted.  There is also the Brexit loan adjustment scheme, on which I will maybe go into more detail later.</p></speech>

The supply of timber is vital to the timber industry.  The question asks the Minister how we are doing on felling licences.  The timber can be standing, but unless you can fell it you cannot get it into the mills.  The Minister might provide the information and then I will come back with supplementary questions.</p></reply>

There was deep concern among sawmills about where their supply would come from.  I am pleased to say that in the past 12 months we have worked really hard to make significant improvements in that regard.  Each week the Department publishes extensive information on forestry licensing and forestry-related statistics on the weekly forestry dashboard.  Unfortunately, I do not have with me the year-by-year figures; I have the overall five-year figures.  I will send on the specific details of the year-by-year figures the Deputy has requested.  In the past five years, more than 14,000 tree felling licences have issued.  My Department commenced compiling its own timber volume data for issued tree felling licences last year, when the 1,700 felling licences issued covered a volume of just over 5 million cu. m.  To date this year, to the end of November, more than 7.7 million cu. m of timber has been licensed.  That is expected to be about 8 million cu. m by the end of the year.  That will be the highest volume of timber ever licensed in a single year and highlights the improvements we have made in the issuing of felling licences in the past 12 months.</p>  <p>  Coillte's 2022 felling programme will be fully complete by year end, which again instils confidence in the sawmill sector.  Coillte recently completed its contract position to Irish sawmills for 2022, which means that those sawmills enter next year with some certainty around their supply, which certainly was not the case this time last year.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office compiles data on actual volumes of timber harvested from forests based on surveys.  I have been advised that timber harvested from Irish forests ranges from 3.6 million to 3.9 million cu. m over the period 2017-20.  This volume harvested closely relates to the capacity of Ireland's forests to produce timber based on the age of forest crops.</p></speech>

Interestingly enough, in view of the debate on the previous question, selling to the primary market, which, outside of the State, is obviously the UK market, is not a difficulty.  The Minister and I visited a mill at which they said that getting timber through all the formalities was, I think, a 50-second job.  That is a good news.  This is therefore not a problem of Brexit; it is a problem with getting the supply.  Is there or will there be a matching between capacity and the ability of the licensing system to license enough timber, allowing that the producers such as Coillte have enough timber to license?</p></speech>

As the years will progress, we know there will be a significant volume of timber to come onto the market.  We have to match our licensing capabilities with that to be able to deliver that.  We sometimes hear the discussion of Coillte felling licences versus the private side.  As a note for this year, Coillte tends to submit its felling licences in batches, whereas private individuals submit them daily, one or two at a time, perhaps.  In March Coillte submitted more than 1,800 applications and in November a further 430 applications were received.  Those were the two batches.  Private felling licences are submitted daily, but on the breakdown of the total licences that have been issued to the year to date, 1,200 private licences have been issued versus 1,378 licences to Coillte, which is a 47%-53% split.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that Coillte is the largest supplier of timber to our sawmill sector, I think there is a little bit of fairness there in terms of the number of licences.</p></speech>

It is important to put on the record the value of this industry to Ireland.</p></speech>

We are a massive net exporter of timber products.  I think we export 90% of what we produce in Ireland.  That is a credit to the sawmill and the wider sector, and the landowners and farmers who grow the trees and produce them.  I will get the employment and value figures sent on to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It concerns whether or not the T&aacute;naiste has an estimate of the number of expected redundancies that will result from the pandemic.  I understand that efforts have been made to save jobs.  I appreciate that that has been a priority for the Government.  However, it is inevitable that redundancies will arise out of the pandemic.  I know there was consideration at committee last week of legislation in this regard.  I am seeking an estimate on the scale of it.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900012#K00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  Since the outbreak of Covid-19 here in March 2020, the Government has sought to save as many lives and as many livelihoods as possible.  The early introduction of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and its longer term successor, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, provided immediate assistance.  This was followed by many targeted measures for business which have been critical in keeping them afloat and preventing redundancies.  We acted swiftly to prevent the closure of viable companies experiencing temporary pressures on liquidity making temporary amendments to the Companies Act 2014 in respect of insolvency.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday I signed an order commencing the new small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, for leading on this initiative.  From this week, small and micro enterprises have access to a new restructuring and rescue process mirroring examinership, but in an administrative form.  It is designed to be cheaper and faster than the court-sponsored examinership system.  Taken together with the range of grants and loans available, we should save viable businesses and jobs that would otherwise have been lost.</p>  <p>  Last week's labour force survey revealed that more than 110,000 people returned to work in the third quarter of this year.  Encouragingly, employment is up in every region and every sector.  At the end of November, the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment had fallen to 54,824, its lowest level to date.  We are not able to project how many of those will become redundant.</p>  <p>  While many sectors are rebounding relatively quickly, a smooth recovery is certainly not guaranteed and the announcement last Friday of the reimposition of some restrictions is a reminder to us all in that regard.  Redundancies in some businesses will regrettably arise.  We do not have a definitive measure of redundancies arising, as distinct from job losses or gains.  The measures we do have, such as collective redundancy notifications and redundancy claims from the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, give only a partial picture.  That said, after a surge last year, both have dropped significantly in 2021.  Redundancy claims from the Social Insurance Fund for this year are below 2019 levels.  More people became redundant in 2019, before the pandemic, than in this year of the pandemic.  Collective redundancy notifications have dropped approximately 40% from 2020 levels.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste mentioned the drop in the number of people receiving the PUP, he might use his own platform to deal with some of what comes from people like Pat McDonagh, who say that those on the PUP are living it large and they will not go back to work.  All of the available evidence actually suggests that the minute work is available, people are straight back at it and they want to be back in work.  The difficulty for people in the private sector and those working in small companies, in particular, is having available staff and supports there to get them through the process.  The T&aacute;naiste has heard me say many times that the best defence any worker can have is to join a union.  Where there is a union and a process, that is one element of it.  However, the unfortunate things is that many people do not have that, so there will need to be additional staff to shepherd people through.  It is not easy to become redundant.  It is awful to lose your job, but to have to deal with the paperwork then when you may never have had experience of that before is difficult.  I want to hear from the T&aacute;naiste that his Department will provide additional resources to help people through the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900012#K01000"><p>I will certainly examine that.  If more resources and staff are needed, we will provide them.  I accept the Deputy's point that it can be difficult for people to work through the redundancy process.  Some of us have experience of it, but it is more complicated than people may think.  The Deputy's point is well made in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the number of people on the PUP, at its peak there were 650,000 people in receipt of that payment.  That is down to around 55,000 now.  It should be evident to everyone that more than nine out of ten of the people who were on the PUP went back to work.  To characterise all people on the PUP in any sort of negative way is totally wrong.  The statistics do not lie.  More than nine out of ten people on the PUP went back to work as soon as they had the opportunity to do so.  For those who are still on it, around 55,000 people, we are working with them on an individual basis, helping with job searches, education and training opportunities and such.  There are also control measures in place, because a small, but a not tiny, number may not currently be in the State or may be working and claiming at the same time.  We need to work on that.</p></speech>

It really is not easy.  People need to know the timeframes involved in respect of claiming the SIF.  These are things that are not widely known.  They are questions that I get asked.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is asked them himself.  I have never been made redundant, but I have been through the redundancy process.  Collective redundancies are not easy on the people being made redundant, but when they are in a bigger group, they do have that support.  Notwithstanding the SCARP, if that does not work, the company is gone and the person does not have those supports, it is really difficult for them to claim from the SIF or go to the WRC when they have not been given the requisite paperwork.  I encourage the T&aacute;naiste to have a list of FAQs put onto the Department's website.  I know that information is available on the WRC website.  It is not that easy to understand and digest.  I believe that there will be high numbers of people who will need that support in the early part of 2022.</p></speech>

One might say that what is happening in the economy is a bit peculiar.  We are facing a pandemic, yet in the face of that pandemic the economy is growing very rapidly.  There are 2.4 million people at work.  We think that next year there will be more people at work in Ireland than ever before.  Most sectors are doing extremely well, but there are some sectors that have been hit really hard.  We have always had two economies in Ireland, but we really have two economies now, because there are the affected sectors and the unaffected sectors.  Interestingly, statistically, 5,452 potential collective redundancies were notified in 2019.  That rose to 12,514 last year.  There have only been 7,500 such notifications to date this year.  Nobody can say for sure what will happen next year.  However, it is of note that the number of collective redundancies notified this year is half of what it was last year.</p></speech>

We know that in the domestic sector, people can switch suppliers.  My understanding is that some companies are not issuing new contracts, so there is very little competition.  I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste by email on 23 November and to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, citing an example of that in my own constituency.  I am asking what the T&aacute;naiste's Department can do on this issue.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900013#L00100"><p>Wholesale and retail energy costs, electricity and natural gas, have risen significantly over the past year, primarily driven by the market price for natural gas internationally.  The global natural gas price appears to be rising because of a combination of international geopolitical factors, lower than usual reserves and regional supply chain and weather issues.  Increased oil prices are also affecting the cost of petrol and diesel at the pump.</p>  <p>  I am extremely conscious of the pressure that volatility in costs can put on a business, particularly small enterprises, those with tight margins and those particularly dependent on certain fuels.  I have asked my officials to engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the issues arising for business as part of wider Government consideration of the effects of energy costs increasing.  Energy bills can be an inflexible component of the cost base of a business in the short term and in certain energy intensive manufacturing sectors.  These are a key element of cost-competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Energy costs are volatile historically.  Ireland is particularly dependent on natural gas for electricity generation, heating and industry and, therefore, recent international price spikes are a cause for concern for the Government and a threat to our competitiveness.  However, these increases are unlikely to last indefinitely as the market responds and production increases.  Recent global price volatility for fuels is yet another reminder that our society and our businesses should increasingly be looking to reduce our exposure to fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  Government efforts to achieve price competitiveness should focus on delivering diversified energy systems and support for energy efficiency and renewables, with regulation that protects consumers and delivers efficient, competitive energy retail and wholesale markets.  A range of incentives and advice is available to business to help them use energy efficiently, diversify their fuel use and switch to renewable energy sources.  Small businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from SEAI to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their costs.</p></speech>

I completely accept there is an international issue.  I hope it will be short term.  There is a lack of competition whereby there is no possibility of being able to negotiate with a provider.  Domestic customers can switch but not enough of them do.  This competitive side is problematic.  This particular enterprise was paying 6 cent a unit and is now paying 25 cent a unit.  It may well compromise future contracts for this particular company.</p></speech>

I do not recall seeing that particular email but I will ask my private secretary to pull it out for me and I will take a look at it today or tomorrow.  That is a huge increase from 6 cent to 25 cent.  For any business facing that sort of increase in energy costs it will be very serious and very severe.  I will take a look at it.</p>  <p>  Obviously responsibility for energy and energy prices does not fall under my remit or that of the Department.  It is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I will take up the point the Deputy raised on competition and switching with him and with the regulator.  As the Deputy pointed out, domestic users can switch a lot and achieve reductions in their bills this way.  They tend not to.  People have busy lives and do not get around to it.  I encourage them to do so.  For businesses it is a little bit more difficult.  I re-emphasise the point I made earlier.  The best thing we can do, and the Department is doing this, in the medium term is to help businesses to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewables and alternative sources.  These will be much more reliable and stable in price.</p></speech>

The reason I sent the email, and I will resend it for ease of access, is because it is probably one of many examples.  If there is an issue with energy companies refusing to compete, even in a very volatile environment, it needs to be specifically addressed.  When replying to a previous question the T&aacute;naiste spoke about the number of people in employment and this is great.  We also want to retain jobs and we want companies to be able to compete for other work.  This particular company, as I am sure others do, feels it is compromised by virtue of the fact it cannot have some certainty on its energy costs.</p></speech>

It is a toolkit that will highlight the help available from the Government, financial educational training and expertise.  Assistance is available from local employment offices, Enterprise Ireland, the SEAI, Irish Water, the EPA, IDA Ireland and others to help businesses to implement their actions.  The target audience for the toolkit is SMEs and small businesses that want to begin their decarbonisation journey, reduce their energy use and move towards renewables and alternative sources.  It should be useful to any business that does not yet have a sophisticated understanding of its carbon emissions and will help to recommend the steps it should be considering to reduce them.  We are very aware that businesses have a lot on their plate and some will find the transition easier than others.  We also know from detailed engagement in many sectors that most businesses are eager to be more sustainable to add value to their customers and communities by taking action on their environmental impact.</p></speech>

Ireland has a robust suite of legislation to protect and support workers facing redundancies.  The Cahill Duffy report was in response to particular terms of reference that were quite narrow and specific and do not address the generality of redundancies that arise in insolvency situations.</p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement with the social partners, the Oireachtas committee and many others over the past 18 months, the plan for action on collective redundancies following insolvency was published on 9 June this year by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I.  This sets out several commitments to safeguard further the rights of workers in these circumstances, including a range of amendments to company law and employment law, setting up an employment law review group on a statutory basis and the provision of an accessible guidance document to help workers and their representatives navigate the existing legal framework.  The guidance document has just been completed and will be published shortly.  It will provide clear and accessible information for employees facing a collective redundancy situation following a company insolvency.  It will be of great assistance because there has been much misinformation in many cases.  The Deputy referenced Debenhams.  There was much misinformation at that time.  The guidance will be very useful to enhance the work that has been completed by the unions.</p>  <p>  The following recommendations were progressed in the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021, which was signed into law this week.  It amends section 627 to clarify that the liquidator has power to bring or defend proceedings before the Workplace Relations Commission and Labour Court.  It amends section 587 to oblige the liquidator and director to ensure creditors are made aware they have the right to form and participate in a committee of inspection.  This includes employees.  It amends section 666 to provide that where a committee of inspection is appointed it shall include at least one employee creditor member.  Work on drafting amendments to the Protection of Employment Act 1977 will commence in quarter 1 of 2022.</p>  <p>  The remaining company law recommendations will also be progressed next year.  The employment law review group will initially be established on a non-statutory basis as early as possible in 2022.  This will be very useful.  This complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhance participation and transparency for those workers facing a collective redundancy following company insolvency and will also provide for the continued development of employment law in general.  This is a positive development.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact the Act will come into law this week and it will be important.  There are real concerns that once the employer support schemes introduced during the pandemic end there may be many business closures throughout the State.  Everyone has this concern.  Unfortunately, in many cases employees will be made redundant when businesses collapse.  Would it not be more prudent to have the recommendations in the Cahill Duffy report implemented in advance of this possibility?  I do not think the Minister has done enough on this one.  Such a step could protect workers who will face similar shutdowns as those experienced by the then workers at Clerys and as we saw in Debenhams recently.  We witnessed how disgracefully the former workers at Debenhams were treated last year without the report recommendations being implemented.  We witnessed how they had to camp outside their former places of employment in an effort to ensure the assets of the company were not transferred out of the State.  It is five years since the report was published.  I do not believe there has been a serious attempt by the Government to implement the recommendations of the report in full.</p></speech>

That was very loud and clear.  We have allowed a discussion on this with the Deputy.</p></speech>

It was from that that the plan of action would come.  It is not a case of saying that if we implemented all of the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report that would have solved Debenhams or any other redundancies.</p>  <p>  On potential redundancies in the months ahead, I think the Deputy will appreciate that the response during Covid-19 over the past 18 months has been to try to keep businesses open and to prevent the loss of jobs.  Every effort has gone into that.  Yes, it is possible there will be some redundancies in the new year but we will do everything we can to prevent that from happening and that is what the business supports are there for.</p></speech>

I think we will to have to agree to disagree on the Debenhams issue.  When the Minister of State addressed questions on this issue in June of last year he said that on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s direction, a review was to be undertaken into the matter, including legislation in this space to determine if they could do anything to strengthen the position.  Part of the Government&rsquo;s stated plan was to involve some of the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report but not all six of them.  Can the Minister of State provide a rationale as to why the Government is not now considering all six recommendations to be implemented?  I ask this because one should consider the fact that Mr. Duffy advised the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the employment law proposals in the report were part of a package that should be implemented in full rather than picking and choosing those which one liked, otherwise it would not make sense and would be incapable of operation.  We have a real concern that when the employment supports are withdrawn, which they will be, and when we move out of the pandemic, many companies will collapse with people losing their jobs.</p></speech>

There will be more announcements in that space today.  We are very much committed to saving these jobs.  I have not seen the Deputy&rsquo;s committee report on the Duffy Cahill report or read it in detail but it is wrong in the view of the Government, and I will keep saying this, to continually say that implementation of the Duffy Cahill report could have prevented what happened in Debenhams.  That is not the case and the authors very clearly said that also.  We have engaged in work with the Duffy Cahill report and with numerous other reports.  We have reviewed the legislation.  We are making the changes and have a plan of action.  This has been accepted by all relevant stakeholders in this space, including by the employees of Debenhams.  Separate from that, a fund was put in place to assist the Debenhams workers which opened on 1 November of this year, if I remember correctly.  It is open for two years and approximately 458 of those workers have engaged with that and are using those funds to assist them find new work or start new businesses, which is a positive development.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste said that he did not believe that restrictions were going to come in on Wednesday.  They came in on Friday and there was a great deal of confusion with regard to sectors which thought that they would never have to take a backward step when they had to take that step.  My question is about the amount of interaction that there has been, not just with the sector representatives, but also with the worker representatives in this space.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900014#M00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I think I said I was sceptical as to the need for additional restrictions, particularly ones that would impact on family life and businesses and so on.  I will maintain a healthy scepticism around that as Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.  I hate to see any business being closed or being restricted.  As Minister for employment I very much hate to see anyone being laid off specially for the second or third time.  As a politician who believes in personal freedom and liberty I hate to see people&rsquo;s individual freedoms or family life being restricted by Government in any way.  Sometimes it is necessary.  Any time we impose restrictions on people and business we need to ask questions.  Where is the evidence?  Will this work?  Are there alternatives?  That is my responsibility and I will continue to do so, particularly if further restrictions are proposed in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  The new instructions that were announced on Friday were a bitter pill and a deep disappointment to all of us.  They were a body blow in particular for sectors like hospitality, the arts, events, entertainment and leisure which rely on December to see them through other parts of the year.  On Monday, the Taoiseach, the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Catherine Martin, and I met with representatives of the hospitality entertainment and arts sectors.  The meeting included representatives of business bodies and also of trade unions.  At each point of closing and reopening the economy during the pandemic, I have met with stakeholders to update them and listen to their feedback.  This includes the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  </p>  <p>  The announcement made on Friday was based on strong public health advice that notwithstanding a stable or improving epidemiological situation, there are three concerns, in particular.  First, the certainty of increased social mixing as we approach Christmas and the impact that that might have.  There is a flu season that we did not experience last year but expect to experience this year.  Our immunity to the flu has waned as a consequence of social distancing for the past year or two.  There is also uncertainty about the Omicron variant.  </p>  <p>  We sought to keep workers connected to their employers and on the payroll and to help businesses survive through a robust and sustained programme of financial support from Government.  We will continue to provide assistance where and when it is needed and this was evident on Friday when we announced a package of financial interventions for the hospitality, events and entertainment sectors.  This includes a change to the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, or the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, details of which will be confirmed very shortly by the Minister for Finance, an extension of the targeted commercial rates waiver at least until the end of March and an extra &euro;25 million to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media targeted at the live events and sectors covered under the remit of that Department.</p></speech>

On the sectors that have been specifically impacted, particularly the entertainment and hospitality sector, one is talking about the Unite and Mandate unions representing the workers there.  There needs to be more detailed engagement.  When I speak to people, some of whom have attended the meetings or have certainly been briefed after them, I have learned that there needs to be detailed discussions around issues such as ventilation.  If I take the example of a restaurant in my town of Skerries called Potager, it has put in ventilation systems but it is still finding itself restricted.  No account is taken of that.  There needs to be more detailed engagement, and I do not necessarily mean with the T&aacute;naiste, although that would be helpful, but with his officials around mitigation measures as well as the announcement and explaining of how it is going to work.  The T&aacute;naiste said he is accepting feedback.  They tell me they want some traction on the mitigation measures but are not getting that.  How much value is either side are getting out of these engagements when they happen?</p></speech>

We do them in different ways.  There is the hospitality and tourism forum, which is co-chaired by me and the Minister, Deputy Martin.  It very much engages with the representative bodies in that sector and there are many of them.  Unions are also represented there, as they should be.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, chairs the retail forum which is probably less significant in pandemic terms at the moment but was a very big deal when retail was restricted with issues around supply chains.  There is then the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, which has sectoral groups with different unions represented on it through ICTU, which is led by the Taoiseach but I also have a role in that.</p>  <p> Ventilation is covered under the work safety protocol but at the moment no business gets any kind of additional benefit for having good ventilation and that is down to an absence of adequate evidence but there probably should be.  That is something that I have an open mind on and if it is the case that the evidence stacks up and we could allow higher capacities in well-ventilated businesses, that would make sense to me.</p></speech>

The businesses are not being asked for this and they tell me that it is not on the agenda and that they are getting no credit for it but they have put their hands in their pockets.  They did so, incidentally, believing that they were not going to have to take a step back and had in sight what they thought was going to be a reasonably decent trading month.  Many businesses were relying on the fact people would be dying to get back out, as I am and as I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is.  We want to be able to socialise again.  Businesses have spent that money and now find themselves in a situation where their capacity to trade is being curtailed and they are not getting any support.  The T&aacute;naiste said that is not getting any traction and that he has an open mind on it but has he done anything on it?  Has he engaged in any research on this and looked at how it might be done because there are premises with high ceilings and good ventilation?  These are very different from smaller premises with lower ceilings and capacity.</p></speech>

Grants have been provided to schools, for example, for CO<sub>2</sub>monitors and other things like that.</p>  <p>NPHET, our public health adviser, is sceptical in respect of the benefit of HEPA filters.  However, if the pandemic is going to be a long war - unfortunately, it may be a war - part of our vaccine plus response in the next couple of months, the next year or however long the pandemic will last may well be filtration, clean air and allowing more capacity in areas that are well filtered.  It is something on which I will spend more time.</p></speech>

On a positive note, it was confirmed earlier this week that Ireland's allocation under the Brexit adjustment reserve is &euro;1.165 billion at current prices.  This represents just over 20% of the total reserve, or the largest allocation for any member state.</p>  <p>  This week, I spoke at the launch of two ESRI reports on cross-Border trade and services and enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland to high-value foreign direct investment, FDI.  These are the first publications from the ESRI joint research programme with the shared island unit of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This research provides empirical evidence on the competitive advantage that the protocol provides for Northern Ireland.  EU market potential is a driver of location choice for high-value FDI, including manufacturing, which is a sectoral strength for Northern Ireland, having access both to the UK internal market and the EU Single Market.  Importantly, the ESRI work estimates the benefits of what we could do in a co-ordinated way on the island to enhance the overall prospects for attracting high-value FDI and the skilled jobs that go with it.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures.  Following on from the previous Brexit loan scheme, in October we launched the Brexit impact loan scheme which will make up to &euro;330 million in low-cost lending available to eligible businesses.  It is a competitive loan scheme, providing loan terms of up to six years, with loans ranging from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured.  Since the launch of the scheme, 77 loans have been sanctioned, to the value of &euro;7.6 million.  Enterprise Ireland's evolve strategic planning grant offers up to &euro;5,000 to assist exporting companies, while its market discovery fund helps companies to research viable and sustainable new market entry strategies.  Enterprise Ireland, EI, is providing post-Brexit advisory support on sourcing, customs and logistics and can also provide strategic consultancy grants and the agile and operational excellence grants to boost innovation and increase competitiveness.</p></speech>

There are a couple of areas I wish to pick up on in order to drill down.  The first is tied to the point on which the T&aacute;naiste finished in terms of the work EI is doing with businesses to help them prepare.  What work has been carried out in recent weeks to help businesses prepare for the checks that are due to be implemented in Great Britain on 1 January for Irish companies that are exporting to the British market?</p>  <p>  The second and more important point relates to the more general approach to championing diversification.  The diversification of export markets was discussed earlier with the Minister of State with responsibility for agriculture and trade promotion, Deputy Heydon.  I refer to the diversification of routes and logistics to encourage more companies to avoid the land bridge where possible and ship direct to our biggest market which is, of course, the continental EU.  How is that being developed through the appointment of officials from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia or Tourism Ireland within Irish embassies to help us grow our footprint in continental European markets and other markets we approach through European trade deals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900015#N00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He is absolutely right regarding diversification.  If one goes back 100 years, 50 years or even 40 years, Ireland was almost entirely dependent on Britain for trade and foreign currency.  It is never a good thing for a country to be too dependent on another country, particularly a large neighbour if it has one.  For several decades, our industrial and enterprise policies have been about diversification and making sure all our eggs have not been in the one basket.  That has stood to us.  The fact that Brexit has not had as negative an impact on the economy as it might have had is down to the fact that we have so much trade with the US and the eurozone.  We want to increase our trade with areas beyond the eurozone, such as the Middle East, Japan and south-east Asia.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is expanding and IDA Ireland is expanding our offices around the world, appointing new enterprise people to embassies around the world and opening new embassies, as the Deputy will be aware.  We have seen a real improvement in the number of options for exporters and importers.  The number of direct routes now available to continental Europe is extraordinary and they are very much being used.</p></speech>

Although more difficult in Covid times, trade missions are of great importance.  What appetite is there for virtual trade missions in 2022 as well as in person missions where feasible?</p>  <p>  The second point I wish to make relates to maximising talent and labour.  We speak a lot about encouraging Irish students to go into apprenticeships and other things but it is important to also consider maximising the pool of talent arising from freedom of movement within the Single Market.  What efforts are being made to consider potential workers who may be coming out of third level in France, Romania or elsewhere in the EU and have the necessary skills to be HGV drivers and so on?  I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste could elaborate a little on the all-island dynamic in terms of attracting FDI and what, if any, co-operation that involves with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></speech>

I very much agree with the Deputy's remarks in respect of boots on the ground.  There is no substitution for having boots on the ground or personal contact.  It has to happen.  Virtual engagement is great, but it is no substitute for individual personal contact and having boots on the ground.  We are doing exactly that - increasing our embassies, embassy staff, counsuls and agency staff on the ground, not just through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland which fall under my remit, but also through Bord Bia, for example, and Tourism Ireland.  It is making a difference.</p>  <p>  Trade missions are a big part of what we do.  Having been on several of them, the Deputy knows what difference they make.  It is almost like endorsing companies in many parts of the world.  If a company is on a trade mission with the Government, that is seen as an endorsement that it is a good company and can be believed.  It also gives companies access to meetings at a level they would not get if they were not part of the trade mission and maybe the Minister was not in the room.  I wish we could do more of them.  I only managed to get two done last year because of the restrictions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, did several of them.  We are hoping that Omicron will not put paid to trade missions because we would like to do quite a lot of them next year, if possible.</p></speech>

Officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission attended and explained their individual roles on enforcement and compliance in this area in respect of taxation, PRSI and employment rights.  While there was some debate about the actual scale of the problem, there was general agreement that it is a complex issue.  Although the data do not suggest that false self-employment is becoming more prevalent in Ireland, it was stressed that, regardless of the scale of the problem, steps must be taken to protect workers from exploitation.  In that regard, the Department of Social Protection regularly carries out targeted investigations in certain sectors.</p>  <p>  The revised code of practice on determining employment status was published by the Minister for Social Protection in July and reflects recent case law.  Work has commenced on placing it on a legislative footing.  There is ongoing engagement at official level and the issue is tabled for discussion again at the LEEF subgroup meeting on 13 December, which I will be attending, to see what further action can be taken.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is expected to announce proposals on platform work this week, with a proposal for a directive from the directorate general for jobs and social rights and a set of guidelines from the directorate general for competition, featuring aspects such as employment status of platform workers, algorithms, cross-border work and taxation.</p> <p>There is also expected to be a communication on decent work.  We will consider these proposals in due course.</p></speech>

At yesterday's committee meeting, we heard from representatives of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, who talked about the need to improve the numbers working in the haulage industry.  I know the Minister of State is closely watching the situation at An Post, which, I have been informed, recently lost a very large contract for Amazon deliveries.  I understand Amazon is saying it is going to do its own deliveries, but checking websites shows there are jobs available that I would put under the heading of bogus self-employment.  They certainly do not amount to employment in the strictest sense of the word, although, on my reading of it, people will be treated like employees.  We need a laser-like focus on this issue.  There is a crisis in the haulage industry at the moment, as the Minister of State is well aware.  We have a situation whereby these large companies are coming in and apparently setting the rules.  Some of these jobs are advertised on <i>indeed.com</i>.</p></speech>

I accept the Deputy's anecdotal evidence in this regard but the most recent, pre-Covid, CSO labour force survey statistics from quarter 1 of 2020 show the number of self-employed individuals in Ireland at the end of March 2020 stood at 331,600.  This represents an increase over the year of 2.4%.  However, the previous year had shown a decrease of 3.8%, indicating marginal fluctuation in the figures.  While there is anecdotal evidence out there, the exact number of incorrectly classified self-employed workers is not known.</p>  <p>  I agree with some of what the Deputy said.  Bogus self-employment is wrong.  It facilitates exploitation, distorts competition from a tendering perspective and leads to a loss of income for the State.  That is why it has been receiving attention from the Government, was discussed at the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, last May and will be discussed again at the forum this coming Monday.</p></speech>

Again, I encourage him to log on to<i>indeed.com</i>and have a look at the types of jobs being offered there.  They are what would previously have been considered decent jobs.  It is not an accident that there is a crisis in the haulage, transport and logistics sector at this time.  One of the elements of that crisis is that these jobs are not attractive jobs for people to do.  They are highly pressured and now it is a case of, &quot;Have a pat on the back, there is no sick leave or anything else but, congratulations, you are an entrepreneur now.&quot;  People have to provide their own vehicle but still must work to a roster.  There is a lot of that out there if one looks for it.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to look into the loss of the large Amazon contract by An Post.  It is a huge loss.  Amazon says it will provide its own drivers but it is not doing so.  If he looks at the company's website, he will see how many people it directly employs, notwithstanding the fact there are people who are, in effect, working for it.  If he is not prepared to quantify the scale of this problem, we are not going to be able to deal with it.</p></speech>

However, having engaged with the industry, I also know there are haulage companies that are offering very good terms and conditions of employment and they, too, are having serious difficulty recruiting staff.  It is unfair to say the reason there is a difficulty in the haulage industry is that everybody is expecting hauliers to be self-employed.  That is simply not the case and it is not factually accurate.</p>  <p>  I concur with the Deputy that there is anecdotal evidence of an issue in this regard.  We need to strengthen the data and evidence and ensure this issue is tackled, because it is wrong from an exploitation perspective and in terms of loss of earning to the State and, in addition, it distorts competition when legitimate companies are hiring people legitimately and paying their taxes but are unable to compete.  That is why the matter will be on the agenda next Monday at LEEF.</p></speech>

The Government is a very strong supporter of vaccine equality in the world.  Morally, we need to make sure the world is vaccinated.  We were not able to defeat smallpox and polio on a national basis; it could only be done on an international basis.  This is what we need to do with Covid as well.  Any country with a population that is not fully vaccinated is a potential reservoir for reinfection.  It is the right thing to do morally and also from the point of view of self-interest.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, international trade is a competence of the European Union under the treaties and, in exercising that competence, the European Commission engages fully with member states, including Ireland, through a variety of committees, working parties and groups, including on intellectual property.  As part of the EU, we are very strong advocates of what is called compulsory licensing.  This would allow governments to license the production of vaccines on a generic basis, whether the pharmaceutical companies agree to it or not.  It could be very useful for countries like South Africa and India, which have vaccine-making capacity, to be allowed to license the production of the vaccines in the plants in their countries, irrespective of whether the companies approve.  That is what we, as part of the European Union, are supporting and advocating at present.</p>  <p>  I have an open mind on the alternative suggestion of a TRIPS waiver.  I have always said that if we receive a WTO proposal, we will examine it.  That has not happened yet.  The TRIPS waiver, just like compulsory licensing, will not result in any new vaccine plants being built or made operational, which means it will not be enough on its own.  What is needed is a comprehensive response involving capacity-building, know-how, qualified scientists and technicians, capital, and experienced medicine and safety regulators.  All those elements are needed to get vaccines from the laboratory into people's arms.  That is why it is better to have governments and pharmaceutical companies working together to find a solution rather than trying to create conflicts between government and industry.  I do not think that is the right approach.  We need a global solution that is comprehensive, intelligent and workable and that does not disincentivise innovation.</p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million in funding to COVAX in 2021 and will donate 1.3 million vaccines this year to low-income countries as part of that programme, with more to come in 2022.  The first 500,000 Irish doses donated through the facility reached Nigeria on 29 November, with further donations of Irish vaccines taking place in the coming weeks.  In addition, Ireland has delivered on its commitment to donate 335,000 doses to Uganda.  The Irish people have shown enormous generosity in donating through UNICEF's Get a Vaccine, Give a Vaccine programme, which I strongly support and endorse.  The EU has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative, and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.  As a Government, we have consistently opposed the export bans advocated by others, including some of those now advocating a TRIPS waiver.</p></speech>

The truth, however, is that the EU and the Government are an active barrier to solutions.  Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO has said: "It's a tragedy and it's an abomination that today there are frontline workers going to work in Covid wards in many countries that still have not been vaccinated.  That is a disgrace."  Mary Robinson has stated: "The European Union represents the biggest roadblock to this effective solution to ramp up the supply of lifesaving vaccines."  Each day, six times more booster shoots are being administered in high-income countries than first doses in low-income countries.</p></speech>

More than 100 countries have asked for this, according to M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  The nursing unions were the latest, with about 30 of them throughout the world, including the Vaccine Alliance and so on.  In our country, 400 leading scientists have expressed a similar view.  No progress has been made on this.</p> <p> I welcome the figures the T&aacute;naiste gave on vaccines.  A total of 1.3 million vaccine doses will be given to low-income countries this year, and he might give us a breakdown of that.  Nevertheless, he stated trade is a competence of the EU, but health is not.  This is a health issue.  Trade is subservient in this regard.  He talked about not interfering with the entrepreneurial spirit but that too is questionable to me because all the vaccine production has been financed predominantly by, as I understand it, public money.</p></speech>

While other countries such as the United States, on some sort of national security grounds, stopped vaccines being exported to developing countries, the EU exported as many vaccine doses as we made for ourselves.  I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in is a Euro-critical party but that is going too far.  The EU has exported more vaccine doses than any other major player in the world and Ireland has been part of that.  We have donated 1.7 million vaccine doses and will do more in 2022.</p>  <p>  I did not say anything about the entrepreneurial spirit, although I did say something about incentivising innovation, which is important.  It is very possible that in 2022, we will turn to companies such as BioNTech, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and others and ask them to develop a vaccine to the variants and treatments for Covid.  We cannot just dismiss concerns about disincentivising innovation.  It is a serious matter that needs to be considered.</p></speech>

These countries are looking for the opportunity to provide for themselves and they are in a position to do it.  We have prevented them previously, in the context of AIDS and other pandemics, and we are doing it again.  It is simply disgraceful and completely out of step with the will, spirit and passion of the Irish people.

COVAX has done so much but there has not been an assessment of whether it has met the need.  Clearly, it has not because the figures speak for themselves.  Just 8% of people in low-income countries will have received at least one dose by the end of 2021, compared with 76% for high-income countries.  I have mentioned just some of the organisations that are crying out for a change of approach and for the TRIPS waiver to be considered as a matter of urgency.  They are hardly doing that for the good of their health, which is probably a bad choice of words in the context of Covid-19.  Moreover, there is no transparency regarding the deals being done bilaterally with individual pharmaceutical companies, and no acknowledgement of the vast sums of public money that have been used to incentivise, with an indemnity clause that is never ending, and none of this has ever been discussed.

Time and again, even when looking for State services, we hear the mantra no labour is available.  If there is genuinely no labour available here, a debate we could have with the Ministers for Social Protection and Finance in respect of incentives, what will the Government do to ensure vital services are available in this country?</p></reply>

In general, we try to analyse and identify any areas where there are critical skills gaps or a shortage of labour.  The Department regularly engages with stakeholders through the various forums and also individually with different sectors and groups.  We carry out a detailed analysis twice a year on every sector in respect of which shortages have been identified.  Where evidence that is gathered clearly identifies shortages, we react and change the process for permits, something I will return to presently.</p><p>That is only one measure.  The best way to deal with labour shortages is to predict them and invest the funding and various supports in all levels of education to address that.  That is what we try to do to work more clearly and directly with the various sectors.  Following reforms of the past ten years, we have a very enterprise-facing education system, through further education and training and all the commitments and announcements regarding apprenticeships, skills and on-the-job training, along with investment in higher education, research and innovation to drive automation.  Every effort is made to deal with skills gaps and to work with the relevant sectors.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the employment permit scheme, a regime designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately qualified non-EEA workers to fill skills and labour shortages in Ireland.  This objective must, however, be balanced by the need to ensure no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals are available to undertake the work and that the shortage is genuine.  We look for evidence, backed up by the parent Department, that the shortage is genuine and every effort is made to source that labour or talent locally.  It is sometimes difficult to explain.</p> <p>If there are, potentially, 40,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and another 150,000 people on long-term or short-term social welfare, it is sometimes hard to explain how we also need to bring in other talent.  We try to close those gaps by working through the Department of Social Protection and with employers through the range of schemes, such as pathways to work, to join the dots there and try to get people who have various skills, and through upskilling if needs be, to fill those job vacancies.  Where that cannot happen we use the permits scheme to bring people in as well.</p></speech>

It is a skilled job, but one that does not require much formal qualification.  It appears that the Government's system in this case finds it impossible to get enough people in the State to provide those services.  People who are in critical situations are not getting care.  On the other hand, I understand that the work permit system is so restrictive that it is not possible to bring in people where there are none available to do home care.  Has the Minister of State had discussions with his colleagues on whether we should issue work permits to people to come here to provide these vital front-line services in the community?  We saw in the Covid-19 pandemic how advantageous home care is in many cases as an alternative to nursing home care.</p></speech>

However, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right.  We have gone the full circle.  There are families and people across the country for whom we could not get home help hours for a long time because the resources were not available.  Now the hours are available, but we do not have the people.  Families are being left in appalling situations.  Loved ones are being left in hospitals, unable to leave, because we cannot get home care workers.  They are available internationally.  We require a system with flexibility whereby families can get their loved ones cared for at home through some type of change to the work permits system.  This is very urgent.  There are thousands of people and families awaiting home care at present who cannot get it due to the lack of staff.</p></speech>

I have met farmers who are facing into a very busy period at present with milking, cows calving and so forth.  It is a 24-7 job with health and safety issues involved.  They have identified workers abroad in places such as the Philippines, but the amount of time it takes to get the work permit issued and the visa on top of that means that the calves will be ready for slaughter by the time it is done.  It is too long.  The system must be shortened and speeded up so these people can get here sooner.  More staff have to be put on that work.</p></speech>

The first is that of home care workers.  I did not see Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's debate during the week, but it was discussed with the Taoiseach last week in the House.  It is an issue we all have commented on lately.  We are engaging, and will engage, with the home care providers in the sector to try to gather the evidence to make the case.  We carried out two reviews over the last year since the onset of the pandemic.  In April of last year we changed the scheme to allow permits for healthcare assistants, who generally work in nursing homes, to come here to work.  There was evidence to show there was a shortage there and there was agreement with the HSE and the Department of Health that they were needed.  A structure and a training regime were put in place to facilitate that.</p>  <p>  Phase two of that was the demand for workers in the home.  We have tried to engage with the providers in that area.  They have gathered evidence for us and we are working through that evidence.  However, in the last review, which was completed in the last few weeks, the evidence was not there to show that there is a need to revert to the permits scheme to bring skills or labour in from abroad.  The biggest issue we have to try to tease through is that 75% of the people who work in that sector at present are part-time.  I understand that a number of them might choose to be part-time, but we have to go deeper and analyse that.  The Department of Health is involved in that process.</p></speech>

We know that labour shortages are endemic in this society.  We have to import most of the deckhands on fishing boats.  There are delays in the licences in that area.  Amazingly, we are very short of people in the hospitality sector.  People in that sector tell us constantly that they cannot hire workers.  Perhaps I am looking at the wrong end of the story and maybe another issue under the remit of the Department is more relevant here, namely, the issue of a living wage to make it attractive to work and the interface between gainful work and social welfare.  If the Minister of State wishes to address that issue rather than that relating to work permits, I would be interested.  However, I am also interested in exactly what he is doing to streamline the entire work permits process.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the hospitality sector.  On one hand, there are thousands of jobs available in that sector, and we have given permits and prioritised certain areas, such as chefs and so forth.  On the other hand, if one analyses the live register and the people on the PUP, there are thousands with a background in hospitality.  There is a mismatch there and we are trying to close that gap.  Yes, it involves pay and conditions.  Yes, it involves choices and people are re-evaluating their careers.  Again, we try to support that.  A large amount of money is set aside for education and the upskilling agenda.  I ask employers in all these sectors to engage with the pathways to work scheme to attract labour.</p>  <p>  With regard to the farmers, we made 100 permits available, in conjunction with the Department of Health, to bring in dairy farmers.  My sense is that this will not be enough, but I have to work with the relevant Departments and agencies, notably, the Irish Farmers Association and so forth, in the sector to be able to gather the evidence.  However, we react quite quickly and have done.  The number is 100 at present.  We can increase that in the next review if there is proven demand.  We try to work with every sector to encourage them to source labour locally and to avail of the supports from the Government through the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and our Department to make that happen.</p></speech>

The enterprise agencies of my Department directly and indirectly support approximately 635,000 jobs in the regions outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  In preparing for Brexit, the Government introduced a range of measures to assist businesses and SMEs.  The 2022 budget allocation provided to Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices will be used to service existing programmes as well as to provide the scope to explore the potential for new schemes to address the ongoing impact of Covid-19 and Brexit.  The customs insights course from Enterprise Ireland helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to move goods from, to and through the UK.</p>  <p>  To date, my Department has made available over &euro;126 million in regional enterprise funding through the regional enterprise development fund, the Border enterprise development fund, BEDF, and the regional enterprise transition scheme to assist locally-led regional enterprise and development projects.  The BEDF was launched in 2020 with the aim of improving the international competitiveness of enterprises in the Border region in the context of Brexit and other market challenges.  To date, 11 projects have secured funding of &euro;17.4 million under this fund.  The BEDF is part of a &euro;28 million economic stimulus package for Border counties and further enhances Brexit supports for smaller businesses supported by the LEOs and drives SME business transformation for businesses in the Border region who are challenged by Brexit and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s regional enterprise transition scheme was recently introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of assistance for regional enterprise development and assistance to regions facing difficulties as a consequence of Brexit and Covid-19.  Last October, 24 projects secured funding of &euro;9.3 million, with funding approved in each region.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across the Government and with stakeholders to examine all appropriate business supports to assist businesses impacted by Brexit.</p></speech>

How stand the specific regional enterprise plans?  Many of them came to their conclusion in 2020.  Will they be renewed and put back in place?</p> <p> The Minister of State mentioned a lot of macro stuff which was irrelevant.  I will try to give him a sense of real broadband issues.  A leading domestic and international exporting company has been in a small town for nearly 90 years.  It cannot get access to proper broadband to allow it to e-tail the company and provide a better service to its customers, both retail and wholesale.  The relevant town will not be included in the national broadband plan for several years.  Those are the day-to-day challenges facing enterprises in our regions.</p> <p> In the context of Brexit, the Minister of State mentioned the customs courses.  What specific programmes are in place for companies in the west and in the Border region who face the disadvantage of challenging companies which have the best of both worlds, as it were, in Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

Under the previous plan, &euro;16.7 million was invested in the west on nine specific projects.  The new plans are coming to the final stage.  These plans have been developed through key stakeholder engagement, involving Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the local enterprise offices, local authorities and many private enterprises operating in specific regions.  We want each plan to produce proposals unique to the specific region.  We hope to launch the west regional enterprise plan at the end of January or the beginning of February.  Last week the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approved funding of &euro;140 million to underpin the nine regional enterprise plans, enabling us to put out a call in the middle of next year for funding proposals to support enterprise development across the nine regions including that of the west.</p></speech>

We could take the entire &euro;140 million in the west.  Will the plans encompass the Government's new climate action priorities, particularly in the west?  There is much rather lazy focus on wind energy, but much more could be done with hydrogen production and advancing the infrastructure of the area in a climate-friendly way.  Will the enterprise plan include specific targets to encourage companies and communities to embrace that?  Will the shortcomings of the previous plan, which were not delivered for whatever reason, be addressed in preparing the new plan?</p></speech>

They will be designed with input from the key stakeholders in each region.  It is up to the regions to devise their own plans and to prioritise what they see are the most ambitious targets they can achieve within their regions in the coming years.  I already outlined the key stakeholders that will participate in that.  I would be happy to get a copy of the draft plan and share it with the Deputy and he can have an input into it in that way.</p>  <p>  Lessons need to be learned from the previous plans.  Much of the funding that was allocated has not been drawn down and we need to understand why.  Obviously, the Covid pandemic was a contributory factor but it is not the only reason.  Earlier this week I met the CEO of Enterprise Ireland who is determined that the new schemes to be announced next year take account of the past experiences and what went wrong with some of the schemes in the previous plan.</p></speech>

My Department is overseeing the development of nine new regional enterprise plans.  These are bottom-up plans, developed by regional stakeholders which identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities and enable job creation across the regions including in the south-east region through collaborative regional actions.  The new south-east plan which covers Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford will build on the core activities of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local employment offices and the wider range of State bodies involved in supporting enterprise development in the region.</p>  <p>  I have responsibility for driving the delivery of the new plan in the south east, and over the past year I have engaged directly with the regional steering committee made up of our enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the local enterprise offices, local authorities, higher and further education bodies, businesses and others in the south east.  That committee is chaired by Patsy Carney, director of Kinetic Labs.</p>  <p>  The regional stakeholders in the south-east region have signed off on five focused strategic objectives together with supporting actions for the region on starting and growing businesses, green growth, smart specialisation, innovation and placemaking.</p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to publish the south-east plan and launch it early in 2022.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford.  I welcome the job announcements for Kilkenny and Waterford this year but Carlow got none.  Carlow really needs to be looked at.  We are the smaller county.  I ask the Minister of State to do what he can.  I welcome that he will be launching the regional plans and in particular the one for the south east.  I have been working with IDA Ireland and I welcome that there is a new build for Carlow.  I understand that facility will be ready in July 2022.  That was meant to have been done five years earlier in 2017 but the building is nearly complete.  We are delighted with that, but we need to promote Carlow more.  What is the update on jobs for Carlow?</p></speech>

Two projects were supported.  Insurtech Network Centre in Carlow, which supports technology solutions to the global insurance services sector, received &euro;1.4 million and the National Design Innovation Hub received &euro;1.843 million.  Under the previous regional plan there was significant investment in Carlow.  I hope there will be further investment in Carlow under the new regional action plan, which, as I have outlined, will be published early in the new year.  It is a plan specific for the south-east region, devised by the people in that region who know the region best and know what is needed and where the investment needs to be made to support job creation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned IDA Ireland.  She will be aware that IDA Ireland published its strategy earlier this year and for the first time one of its key pillars is to have 50% of new investment in the regions during the lifetime of this plan.  That is a significant commitment to regional development </p></speech>

I welcome the action plan which is very important.  These regional plans are very important so that we look after our smaller towns, such as Bagenalstown, Tullow and Hacketstown in my area, where I hold clinics.  Broadband is another issue we need to address, along with that of keeping our small companies going.  However, jobs are the big thing particularly now that we are going to have a technological university for the south east.  We have so much to offer.  Carlow will be a major priority for me - Carlow-Kilkenny - and I will be looking for jobs there.</p></speech>

The plan is devised by the people of the south east.  I am very confident that there are objectives and targets for every county in the south east and it will not just concentrate on one particular county.  When I engaged with the stakeholders, I stressed that if it is to be successful, it must have buy-in from all counties; all counties must be supported.</p></speech>

The location of Central Pharma, in what was originally an advance facility in Kerry Technology Park, is very good news for Tralee and will bring many jobs to the town.  The second facility will also potentially provide hundreds of jobs.  It is crucial, therefore, that we drive this project forward as quickly as possible.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste provide an update on the matter.</p></reply>

I know both Deputy Griffin and Councillor Jim Finucane, among others, have been working on the matter for some time, and the Deputy has raised it with me several times on the floor of the House.</p>  <p>  The latest position is that IDA Ireland is continuing to engage with stakeholders to seek a suitable site for the proposed building in Tralee.  Securing planning permission and the construction of the building will take time, but it is intended that the facility will be delivered during the life of the current IDA Ireland strategy either during or before 2024, whatever the case may be.  The advance technology building may provide a new office for an investor or industrial investment given the flexible nature of IDA Ireland building solutions.</p>  <p>  Provision of appropriate property and infrastructure to meet the needs of multinational companies remains essential to winning foreign direct investment, FDI.  Advance technology buildings are designed to provide high-quality production and office accommodation for future manufacturing and technological businesses.  They usually range from 25,000 to 30,000 square feet and are high-specification buildings, flexible in use, and provide office or industrial space or, in some cases, a combination of both.  The buildings are completed to achieve leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, accreditation where possible.  Under the regional development pillar of its strategy, IDA Ireland aims to win investment to propel recovery and support development in every region of Ireland, targeting 400 investments outside Dublin by end of 2024.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is actively encouraging investors to locate outside the Dublin area, be that through marketing potential investment sites outside the main cities or working to develop recognised industry clusters.  The agency continues to engage with new companies on promoting Ireland as a location for their business and utilises virtual site visits as opposed to physically visiting the county.  IDA Ireland will continue to position County Kerry to prospective companies in 2022 and beyond.</p></speech>

This is a very positive development and I welcome it.  I wish to emphasise that we have no shortage of space in Kerry for these type of facilities.  Kerry Technology Park is full of sites that would be very suitable for a second facility.</p>  <p>  Central Pharma will begin operations in the first quarter of next year.  The likelihood is that this company would not have come to Tralee if it were not for the advance facility.  I was delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy English, visited the technology park with me recently to see the available sites and how close it is to Munster Technological University, which could also be a beneficial location for potential investors.  I would be grateful if the process could be speeded up as much as possible in order to get the planning permission application submitted.</p>  <p>  On balanced development within the county, the T&aacute;naiste knows that Killarney, to which he is a frequent visitor, is thriving in the context of tourism and hospitality.  We need an industrial balance as well, however.  Killarney would also be a suitable location for another facility for Kerry.</p></speech>

That means investment in tourism - the county is hugely successful in that regard already - food production, energy, public services and FDI.  The county has shown what an attractive place it can be for FDI and for major companies such as Liebherr and Fexco.  We anticipate seeing further investment in Tralee during the course of this Government's term of office.  That is probably the best approach for the county.  Just as Ireland needs a diverse economy that does not put all our eggs in one basket, the same applies at county level.  That is the strategy for Kerry.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has been in touch with me quite often about the tourism industry and the impact the recent restrictions will have on the hospitality sector.  He may be aware that the Government announced this morning that the best solution is to restore the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to the full amount, a return to the November rates, for the duration of December and January.  I know that will be welcomed because the Deputy has advocated for that.  We had hoped to do something more targeted with the Covid restrictions support scheme, but when we tried this it proved too complicated, so we decided to do it across the board.</p></speech>

That money circulates in the economy.  Money goes around.  When one person suffers, everyone suffers; when one person does well, everyone does well.  I remember during my time as a publican, when agriculture was going well and farmers had money in their pockets, money circulated around the village and everyone did well.  That is why the restoration of the EWSS is really important.  It will be meaning for many people this Christmas and it will lift all boats in the economy.  I welcome that.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste's positive approach in the context of the broader economy in Kerry.  As I said, advance facility solutions work.  They are a good model and they work for peripheral counties, such as mine, that are at a disadvantage in attracting FDI.  I have no doubt that the second facility in Tralee, when it goes ahead, will be filled.  If the T&aacute;naiste were to consider providing one for the southern part of the county, that would also be important.  It would be filled and create jobs.</p></speech>

The restoration of the EWSS to the full November amount will benefit all companies that are down 30% or more in turnover.  It will benefit and help the hospitality, arts, entertainment and night-life sectors to get through this difficult period.  It will be in place until at least the end of January, whether or not restrictions are eased.  It will benefit some companies that do not need it as much, such as in retail, construction and services, for example, but as the Deputy correctly pointed out, that will mean more money circulating in the economy.

That was an issue about which there was grave concern.  I recently met the chief executive of Cork city local authority to discuss the authority's plans for the city centre and to deal with vacancies and to make the city and county a more attractive place to win investment and to create jobs.  The local authority has plans in train that we are supporting.  The regional enterprise plans are key to driving that activity and take a bottom-up approach to engage with State agencies, those working in my Department, to create jobs in addition to working with the local enterprise office, the local authorities and the education system in order to work through ideas to create solutions and actions that will help create jobs in Cork, including the city.</p>  <p>  There has been much success in Cork in recent years regarding jobs, for which I will provide details.  Most important in that has been the work with the local enterprise offices.  We engaged with them extensively during our recent visit there.  Much good work is going on to support and create jobs across many sectors.  There are some sectors that cannot be supported with grant aid but can be supported with mentioning, soft supports and trading online vouchers and such initiatives which work well.</p>  <p>  It is also important that Cork City Council commissioned a city centre economic revitalisation strategy.  Following considerable consultation, it will be available in quarter 1 of 2022.  Actions are already under way to make the city more attractive in order to win investments.  Seven streets have been pedestrianised, thereby facilitating 1,000 outdoor dining spaces, the approval of 230 outdoor dining grants and the approval of five major winter-proofing grants for outdoor dining areas.  The latter are currently being installed.</p>  <p>  On Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, much good work has been carried out and they are featured in the regional enterprise plans that will be launched in early 2022.  In Cork, Enterprise Ireland works with and assists more than 600 client companies in the city and county, who employ a total of 25,706 people.  According to my Department's Annual Employment Survey 2020, a total of 2,712 new jobs were created by client companies in Cork.  Considering some job losses by client companies, this translated in a net increase of 686 jobs.  Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with community groups in County Cork, developing community enterprise centres to foster microenterprises, which can in time grow into larger companies.  Enterprise Ireland also supports centres in Cork city such as Cork Urban Enterprises, in addition to the Churchfield Community Trust.  IDA Ireland is doing great work in Cork.  There are 43,856 jobs with IDA Ireland involvement.  A big part of its strategy for 2021 to 2024 is a focus on regional development in Cork, including the city.</p></speech>

T&aacute; pac&aacute;iste de thaca&iacute;ochta&iacute; de dh&iacute;th ar dhaoine anois le dul i ngleic leis an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im seo.</p><p>There is no doubt that winter is here.  Those on low and middle incomes are facing energy price hikes in the months ahead.  Today, we hear from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that inflation is now running at 5.3%, the highest rate in more than 20 years.  This is largely driven by energy costs.  The CSO tells us that, in the past 12 months, the price of electricity has shot up by 21%, the price of gas by 26% and the cost of heating one's home by a staggering 71% if using oil.  In a survey published by my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, in which 14,000 people took part, 99% of respondents said that the Government was not doing enough to tackle the cost of living.  Some 77% said that this has had an impact on their mental health.</p><p>Since the beginning of this year, suppliers have announced more than 35 price increases.  <i>Bonkers.ie</i>shows that those price hikes could increase annual household energy bills by as much as &euro;1,300.  Workers and families need a helping hand now.  </p><p>Across Europe, we see governments responding to soaring energy prices in order to shield households.  In Spain, VAT on electricity bills has been slashed by 11%.  In Italy, the Government has launched a package worth &euro;6.2 billion to protect households from rising energy prices to the end of the year.  This Government has done nothing despite the fact that we in this State face the highest energy prices in Europe.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in call on the T&aacute;naiste's Government to wake up.  We have repeatedly called for relief to be provided to low and middle-income households, households that will struggle when they receive their bills for electricity, heating and oil in the coming months.</p><p>In October, the Commission launched a toolbox for action to support member states in tackling rising energy costs.  We have said that the Government should work with the Commission to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills, thereby providing an immediate 12% cut in energy prices for households this winter.  The Government rejected that proposal but we have put forward many others.  For example, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is aware that many jurisdictions operate discount schemes for households.  Under these schemes, the electricity or gas provider applies a discount to the household's energy bill, with the amount of the discount then reimbursed to the provider by the State.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is aware of this because a similar scheme already operates here through the free electricity allowance.  This allowance is automatically deducted from the household bill and the supplier is reimbursed by the State.  A similar scheme could be rolled out if the political will was there to provide immediate financial relief in respect of the electricity and home heating bills of low and middle-income households this winter.</p><p>Has the Government even explored that option?  If not, will the T&aacute;naiste consider or commit to exploring that option?  We are asking the Government to wake up to the fact that people are hard-pressed.  These numbers do not lie.  There has been a 71% increase in the cost of heating your home if you use oil.  There has also been an increase of more than 20% in the cost of electricity and gas.  Despite their households having cheaper energy costs than those in this State, other European Union member states are acting, in some cases through multibillion euro packages, to support workers and families through this period.  In light of the fact that the Government is reported to be considering a financial package, how long must workers and families wait for it to act?  Households cannot wait any longer.</p></speech>

The cost of living in Ireland is rising very quickly.  After more than a decade of little or no inflation, we now see prices raising at a rate of more than 5% a year.  We have not seen that in 20 years.  This is very much driven by increases in fuel and energy prices.  The Government is very aware of that.  We know it is very difficult for many families who are trying to make ends meet and find enough money to pay the bills at the end of the week or the end of the month.  Of course, we also know it from our own experience of going into the shop or forecourt or getting our electricity or gas bills through the post.  We need to help.</p>  <p>  Government is helping in at least four ways: pay increases, welfare and pension increases, a reduction in personal taxation and help with the cost of living in respect of a number of services.  To expand on that a little bit more, with regard to pay increases, an increase in the minimum wage will kick in from January and there are also increases in public sector pay.  There are also significant pay increases in most, although not all, parts of the private sector.  With regard to welfare and pensions, an increase in the fuel allowance has already kicked in.  Increases in the pension and weekly welfare payments will kick in from the first week of January.  Reductions in personal taxation will also kick in from January.  This means that people will pay less income tax.  This is being achieved through increases in tax credits and an increase in the cut-off for the standard rate of tax.  People will see that in their payslips in January.  There are also other things that can help with the cost of living.  There is to be a rent freeze in real terms.  The freeze in childcare fees will be really important to many families who spend a lot of money on childcare.  There will also be a reduction in the cost of medicine.  These will also kick in from January.  These are the four sets of actions the Government is taking which should see the rate of inflation coming down in 2022.  That is what we anticipate will happen.</p>  <p>  With regard to energy prices in particular, the Government is aware of the European toolbox and the options available to us to assist families and households with the high cost of energy.  These are currently under consideration.  We would certainly like to do something to help with electricity bills and perhaps also gas bills.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Michael McGrath and Eamon Ryan, are working on that at the moment.  We hope to be in a position to make a decision on that in the near future so that people will see the effects of that decision in the bills they receive being a little bit lower than expected in the new year.</p></speech>

It was the same when the Government was going to roll out free antigen tests but then Lidl and so on sorted it out.  It is likely that the same thing will happen here.  The Government will take so long to come up with a scheme that the weather will have got better.  We will be into the spring or the summer and the Government will say that help is no longer needed.  We have been raising this issue with the Government since October.  There have been 35 energy price increases.  It was 4&deg;C yesterday.  I am not sure what the temperature outside is at the minute.  People are suffering as a result of these energy price increases.  <i>Bonkers.ie</i>tells us that they amount to &euro;1,300 per year.  The T&aacute;naiste has not mentioned anything about offsetting the rapid rise in oil prices.  Most people in rural Ireland use oil rather than electricity or gas to heat their homes.  Oil heating has seen the sharpest increase, 71% in a year.</p><p>There are solutions.  We already have a model through the electricity discount scheme.  We can expand that to other operators.  When is the Government going to bring forward a scheme?  I am conscious that next week is the D&aacute;il's last sitting week for the year.  While Government is doing basically nothing on this issue, bills are coming in and households are under additional pressure and wondering how to make ends meet.</p></speech>

We are particularly focusing on electricity because it is a bill everyone gets.  It is something that people have to use.  They do not have any choice as to what type of energy to use and must use what comes in on the wires.  We are working on that at the moment.  As I said, if we are going to do something that will have an impact on people's bills in the new year, we will have to make a decision in the next week or two.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Michael McGrath and Eamon Ryan, are working on that as I speak.</p>  <p>  The Deputy did not acknowledge some of the things the Government is doing to help people with the cost of living.  There are to be pay increases next year.  An increase in the minimum wages kicks in from January.  Most people in the private sector are getting decent pay increases this year coming, as they should.  There are to be increases in the pension and welfare payments from January and there has already been an increase in the fuel allowance.  There will also be reductions in income tax for middle-income earners.  It is not only low-income earners who struggle with bills.  People on middle incomes and middle-class people do too.  We are reducing income tax in the new year.  People will see that in their payslips from January.  When they see that, they will know it is something Sinn F&eacute;in opposed.</p></speech>

Does he trust the women of Ireland?  Yesterday, the Minister for Health announced the terms of a review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.</p> <p>When this historic legislation was debated and passed three years ago, it was the understanding of Members of this House that there would be a review of the operation of the Act, inclusive of policy.  The Minister is instead only planning a review to see if it is operating as intended, and not to look at the legislation underpinning it.  Did the T&aacute;naiste, as a member of the Cabinet, sign off on this approach?</p> <p> This review will not consider any policy changes to the Act.  It amounts to a predetermined process and it is at odds with previous statutory reviews.  How can the Minister for Health realistically just look at how this legislation is currently operating, without in any way considering the constraints on policy caused by the law?  How can the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste's Government be agnostic on this matter?  Was this a political decision?  The Minister said that the experiences of women would be a critical source of information for the review, but he does not intend to address the major problems they have encountered.</p> <p> This legislation has a range of well-known problems.  Only ten maternity units offer full termination services as well as very few GPs.  There are also geographical issues across the board.  Three years on, legislation for safe access zones around maternity hospitals has not been published.  The reality for women is that the three-day waiting period and 12-week limit create serious access problems.  Imagine that 375 women travelled to the UK last year in the middle of a global pandemic.  I know some of them.  There are real problems with this legislation and it should be reviewed.  We have had many statutory reviews of legislation in recent years that have looked at legal frameworks.  The T&aacute;naiste was part of those when he was a Minister and the Taoiseach.</p> <p> Why is this legislation being treated differently?  The first review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 specifically examined how it could be improved.  The same process was followed for the Gender Recognition Act 2015 in the review of 2018, which took on board specifically the views of those affected by the legislation.  It was the same with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 in July 2019.  The reviews of those three Acts included the legislation.  Here, however, the T&aacute;naiste's Government has now decided, and I am hoping to find out whether it was him, the Cabinet or the Minister alone, that this legislation will be treated differently.</p> <p> What is the point of a review of the operation of the law on terminations in Ireland if it does not take on board the concerns of those impacted by the constraints of the legislation in the first place?  Is the T&aacute;naiste categorically ruling out any changes to the law?  If so, why?  What is the point of such a review, if it is going to change anything beyond service provision?  </p> <p> Why is this review being treated differently?  Does the Government not trust the women of Ireland?  Is the reality instead that the Government is taking this course because so many of the members of Fianna F&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste's partners in government, opposed and voted against this legislation in the first place and this is the most politically expedient thing to do?</p></speech>

I led the Government that allowed people to have their say on the eighth amendment.  Indeed, on my first day as Taoiseach, I said that one thing I would do would be to allow the people of Ireland to have a vote and to make a decision on that matter.  It was not politically expedient; it was something that I thought was the right thing to do, and I am glad that I did it.  The people answered that question and did so with a clear majority.  While I respect all sides in this debate, the result of that referendum was very clear and decisive.</p>  <p>  Regarding the review, I do not recall having seen the terms of reference.  That is not to say that I did not.  As can be imagined, many things cross my desk and I will check up on what the terms of reference are and if they have been signed-off on by the Government yet.  I do not think they have, but it is possible that they have been.  I will check that out.  I agree with the basic point made by the Deputy that we should, at least at some point, examine some of the issues around the legislation.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of safe access zones, and that is certainly one.  He also mentioned the issue of the waiting period.  Many people feel it is a good idea.  I appreciate that some people do not.  We must also look at the issue, which comes up quite a lot now regarding non-fatal foetal abnormalities, which is a difficult aspect and one of the reasons people travel to the UK.  Like I said, however, I do not have the terms of reference in front of me.  Later in the day, I will see if they have been agreed and take it up from there.</p></speech>

The Minister was agnostic yesterday, and the T&aacute;naiste seems now to be struggling.  As the T&aacute;naiste in this Government, the fact he cannot remember whether such an important matter was signed-off by the Government is quite amazing.  It shows the priorities of the Government.  Yesterday, my colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, asked the Minister about policy recommendations.  If they emerged, although they probably cannot because the terms of reference are so narrow, would that constitute a reason to bring changes to the legislation?  The Minister's answer was "possibly".  What sort of Minister would say he would "possibly" bring in changes to legislation if such an important review recommended them?  It is almost impossible, however, because the terms of reference are so narrow.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste a specific question.</p></speech>

When the legislation was enacted by these Houses, and the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, brought the legislation through, it was certainly in my mind at that point that it would be a comprehensive review-----</p></speech>

The scheme was brought in by the Government to ensure that people could stay in their homes with a level of support.  Without such supports, they would be likely to end up in a residential or nursing home facility.  The budget granted a massive increase in the home care support hours available.  I am critical in that regard because there is no delivery.</p>  <p>  Without delivery, that increase is, in effect, spin and it creates false hope.  Nothing is more demoralising for people, our older age cohort and our most vulnerable people, than to receive letters giving them the good news that they have been granted a home care support package, only to go to the next line which states that it is not possible to deliver it because there is such a critical shortage of carers.</p>  <p>  In general, the people receiving these letters have paid tax all their lives and their children and working and paying tax to contribute to the Exchequer so we can provide these schemes.  Yet, a review of the critical skills requirements by the Department of Social Protection states that no critical skills permit allocation is required within the sector as recruitment difficulties and challenges faced by the sector are primarily due to contract issues and the terms and conditions being offered.  That is serious.  It is not an issue of money in that we have the finances to deliver the hours.  We must consider the money being made available to carers.  Carers, particularly in rural Ireland, are using their own vehicles to drive from house to house on an hourly rate of &euro;12.70.  It is not making sense.  If there is an issue in the HSE in regard to terms and conditions and if it transfers the provision of services to the private sector, then we must examine that aspect.</p>  <p>  To put this in context, 5,000 people are waiting on home care hours.  Some 1,000 of those people, a disproportionate number, are in County Wexford.  One fifth of the overall number of people waiting are County Wexford.  I am dealing with a lady who is in her mid-70s and who is looking after her husband, who had an accident recently and is now a paraplegic.</p> <p>He is in his mid-70s.  She gets care five days a week but gets no care at the weekends when she is on her own lifting her paraplegic husband.  I am aware of a lady who has been in a nursing home for the last 18 months.  She went there on the basis that it was a step-down facility and that she was going to receive home care support.  She cannot go home without it.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to better community-based services, shifting care to the home and offering greater choice for people.  Progress has been made on the number of home care hours delivered through increased investment in recent years.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, allocated additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support.  This year's HSE national service plan sets a target to provide 24 million home support hours, 5 million hours more than was provided last year.  It is estimated that at the end of September some 15 million hours had been provided to over 53,000 people.  This is 2.2 million more hours compared to the same period last year.  That is a real increase in the amount of service being provided to people.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to secure the additional five million hours has been maintained for 2022.</p>  <p>  Significant inroads have been made into reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional services, from more than 7,800 in January 2020 to just 400 now.  While waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional home support services have decreased substantially, there can be delays between funding approval and the provision of home support hours.  At the end of September 2021, there were just under 5,000 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available.  That is a significant increase on where we were in January of last year.  Although there has been a steady increase in the number of people waiting to receive home support over recent months, it is important to say that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from more than 9,000 at the start of 2020 to about 5,300 now.  Efforts are ongoing to enhance the provision of home support and to meet existing demand, including through the ongoing recruitment of home support workers, although this is a challenge.  In order to deal with issues around carer capacity in the HSE, it is endeavouring to prioritise services for clients with the highest care needs to ensure that service can commence for those who require it most urgently.  The HSE continues to recruit home support workers at local and national levels.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is committed to establishing a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes.  Potential issues to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development and the sustainable employment of home care workers into the future.  A call for submissions to identify the issues that need to be considered and to inform the establishment of the group was announced just last Friday.  The Department's project team will analyse submissions received to inform the setting up of the group early next year.</p></speech>

I suppose I am asking the Government, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who I appreciate is doing her best and a very good job, to ensure that we do not wait until that review is complete to make good on delivery for carers.  The T&aacute;naiste was previously Minister for Health.  All we are going to achieve, if we do not address this situation immediately, will be to drive people into residential care and nursing home settings, which would be the total opposite of what the scheme is intended for.  I am talking about the T&aacute;naiste's or my mother or father and people whose children are out working to contribute to the Exchequer and who are doing their best.  The scheme was supposed to support those most in need.  Our oldest and most vulnerable need the service.</p>  <p>  There are several issues with the service.  In Wexford, for instance, if a carer is available in Rosslare and care is required some distance in away in another district such as Enniscorthy, the policy is that they will not be asked to go there because it is not affordable.  We have the money to deliver the hours and we need to use some of that money to make it affordable and make the carers available.  We cannot continue like this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900023#V00400"><p>I take the Deputy's point.  Her arguments are very well made.  If home care is not available, what is the result?  More people end up stuck in hospital with delayed discharges.  More people end up in nursing homes long before they need to go into a nursing home.  That is not right.  People should have the autonomy to stay in their home for as long as they can.  As the Deputy acknowledged, it is not a matter of money.  The amount of money provided for home care has increased dramatically in the last couple of years.  It has probably increased by 40% or 50%, if it has not doubled in recent years.  The kind waiting lists we used to have that were a result of inadequate budgets are no longer the issue.  The issue is finding and retaining adequate staff to provide home care.  That is a real challenge.</p>  <p>  One area that my Department operates is the work permit system.  Home care workers are currently on the ineligible occupations list.  In order to have an occupation removed from this list, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to skills and labour shortages in Ireland and the European Economic Area, EEA, and not to other factors such as salary or employment conditions.  The view of my Department is that removing home care workers from the ineligible occupations list would not solve the problem.  What we need is a more comprehensive, longer term approach, dealing with the wider issues the Deputy mentioned such as pay, career progression and costing.  I appreciate this needs to be done sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

The Government has taxed every person in Ireland &euro;10.88 on every &euro;100.  These groups told me they are going to protest.  The farmers' group is coming on Sunday and the truckers and hauliers are coming on Monday.  They are not protesting for themselves only.  They will be joined by SMEs and everybody in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have always said that it was the rest of the country against Dublin but I have to stand corrected.  I have been contacted by so many people from rural Dublin.  The Government has failed them and let them down.  People in north Dublin contacted me over the failure of the Government to tackle the increase in the fuel tax which every Minister, Minister of State and backbencher in Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party are backing.  The T&aacute;naiste asked today how he could make a difference to every household in Ireland.  The Government is taking 19 cent in tax from the increase on fuel since 2020.  It took 81 cent in tax in 2020.  It is now taking &euro;1.05 from petrol.</p>  <p>  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday.  He told me he was going to speak with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and he told me he was talking to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  I spoke to the Taoiseach.  The only person from the Government who did not reply to me was the T&aacute;naiste.</p>  <p>  The Government has control of this.  I was told last night by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that they cannot change the VAT but they have control over the customs and excise, they have control over the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, and they have control over the other 19%.  They said they do not have control over the 23%.</p>  <p>  Every person in Ireland is suffering because of the Government's failure.  What did it do when the EU told it to reduce taxes?  It increased taxes.  People were able to go into shops, get &euro;100 worth of groceries and come home with two big bags of shopping.  Now they have one bag of shopping for the same &euro;100 because of the fuel increases the Government has in its control but that it could bring down tonight.</p></speech>

I acknowledge on behalf of the Government that we understand the enormous impact the rising cost of fuel and energy is having on people, whether it is people in business, particularly in the transport sector, those in agriculture, householders or individual citizens.  I outlined in my response to Deputy Doherty the kind of things we are doing at the moment to help families with the cost of living.</p> <p>Many of these, particularly tax reductions, welfare increases and pension increases, will kick in in January.  I also outlined that we are considering helping with the cost of electricity, in particular.</p> <p> I believe I did acknowledge the Deputy's email yesterday but, if I have not, I certainly will today.  I think I heard the Deputy state the EU told us to reduce taxes.  That is not true; that is something he made up.  The EU has produced a toolbox of things governments can do, if they choose to, from their own resources to reduce the cost of energy.  When using one's own resources to reduce the cost of energy, it has a consequence in that there are fewer resources for something else.  That has to be borne in mind.</p> <p> With regard to the carbon tax, I wish to state once again for the record that it is a particular type of tax.  It does not go into the coffers and is not used for general government spending.  It is ring-fenced to increase the fuel allowance for the most vulnerable in society, who need extra help to pay the bills.  Had the carbon tax not gone up, it might not have been possible to increase the fuel allowance.  That needs to be borne in mind by anybody involved in this debate.  The revenue is also used for the likes of retrofitting homes, especially in rural areas, particularly the midlands, to turn homes that are very cold and expensive to heat into much warmer homes.  The money is also ring-fenced for other aspects of climate action, such as the re-wetting of bogs and making sure Bord na M&oacute;na staff in rural Ireland, particularly the midlands, will continue to have a job.  It is also used to invest in initiatives such as LED lighting to reduce energy bills for local authorities, thus improving their bottom line.  Therefore, the carbon tax is a very particular one, and one that is ring-fenced for many good things that everybody believes should be funded.</p></speech>

I did not say the Government did not need the tax.  The Government had 81 cent in 2020; it now has a euro.  This relates to an increase in the price of fuel over which it has control.  The T&aacute;naiste talks about giving money to people who are vulnerable but it does not even make a difference to them because the prices have gone through the roof.  They have gone out of control.</p>  <p>  Food costs have gone up in this country because of inflation.  The Government has been driving inflation.  Reducing the additional tax imposed since 2022 would drive down inflation for everyone.  It is not rocket science.  You do not need to have a third level education to work this out.  I did not have one and I am able to work it out.  The Government should reduce the cost of fuel.  The cost affects every industry, including the clothing and food industries, and farming.  Reducing the tax will automatically drive down inflation and the cost of living.  That is common sense, which the Government seems to lack.</p></speech>

There have been very significant increases in the costs of fuel and energy in the past year.  By and large, these have not been driven by increases in taxation.  The latter are part of the reason but only a small part.  The increases are largely being driven by the very big increases in gas and oil prices internationally, which are not under our control.</p><p>When it comes to the carbon tax, for example-----</p></speech>

It is bizarre that I am even saying that because the proposal is so disgraceful.  It is such a shameful measure.  It threatens livelihoods, particularly those in the tourism sector in my region, the north west.  It places massive stress on individuals from other EU countries who reside in this State.  It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area.  Ireland once again faces the prospect of collateral damage caused by a Tory Government in Westminster that does not give a damn about it.  That the Tory Government could even countenance a measure like this shows how divorced it is from the reality of life on the Border.  What action is the Irish Government going to take to make it absolutely clear to the British Government that this is not on?</p></speech>

We are certainly going to communicate to our UK counterparts our concerns and objections regarding this measure.  Unfortunately, it does not come as a huge surprise.  The Deputy may recall that part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling UK borders and reducing and stopping immigration from the EU.  This is part of the outworking of that.  It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit did not realise that, but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the UK is going to harden its borders and reduce immigration, including from the EU.  Ending free movement was a big part of the argument the UK made, but we will absolutely be making our views known.</p></speech>

There is a cohort of privates and corporals recruited since 1994 who can continue in service only until the end of next year, December 2022.  It is estimated that 700 experienced non-commissioned officers in the post-1994 cohort will be leaving.  We cannot support this.  The knowledge and expertise are going.  If the personnel meet the medical and fitness criteria that would allow them to continue to serve, why can the Government not address this?  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify for this House that this will be addressed?  It is obvious that this should not be allowed to happen.  We need to have a decision on this very soon.  It is completely unfair and unreasonable to treat the affected personnel like this.

I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the advisory committee led by Ms Catherine Day, and all the NGOs that have worked tirelessly to ensure this happened.  It will be life-changing for so many people, particularly those who live in the economic shadows of our society and in circumstances of poverty.  It is in light of this and the economic vulnerability of those concerned that I ask the Government to go one step further by waiving the fee of &euro;550 for an individual and &euro;700 for a family.  It may not seem like a lot of money to us, but it is a huge amount to those who live in the circumstances in question.  Since there is a window of only six months in which to avail of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it would be a travesty if a financial barrier were to prevent somebody from doing so.  Therefore, I ask the Government to waive the fee.</p></speech>

As she says, this is an important scheme for the undocumented and those who have been in direct provision for more than two years.  As the Deputy knows, the scheme does not apply any charge to those who are in direct provision.  Therefore, about 2,800 individuals will be able to participate in the scheme without any charge.</p>  <p>  Regarding undocumented migrants who wish to participate in the scheme, we believe the charges are fair.  The charge for an individual is &euro;550.  It is &euro;700 for a family, be it a family of two, four or five.  The fee set is just to allow the Department to cover the administration costs and it is not intended to bring in any revenue.  It has been set at a level that allows us to cover our costs.  The scheme will be accessible to applicants whom we know are working in the black economy.  The scheme is to regularise their circumstances so they can participate in the normal economy.</p></speech>

He caught Covid at the end of last year.  He went to Tallaght hospital and ended up in intensive care.  He was in a coma for three months.  It is a really terrifying story.  Pete's family were told to prepare for the worst but he managed to recover, defying the odds.  Like tens of thousands of others in this country, he is now suffering from long Covid.  He described to me his brain fog, post-traumatic stress disorder and difficulty breathing.  He still needs regular support, which he describes as essential and which he gets from the long Covid clinic run by Professor Donnelly in Tallaght hospital.  However, Pete and Professor Donnelly have been told the clinic's funding will run out at the end of February.  The clinic has been told to prepare for the worst.  Pete is fighting back and campaigning to save Tallaght's long Covid clinic.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to intervene to ensure the clinic will get the long-term funding it needs as part of expanding a nationwide network of long Covid clinics to have the capacity and expertise to deal with what is going to be a growing challenge.</p></speech>

I am glad he has survived Covid but, obviously, very sorry to hear he is still experiencing the long-term effects of it.  We are still learning about this new virus and this new post-viral syndrome and we have a lot still to learn about diagnosing and treating it.  I do not have the details of the clinic in Tallaght hospital the Deputy mentions.  There will be a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on health this afternoon, so I will make sure the matter is mentioned then and brought to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

For decades now, the very hint of high winds and rain strikes terror into the people of Bantry and now Castletownbere as what happened on Tuesday has been happening for years, with businesses and residences ending up flooded.  The mop-up operation on Tuesday in Bantry has once again angered business people as they are worn out and sick to the teeth from listening to promises of progress on flood relief works.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us today an exact date for the flood relief works to start in Bantry?  Will he and the Government agree a proper compensation package for the people of Bantry, which is continually destroyed by floods?</p></speech>

I was in Bantry the summer before last, just after the floods, and saw some of the businesses that had been damaged at that time.  My Department has a scheme that can help businesses that are not insurable or that cannot get insurance with the cost of rebuilding.  I am not sure if that is the case for any of the businesses in Bantry at the moment, but that scheme is available if they need that help.</p></speech>

I went to Citywest on the Monday before last.  I had not received an appointment from the HSE; I was a walk-in.  I got there at 8 o'clock in the morning.  I spent two hours standing outside in the marquee with all the other over-60s in the freezing cold and then spent an hour queuing in the centre.  I got my dose at 11 a.m.  At UCD this morning, people visiting the centre as walk-ins, having travelled by bus or whatever, found that the cut-off point came at 9 a.m. because there were too many people queuing for the walk-in service.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look at getting these vaccine centres into the communities so people in my cohort - many of us are healthy but many of us are not - to get their vaccines in their local area.</p></speech>

In the round, the third dose programme is going very well.  More than 1 million people in Ireland have received their third dose.  I think we are very close to the top of the league table in the European Union for third doses.  We are in about fourth place out of 27 countries, but I know that if you are left standing in the cold waiting for a vaccine you do not get, that is pretty cold comfort.  There have been IT problems and teething problems and we will get them right, just like we got them right during the first period of the vaccine programme.</p>  <p>  I am told that about 900 pharmacies are now involved in the programme.</p></speech>

I also welcome the &euro;5 million announced by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, for community pantos.  I spoke to her about Striking Productions in Carlow, a community panto which has lost a lot of funding.</p>  <p>  Christmas is about families.  Why is the assisted human reproduction Bill being delayed?  We need to recognise families engaged in international surrogacy.  Our society now knows there are many ways to become a family, and we must recognise that the law must catch up in that regard.  All families are equal.  When can we expect the Bill to come before the House?  Many families in my area have contacted me about it.  It is urgent.  I ask that the Bill be brought through the House as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I think that when I was Minister for Health, in 2014 or 2015, we published the broad outline as to what the Bill would look like, and that is five or six years ago.  I know that a lot of work has been done in the Department of Health since then with the assistance of the Department of Justice.  We are very keen that this should be the Government that legislates for this area, where there are too many lacunae at the moment.  My understanding is that a special committee is due to be established by the Oireachtas.  That committee will try to gain consensus and tease out some of the very difficult issues, including complicated ethical issues, that arise from assisted human reproduction.  I hope we will be able to get that committee set up in the new year and then legislate on foot of that.</p></speech>

This makes absolute sense in addressing the risk of the spread of Covid-19 among third level students.  Why have 12% of students in higher education institutions been excluded, namely, students in private higher education institutions such as St. Nicholas Montessori College in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Griffith College, Hibernian College and Dublin Business School?  It makes absolute sense that we roll this testing out across the sector to protect society as a whole.  Many of these institutions were involved in the pilot programme as well as students from the institutions, particularly in St. Nicholas, where students were involved in supplementing the sector when they were needed most.  Will the Government look at this roll-out to ensure that all students of higher education are treated equally?</p></speech>

We have been too slow to adopt antigen testing in Ireland but, in fairness to the third level sector, it was one of the sectors that led on this.  The Minister made sure that happened, and &euro;9 million has been provided for free antigen tests in the public third level institutions.  I do not see why that could not be extended to the private ones, so I will certainly take that up with the Minister and see if we can get that done.</p></speech>

I have a letter here from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 7 July, stating that Clare would be included in the scheme once the same rigorous analysis that was done in Mayo and Donegal to quantify the extent of the problem in those counties had been done in Clare.  That testing has been done.  A D&aacute;il motion was passed unanimously on 15 June calling for a 100% redress scheme and no less, with no hidden details, fine print, sliding scales, etc.  It has been six months.  Why is the Government denying people in Clare justice and equality?  The families feel like they are being gaslighted and that the delay is inevitable.  It is causing their homes to crumble around them.  What will the Government do for people in Clare?</p></speech>

Therefore, if there are homes in Clare, Limerick and other counties that are affected by mica, they would be included.  It will not be just for Mayo and Donegal.  Again, this is really a matter for the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, so I will let him know that the Deputy raised it and she might want to come back with more detail.</p></speech>

The Government has rightly introduced a scheme which shows solidarity with those people.  However, given the scale of this, the cost of which is already &euro;2 billion and rising, does the T&aacute;naiste believe that financial institutions should be contributing towards the cost of such a scheme, given that it is their portfolio of loans which is now being shored up by taxpayers and that their financial position is greatly strengthened in that respect?</p> <p>Should they be making an inexorable contribution toward the cost that is falling on the taxpayer?</p></speech>

The levy was brought in for that purpose.  Some of the institutions would argue that they are now paying for it through that levy.  I am not sure I agree with that argument, but that is the argument they would make.  However, it is very much the view of the Government and the Minister of Finance that the cost of this should not fall entirely on the taxpayer.  The Minister is working on a proposal to introduce a levy on the construction sector.  That will not cover the entire cost of it, but it will cover some of it.  He will have that ready for the budget next October with a view to introducing it from 2023.</p></speech>

Is there recognition of the devastating effect that could have on an industry that has stood its ground, put its shoulder to the wheel and defended what had to be defended, when called upon, in this country?  Further, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to confirm that it is not Government policy, and that it is recognised that not only would rural Ireland be punished severely if the pursuit of such a policy was followed, but that urban Ireland and the continuity of food supplies to the capital city and every town in the country would equally be threatened.</p></speech>

The Government is encouraging banks to lend money to young farmers.  In fact, my Department runs schemes that help to guarantee those loans.  It is Government policy that banks should lend to young farmers.  We want to encourage young people into agriculture and food production.  We want them to invest in expanding and modernising their farms.  Indeed, younger farmers, in particular, who understand the need to take climate action, know that that costs money and requires up-front investment.  How are they going to do that without loans from the banks?</p></speech>

Mass examination halls at normal capacity are being used to host the end-of-semester exams.  Many students and staff have legitimate health and safety concerns for themselves and vulnerable family members.  Others are Covid-positive or are close contacts and have their movements restricted or have to self-isolate.  Deferring exams and assessment is a deplorable option.  Aside from the anxiety and stress caused by deferring exams, the financial implications in terms of additional costs and loss of income are grossly unfair.  We have been calling for alternative arrangements to be put in place since early November.  Can the T&aacute;naiste give me a clear reason most assessments and exams cannot be done online to enable students to comply with public health guidance and ensure they can have a family Christmas too?</p></speech>

It is encouraging that the incidence of the virus among the 18 to 24 age group is now falling, albeit slightly.  The 50% indoor capacity restriction does not apply to exam halls.  One thing we have done is to introduce free antigen testing in third level colleges.  That can be very beneficial for students who can take an antigen test before they engage in social activities and also before taking exams.</p></speech>

Indeed, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform warned that the consortium could recoup all of its money by 2028 and then sell up shop.  Nevertheless, the taxpayer agreed to fork out &euro;2.7 billion for a network that we will never own.  The broadband plan is now way behind schedule.  Its target for homes connected by next January has been cut in half.  Today, we have learned that David McCourt and other investors were paid out &euro;50 million in 2020 before a single home was even connected, with the taxpayer paying them &euro;43 million.

He was referred to a consultant in County Cavan, but he needs to see a paediatric urologist in Temple Street Children's Hospital.  His parents have just been told that he may get a consultation when he is five years old.  That is three and a half years from now.  The parents are naturally worried because if untreated, their son may encounter fertility issues later in life or a higher risk of cancer.  The family feel they are being pushed towards seeking a private consultation when financially, they cannot afford to, but for the sake of the future health of their son, they feel they cannot afford to fail to take the private route.  Why are children facing waiting lists?  Are regular reviews carried out in our hospitals to identify where there are consultant shortages?  The waiting time for this child is three and a half years.  How many children are being affected by these waiting lists?</p></speech>

If, with the permission of the family, the Deputy wants to pass on the details of the case to my office, I will follow up on it and see if there is anything that we can do.  It may be that there is a shortage of consultant paediatric urologists.  It is a lesser known fact in Ireland, but there are 40% more consultants in Ireland and 40% more doctors in our public health service than there were ten years ago.  However, notwithstanding that, in some specialties we are finding real difficulty in recruiting people to the public service.  That is resulting in some big problems.  If the Deputy wants to pass on the details of the case, with the permission of the family, we will check up on it.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, have been extremely helpful.  However, the sector is on its knees and all the sectors providing associated employment are also in difficulty, including the entertainment industry, individuals and groups.  The Irish Hotels Federation has contacted us all again.</p> <p>Locally, the Seven Oaks Hotel in Carlow, on behalf of its members, and the Newpark Hotel in Kilkenny highlighted the other costs they are lumbered with.  These are costs such as recruiting people from abroad and then having to put the recruitment on hold because they are closed down again.  Then there is the loss of income, for example, &euro;140,000 in December for one hotel alone.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please look at the supports that can be given beyond the existing schemes in order that they can reopen again?</p></speech>

We are going to have to do that, and we will do it.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and I co-chair the hospitality forum.  We are going to have to have more discussions about this in the new year.  What we have done to help the sector through this difficult period and the new restrictions is that the commercial rates holiday will be extended until the end of the first quarter of next year, if not for longer.  The employment wage subsidy scheme will be restored to the higher level of payment.  The Covid restrictions support scheme is being extended to cover businesses that are fully closed such as nightclubs.  The Deputy has put his finger on a real issue.  The hospitality sector is severely restricted and facing into a very difficult period but has to bring in staff from overseas.  There are businesses that cannot get staff.  This shows how complex the problems we face now are.  We are subsidising such employment, but the same businesses have to go abroad to get staff.  It requires more comprehensive examination.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, a folio of land at Cairns Hill in Sligo was put on the market.  I raised the issue locally and was told that the OPW was going to bid for the site and asked not to go public on the matter.  Had the latter not happened, I would have raised the issue in the D&aacute;il.  I trusted the OPW to buy this site and thereby ensure public access to the cairns.  A local group would have tried to raise funds to purchase the site but it also stood back because it was asked not to raise the price of the site.  Now it is too late.  The site has been sold and we have been told that the vendor chose not to accept the OPW's bid.  Why did the OPW not submit another bid?  The selling price was reasonable.  This is a very important site.  Had the OPW bid succeeded, it would have guaranteed public access to the site and ensured an excellent addition to the portfolio of monuments in County Sligo.  Those are the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, not mine.  This is a lost opportunity.  What can we do about it now?</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of spending some of my summer holidays last year in Sligo.  I climbed Knocknarea and saw Queen Maeve's grave.  I am familiar with the wider passage tomb complex in County Sligo.  I strongly support the bid to include it as a world heritage site.  I am not familiar with the particular site the Deputy mentioned, to be frank.  I cannot really answer the question she posed on behalf of the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Donovan and Noonan.  I will let them know the Deputy raised the matter here today.

I apologise for the slight delay in starting.</p>  <p>  I thank the House for this opportunity to update it on the outcome of the seafood task force process that I instigated in March this year in response to the unacceptable outcome for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  It is appropriate that I begin by recalling the details of the TCA as they pertain to our seafood sector.  It was clear during the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement negotiations that fishing quotas were going to be a particularly difficult issue and it was one of the principal reasons for the protracted negotiations on the TCA.  A no-deal Brexit scenario would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and also possibly displaced into Ireland's fishing zone.  That was the doomsday scenario.  The Irish fishing fleet catches about one third of its catch in the UK waters and if access to UK waters was denied in a no-deal scenario, it risked losing access to that catch and in addition other EU vessels operating in UK waters would be displaced into our waters.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach and I met the fishing industry this time last year it identified a no-deal Brexit as the worst possible outcome for the Irish fishing industry.  The agreement reached was less severe than that, and less severe than it would have been had the Barnier task force agreed to the UK negotiating demands.  Nevertheless, the trade and co-operation agreement was still a very painful outcome for Ireland.  The agreement reached provided that, as the price for continued access by EU vessels to UK waters, there would be a transfer of quotas across a range of fish stocks from EU member states to the UK.</p>  <p>  In January of this year, I published an analysis of the quota transfers for Ireland across the different stocks and the implications.  The quota transfers are to be spread out until 2026.  The aggregate final quota transfer by Ireland to the UK is valued at a &euro;43 million loss to Ireland&rsquo;s fishing sector by 2026, amounting to a 15% reduction compared to the overall value of Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 quotas.  The upfront loss for 2021 is very sizeable at around 60% of the total, or a loss of &euro;26 million at the quayside. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s analysis also showed that because of the stocks concerned, Ireland is contributing a disproportionate share of its quotas, compared to almost all other member states and this is clearly inequitable burden sharing.  Throughout 2021, I have consistently made it very clear to the Commission and other member states that Ireland considers that the transfer to the UK involves a very high share of some of our most important stocks.  I pointed out that within the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, Ireland contributes by providing rich fishing grounds for EU member states and our exclusive economic zone provides spawning and nursery grounds on many of the core stocks which are shared with the UK and on which the trade and co-operation agreement quota package and the Common Fisheries Policy depend.  I also strongly expressed my disappointment that the principle of burden sharing within the EU member states has not been adequately respected.  I made clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland has contributed to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly.  I have raised the matter of inequitable burden sharing at EU level and in bilateral exchanges with the Commissioner and other EU member states at each and every suitable opportunity that has arisen and I will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  During his visit to Ireland at the end of September, Commissioner Sinkevičius met with industry representatives in Killybegs and heard directly from them that Ireland has paid too high a share of quota under the trade and cooperation agreement.  I followed up with a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner on all the issues arising.  The Taoiseach and I met the Commissioner to further emphasise, from a Government perspective, that addressing burden sharing is a priority for Ireland and the Taoiseach has pursued the matter with the Commission President.</p>  <p>  I have made clear that this important element of the Common Fisheries Policy must be included by the Commission as part of the full CFP review and form part of the formal review and the Commission report to the European Council and European Parliament on the functioning of the CFP.  Last week, the Taoiseach, having previously met the President of the European Commission on the burden sharing issue, again wrote to Ursula von der Leyen on the issue of the inequitable burden on Ireland in terms of quota transfer under the TCA and to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s call to find practical ways within the EU to address this issue.</p>  <p>  I, as Minister, have continually pushed strongly that a solution must be found, and I intend to continue to keep the focus on this situation and to use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.  Together with these initiatives on addressing burden sharing, I was determined that our fisheries sector and the coastal communities that depend on fishing should be appropriately assisted with the impacts of the trade and cooperation agreement.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, I established a seafood task force whose terms of reference were to examine the impacts of the TCA on our fisheries sector and coastal communities and to identify initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring, so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet, and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing.  I asked the task force to consider and recommend constructive actions that would help to alleviate the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland in the agreement.  I asked the task force to consider how all available funding streams could be used to address, to the extent possible, the initiatives identified and the State agencies to support those initiatives.</p>  <p>  An important context for the work of the task force was an EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve, BAR, fund that was being negotiated at EU level at the time I established the task force.    The BAR regulation was enacted on 6 October 2021, with Ireland allocated by far the largest share of funds at almost &euro;1.2 billion in current prices, recognising that Ireland is the member state most impacted by the departure of the UK and by the Brexit co-operation agreement outcome.  Fisheries and coastal communities were an important element of the negotiations on the member state BAR allocations, with fishing in UK waters and maritime border regions with the UK accounting for &euro;184 million of Ireland&rsquo;s BAR allocation.  The purpose of the BAR is to provide EU supports to counter the adverse economic, social, territorial and, where appropriate, environmental consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in those member states most adversely affected by the withdrawal, and to mitigate the related negative impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion.</p>  <p>  The BAR, understandably, has a particular focus on regions, local communities and sectors most affected by Brexit.  Importantly, the BAR is 100% EU funded and the Commission will be providing pre-financing this year and in 2022 and 2023, making the BAR an invaluable tool for Ireland and other member states to use to counter the impacts of Brexit and the trade and cooperation agreement.  The BAR will see Ireland implement Brexit mitigation measures this year and in 2023 across the economic sectors most impacted by Brexit.  The eligibility period for the BAR ends in 2023.  Formal BAR funding applications to the Commission will follow by 2024, which will make the pre-financing already provided definitive.  </p>  <p>  Another important context for the work of the task force was the new European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF, which again was being negotiated at EU level when I established the task force.  The EMFAF regulation has since been enacted on 7 July of this year and Ireland is allocated &euro;142 million in EU funds under the EMFAF, with the Government to provide co-funding for this level of EU investment.</p> <p>Unlike the BAR, the EMFAF is solely focused on member states' seafood sectors and coastal communities.  My Department is preparing a new seafood development programme under the EMFAF and I expect it to be adopted next year.</p> <p> In establishing the task force, I strongly believed that a once-in-a-generation event such as the trade and co-operation agreement required a collective response involving the seafood businesses and coastal communities most affected by the TCA and with the intimate knowledge of the sector to know what initiatives are best able to address the impacts of the agreement.  The task force comprised ten representatives of the fishing sector, including the four main fishing co-operatives in Castletowbere, Greencastle, Ros a' Mh&iacute;l and Clogherhead, the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum.  It also included representatives from the aquaculture sector, coastal communities and a range of State bodies with an important role to play in addressing the impacts of the TCA, including Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and coastal local authorities.  The task force was led by Aidan Cotter, the former CEO of Bord Bia, who was assisted by a steering group of Margaret Daly, deputy CEO of seafood processor Errigal Bay Limited, and M&iacute;cheal &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide, former director of the Marine Institute and member of the aquaculture licensing appeals board.</p> <p> The task force undertook its work with great enthusiasm and professionalism.  It met on 14 occasions in a seven-month period and I know there was much work undertaken outside of those meetings as well.  To assist its work, the task force undertook a public consultation and received 27 submissions. Task force members also made multiple submissions to inform its deliberations.  These submissions, much expert analysis by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the expertise of the task force members helped to inform a full and detailed examination of the TCA impacts by the task force and a healthy debate within the task force on its recommendations.</p> <p> I received the final report of the seafood task force, entitled Navigating Change, on 11 October.  The report recommended 16 support schemes at a total estimated cost of &euro;423 million.  The task force acknowledged in its report that its recommendations would give rise to substantial public expenditure which will need careful consideration in order to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained when public money is being spent or invested, as required under the Government&rsquo;s public expenditure code.  The task force report also acknowledged that the assessment of the range of measures recommended, the development of detailed schemes, and submission for state aid approval can only be approached on a phased basis, and accordingly will be progressed on a prioritised basis.  The task force requested that a full assessment of the proposed support schemes by the relevant Departments and State agencies, in the context of the necessary Government criteria for public expenditure, be carried out with a view to implementing the schemes, subject to any necessary modifications.</p> <p> It proposed in its report that in the period from 2021 to 2023, the measures necessary to implement the task force recommendations should, to the greatest extent possible, be funded from Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under the Brexit adjustment reserve.  Of the task force recommended support schemes, in the region of &euro;300 million could potentially be eligible for funding under the BAR, subject to other funding priorities for the BAR and to Government assessment of the recommended schemes and their being accepted.  The balance of the recommended schemes would fall to be funded over a longer period under my Department&rsquo;s seafood development programme, should they be accepted by the Government.</p> <p> I will now outline some of the recommended support schemes.  Without doubt, the most significant scheme recommended by the task force is the implementation of a permanent voluntary decommissioning scheme for the whitefish fleet at a cost of &euro;66 million, recommended to be funded under the BAR.  The TCA quota cuts have had wide-ranging impacts on our seafood sector and coastal communities depending on the seafood sector, but most of all they call into question the economic viability of the whitefish fleet as it stands.  With lower quotas available post Brexit which will continue to decline on a phased basis up to 2026, our entire whitefish fleet will suffer diminishing economic returns.  This is not sustainable economically and risks being a catalyst for breaches of fishing regulations.</p> <p> To inform the task force on the scale of fleet restructuring required, a profitability analysis was carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This analysis quantified the number of vessels required to be removed from the fleet in order to return the various fleet segments to the level of profitability prior to the TCA.  This analysis estimated that some 60 whitefish polyvalent and beam trawl vessels of a gross tonnage of 8,000 tonnes would need to be removed so as to return these fleet segments to profitability.  This equates to 26% of the whitefish fleet by number.  Removing this amount of capacity would potentially free up approximately &euro;38 million of quota for the benefit of vessels remaining in the fleet, thereby securing their future viability.  The task force recommended a decommissioning scheme of this scale.</p> <p> It is clear that this is a severe blow to the whitefish fleet and the coastal communities dependent on fishing.  However, I note that the task force was unanimous in recommending this initiative and the task force included all of the main representatives of the fishing fleet.  The recommendation, of course, reflects the post-Brexit reality of the TCA, which is that there are fewer fish to be shared among the whitefish fleet.  The task force concluded that it is absolutely necessary to voluntarily shrink the fleet to this extent so that the remaining vessels can survive in business.</p> <p> Permanently leaving the fleet and the livelihood many families have known for generations is a major decision for any vessel owner.  The task force recommended that the scheme be voluntary and, of course, that is appropriate.  It estimated the necessary compensation for those leaving the fleet at up to &euro;12,000 per gross tonne.  This amount would cover all costs, including vessel owner compensation, crew payments and costs for scrapping of vessels.  I am mindful that crew members of fishing vessels being decommissioned must be compensated as a mandatory condition of the payment to the vessel owner and I will be ensuring that this happens.  As an important complementary measure to the decommissioning scheme, the task force recommended that scheme payments be subject to similar tax treatment as the decommissioning scheme implemented in 2008.  The task force believed this was essential to incentivise sufficient vessel owners to apply under the scheme if it is to reach its targets to take out sufficient capacity to restore incomes and fleet balance to the pre-TCA situation.</p> <p> In an important recommendation to accompany the recommended decommissioning scheme, the task force report recommended that a scheme be implemented to essentially decommission off-register fleet capacity.  Off-register or latent capacity is fishing capacity that is licensed for use but not currently in operation for reasons such as vessels being lost at sea, damaged, in need of repair or upgrade, or up for sale.  My Department&rsquo;s licensing authority for sea fishing boats maintains a register of capacity that is currently active or on-register, as well as capacity that is inactive or off-register.  Off-register capacity is very relevant to the proposed voluntary whitefish decommissioning scheme because it is a possible route back into the fleet for vessel owners whose boat has been decommissioned.  While off-register capacity is latent and does not use up quotas, should a former vessel owner purchase off-register capacity and use it to introduce a new vessel to the fleet, this would take up quota and negate the benefits of the voluntary decommissioning scheme.</p> <p> This issue of off-register capacity was identified as a serious risk to the success of a decommissioning scheme in a cost benefit analysis conducted on behalf of BIM by Grant Thornton in 2016.  Grant Thornton found there was a level of re-entry to the fleet following previous decommissioning schemes.  Of 73 vessels decommissioned, 19 new vessels were reintroduced.  The Grant Thornton report recommended that a decommissioning scheme should not be implemented unless the issue of off-register capacity is addressed in tandem.</p> <p>At the time of the task force report, there were 15,466 gross tonnes of off-register capacity, which is almost twice the level of capacity the task force recommended be decommissioned.  This is clearly a significant risk to the success of the decommissioning proposal.  The task force recommended that we implement a once-off scheme to buy out off-register capacity, at a set price to be determined.  The process of preparing the details of a decommissioning scheme is time consuming, including conducting a new cost-benefit analysis, as required under the public spending code for a scheme of this size, agreeing within Government that the proposed scheme should proceed, legislating for tax treatment of scheme payments and securing state aid clearance.</p> <p> Should the voluntary decommissioning scheme proceed, vessel owners will need some time to reflect on their own situation and the payments offered under the scheme and there will be time taken for the application and approval process.  Taken together, these matters mean it could be summer 2022 before the benefits of the scheme would be felt by other vessel owners in terms of available quota being shared across a smaller cohort of vessels.  For these reasons, the task force recommended that a second round of voluntary temporary fleet tie-up scheme supports be implemented in 2022 for the whitefish fleet.  As Deputies know, a voluntary temporary tie-up scheme is already being implemented over the October to December period, at a cost of &euro;12 million, as recommended to me by the task force in its June 2021 interim report.  That scheme is assisting the whitefish fleet with the reduced incomes in 2021 arising from the TCA quota reductions this year.  A similar, second round of tie-ups in 2022 is proposed to support the income of the fleet, pending the full benefits of a decommissioning scheme being felt across the board.  That proposal is costed by the task force at &euro;12 million in 2022 and is recommended to be funded under the BAR.</p> <p> I turn now to the wider impacts of the TCA quota cuts, which, as I said, undermine the viability of our fishing fleet.  I have outlined a proposal from the task force to take out 60 vessels from the whitefish fleet.  Should such a scheme proceed and achieve its targets, we could see perhaps 400 crew members lose their jobs.  A separate impact of the TCA quota cuts is the significant loss of raw material supply to our vibrant seafood processing sector.  Fewer fish being landed by Irish vessels means less raw material supply for our processors to be transformed into the added-value seafood products we see on our supermarket shelves, which have underpinned the strong growth in seafood exports in recent years.  Replacing that raw material is not easy but there are possibilities.  There are logistical difficulties and cost issues in seeking to import supply from the UK, particularly when other member states impacted by the TCA are seeking to do the same.</p> <p> There is, of course, an abundance of fish caught off our coasts by other member state vessels, which generally return to their home ports to land their catch.  Between 2015 and 2019, the Irish fishing fleet caught, on average, 38% of the value and 35% of the volume of all fish caught in our 200 mile zone.  Clearly, there is significant potential, particularly with rising oil costs, to attract an increasing amount of the fish caught by other fleets into Ireland to drive the development of our processing and other marine support industries.  We have seen some great successes in recent years, particularly in Castletownbere and Killybegs, in attracting these foreign vessels to land their catch in Ireland.  By further developing our processing and support industries, we can create a more attractive market proposition to encourage more EU, UK and Norwegian vessels to sell their catch to Irish processors.  The loss of raw material supply to our processors, if not addressed through positive interventions, as recommended by the task force, risks these processors losing hard-won markets and reducing their profitability, and may lead to loss of employment in coastal communities already impacted by the jobs lost from decommissioned vessels.</p> <p> A further knock-on effect of the necessary voluntary decommissioning of up to 60 fishing vessels is the impact on ancillary and support service industries in coastal communities.  Fewer vessels means less boat maintenance work, net-making and provisioning.  This outcome risks further loss of employment in coastal communities.  The widely representative task force I put together carefully considered all these interrelated impacts and recommended an integrated response via investment in marine infrastructure, seafood processing and aquaculture, supported by community-led local development.</p> <p> In regard to the seafood processing sector, which comprises approximately 160 firms, the task force recommended facilitating substantial investment in seafood processing enterprises to support greater utilisation of raw material, improved efficiency, development of new offerings and demonstration of quality and sustainability, as well as building capability and innovation through people and processes.  This investment will protect and enhance their viability and position them to attract additional raw material.  While my Department's European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF, programme has been providing similar supports over the past seven years, the scheme recommended by the task force would provide temporarily increased graduated grant aid rates of between 30% and 50% during the period of BAR funding for 2022 to 2023, with the higher rates targeted at secondary and tertiary processing to provide an immediate stimulus to overcome some of the constraints arising from Brexit.</p> <p> The task force recommended that supports of &euro;90 million be provided, predominantly in 2022 and 2023, through the BAR and subsequently through the EMFAF, over the period up to 2027.  The task force was of the view that this level of funding, when combined with industry funding, would give the sector a unique opportunity to implement the transformational change required in response to the TCA.  Transformational investment on this scale would foster increased employment in the processing sector, mitigating the loss of employment arising from the TCA quota cuts, and could position our processing sector as an increasingly attractive market for foreign vessels operating off our coasts.</p> <p> While there are direct impacts of Brexit and the TCA on the aquaculture sector, similar to many other areas of our economy, the recommendations of the task force for investment in the sector are primarily based on its capacity as an alternative native source of raw material supply to our processors and an alternative source of employment in coastal communities.  The sector shares many elements of the skill set possessed by fishing crew and presents an ideal career opportunity for crew of former fishing vessels, benefitting both the aquaculture sector and former fishermen.  Ideally, it will keep former fishermen in their coastal communities.  The task force recommended that both the BAR and EMFAF funding sources should be utilised, as appropriate, to develop Irish aquaculture to mitigate against the negative impacts of Brexit that have been most pronounced in other sectors of the Irish seafood sector.  It recommended that graduated grant aid rates should apply in order that the categories of activity that are most impactful would be incentivised, with total aid of &euro;60 million being made available for investment over the period up to 2027.  This would stimulate the modernisation of aquaculture sites in line with international best practice, increase resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact, advance understanding of market opportunities and innovation capability, and develop technical, marketing and management capability.</p> <p> The task force report noted that public marine infrastructure, including piers, slipways, pontoons, etc., is a critical enabler to maximising the use of, and benefits to be gained from, our rich maritime resources.  High-quality publicly owned marine infrastructure facilitates the development of myriad uses and enables commercial fishing, aquaculture, sea angling and other marine leisure and recreational activities to develop and flourish.  The development of this range of water-based activities drives related onshore activities and helps to diversify and build resilience in our coastal communities.  The task force recognised that modern public marine infrastructure is a central and essential element in creating an integrated response to the impact of the TCA on coastal communities.  Accessible and safe public marine infrastructure would enable community-led local development through our fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, to support the development of a wide range of marine activities and help to diversify and build resilience. </p> <p> The task force proposed that the earlier years of a support scheme should focus on small-scale, shovel-ready local authority projects, which would be funded under the BAR and would give immediate construction stimulus to the coastal communities impacted by the TCA.  The resulting infrastructure development would provide a more long-term platform for the development of new and diversified economic activity in coastal communities.  The provision of this enhanced, publicly owned marine infrastructure would be a key enabler in allowing integrated application at a local level of the task force's other recommended initiatives for the seafood sector, namely, locally led development and marine tourism initiatives.  The task force is recommending an &euro;80 million, five-year initiative for the development of publicly owned marine infrastructure.</p> <p> Community-led local development, CLLD, empowers communities to support initiatives to create employment and economic activity to sustain livelihoods in an area-based approach and, accordingly, has a key role to play in addressing the impact of the TCA on Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities.  For the past nine years, my Department has been implementing to great success a CLLD approach through the seven fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, through my Department&rsquo;s European maritime and fisheries fund programme.  Providing seed funding for new businesses, funding to diversify or expand and enabling capacity development that will allow people to use their skills for new opportunities in the marine sector is paramount to keeping these communities viable in the long term.  The task force recommends that significant funding be made available through the FLAGs to support coastal communities impacted by Brexit to diversify their economies into the wider marine sector, where local skill sets are particularly suited.</p></speech>

The report of the seafood task force is presented as the future of the Irish fishing industry and a blueprint for creating vibrant coastal communities.  While there are some good measures in it and, of course, welcome funding, we must face the hard reality.  The report, if implemented, will further reduce the Irish fishing fleet and, by consequence, the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  Ireland has approximately 20% of Europe's northern and western fishing waters.  A total of 30% of all fish landed in Europe is produced in Irish waters, yet we have some of the smallest fishing quotas for species in all of Europe.  Since we joined the European Economic Community, EEC, in 1973, Governments have made mistake after mistake in building a vibrant and sustainable Irish fishing industry.  It is arguable whether we want to build or have an industry at all at this point.  It seems that, when this or previous Governments have had to negotiate to fight for our fishermen, the default position has been to raise the white flag.  The Irish fishing industry has always been the sacrificial lamb.</p>  <p>  Ireland has taken part in two EU-funded decommissioning schemes that dramatically reduced the Irish fleet, and now there is another decommissioning proposal to get rid of a further 60 boats.  In 2006, there were 280 boats of more than 18 m in the Irish fleet fishing offshore.  After this latest scheme, that fleet will be reduced to one third of what it was 15 years ago.  What a damning indictment of Government policy and failure over the past 15 years.  While we tear apart our fishing communities, countries such as France and Belgium are investing in the upgrading of their fleets.  This is no surprise when we consider the percentage of the fish they take from our Irish waters compared with what is allocated to our own fishing fleet under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  I reiterate only 15%, or even less, of the total value of the catch from Irish waters, the exclusive economic zone under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, is allocated to the Irish fishing fleet.  This is utterly shameful.  In contrast, 75% of the fish in British waters is allocated to their fishing fleet.</p>  <p>  We have long called for a full review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Is there an appetite among the Government or the Civil Service to go to Europe and fight for such a review?  A partial review is to commence in January but we need a full review, with everything on the table.  We need to find and build solidarity and alliances with other European partners and truly reopen the Common Fisheries Policy, once and for all.  The unfairness must end and what better opportunity than now when Brexit has changed so much?  It is the profound unfairness and injustice, above everything else, that sticks in the craw of the Irish fishing community.</p>  <p>  For decades, Irish fishermen have watched European fishing vessels come into Irish waters and fish away at huge quotas compared with those for Irish boats, then watched them unload their uninspected catch into frozen container trucks and go home to their own countries.  Meanwhile, Irish vessels are chased from pillar to post by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service with much lower quotas, and have recently been forced to unload their iced catch on the harbours, de-ice it for inspection and only then send it to the factory for processing.  It would be laughable were it not so serious.</p>  <p>  Let us take just one example to prove this.  This goes to the heart of so-called relative stability, which has been, and continues to be, a complete and utter disaster for Irish fishing.  During the formative years of 1977 to 1982, the Irish system did not record its catches in any accurate manner.  Let us take the example of monkfish.  The French currently have an allocation of 50% of the monkfish in Irish waters, while Ireland has 5%.  Is that fair?  Something has to give, things have to change and the Minister and his Department must lead that.</p>  <p>  This year, when the flotilla of fishing boats sailed up to the River Lee and into Cork city, and then up the River Liffey and into Dublin city, it marked a sea change.  The fishing industry had united in protest and opposition to the disastrous policies of the Minister's Government and those who preceded it.  No more would they accept weak negotiation on their behalf, no more white flags or jelly bellies.  The year 2021 has seen pelagic and polyvalent quotas reduced by 30%, demersal quotas by 20% and the inshore fleet reduced to targeting non-quota shellfish.  Our industry is dying and, as far as it is concerned, the State is assisting in its dying.  As I said earlier, the French and Belgian states are sponsoring the building of new vessels, while we in Ireland are proposing the decommissioning of a further 30% of our offshore fleet of over 18 m, or 60 of our boats.  When you step back and think about it, this is worse than bonkers; it is self-destruction.</p>  <p>  Where do we start?  Burden-sharing must be reopened in these upcoming December talks.  The reality is there has been none.  The burden of Brexit on the European fishing fleet may as well have been undertaken unilaterally by the Irish industry.  That must be the starting position.  Negotiations are always tough, but now is the time to show steel.  Once and for all, Ireland needs the Minister with responsibility for the marine and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to stand up for Irish interests.  At the very least, he needs to go to Brussels with a minimum levelling-up approach imprinted in his thinking.  This would take account of at least some small element of the historical loss and unfairness we have suffered.  It would also set a marker for the upcoming review of the CFP at European level.</p>  <p>  Gone are the days when we were the best boys and girls in class, when we would say, "Yes sir, no sir" and take what we were given in terms of quotas.  It is time to defend our industry, be proud of our immense natural resource and outline to Europe what we want and need in order to build our proud industry.  We want our fair share of what is ours and will not stand any more for being stamped on and told to put up with everything.</p>  <p>  Representatives of various fish producer organisations attended yesterday's Oireachtas committee meeting.  They did not enthusiastically endorse the report and they certainly did not enthusiastically endorse decommissioning.  They did so with a heavy heart.  They have fishermen on their books who have no future, through no fault of their own but through that of Government after Government.  They do not believe things will change and they will avail of this scheme with a very heavy heart.</p>  <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is being negotiated between Britain and Europe.</p> <p>The Minister and the Taoiseach need to insist that we have access to those negotiations because they will have an enormous impact on our fortunes at the Council.  The Minister will have a limited engagement in the days ahead while these negotiations continue.<br/><br/>The island communities have real concerns about this report.  They have made submissions and I will forward to the Minister their submission outlining their ongoing concerns.  They are not enthusiastically endorsing this report.<br/><br/>I conclude my contribution by quoting the famous Luke Kelly poem:</p><blockquote>	For what died the sons of R&oacute;is&iacute;n, was it greed?...<br /><br />Will German, French or Dutch inscribe the epitaph of Emmet?<br /><br />When we have sold enough of Ireland to be but strangers in it<br /><br />For what died the sons of R&oacute;is&iacute;n, was it greed? </blockquote> <p>Were words ever more appropriate to what is happening in our beloved coastal and fishing communities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900032#JJ00200"><p>I am not from a fishing community.  I do not understand the complexities of the fishing sector and have never made any pretence that I do.  However, I have been listening and all of us in this House need to listen to what is becoming an endangered species, the Irish fisherman.  It is one of the travesties of an island nation that we do not have a world-class fishing fleet and world-class fishing industry that would inspire pride in all that it does.</p>  <p>  In that context I read the seafood task force report.  In completing its work, the task force described the seafood sector as being in the eye of the storm regarding the Brexit fallout.  I thought it was a very apt description because for many sectors the impact of Brexit still looms on the horizon, but for our fishing communities and those in ancillary industries Brexit has become tangible very quickly.  Through the agreement, the Irish fleet lost 15% of its annual quota.  Prawn, monkfish and haddock were particularly impacted.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn very eloquently outlined, that does not even begin to tell the story of what our fishing communities will endure as a result of Brexit.  It is not losing 15% of a fair catch; it is 15% of what has been a raw deal for our fishing communities for generations.</p>  <p>  We need to be big enough and bold enough to say that our fishing communities were sold out upon joining the European Economic Community.  They have been sold out by every Government since in their lax attitude to negotiations relating to fishing industry.  That is been evident again in the trade and co-operation agreement.  We recognise as much as, if not more than, anybody the need to secure a Brexit withdrawal agreement.  However, the difficulties with the agreement are not necessarily over what was agreed with the British, which comes down to hard tacks, but over what was actually agreed at EU level.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn has said very clearly, that exposes the fundamental failure within the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  The task force report we are debating makes recommendations to spend &euro;423 million.  While we could debate at length the merits of each individual recommendation, it is unfair that every time we consider a review of this, the default proposal is always to decommission, get rid of boats and pay people off.  A number of other identifiable options might be of assistance to our fishing community and we need to give thought to that.</p>  <p>  Whenever I have met representatives of fishing organisations or seen them appear before the Oireachtas committee, they stress they do not want to be paid to give up their livelihood, something that is probably true of us all.  They do not want to be paid off essentially.  They want to be able to do what their families have been doing for generations.  While some will accept a decommissioning deal if it is on offer, it is not because they want to abandon their sector but because they feel their Government has abandoned them.  There is a fundamental problem in our approach to this issue.  Historically, Irish Governments have accepted that fisheries was a battle they could not win.  Too much of this has been left in the hands of a small number of officials.  We have not had a political grasp on our fisheries sector for quite some time.</p>  <p>  Last year, I asked the Minister if he agreed with me that this issue was so profound that we needed a Minister of State with responsibility for the marine.  He argued that it is so important that it should be on the senior Minister's desk.  With due respect to him, we have seen nothing that indicates he has given this the level of priority that it needs within government.  As Opposition spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, I have seen that the areas relating to agriculture and food are so profound and important that it is impossible for me to stay fully on top of that and, at the same time, deal with what is potentially the most complex issue in any Department.</p>  <p>  We have a Minister of State with responsibility for organics and forestry - matters that should be on the Minister's desk and over which he should have control.  I would argue that it will be much more appropriate to have a Minister with direct responsibilities for fisheries.  We can see the evidence in the contributions from Deputy Mac Lochlainn today.  It makes a difference when somebody is working continually on the issue, knowing the issues inside out, meeting people from the sector every day, engaging with them and finding solutions.  This results in the articulation of policies that will make a difference.</p>  <p>  This is not a personal attack on the Minister.  I do not think anybody has the capacity to deal with the complexities of issues in both farming and fishing.  We need to have a Minister with political responsibility and somebody who has the political strength within government to bring this to the heart of government negotiations.  We need fundamental reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which has absolutely failed Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, here is the twist.  I accept that if we go into a room where the Common Fisheries Policy alone is being discussed, we will not get agreement among other member states for the type of reform that is required.  Most other member states have been laughing at Ireland's position since the 1970s.  The only way we will get the type of reform needed is if this is brought into the heart of the European negotiations on every budget, every treaty change, every proposal on financial services or whatever the case may be.  Ireland needs to set out as a political priority for our membership and within our membership of the European Union that if we want to see progress and developments at an EU level, fundamental to that must be a change to the fishing policy.  That needs to be led by the Head of Government as well as by a collective move by the Government.  The only way that can happen is if there is the political realisation that change needs to happen and I am not convinced that that realisation has yet happened.</p></speech>

Every day of the week, people in the fishing industry tell me they feel let down and abandoned.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully recognises the importance of co-operation at an international level, predominantly through the EU, for the sustainable management of fish stocks.</p>  <p>  That said, the current Common Fisheries Policy is a terrible deal for Ireland and always has been.  This has been the result of a litany of historical failures by successive Governments to secure a fair deal for our fishing sector.  This has been compounded by the disaster of the recent Brexit trade and co-operation agreement, as the Minister knows.  The agreement saw &euro;199 million worth of EU-wide quota transferred back to Britain.  Approximately &euro;43 million, essentially a quarter of the total, came at the expense of the fishing sector in this State.</p> <p>The sector lost 15% of its total quota.</p> <p> The European Commission is in the process of conducting the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which will be presented to the European Council and parliament at the end of next year.  It is vitally important that there is substantial reform, but how can the sector trust the Government given its track record?  That is what people are asking me.  I know a meeting has been arranged for tomorrow morning at which the Government does not want any outside voices.  This is very disappointing because we need to work together in order to sort this out for the sake of our coastal communities.  That is what fishermen along our coast and certainly those along the Mayo coast expect from us.</p> <p> The seafood task force was established to make recommendations to the Minister on measures to mitigate the impacts on the fishing industry of fish quota share reductions arising from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  The report refers to the longer term fleet restructuring measures through the voluntary permanent cessation schemes, including the inshore sectors.  I want to balance recognising how important the fishing industry is with also recognising how underdeveloped it is by international standards.  The fishing fleet operating in Mayo is predominantly the inshore fleet.  While short-term supports for voluntary cessation may be necessary, the idea that the long-term solution is to downsize this sector in Mayo is completely unacceptable.  The fishing industry provides and essential source of income for many people in communities along the coast of Mayo, and fishing is one of the few jobs that sustained communities throughout the tough times.  When a State reduces its fleet, it takes a retrograde step.  This is the third time decommissioning has been introduced.  Fishermen want to fish.  They do not want tie-up schemes or decommissioning; they want quotas to be allowed and to be allowed to do the job they love.  They feel totally abandoned and let down by successive Irish Governments, and they want a fairer distribution.</p> <p> We need to implement the recommendations of the final report for the very survival of fishing and coastal communities, but this cannot be the end of it.  Unless there is a fairer, more balanced and viable approach our communities will be decimated.  We need a fairer quota system.  This is not only about the overall quota system, but how it is distributed as well.  We need to know, in the context of places like Erris where there are no processing plants - which is a failure of the Government - how that money will be spent.  Can it be spent on piers, infrastructure and other areas?  Article 16, on how quota is divided, is not being implemented properly in Ireland.  We have 1,500 vessels of which less than 50 have mackerel entitlements.  One medium vessel has an allocation equal to 1,000 smaller vessels.  That is not right.  The unfair distribution of the quota as it stands must be looked at.</p> <p> I hope the Minister will take from today's debate what is need for the coastal communities, because the coastal communities and the fishermen in County Mayo feel completely abandoned by this Government.  They will not be put off by meetings with no opposition present and no hard questions being asked.  We have a responsibility to work together.  The Minister has a responsibility in government.  Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, has done Trojan work on this.  We want to work with the Minister.  We want to get it right, not just for now but for ten and 20 years' time and into future generations.</p></speech>

Where is this mythical level playing field when it comes to the Irish fishing fleet?  No other nation had imposed upon it a 15% reduction in its fishing quotas, which will lead to the loss of up to &euro;43 million per year.  No other nation was asked to decommission a major portion of its fleet.  No other nation was offered a voluntary tie-up scheme.  A funding scheme is not the answer to fishers who, over decades, have built their modern fleets, their small prosperous coastal communities and provided the country with an industry valued at &euro;1.22 billion per annum and employing more than 16,000 people.</p>  <p>  The pretext is the premise that this will somehow reduce the number of fish caught and balance the books.  All the while, Belgium, France and Spain are substantially investing in and adding to their fleets with modern super-trawlers being constructed as we speak.  While we, once again, sacrifice our country's natural resources, we are allowing other countries to fish with impunity and receive all the benefits of the lucrative global superfood product.</p>  <p>  As the saying goes, there is no use in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  I hope and pray this is not the case here.  It is in the Minister's hands, as the representative of the fishers of Ireland, to ensure burden sharing is proportionate to the quota transfers across the board.  It has not gone unnoticed that Britain's first move in the Brexit negotiations was to stake its claim on territorial waters and use its fishing fleet as a trump card and for major bargaining leverage in the negotiations.  It has not gone unnoticed that the 15% reduction in quotas has left our industry in a most disadvantaged place.  This must be addressed and rectified in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is due to be completed by 31 December 2022.</p>  <p>  A full and comprehensive plan must be deployed and acted upon to protect what we have and to invest and grow our fishing aquaculture and processing industry in a responsible and sustainable way.  These are valuable assets that belong to and enrich our nation.  I find it incomprehensible when I see the future of fishers being bought off, with processors closing and job losses in order to facilitate France, Spain, Belgium and others reaping the rewards of our fishing waters for many years to come.  Meanwhile our fishing boats are decommissioned and tied to the piers.  I implore all stakeholders to put forward their case in a strong and bold manner, because the clock is ticking and there is no time to lose.  The stakes are high for the sustainability and future of our fishing communities, including in Kilmore, Rosslare, Slade and Duncannon in my home county of Wexford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900033#KK00300"><p>The report sets out the stark reality facing the Irish fishing sector, which is in the eye of the storm that is Brexit.  In the hundreds of headlines and news reports on Brexit, fishing is not mentioned enough.  Despite the massive impact of the ongoing change, coastal and island communities' livelihoods depend on the sea and they are often overlooked.  The Irish fleet has lost more than 15% of its annual quota, which is compounded by supply chain disruption to and from the UK as well as transport links with continental Europe.</p>  <p>  The key issue here is one of imbalance.  The report highlights the imbalances between fleet capacity and resource availability as a result of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  There is also the imbalance in the distribution of the decreasing Irish quota with the inshore sector getting disgracefully low allowances in some cases.  Brexit is an incredible challenge for the fishing and seafood sector, but now all we can do is see it as an opportunity to recognise and set out policies that will guarantee the sustainability of coastal and island communities.</p>  <p>  Our fishing quota is a public resource.  It has to be distributed equitably between smaller vessels and operators as well as large players.  Any schemes or measures to counter the Brexit impact cannot be allowed to reinforce current imbalances.  The loss of fishing opportunities is felt by all fishers, and any response must recognise this and adjust historical and existing disparities.  The closure of the artisan hook and line fishery for mackerel for vessels under 15 m in length in June is a clear example of the inequality.  The 2% of the quota assigned to the inshore sector ran out halfway through the year, leaving more than 2,000 boats - almost 2,000 families - without access to this type of fishing.  At the same time, 98% of that quota is allocated to just 49 boats.  I raised this injustice with the Minister in June, and nothing happened.  Since then, the smallest of vessels, which were just trying to getting by, were not permitted to catch even a few dozen mackerel to sell at the likes of a farmers' market using a fishing method which, as we all know, is probably the most environmentally friendly of all.  Why is our fishing regime set up to benefit a few big players and not the majority of fishers?  This is similar to our agriculture policy and pretty much like our housing and health policies.  The same story unfolds.</p> <p>This policy choice also conflicts with Article 17 of the Common Fisheries Policy, which states that the allocation of quota must be based on "environmental, social and economic" benefits.  Where is the evidence of that in Ireland's policy?  The preamble to the policy specifically states "Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper."  Our inshore fisheries are more environmentally friendly.  They practise the kind of fishing that has been found in coastal and island communities for centuries.  This is where the vast majority of employment in the sector is.  This is the segment that should get the most support.  It should get at least a fair allocation of quotas and funding.</p> <p> The submission of the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, now a producer organisation, PO, makes very clear recommendations which need to be met if the Minister and the Department are serious and genuine about supporting inshore fishers.  These recommendations include a flat-rate payment for all registered vessels of 12 m or less.  The submission also recommends that vessels of between 12 m and 18 m which do not qualify for supports under other Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, measures should be supported under a similar scheme.  It also says that the issue of access to fishing opportunities by the national fleet should be examined through a formal public consultation in light of the decreases in quota.  These are also sensible and important actions the Government can and should take. </p> <p> Piers and marine infrastructure are vital in facilitating the seafood sector.  I welcome the report&rsquo;s acknowledgment of this.  It states that &lsquo;"Public Marine Infrastructure (Piers, Slipways, Pontoons etc) is a critical enabler to maximising the use of and benefits to be gained from our rich marine resources" and recommends an &euro;80 million, five-year initiative for the development of these features.  This is not only vital and necessary funding, but it will also reap multiple benefits for the fishing, recreation and tourism sectors, which will generate considerably more for local economies.  However, this funding must be in addition to existing investment in piers and slipways because, as everyone who is from a coastal area will know, current resources for this area are vastly inadequate and the Government needs to recognise this and provide fresh investment rather than relabel existing measures.  I hope that makes sense.</p> <p> I have continually raised the need to fund our small piers as vital infrastructure for inshore fishing.  A pier in a bay or on an island can support ten or 20 families and can keep people in rural areas and on our islands.  In west Cork, there are a great many examples of piers like this.  Many people fish off them, creating employment.  The likes of Dunmanus, Colla, Durrus, Allihies, and Turk Head - I could list more - all need investment.  Too many small piers dotted around our coastline and islands are falling into disrepair and lack basic amenities like slipways.</p> <p> Islands must also be recognised in this category.  They require basic infrastructure if they are to participate effectively in a sustainable fishing industry into the future.  The Minister needs to support the development of a network of onshore infrastructure on the offshore islands to facilitate the island fishing fleet and shore-based seafood collectors.  Given the limited range of small vessels and their vulnerability to weather conditions, offshore islands should be equipped with combined landing, storage, processing and retail units to facilitate short fishery supply chains and the adding of value to catches.</p> <p> The task force outlines the case for investment in public marine infrastructure.  The Government needs to implement this and ensure that small piers and islands get the investment they desperately need.  I have spoken to the Minister about this but, when I was on Cork County Council, the coastal management committee ended up talking about how to get more funding rather than about what projects in Cork needed funding because there was no money there for them.  There is no point in everybody going in and fighting for their own local pier.  There needs to be funding for more of them.</p> <p> Different representative organisations have also raised concerns that must be addressed.  The Irish Fishing and Seafood Alliance has highlighted the lack of clarity regarding how many of the recommended measures will come from the EU Brexit fund.  There is also confusion as to whether those applying for decommissioning will have to refund any tie-up scheme payments they received.  In addition, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has pointed out the inadequacies of the proposed decommissioning scheme. </p> <p> This discussion is not only about seafood, but about the future of our coastal and island communities as a whole.  It is about families and whole cohorts who are dependent on this sector, including those involved in culinary and environmental tourism.  There is a glaring need for a citizens' assembly on our maritime future.  The legislative framework around marine planning and development is rapidly changing with vastly insufficient input from the communities affected.  Brexit has now underscored the inequities of our quota and funding allocations.  We are still awaiting an offshore islands policy and massive sections of marine zones are going to become protected areas.  We need to have a clear understanding of how this all fits together.  We need to have a vision for the future of our coast.  I urge the Government to convene a citizens' assembly on this in the next year.  </p> <p> The seafood sector task force&rsquo;s report is an enormous opportunity to set out a fairer policy which recognises the inshore sector and supports coastal and island communities.  It is now up to the Government to make that happen.</p></speech>

We are dealing with the final report of the seafood task force.  It lays out starkly the position of the fishing industry and the communities that lie behind it.  We have had many reports on many issues over many years but we have not necessarily done anything other than bind them and present them well.  We have not always done the business or carried out the required due diligence.  There are fishing communities across this island, including in Clogherhead and other areas in my constituency.  The Minister has had a number of interactions with fishermen and realises, or at least has been told about, the difficulties they are dealing with.  We know what we could be looking at.  That has already been said.  I am talking about reductions in the fleet.  Brexit is the gift that never stops giving and following the trade and co-operation agreement, our share of quota has been reduced by 15%.  Only 30% of fish landed in Irish territorial waters go to the Irish fishing industry.  We have great difficulties in this regard.</p>  <p>  We have three major asks in respect of this report.  The first is that too much of a burden is being put on the Irish fishing industry.  There are also very significant issues in respect of financing, funding streams and the rules around them.  We need these to be updated and we need a system that is fit for purpose.  Beyond that, we are dealing with a third issue, the most major one of all.  I have heard a term used here.  I have used it myself and I am going to use it again.  With regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, the Brexit negotiations and the trade and co-operation agreement, we see that once again the Irish fishing industry is the whipping boy.  It was not sufficiently defended and it is now feeling the pain.  We started from a bad place and ended up with a reduction of 15% in the quota.  When the opportunity arises as quotas and the Common Fisheries Policy are renegotiated, we need to invest greatly to ensure delivery.  Of course, there are many people who will want to avail of particular funding as regards decommissioning and so on.  That is fine but we need to look at the fishing industry overall.  We need to ensure it is able to deliver a stream of healthy food for us into the future.  Even beyond that, we need to look at the positive impact the fishing industry has had in our communities.  </p>  <p>  It would be very difficult to talk about this and the whole issue of Brexit without noting the utter madness of a British Government which, I think it is fair to say, does not care at all about Ireland.  That is the only view we can take.</p> <p>We have the absolute madness now that we could be talking about new British immigration laws that might see non-Irish EU citizens living in the South needing to apply online for pre-travel clearance to cross the Border.  This could be a matter of them crossing the Border to get to work and then crossing back.  They would be leaving from the South to then end up back in the South.  It is utterly unworkable and it once again shows how Britain in any of its determinations and negotiations concerning Brexit does not care in any way, shape or form about Ireland or the North.  It only cares about that aspect as a pawn.  This is an issue that we must be solid and firm about.  I also brought this issue up yesterday with Commissioner Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič.  I refer to the impact this will have in future.  It is fair to say that everybody here agrees that we must be solid.  The Irish protocol is the only show in town and there can be no return of a hard Border.</p> <p> To return to the issue at hand, we have an opportunity now to follow through concerning the report from this task force, and first and foremost is a renegotiation of the CFP.</p></speech>

It would be impossible to mention or discuss all the problems that fishermen have raised with me in the context of this report, but I will do my best.</p><p>Looking at the executive summary of the seafood task force report, a couple of paragraphs jumped out at me.  These state that:</p> <blockquote> 	The Irish seafood sector is, in many ways, &lsquo;in the eye of the storm&rsquo;.  It has been shaped by the common experience of EU membership, alongside the UK, since both joined the EC, as it then was, in 1973.  Irish boats fished the shared waters in the English Channel or off Scotland and Killybegs trawlers became familiar sights in ports such as Ullapool and Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands.  The Brexit/TCA deal has brought a sudden and dramatic shift in the landscape for the entire Irish seafood sector, in a number of respects:  	- Irish fleet has lost access to 15% of its annual quota, mainly affecting pelagic stocks, prawns <i>(Nephrops)</i>and whitefish stocks such as megrim, monkfish and haddock<br /><br />- Irish seafood exports to UK, a key market, worth &euro;80 million pre-Brexit, are impacted <br /><br />- Irish seafood imports from UK (worth &euro;219 million in 2018), a key input to the Irish retail and processing supply chain, have been disrupted<br /><br />- Vital seafood export routes, primarily the &rsquo;land-bridge&rsquo; via the UK, have been curtailed<br /><br />- Established Irish/UK links at scientific and policy levels in EU and ICES have been lost.  </blockquote>  <p>The key question arising, of course, is what are we going to do about this situation and how are we going to protect our fishing industry from further harm and devastation.  &quot;Burden sharing&quot; is a phase often spoken when it comes to fishing.  It is such an apt name, because so many burdens have been placed on the Irish fishing sector.  It is not reward sharing, but burden sharing.  Surely the spirit of the EU is to help people and not to place burdens on them.  The Common Fisheries Policy is an outdated, severe burden on our Irish fishers.  To quote again from the report: </p> <blockquote> 	&quot;[...] Ireland contributed about 15% of the total value of our total 2020 fisheries quota to the Agreement.  Proportionally, this is substantially more than that of any other Member State impacted by the TCA&quot;. </blockquote>  <p>Again, we see that it is the Irish fishers who pay the heaviest price.  The Government owes it to the Irish fishing industry to do all that it can to create the conditions for our fishing industry to thrive.  We made many concessions to get an EU agreement over the line.  Our fishermen were neglected.  The unlevel playing field is another major concern of fishermen that I have mentioned previously in debates here concerning the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021.  Some of what I said then needs to be repeated, because it is still causing significant anger among those in the industry and, moreover, particularly in our Wexford ports.  Irish people who commit infringements in Irish waters will have penalty points applied by the Irish authorities.  Yet, when foreign masters commit infringements in Irish waters, they will not have penalty points applied by the Irish authorities.  All we can do is to notify the authorities in their countries of origin.  That is if they were to be an inspected at all.  We should have the opportunity to police our waters as we see fit, rather than only being able to refer offences to the authorities in other jurisdictions.  It is a fundamental issue of sovereignty over our affairs.  While Ireland has seen many benefits from our membership of the EU, our sovereignty over things such as our fishing rights has been steadily eroded to the detriment of Irish fishers.</p><p>We do not have a level playing field.  It seems that we are not currently able to police our waters and we do not have the right to punish offenders in our waters, which is a concerning state of affairs.  There is an urgent need for a review of the Common Fisheries Policy, if ever these issues are to be dealt with to deliver a policy for how we fish today and not 50 years ago.  The report states that:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister has set down that Ireland is seeking a comprehensive review, to inform a full reform of the current policy.  He has made clear that the CFP review must take stock of the disproportionate impacts imposed on the Irish fishing industry by Brexit and the TCA.  He also made clear that Ireland will be seeking to address the imbalance in the quota transfers [of] the TCA.  </blockquote>  <p>I have heard him say that myself.  I welcome the news and I sincerely hope it is not an empty promise on his behalf.  We must stand firm on this issue during negotiations and debates.  I wish the Minister well in this work because the fishing sector is absolutely relying on him.  All Irish fishers want a fair deal and a level playing field to allow the sector to be sustainable.</p><p>From 1 April 2021, certain Irish fishing boats, many based in County Wexford, have not been allowed to land their catches in UK ports.  They have had to use EU ports instead, adding extra time and cost to their journeys, including hundreds of extra nautical miles and kilometres, plus the added costs of getting their catches back to Ireland.  They have to do that to earn their living and to help their communities to survive, with added risk to life and limb.  It also results in greater levels of emissions, which the Government seems only to be concerned with at some level.  This burden of not being able to land catches in UK ports would not have been quite as bad except that we offered five extra landing ports in Ireland to facilitate foreign-registered fishing vessels landing catches here.  Therefore, we bent over backwards to accommodate people we have no responsibility for.  Yet, our fishermen feel cast to one side.</p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of salmon drift net fishing.  This is a forgotten sector and one I discussed briefly with the Minister.  In 2005, the sector was effectively closed down using the guise of protecting fish stocks.  In 2006, a &euro;25 million decommissioning scheme, or hardship scheme, was introduced.  Only those who agreed not to reapply for their licences were compensated for their loss of livelihood.  A response to a parliamentary question that I submitted a few weeks ago said that 1,046 licence holders had availed of that scheme.  A number of licence holders had decided against applying for the scheme, as they wanted to be able to resume fishing in the future, as many had done for decades beforehand.  They were assured that they could do so.  Now, 16 years later, they still have not been allowed to resume their fishing activity.  In some instances, people have been stripped of their livelihoods and prevented from engaging in salmon drift net fishing for 16 years.</p><p>The Government has a responsibility to these people.  The response to my parliamentary question stated that only 79 people still had active licences in 2021.  That might be a relatively small number, but those are 79 people without the opportunity to earn a living from salmon drift net fishing.  The situation has impacted far more than just those 79 people holding the licences, however.  It has also impacted their families, if we take into account that at one point this activity provided those people&rsquo;s livelihoods.</p>  <p>This fishing has been banned for a period that has been extremely long and that could not have been unforeseen.  I can only assume that in 2005 it was expected to last for possibly a year or two.  Now that there are only 79 licence holders, can we not reinstate their right to fish?  If we are not going to do that, we have to compensate them.  Fair is fair.  When the fishing was stopped for these people, there were well over 1,100 licences active and now there are only 79.  They deserve better from Government than to be just cast aside and ignored.  It is their opinion that Government does not care as these are only 79 votes.  I do not wish to believe that we would cast any group aside because of a vote.  I ask the Minister to consider how we would deal with the 79 licence holders going forward.  If resumption of the fishing is not possible, a hardship scheme should be reintroduced to take care of that.</p></speech>

Fishermen have been raising their concerns about their industry since long before the Brexit trade deal was signed prior to Christmas 2020.  All concerns put forward by the entire sector have been ignored by the Minister.  The Minister's actions have seriously disadvantaged the Irish fishing sector.  This has been compounded by the EU ruling that means fish need to be weighed on piers.</p>  <p>  The greatest thing that is required for the fishing industry is for the Government to develop a backbone and a willingness to fight at European level to save it from being decimated.  That is the one element that has been consistently missing over the last 48 years of our membership of the EU.  Successive Governments have been completely subservient to every rule, regulation or guideline that has ever come from the European Union.  Successive Governments have failed to recognise the true potential of the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  The seafood task force report is a complete distraction from the real impacts of Brexit.  It is a deeply cynical move for the Government that failed the sector during the Brexit negotiations to compound its failings further by seeking to decommission large portions of the Irish fleet.  All talk now is about burden sharing.  Where was the talk about burden sharing 12 months ago and a year and a half ago?  The Brexit trade deal must be revisited.  The Common Fisheries Policy which is up for renewal shortly must be used to get a better deal for Irish fishers.</p>  <p>  Under this Minister's policy on fisheries, some boats are tied up for long periods due to a lack of quota.  Bigger boats could be tied up six months of the year now.  The same Minister wants to put fishermen and fisherwomen completely out of existence via this report's recommendations.  The Brexit deal and the withdrawal of the weighing derogation were two straws that really broke the camel's back within the Irish fishing sector.  Brexit took away 15% of our already minimal quotas.  That is a really hard blow to the industry.  It equated to 25% of the industry's income.  Every year for evermore those fish are gone to the UK around the Irish coast.  We only have 7.5% of monkfish quota and 3% of hake so it is very low.  The EU granted &euro;199 million worth of fish to the UK as part of the Brexit trade deal and out of that Ireland had to give &euro;43 million worth of fish.  We consider that to be desperately unfair.  The sector is being slashed by an annual cut of at least &euro;43 million simply due to Government sell-out.  This will impact the sector every single year.  My colleagues in the Rural Independents Group and I highlighted this earlier in the year.</p>  <p>  The evidence illustrates that our fisheries Minister and the Government blindly allowed Brussels to give away Irish fishing quota during crucial Brexit negotiations.  In doing so, they have betrayed not only the sector and coastal communities but the entire country.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, sold the Irish fishing industry out during the Brexit negotiations.  When I raised these issues in the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions this year and last with the Taoiseach, his response was flabbergasting and deflective in nature.  He chose to take a defensive and elusive tone which lacked any acknowledgement of the extent of the destruction by this Government of the Irish fishing sector.  The Taoiseach's response clearly indicates a deep and uncaring lack of understanding for the sector.  This was previously demonstrated when he signed into law a highly destructive penalty points system when he was caretaker Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in August 2020.  Replies I have obtained to a series of parliamentary questions confirm that the Government blindly supported the EU negotiators and mandate in the context of the Brexit negotiations.  This provides infuriating confirmation that the Irish fishing industry must now pay the price for our Government opting to toe the Brussels line in the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  The shocking utter lack of engagement and dialogue with the EU side on behalf of the Irish fisheries sector by the Minister in the months leading up to the Brexit deal is now glaringly obvious.  In fact, at his first meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 September 2020, the Minister failed to raise the Irish sector's pre-Brexit concerns.  At his second meeting on 19 and 20 October 2020, he again failed to table or raise discussions on the Brexit fisheries implications for Ireland.  Instead he chose to engage in a rather meaningless three-way bilateral meeting with fisheries Ministers from France, Denmark and Netherlands.  At his third EU fisheries meeting on 16 November 2020 no fisheries items whatsoever were raised.  One would be forgiven for wondering what was being discussed at such fisheries meetings.  Further meetings attended by the Minister on 27 November and 15 and 16 December, at which the Brexit fisheries elements were discussed, point to the Minister acting as a protector of European quota interests rather than a protector of the Irish share of the quota.  This new information serves to illustrate the complete blindness with which the Minister and the Government trusted the EU negotiators.  It also illustrates that the Minister and the Government strategically chose not to stand up for Irish fishing interests and instead sought praise from the Brussels elite.  Sadly, this was at a time when Irish fishermen were depending solely on the Government to protect their interests.</p>  <p>  In an overall context, data from Dublin City University indicates that Ireland's share of the total fish catch in the Irish maritime zone is only 15% or 16%.  This means that the other 85% is caught by foreign vessels.  The Brexit fisheries deal means that Irish vessels are hit with massive quota reductions in neighbouring UK waters while other EU countries got sweet deals.  Despite the fact that foreign vessels continue to extract 85% of fish from Irish waters we now have a Government that is hell bent on forging ahead with a wide-scale decommissioning of the Irish fleet, dressed up as some sort of a review process and contained within this report.  It is telling that none of the Minister's colleagues from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party are here today to back the Minister up on this stingy deal for the Irish fishermen.  Decommission them, get rid of them.  That is the plan.  All the while, foreign vessels will be allowed to continue fishing our waters.  It is no wonder Irish fishing and coastal communities feel let down by the Government.  The sector was only seeking a fair distribution of quota, nothing more and nothing less.  They were betrayed in that request.</p>  <p>  The Government should have made a decision to adopt a much tougher stance during the Brexit negotiations.  The Taoiseach failed miserably to clarify why he and his Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine chose to let the Irish fishing sector down.  This arrogant and aloof attitude cannot be tolerated as it is destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen and fisherwomen while also destroying coastal communities.  It has us now on our knees with a begging bowl in front of Europe.  The only solution being offered by the Government is a public relations exercise dressed up as a pathetic review after the fact.  This review has one long-term objective, to decommission a large volume of Irish vessels.  As a Deputy who has consistently stood shoulder to shoulder with our fishing industry, I will not be accepting this hoodwinking approach.  I will continue to fight every day for our fishermen and fisherwomen.  I am again calling on the Minister and the Taoiseach to go back to Brussels and seek a greater share of the quota for the Irish fishing vessels, currently 15% or 16% of the Irish maritime zone, in order to make up for the mess created by their own inaction.  Failure by the Government to heed this call will result in a decommissioned Irish fleet and almost all fish in Irish waters being caught by foreign vessels due to lazy policies by a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach and his Minister and Deputies with the support of Fine Gael and the Green Party.</p>  <p>  What are the species landed by the Irish fleet that make up the 35% of landings the Minister spoke about earlier?  Does he know how many tonnes this amounts to?  Is he telling us the full amount caught in Irish waters by every fishing boat of the EU was 300,000 tonnes when the Marine Institute says 3.7 million tonnes were caught by EU vessels in 2020?  We have less than 1% of the fish caught in Europe.</p> <p>Whoever wrote the Minister's report and speech should be retired.  Is he aware that the European Commission has written to the SFPA asking about breaches of landing obligations?  It is threatening to withdraw millions in funding for our national Naval Service.  Is there anyone listening to the industry calling for a level playing pitch?  Why are foreign boats sailing in and out of our ports with little or no monitoring of their activities when our fishermen will soon be putting some seats into their boats for the inspectors because there are so many on board so often?  We lost access to Rockall, and &euro;5 million worth of squid are gone.  Where has the Minister covered this in his report?  An additional one-month tie-up is being proposed, which means no fishing and no earnings from other species.  This is of little or no help.</p> <p> There are many issues I could address.  The inshore sector has also been badly hit and is on its knees.  Coastal and island communities will be hit badly.  Nothing can compensate people for losing their livelihood.  I refer to people who have fished the sea day and night and went out in rough times to put food on people's plates in this country.  No Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Greens showed up here today.  That is a scandalous sign, and it is a scandalous statement by them that they do not support what the Minister is putting before us today.  I certainly do not.</p></speech>

I am not going to claim I am as knowledgeable about fishing as many who live in coastal areas.  My analysis is that much of what is happening has been driven by bad EU policy down through the years.  It seems that the EU, as a combination of nations, wants the big monopoly to do everything.  One time a builder could go to the council and tender for three, four or five houses and build them; now, if an area is being developed, the builder's bonds and turnover will not be big enough.  Unless you are a big builder getting funding from somewhere abroad, meaning you have the necessary turnover, you are not considered.  The HSE has gone down the same road.  It wants one supplier to do all - the big guru that will have it all.  Regarding roads right around the country, the thresholds related to turnover are quite unbelievable.  Consider the case of Irish Water.  Regarding group water schemes, we used to have a saying down the country that a tractor, transport box, digger and a couple of people would do the job.  Now people are given a region and if their turnover is not big enough for it, even though they might have done the job down through the years for 100 or 150 houses, they are regarded as too small.  They are being shoved into a corner as subbies, and they have to sub off those who are able to control a whole area.  It appears that the EU, in all its legislation, wants bodies to be dealing with one person.  The job goes out to tender, a decision is made on turnover, and then it is a case of bye-bye.  The sad reality of this, no more than in the fishing sector, is that we had companies that came from Spain and other parts of the world to tender for work here.  Some of the outcomes were not very favourable.  The practice leaves Irish people scratching their heads.</p>  <p>  When I hear about fishing, the Brexit deal and some of the proposals, decommissioning comes to mind.  Decommissioning is taking people away from the work they were doing, to put it very simply.  People have to sell their boats and are offered a few measly pounds.  It reminds me of the time of the beet issue in Ireland, when farmers were sold a pup, to put it very clearly.  Why are we, as a country, constantly stopping things that give people a living and then saying, with hindsight, that we should never have done so as it left us exposed?  Let me give a case in point.  In Europe, we are like a little bird within the nest with our beak open because we are waiting for gas so we will not perish to death.  It is the same with fertiliser.  We are relying on countries that are sparring with the likes of Russia.  They are trying to kick Russia in the mouth but, at the same time, we want their gas.  Tariffs are put on things.  The whole exercise by the EU has to be questioned.  The only area where the penny might have dropped for it is the farming sector.  I have said before that I support the Minister on convergence, but in 2000 or 1999 it was a matter of punching as many bullocks as you could, at nine months and 18 months.  The more land and bullocks you had, the bigger your payment was, but the small fellow or lady with a few cows on ten, 20, 30 or 40 acres did not have the money to do this and ended up at the bottom of the ladder.  That is why we have lost so many farmers in the farming sector.  It became unviable for the poor devils.  The EU now seems to be driving towards having one big commercial operator, farmer, fisherman and builder.  The aim is to have one in each sector so that when invoices come in, you do not have to be looking at 40 little subbies torturing you or ringing you; you just look at one.  That is not the way to build communities.</p>  <p>  When the EU started off, it was a community, the greatest thing that ever was.  However, we seem to be heading towards what it calls fiscal union.  It is like marriage; it is either love or divorce, one or the other.  The EU needs to have a ferocious rethink.  Ireland has the biggest area of fishing waters in Europe but we seem to have got the worst deal.  I am not referring to the Minister's time but to when the deal was being divvied out.  We got a ferociously bad deal.  Now, with Brexit and the tightening that is coming, other countries are also looking for the few fish left in the waters we are talking about.  We are blocked from going over to theirs, so our people fishing in our waters for our fish are the big losers.</p>  <p>  Let me outline the sad part.  I am no expert in fishing but watch what is going on.  I watched a ship that came from Australia to fish in our waters.  I would say it would gulp more in 15 minutes than 200 fishing boats that we would have going out from our little ports.  The difference is that the 200 little fishing boats that go out from our little ports involve 200 families that are living in 200 areas and helping 200 communities and others in business.  We do not seem to get this into our heads.  I hate to hear the word "decommission".  Consider the likes of Bord na M&oacute;na and the palaver and PR that comes out - I call it the BS - about having created this, that and the other.  We should compare the number of people working seven years ago with the number working today.  It is by doing this that you add up whether people are better or worse off, not by saying we have such a thing coming in, that we are going to re-wet this and do this, that and the other.  It is absolute BS.  What the gurus can say in the media is unbelievable.   </p>  <p>  We have to stand up for the Irish fisherpeople.  I was talking to Deputy Cairns yesterday evening.  She is from a fishing area with small fishing boats.  She said the fisherpeople never got the infrastructure needed in their area to help them.  We should make sure that we provide the smaller communities - be they in Donegal, Kinsale or Wexford, or at any of the other ports - with the infrastructure they need to do what they can.</p> <p>I listened to Deputy Michael Collins talk about putting in extra seats.  It is a damnable thing to have to put in a seat in a boat for someone else to join you basically to shaft you.  We have to stand up for rural communities on the periphery.  They are on the coast.  They are as important as anyone else in any other part of Ireland.  We have to watch that Europe does not try to bully us into doing a horse deal on something: "Do you sacrifice one thing for the other?"  I know there will always be trading, but it is a sad day when we own the biggest area of fishing water in Europe and we come out with the worst part of the deal.  Everyone welcomes new technology, but you must liaise with and work with people.  I have seen lobster pots and so on in respect of which cables are brought in.  Basically, those fishers were told, "You have to get out of the way or we will drive through you."  That is no way to work with people who have been in communities for years and years.  Some of these foreign ministers barely have a pond in their area, not to mind a bit of sea.  They should not be entitled to make decisions for us, given that we have such a big fishing area.  We have a common travel area for flying with the Brits, and I am damn sure we can do something ourselves, whatever about Europe.  I have always believed that people should look after their own and let the rest look after themselves.  That is my honest opinion.  We need to make sure we look after our fishermen and fisherwomen around the country.</p></speech>

It is obviously an important time and has been a crucial year for our fishing sector.  It was a very difficult year for our fishermen, coming out of the impact of the Brexit agreement.  It was really important we had this debate to discuss the sea fisheries task force report, which was presented to me in October, and to get Deputies' views on it.  I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies who contributed and Deputies Holly Cairns, Verona Murphy, Michael Collins and Michael Fitzmaurice.</p>  <p>  I will make a couple of points overall about the contributions.  A number of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies spoke, and even after all that time and all those contributions, I am still none the wiser as to whether Sinn F&eacute;in supports the sea fisheries task force report or does not.  I have no idea.  I listened carefully to all the contributions and I have not a clue what its position is.  I do not think the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies themselves know.  It certainly will not have been clear to anyone listening in to the debate.  They might clarify that in due course.  My objective over the past year, and indeed in advance of Brexit, has been to support our fishers in every way possible.  I have been fully supported in that by my Government colleagues both in advance of Brexit, in protecting us against the threat it posed, a very fundamental threat to fishers' livelihoods and, subsequently, in respect of the damage that agreement did.  We all knew the threat that Brexit posed to our fishing sector.  It was never going to be a good story.  It was always about protecting the sector in every way we could against it.  I find it ironic that Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have stood up this evening to talk about standing up for fishermen and working hard for fishermen when I think back to when Brexit was happening.  As the House will recall, the Brexit deal finally happened on Christmas Eve last year, on Thursday, 24 December.  I remember that the previous weekend the news broke as to what could be in the deal from a fisheries point of view and how damaging it might be.  Very significant efforts were going on within the Government to push back on that.  I remember that afterwards, on Christmas Day, our officials were working in Brussels dealing with the outcome of the agreement.  I remember that on the following day, St. Stephen's Day, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I met with fisher representatives to discuss the stark implications of the agreement for us.  Despite members of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party now talking about standing up for fishermen, there was over that period not a word out of them on fishing, despite the fundamental moment that was for our fishing sector.  We as a Government were standing up in every way we could.  There was not a word out of them.  They say that the weekend before Christmas it became clear what the implications might be - not a word.  On Christmas Eve - not a word.  It was into the new year before there was any comment from a Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson about the impact Brexit would have on fishing.  Yet once the water calmed and the storm passed and once it was safe to come back out, they were out talking about standing up for fishermen again.  It is therefore a little ironic to listen to their comments now when they were nowhere to be seen at that pivotal moment.</p>  <p>  At least Deputy Collins was absolutely clear that he does not support the task force report.  The report was put together by stakeholders, that is, by fishers themselves.  It is a pivotal moment for our fishing sector.  I brought together the fishing stakeholders to advise me as Minister on how we as a Government could best support the fishing sector to address the implications of Brexit, fight at European level on its behalf and address the implications to come out of that in respect of the impact on quotas.  Those fishing stakeholders, including fisher representatives and co-operative representatives, have put together this report and these many recommendations advising me and the Government as to how we can best support this sector.  I note that Deputy Collins does not support their recommendations and does not support the seafood task force report put together by those same stakeholders whose livelihoods depend on it.  At least Deputy Collins is clear on his position in that regard, unlike some other Deputies.  However, I thank Deputies across the board for the many contributions.</p>  <p>  In establishing the task force earlier this year, I strongly believed that such a once-in-a-generation event as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement required a collective response involving the sectors and communities most affected.  For these reasons, as I said, I set up the task force in such a way that there were 17 representatives of the sectors and communities impacted by Brexit on it, together with State enterprise development agencies.  I received the final report of the task force on 11 October.  I compliment the task force on the exceptional job it did in identifying the impacts of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on our fishing fleet and coastal communities and on proposing an integrated plan to mitigate those impacts and set those communities back on a path to prosperity.  The report recommends 16 support schemes at a total estimated cost of &euro;423 million.  Approximately &euro;300 million of that could potentially be eligible through the BAR.  The task force identifies a number of high-level impacts arising from the TCA that I wish to recall.</p>  <p>  First, the TCA quota reductions have created an economic imbalance between fleet capacity and fishing opportunities, rendering the whitefish fleet unprofitable.  Second, the TCA quota cuts have caused a significant loss of raw material supply to our vibrant seafood processing sector.  The loss of that raw material supply to our processors risks these processors losing hard-won markets, risks reducing their profitability and risks loss of employment in coastal communities.  Third, while large parts of the inshore sector have not been directly impacted by the quota transfers under the TCA, many have been impacted by route-to-market issues and increased operating costs, which compound other weaknesses in the sector.  The combination of impacts from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement risks significant loss of employment and economic value in coastal communities.</p> <p>Coming out of that, the task force report sets out an integrated plan to mitigate the four core impacts and other consequent effects on the TCA.  As discussed, first, on returning the white fish fleet to profitability, there is a proposal in relation to a decommissioning scheme.  Second, in supporting the processors with the loss of raw material, there is a proposal on direct investment in seafood processing companies.  Third, in addressing the impact on the inshore fleet, there is a recommendation to introduce a decommissioning scheme and assess ways to remove inactive vessels from the inshore fleet.  Finally, along with the investment in seafood processors and aquaculture enterprises, there is a proposal to invest to diversify the economies of our coastal communities through a combination of investment in public marine infrastructure and community-led local development through fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.</p> <p> Overall, the seafood task force report is comprehensive.  It deals with this once-in-a-generation impact and outlines and supports how I can take, as I have done, measures at European level to try to improve our quota situation to address the burden sharing outcome of the TCA which has been so impactful and damaging to our sector, and importantly, to invest in our sector to maximise its capacity, to create and maintain employment and to support coastal communities over the next number of years.  Once again, I wish to thank Aidan Cotter, chair of the task force; Margaret Daly and Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, steering group members; and the many stakeholders from our fishing communities and fishing representatives who put in much time and effort and attended full-day meetings on many occasions to put together this comprehensive response, looking at all aspects of how we, as a Government, can support them in the time ahead.  I will continue to work my way through the recommendations and will do all I can to support our fishing sector and our fishers, both at European and national levels in the time ahead.</p></speech>

It is something I welcome and support.  Unfortunately, like most of the country, in Limerick issues regarding mental health have increased over the course of the pandemic.  One of the things that the pandemic has cruelly demonstrated is how woefully under-resourced our mental health services are.  Mental health is as important is physical health.  A mental health concern is as big an impediment to an active life as any physical injury, but like an injury, if the resources are not provided, a mental health challenge cannot be addressed.</p>  <p>  In Limerick, we have seen the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, become overwhelmed with referrals.  On many occasions, voluntary organisations have stepped up and have done an incredible job in supporting those in need.  While there are many groups that I do not have time to mention, I would like to particularly commend the work of volunteers at the Limerick Haven Hub, Limerick Suicide Watch and Limerick Treaty Suicide Prevention, who do fantastic work on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  The recent budget presented an opportunity to address the underfunding of mental health services.  It missed the mark.  What we needed was real investment.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an investment of &euro;113 million, but the Government has offered the equivalent of a lick of paint when the whole structure needs investment.  The final outcome of the failure to treat mental health issues is often, sadly, suicide.  In my home county of Limerick, we have lost too many - often young - people to suicide.  Too often, the sound of a helicopter over the River Shannon is a signal that, tragically, another life has been lost and another family has been devastated by suicide.  As such, any project or scheme that can alleviate pressure on these organisations while delivering care to those who need it should be welcomed and supported.  My understanding of this pilot scheme is that it will be a multi-agency scheme that will involve mental health professionals, paramedics and specially trained garda&iacute;.  If a person is experiencing a mental health issue locally, then a specially trained team will contact them, triage them, treat them, and bring them or refer them to appropriate services.  The scheme was part of a motion on the mental health crisis put forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward.</p></speech>

It is a mouthful, but it is a really welcome initiative.  When I got the role of spokesperson on mental health, I said that I would work in a tangible real way in opposition.  I will welcome initiatives that are good.</p>  <p>  As was mentioned, the triage team contains mental health experts, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a paramedic.  I first heard about this scheme in a pilot project that was rolled out in parts of Belfast by my mental health spokesperson counterpart in the North, Ms &Oacute;rlaith&iacute; Flynn MLA.  It was run between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. on a Friday and Saturday in parts of Belfast for a year.  The results speak for themselves.  They were really good.  The team had 193 referrals in that space of time.  Of these, 94 referrals were face-to-face crisis de-escalation contacts.  Out of these crisis de-escalation contacts, they managed to divert 131 people who would have had to attend emergency departments, which is most welcome.  It took the pressure off an already-under strain hospital system.  It also diverted 61 people from the judicial system.  I spoke last week about how the garda&iacute; are the gatekeepers for mental health.  The pilot diverted 61 people who, on another day, could have found themselves being charged, despite the fact that they were mentally unwell, because they may or may not have broken the law.  This crisis de-escalation team was able to meet, treat and triage them in the community and refer them to the appropriate services.</p>  <p>  I am looking forward to hearing the Minister of State's response to the issue, because it is a welcome initiative.</p></speech>

The Deputies will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the law for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the training and deployment of Garda personnel.  The Minister for Justice has no direct role in such decisions.  However, the area of mental health in the justice sector has been a priority for the Minister, Deputy McEntee, so we are grateful for the opportunity to provide an update on this important initiative.</p><p>The establishment of crisis intervention units was recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland in its report published in 2018.  Crisis intervention teams are a priority project under A Policing Service for our Future, the implementation plan for the recommendations of the commission.  These will be specialist uniformed units that will work jointly with health professionals to provide a rapid and integrated 24-7 response to people with mental health issues.  Crisis intervention teams have become a globally recognised model within contemporary policing for safely and effectively assisting people who experience mental health crises or related problems within the community.  The crisis intervention team model promotes strong community partnerships among law enforcement, health professionals and appropriate follow-on support agencies.</p> <p>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Limerick division are leading on the implementation of a pilot project that examines, designs and resources a 24-7 multi-agency approach to responding to mental health-related incidents.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is grateful to them for their leadership on this important project.  The assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing and community engagement is sponsoring this important project within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while local Garda management in Limerick is engaged in the design, planning and eventual roll-out of the project.  The Limerick crisis intervention team project is in the consultation phase and is scheduled for implementation in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.  The intention is that the pilot project will involve a co-located response unit comprising a community psychiatric nurse working alongside front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to calls from anyone in crisis.</p> <p> The project team has engaged with an academic research partner from the University of Limerick who will assist in evaluating the project over a two- to three-year period.  This person will also assist the team with policy terminology and language in respect of vulnerability and eligibility criteria.  A training programme is also being drafted.  The learning from the pilot initiative in Limerick will be of enormous value in shaping a model for crisis intervention teams to be rolled out across the country and ensure that all people with mental health needs receive the support they deserve and are diverted from the criminal justice system whenever possible.</p></speech>

I really appreciate it.  The only concern I have is with regard to the third and fourth quarter of 2022 and I hope it will be done sooner than this.  People in Limerick, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and people who will be involved in this will not be found wanting in delivering the service, which I genuinely believe will be a game changer for many people who find themselves vulnerable.  As I mentioned earlier, the community responders include Limerick Suicide Watch, Limerick Treaty Suicide Prevention and the Haven Hub.  Their job will be made easier.  This initiative will divert people from having to go to the accident and emergency department in Limerick which, as the Minister of State knows, is well overcrowded.  For years it has consistently had the highest number of people on trolleys.</p>  <p>  This is a very welcome initiative.  I believe it will work very well.  It will save lives and that is what we are about.  I hope that when people see something as positive as this working well in Limerick it will be rolled out throughout the State.  I hope to God it will work well in Limerick.  I believe it will if we get the resources and support.  I imagine areas will be shouting for it once we get it up and running.</p></speech>

It was part of our alternative budget.  It would cost &euro;6.8 million to roll this out across each CHO throughout the State.  I welcome the involvement of the University of Limerick.  Research is very valuable.  I read out statistics from the pilot rolled out in Belfast.  We can see how invaluable the service was.  The Minister of State mentioned diversion from the judiciary system.  This is also invaluable.  Last week, I spoke about how the prison system is failing people with mental health issues.  This is a way to stop people going into the prison system in the first place.  It has to be welcomed.  How long will the pilot project be?  The Minister of State mention two or three years with regard to the contribution of University of Limerick.  Will the pilot project be for two or three years?  Does the Minister of State expect it to be rolled out in other areas within these two or three years?  This would be very welcome.</p></speech>

The Deputies are aware of the recent publication of a report from the Mental Health Commission on access to mental health services for people in the criminal justice system.  It references the crisis intervention team pilot project in Limerick.  The Minister for Justice is grateful to the inspector of mental health services and the Inspector of Prisons for their work on this important issue.  The publication of the report is very timely.  We know the healthcare needs of vulnerable and sometimes seriously ill people who interact with the criminal justice system are complex and require whole-of-system consideration and priority action.  It is widely acknowledged these people are too ill to be in prison as they require urgent medication and treatment.  There is a vital need to put in place properly resourced and appropriately located systems of care for those vulnerable people in society.  This is also acknowledged in the programme for Government commitment to the establishment of a high-level cross-departmental cross-agency task force to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those in prison and primary care support on release.</p>  <p>  The Deputies asked how long the pilot roll-out is.  I do not have this information to hand.  I will try to find out.  The Limerick crisis intervention team is in consultation phase and is scheduled for implementation in the third and fourth quarters of next year.  This is approximately six months from now.  I will find out.  I invite the Deputies to send an email to me or the Minister and we will try to get this detail for them.  I do not have it to hand.</p></speech>

The very immediate hinterland of the town brings the population of the area to in excess of 80,000.  The Government and the HSE would not dream of leaving Waterford city or Galway city without a Covid-19 testing centre but Drogheda is left without one.  It seems that nobody is accountable.  As the Minister of State knows, I am from Drogheda.  I live there.  I love my town.  I care deeply about it.  I am not making a narrow, local, parochial case for Drogheda to have a permanent Covid-19 testing centre or a community vaccination centre.  I am making a rational logical case based on the evidence before us and based on our experience.</p>  <p>  The Drogheda local electoral areas and the Laytown-Bettystown local electoral area which adjoins Drogheda consistently feature at the top of the charts of the areas most adversely affected by Covid-19 but we still have no vaccination centre.  There is no logic to this.  This is a real problem in the area.  When rates were running at 40 cases per 1,000, and now we are much higher, we had to beg the HSE nationally to provide us with a temporary testing centre in the locality just for a weekend.  It made an impact.  It works.  The evidence is clear.  The centre in Louth is in Ardee in mid-Louth.  The people there do a very good job.  Nobody is debating this or arguing about it.  However, 21% of all households in Drogheda town alone have no car.  They have no access to private transport.  People with symptoms do not want to have to get on a bus or public transport to go for a test because they do not want to run the risk of infecting others.  This is a laudable position to take.</p>  <p>  Neither does Drogheda have a community vaccination centre.  In May, the 50 to 60 age group in Louth were among the last in the State to be vaccinated.  I had to make a series of interventions with the HSE to enable them to have the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson jab administered in the Helix.  This cannot be allowed to happen again.  The 50 to 60 cohort in Louth and east Meath cannot be left behind.  As the Minister of State knows, those over 50 are at risk.  Tomorrow, the walk-in centre in Dundalk will be open but not for the 50 to 60 age group.  This simply is not on.  We know all about the waning efficacy of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  People can wait no longer.  Those vulnerable people cannot be exposed because of the inadequate roll-out of the booster vaccine and the lack of facilities in my locality.  It is not safe.  It is not on.  It is not acceptable.  We need a vaccination centre in Drogheda, Ireland's largest town.</p>  <p>  Those aged over 50 in Louth and east Meath were badly let down by the HSE nationally in April and May.  If we are to tackle this disease properly and if we are to make people safer, testing and vaccination centres need to be provided where people live and where they are.  We know the countries that perform best are those that have good testing and contact tracing systems, and have systems in place to respond to the needs in urbanised areas.  We simply do not have this, as is evidenced by the fact we do not have a Covid-19 permanent testing centre in Drogheda and neither do we have a community vaccination centre in the locality.  I request that the Minister of State address this with the HSE on an urgent basis.</p></speech>

Testing and contact tracing continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic and is fundamental to identifying the source and containing the spread of the virus.  Demand for testing at this time is very high with approximately 216,000 tests conducted in the last seven days.  This demand on the testing and tracing system is due to the high level of infection currently being experienced in the community.  The HSE has significantly increased community PCR test capacity to 25,000 tests per day and with the current high demand of people using the self-referral online portal, when booking a test one may find that there are no appointments available.</p>  <p>Appointments become available at different times during the day, so people should try again later.  If anyone with symptoms has concerns about booking a test, he or she should contact their GP.  The HSE is prioritising those who are clinically referred to it and symptomatic close contacts.  The HSE is routinely assessing locations where community testing centres are located.  The HSE, in particular, has the goal of ensuring that well in excess of 90% of the population have access to a centre within a 45-minute drive from their residence.  I should add that any individual who has a medical condition that prevents him or her from getting a test centre can be referred by a GP for a home test.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, in response to regional demand, the HSE evaluates options to augment capacity through the use of pop-up centres.  I am informed by the HSE that there are currently two test centres open in Louth, located in Ardee and a pop-up centre currently in Dundalk.  The permanent site located in Ardee was selected following a detailed evaluation as it best met defined criteria, including suitability and sustainability of the location as a long-term testing centre.  In addition, travel times from both Dundalk and Drogheda, as the Deputy is aware, are about 25 minutes.</p>  <p>It is important to reiterate the public health advice that anybody waiting for a test who has symptoms of Covid-19 should continue to isolate until they are 48-hours symptom-free.  This should minimise any impact for a person who may have to wait a number of days for a test.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently taking every necessary action to respond to the significant current demands, which includes working with private providers to add new capacity, extending the opening hours of swabbing centres, ongoing recruitment and redeployment of swabbing teams, and doubling the number of National Ambulance Service mobile teams.  It is currently continuing to monitor the need for testing centres and the most appropriate locations where they open at any given time.  This includes ongoing consideration of the need to open pop-up centres or the relocation of permanent centres or both in response to demand.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked about Drogheda and, as he has said, it is Ireland&rsquo;s biggest town with a population of 50,000, which is one of great significance.  This is not my area but I certainly feel that the Deputy has a point which he has argued very validly.  There was a pop-up centre in operation in Drogheda on 27 and 28 November and 2 and 5 December.  There will also be such centres in Dundalk on 6 and Friday 10 December.  I agree that for a town that size, the suggestion makes sense and I will bring back the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns to the HSE.  If he wishes, perhaps he might send me in an email and I will pass it on for the attention of the HSE.</p></speech>

I know that he will raise it at senior level with the HSE.  I believe regional officials in the HSE in the north east understand the requirement for such a centre in the area.  I repeat again that I am not making a narrow, local, parochial case for my own home town.  It is an observable fact that Drogheda is the largest town in the country and that it has consistently featured at or near the top of the charts of areas most adversely affected since the pandemic hit our shores in early 2019.  The evidence is there.  We know from experience elsewhere that the countries which best deal with the challenge that faces through Covid-19 are those that ensure contact tracing and testing centres are available where people live.  Accessibility is key.  I have dealt with countless cases over the past number of months of people who do not have transport and who are embarrassed that the very busy National Ambulance Service is mobilised to go to a home to test somebody because he or she cannot make it to the testing centre in Ardee.  It also causes great disruption to people&rsquo;s lives.  I can share many cases with the Minister of State of people in very vulnerable situations who could not go for a test as recently as last week because they did not have transport or access to a test in their own locality.</p>  <p>  That needs to be reviewed urgently and I repeat again the requirement for a community vaccination centre in the area.  The 50 to 60-year-old cohort in the area were, I am afraid to say, left behind last April and May.  That cannot happen again and if we are to be successful with the our national vaccine booster programme, we also need not just testing centres in areas where people live and where the population is most concentrated, but we also need community vaccination centres.</p></speech>

It is critical that we continue to monitor demand for testing to ensure that we can identify and contain the spread of the virus.  The HSE are continuously monitoring the demand for testing and attendance rate at both regional and local level in order to ensure that Covid-19 testing is available on a regional basis.  As I explained earlier, the HSE has the goal of ensuring that well in excess of 90% of the population has access to a centre within a 45-minute drive from their residence.  As the Deputy is aware, the test centre located in Ardee fulfils that requirement.</p>  <p>The current very high demand means that testing is now operating at surge capacity and every effort is being made to ensure that resources are targeted to where they are most efficiently deployed to mitigate the impact of the virus across the entire population.  I wish to reassure the House that the national testing policy, including the location of testing centres, is kept under continual review and the HSE continually evaluates the requirement of both pop-up and permanent testing centre response to the emerging demand.  I am no expert in this area but there is a case to be made, in my opinion, for Drogheda as the largest town with a population of 50,000 to have a testing centre within walking distance of those 50,000 people.  I will bring that opinion to the HSE.</p></speech>

There is also the related issue of the operationalising of the children's disability network teams in the same region.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900041#SS00600"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue and for giving me to the opportunity to respond.  I also thank the Deputy for putting this Topical Issue matter down for debate.  From the outset, I wish to acknowledge that there have been considerable challenges in certain parts of the country in the implementation of the PDS programme by the HSE.  This has resulted in delays for families to access much-needed therapies for their children.  I, of course, regret that and I wish to put on the record my sincerest apologies to any family experiencing such delays.  I have only just come off the telephone with the HSE and, as such, my script has changed.</p>  <p>  There are 12 teams in the area that the Deputy has mentioned in the south east.  These 12 teams are made up of one which is led by Enable Ireland, based in Kilkenny.  One is led by the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, which is for the Waterford south city location.  The other ten areas are led by the HSE, which comprise Carlow, Thomastown, Enniscorthy, Cashel, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Waterford north city, New Ross, Gorey and Wexford.  The whole-time-equivalent staff complement working within all of that area is 168.15.  There are vacancies there at present.  When I refer to vacancies, the Deputy should be aware that I am talking about people who are on maternity, sick or parental leave or shared time which is 40.  The number of complex needs children is 4,600.</p> <p>I refer to active recruitment in the context of 2021 and the funding I provided in phases 1 and 2 and the special schools.  It comes to 16.05 in terms of whole-time equivalent staff.  In that regard, staff have been recruited to only three of the new additional posts that I allocated to CHO 5.  That is not down to a lack of funding.  The funding is there.  Three staff have been recruited and there is a shortage of 13.05 whole-time equivalent staff.  In addition, 40 staff are on various types of leave.  That is a considerable number of individuals missing from key posts within the various groups.</p> <p> That is not to take away from the work being done at present.  I compliment the staff who are there on the front line and who have helped with delivering assessments of need in the past 12 months.  The reconfiguration took place on 27 September 2021.  For the three months beforehand, access was determined taking account of what was closest to your school or your address and families had a choice in all of that.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, because she brought to my attention that the access was not working and that on the Dungarvan side, for example, people were getting notified that they must choose a particular location.  We changed that to give parents the choice of closest to home or to the school.  That is an overshot from an operational point of view in terms of exactly where we are at this moment in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, model being rolled out in the south east.</p> <p> The recruitment is being progressed as a matter of urgency by the HSE national recruitment services, and directly in the case of section 39 lead agencies, to support network teams to optimise service delivery.  The area represented by the Deputy is in a fortunate position because ten of the teams are run by the HSE.  Only two of the teams are section 39 groupings.  The complete control, ownership, power, direction and sense of travel all rest completely with the HSE.  It knows exactly what the service level provision is.  It sends that in.  It is in control of the direction of travel.  This model of PDS is one it has designed and implemented and has been ongoing since 2014.  I have just finished a phone call with Gobnait N&iacute; Chrualao&iacute; of CoAction in Cork who was part and parcel of the setting up of it at the very beginning.  There is nothing new here for the HSE.  It is just that, as part of the reconfiguration, the transfer of files took longer than would have been optimal.  Communication has not been of the best quality but I am confident that now that we have reconfigured, communication will improve.</p></speech>

Any Deputies who understand changing structures know that doing so is very difficult and challenging and, obviously, trying to align staff under the new structures was always going to be a difficulty.  I certainly accept what the Minister of State has said in good faith.  However, I want to get to an important part of the scripted response circulated on her behalf.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Of the 100 additional development posts that were approved to strengthen Network Teams across the country in 2021, 13 were allocated to CHO5.  However, only 3 of those posts have been filled due to challenges in recruitment and due to staff preferences for work in other care group areas. </blockquote>  <p>We know there is a difficulty in the recruitment of staff in many areas of the HSE.  We are seeing it in the area of home helps as well.  The difficulty is obvious in the area of support staff and very important staff needed to roll out services for children with disabilities.  There are several issues that arise from that.</p><p>I met a group of parents from the south east last week.  They had mixed experiences.  Some were getting good services, while the services others were getting were not so good.  I found that the service level overall was very patchy, depending on where the person lived or the type of therapy his or her child was getting and possibly depending on availability.  The Minister of State referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  We met Finian McGrath when he was Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities several years ago regarding the need for additional speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other posts to ensure the capacity was there.  I am not sure that capacity was ever put in and I am not sure there is currently the capacity necessary to provide the services.  For all the talk of early intervention, it still does not happen for too many children.  What really concerns me is that the Minister of State's scripted speech notes there is a current waiting list of more than 1,000 children for ASD diagnostic assessments in the south east.  That is a very high figure.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right in respect of retention and recruitment and the challenges that exist in the context of trying to make disability attractive as a workplace.  This week, I met Mark Smyth of the Psychological Society of Ireland, who sent me a submission relating to various grades and preferences.  In fact, if there are more senior posts, it may be easier to attract and train in staff.  We also need to look at the panels.  I am sure the Deputy is considering that in his role as a member of the Opposition.  The panels have been in place for the past ten years and we have to question whether they are effective.</p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that it is predominantly a female workforce.  We need to start factoring in the fact that people are on maternity leave, paternity leave or extended leave.  That comes at a price of 40% over and above the baseline.  That is what we need to discuss.  Prior to the call with Gobnait N&iacute; Chrualao&iacute; I was on a call with Deborah Jacob of CHO 7.  We discussed the need to have relief panels booked with the HSE so that there are people with a rich skill set available to cover for staff on maternity leave and be put into one of the teams.  That would ensure consistency in the delivery of care and the continuation of that pathway and the level of clinical governance and oversight for the junior grades.  Deborah and her eight counterparts around the country would be in control and we would at all times be able to identify the needs and fill the gaps utilising a rich team of therapists within the gift of the HSE.</p>  <p>  To go back to the Deputy's final point in respect of the 1,000 children awaiting ASD diagnostic assessments, it is a priority for me.  Like the Deputy, I was very disappointed to see that figure this afternoon.</p></speech>

It is not an unfounded concern because many of these partnership companies, or local development companies as they are often called, bear the scars of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, process.  That programme was often the other arm of the partnership model.  I am mentioning partnership repeatedly because partnership was a response in the late 1980s and early 1990s to the problems that were happening in many communities.  It was a way of ensuring agencies such as the HSE, education and training boards and the Department of Social Protection, along with local politicians and the community could come together with business and the trade union movement to ensure we could respond to the needs in communities.  It is a model that did not come out of nowhere.  It did not arrive on our doorstep as some theory-based model.  It is a model that was championed by many people and is so important to communities.  I will speak about why that is so in a moment.</p>  <p>  The difficulty arises in the context of each Department seeking to comply with tendering processes and other measures.  I was present at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts this morning when the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection spoke about how these contracts are regarded as non-compliant procurement.  The difficulty is that as we start to ensure they all comply with tendering regulations,we are separating out the local decision making each of the partnerships is able to make.  That will strip away the flexibility in SICAP and local employment services.  It will move from a local service to a regional service and suddenly it will have lost all the benefits the partnership model had.</p>  <p>  I refer to the fears of local providers.  None of them has any difficulty tendering but they have doubts regarding the need to tender to comply with European regulations.  That is a legal issue.  When the Attorney General says something, I have to listen and the Government has to listen, but there are differing legal opinions on this issue.</p> <p> If we go though with the tendering process, we need to make sure that process recognises the expertise of many of the existing service providers and rewards them for it, compared with another company that does not have the same local knowledge.  The process must ensure there is a pay and fee structure that is not all about progressing people to employment, because that means the quality work cannot be done that often needs to be done with people who are exiting long-term unemployment.  We must make sure partnership bodies have the cash flow they might need to switch from the current system, in which they are paid per year, to one in which they would not be paid upfront but after the progression has been made.</p> <p> It is crucial that the ability to react locally to local issues is retained.  It must not, for example, be solely about referrals from the Department of Social Protection; there must be the ability to allow walk-in referrals as well.  We have seen how this type of local response is crucial in communities, which I will speak about after the Minister of State replies.  It is the backbone of what partnership is and the backbone of what these organisations do.  If we continue to nationalise, through contracts, the different models they provide, we open ourselves up to the allegation that some of us in government are ideologically focused on a particular way of delivering a service rather than on delivering for the community.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that existing service providers are concerned about the future contracting of public employment services and I look forward to discussing this issue with the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is procuring a regional employment service, RES, over two phases.  Phase 1 will see the new service commence in seven counties in the north west and midlands from January 2022.  Phase 2, to commence shortly, will roll out the RES model throughout the rest of the State.  This is a significant expansion of the State's public employment service capacity, with phase 2 services expected to commence from July 2022.  The RES will primarily engage with the long-term unemployed, particularly those furthest from the labour market.  When completed, the procurement will see the replacement of the local employment service, which currently services just eight counties in their entirety and another four counties partially, with a regional service covering all 26 counties.  This is a welcome and significant expansion of employment services, providing comprehensive engagement, for the first time, for those furthest from the labour marker throughout the State.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has signalled these changes for several years now, particularly since the publication of the 2018 Indecon reviews.  There has been continuous engagement with local development companies and other relevant stakeholders since 2018 by the Minister and her officials.  The latter have visited every single service provider in the State and the providers have understood for some time that the Department is changing how employment services are procured.  In addition, the Department frequently meets with the Irish Local Development Network and has had intensive discussions with it on these issues.  In early November, parties interested in tendering for the current phase were hosted by a Department webinar, involving more than 150 participants.  After a presentation on the procurement phases, questions were taken for more than an hour.  While the procurement process is competitive, in line with legal requirements, the numerous local and community bodies already supplying similar services on behalf of their communities will be well positioned to tender for the new lots and will, if successful, continue to deliver those services in their communities.</p>  <p>  The RES lots will remain on a county or bi-county basis, where feasible, and function on a sustainable basis to provide the most appropriate service for the long-term unemployed.  They will remain accessible and locally available services.  Just as local employment services sprang up in response to unemployment blackspots in the 1990s, the RES is being designed to respond to the challenges facing the Irish labour market today.  The key requirement in the request for tenders is quality of service in order to ensure that those who are long-term unemployed receive the quality service they deserve.  The procurement will ensure the State adopts best practices when it comes to engaging with those furthest from the labour market.  I have heard the same concerns that the Deputy expressed and I thank him for raising them.</p></speech>

I was disappointed to get a call from the Minister's private secretary only an hour ago to say she would not be able to take this debate.  To be fair to her, she has met with me and many other Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies to discuss this matter, about which there is grave concern.  The work of a Deputy from one of the parties in government is often done behind the scenes rather than here in the Chamber.  There are probably two instances in which we choose to raise matters in the House.  The first is when we want to put on the record the work we are doing and the second is when we feel we might be getting the cuddly meeting treatment, where one meets with the Minister but, afterwards, one is not quite sure whether anything has changed.  My fear is that we are getting a lot of consultation but I am not sure we are getting the change that is needed.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister of State's reassurances on the finances and regarding existing providers.  That is all very welcome and will go a long way to giving people reassurance on some of their concerns.  However, I am not seeing what I would prefer, which is an assurance that services will stay local.  I say that because a county-by-county provision would see Dublin city going from 11 different providers down to perhaps one to three.  Even five would be too few.  On the north side of Dublin, we have separate local employment services in Finglas and Ballymun as well as two covering the eastern side and the city centre.  The idea that those four areas would be reduced into one does not account for a scenario, for instance, where there is a crisis in Dublin Port and a company closes.  How could a regional service respond to that local need?  If there were a huge boom of employment because of construction - perhaps in the Ballymun area, where we hope to build lots of new homes on empty lands and where we are looking to recruit tradespeople - there would not be the local employment services in the community to direct people from local schools or the local labour supply.  If something like the Debenhams closure last year happened again, we would not have those local employment services in place to work with people who have lost their jobs.  I hear everything the Minister of State said but I am also still hearing the word "regional" rather than the word "local", which is the cause of my concern.</p></speech>

I would like to reiterate some key points.  The procurement process for the regional employment service is the outcome of a lengthy process of engagement and consultation with all existing service providers.  The tender will allow the Department of Social Protection to procure employment services on a legally sound basis and in line with best practices.  The RES will continue the delivery of accessible and local services.  With the exception of Dublin, the services are being procured on a county or bi-county basis.  Existing providers are well placed to submit quality competitive bids.  I am not sure whether there will be three or five providers in Dublin but I am sure we can get that confirmed.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the procurement has provided significant feedback for the Department, particularly around minimum referral numbers but also in regard to bringing clarity in respect of upfront payments and the front-loading of payment stages.  The Department has worked hard to eliminate barriers for existing local service providers, which have been encouraged to work together, where necessary, to form partnerships for tenders.  I understand the period after the publication of the request for tender will be longer than usual to facilitate the forging of such partnerships.  Ultimately, the focus is on providing a quality service to the long-term unemployed.  The bids submitted in phase 2 will be evaluated on the basis of their quality and the tenderer's ability to access a wide range of local supports and services that best meet their clients' specific needs.  For successful tenderers, they will have more long-term contracts, greater freedom to manage their service and the capacity to be properly assessed for their performance.  The new service will have a strong local focus and its fee structure will be heavily weighted towards client engagement.  The Minister for Social Protection and her Department will continue to engage with the sector and listen to its concerns right up until the publication of the request for tender later this month.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900044#VV00200"><p>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  T&aacute;im chun m'am a roinnt le mo chomhghleacaithe.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak alongside my colleague Deputy Patricia Ryan on the Second Stage debate of our Bill.  I might say a few words on what motivated us to table it, why it is necessary and how it will improve the regulation of tender bids for capital works.  We are firmly of the opinion that, if enacted, it will improve value for money for the taxpayer when it comes to large capital projects.</p>  <p>  It is no secret this State often encounters significant problems in getting value for money for large capital projects, which can often arise from poor regulation.  Most people will be aware the new national children's hospital is expected to be the most expensive hospital in the world, given its latest estimated final cost is &euro;2 billion, having run over cost by well over 100%.  The national broadband plan has also proved a fiasco, with its latest estimated cost standing at &euro;3 billion, a cost overrun of approximately 500%.</p>  <p>  This is by no means a recent phenomenon.  In 1999, the national road improvement works for the likes of motorways, primary roads and the M50 was completed.  It began with an estimated cost of &euro;7 billion but its final cost was more than double that, at &euro;15.5 billion, a cost overrun of 125%.  In 2005, the Luas green line cross-city extension was completed at a final cost of &euro;991 million, just shy of the &euro;1 billion mark, and its initial cost was estimated at &euro;358 million, meaning it ran over cost by 161%.  One year later, the Dublin Port tunnel was completed and, aside from the poor planning that meant it is unable to take the largest trucks coming to and from the port, it ran over cost by &euro;295 million, or 65%.  Four years later, Dublin Airport terminal 2 was completed having overshot the mark by &euro;139 million.  I could go on but I think we get the point.</p>  <p>  Cost overruns can arise, as we know, from a wide range of factors.  There can be poor planning on the part of the contracting authority or the contractor, litigation arising from contractual disputes, poor performance in the management of risks and so on, but poor value for the taxpayer can also arise for more nefarious reasons.  We can take the issue of bid-rigging, a form of price-fixing behaviour by which firms co-ordinate their bids to maintain high prices, which is a serious issue.  The Government recently acknowledged that with the introduction of its competition (amendment) Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  The Bill that Deputy Ryan and I have tabled is designed to target another source of cost overruns, namely, those arising from the issue of abnormally low tender bids in the procurement process for capital works.  These abnormally low bids are sometimes referred to as lowball offers and they can be one contributor, albeit a significant one, to cost overruns.  In practice, these abnormally low bids are often a result of a contractor submitting a very low bid.  In the case of the building of a school or hospital, for example, given the heavy focus on lowest price criteria in this State, a contracting authority may choose the lowest offer believing it to be the best value for money.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, the contract may then run over cost, leading to poor value for money for the taxpayer.  This is something the T&aacute;naiste himself has acknowledged is a serious problem, when he stated, "... some companies [are] lowballing, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract and then coming back with claims thereafter."</p>  <p>  Another angle to the Bill concerns a matter that is quite topical and that must be dealt with in as a timely a fashion as possible, namely, the issue of bogus self-employment.  The Committee of Public Accounts has been dealing with this issue in depth and our Bill will help to tackle one aspect of this kind of fraud.  A great deal of bogus self-employment takes place in the construction sector.  If, for instance, a contractor misclassifies a significant number of its workers as self-employed, it will dodge the employer PRSI and other obligations and reduce the overall labour cost.  This means the contractor could submit an abnormally low bid and win the competition for the contract.</p>  <p>  As for how our Bill would address these issues, the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016, which govern this area, allow for bids that are abnormally low to be excluded from the process.  That legislation does not, however, define an "abnormally low bid", which means strong subjectivity is involved and contracting authorities can, understandably, be hesitant to exclude contractors from the process.</p>  <p>  Our Bill will enact a new objective criterion such that, where four or more tender bids are submitted for a public works contract or a works contract of contract value equal to or more than the EU threshold value, a bid that is more than 15% below the adjusted average will be considered abnormally low and rejected if it cannot be adequately explained to the contracting authority.  If a contractor makes an abnormally low bid for a contract, thus claiming it can complete the contract at a significantly lower cost than its competitors, it must explain to the contracting authority how this is achievable.  If the contracting authority does not receive a reasonable explanation for the abnormally low bid submitted, it will be rejected and the contractor disqualified from the procurement process.  The contracting authority should record the reason for rejection and submit it to the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also ensure that poor performance in prior public contracts will be grounds for exclusion from participation in procurement procedure.  Where these contractors have shown significant or persistent deficiencies or failures in the performance of public contracts, the contracting authority, such as the local authority, should record the reasons for the rejection and submit them to the OGP.  The State needs to improve regulatory oversight and enforcement when it comes to certain aspects of public procurement, a view backed up by a number of studies by the likes of the World Bank, Transparency International and the OECD.  The OGP does not provide a regulatory function and contracting authorities often lack the capacity to carry this out themselves, which is why legislation is needed in this regard.</p>  <p>  This legislation is reasonable and desirable and would lead to better value for the taxpayer in the context of large capital projects and the cost overruns that often arise.  It will also help to tackle one aspect of bogus self-employment.  We often hear the Government talk of fiscal prudence - it has become something of a watchword - but it seems to do little to tighten regulations that would ensure the prudent fiscal management of the public finances regarding procurement.  While the OGP has no regulatory function, the interim procurement reform board that has been established is not on a statutory footing and thus is limited in what it can do.</p>  <p>  That makes legislation in this regard all the more important.  Deputy Ryan and myself are presenting a simple and clear-cut measure that could help tackle abnormally bids, or lowball offers as they are more commonly known.  The legislation is reasonable and will give guidance in the form of an objective criterion about what should be deemed to be an abnormally low bid.  Without it, that is an extremely difficult matter to assess and we must ask contracting authorities to do it.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will also allow the contractor to explain its abnormally low bid.  It might be the case that the bid is in fact fair and the contractor might have a reason for how low it is.  For example, it may have devised some innovative industrial process or gained access to cheaper materials.  We are not saying that just because it is an abnormally low bid, we should not take it, but it is important we have information on why it is low.  The contractor may have found a more effective way of doing business and, therefore, its bid could still be permitted.  Crucially, however, it will also allow poor performance in prior public contracts to be a ground for a contractor to be excluded from participation in a procurement procedure for capital works.</p>  <p>  In light of the scandals there have been, and of companies wilfully and recklessly dodging their PRSI obligations, are these the kinds of companies we want to win public contracts?  Surely not.  I urge the Minister of State and all Deputies to support the Bill.</p></speech>

It is a short and relatively simple Bill which will have far-reaching effects and will result in large savings for the public purse.  Judging by reports in this weekend's <i>Mail on Sunday</i>, it is a very timely Bill.  Apparently, a number of unforeseen delays have contributed to an increase of almost 40% in the cost of providing motorway infrastructure and the bypass of Sallins, County Kildare.  The M7 widening scheme, the Sallins bypass and the Osberstown interchange, junction 9A, have cost approximately &euro;85.5 million, an increase of nearly &euro;24 million over the original contract figure.  An Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell spoke about the national children's hospital.  Some experts believe the final cost could be as high as &euro;2.4 billion, an enormous 500% increase.</p><p>Successive Governments have been careless with public money by allowing such overspends to happen and this needs to change.  The Bill will ensure that poor past performance in public contracts would be grounds for exclusion from participation in future tenders for procurement procedure.  The current legislation governing public procurement, the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016, allows for bids which are considered abnormally low.  An Teachta Mair&eacute;ad Farrell spoke at length on this.  We are asking that they be excluded from the process.  However, the legislation contains the definition of what an abnormally low bid is.</p><p>The Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2021 will establish that abnormally low tender bids for capital works that have a contract equal to or above the EU threshold for public works would be regulated and disqualified if their lower level breaches a new objective base and cannot be adequately explained to the contracting authority.  There are other aspects to the Bill which I will leave to my colleagues to raise given the limited time available.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900045#WW00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I commend Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Patricia Ryan on introducing it.  There are a number of issues with tenders and contracts.  Some construction companies will submit exceptionally low bids just to secure a contract.  That leads to a chain of events.  Often in the middle of a project the contractor will then come back looking for more cash.  It cannot be moved off-site easily.  There are some good examples of major contracts not too far from this building where contractors cannot be moved.  It is not possible to demobilise them and remobilise another construction company on-site.  There are difficulties with getting companies to finish the works of a previous contractor.  Construction companies that bid too low with an unrealistic price through lack of professionalism or not having the competence to assess the project properly should also raise red flags.  The definition set out in the Bill is a serious attempt to put some shape on this so that we do not fall into these situations on major public contracts.</p>  <p>  Exceptionally low prices can also lead to shoddy workmanship.  Following work on the school bundles, the taxpayer had to go in and pick it up because there was nobody on-site checking to see if the bricklayers put metal wall ties in between each second row of blocks.  These ties work out at about 9 cent each but they were not dropped in because nobody was there watching them, which was shoddy workmanship.  The work then had to be redone.</p>  <p>  Past performance is very important and I welcome that it has been specified in the Bill.  We should be able to consider poor performance in the past.  Too often public contracts have gone out to firms where there are red flags because of their previous track record.  Where a company has no track record, its competence now needs to be seriously assessed.  The Bill addresses those points.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell mentioned some of the other consequences of this, including bogus self-employment.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have seen more than enough examples of bogus self-employment in the past 15 months in a range of areas but particularly in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  We need to move on further than this.  Sometimes Ministers throw their hands up and say they cannot do anything about it.  When we are spending taxpayers' money, we should not just get the job done but get the best public and social good out of it along the way.  We need to insert provisions insisting that companies pay the living wage.  That is what the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister in the North has done.  The T&aacute;naiste often challenges Sinn F&eacute;in to do this, that and the other in the North - things over which we have no control and which are set down by the diktat of the Tory government.  However, where we have the control, we are doing it.</p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Minister up there stepped up to the plate and has insisted that for any public contract works the company must pay the living wage.  Workers should be getting proper overtime rates.  The rights of workers to join a trade union must be recognised.  We cannot have the misclassification of workers as bogus self-employed when they are really employees.  Numerous people have come to me in the last three or four years about this.  Bogus self-employment is a big scandal and it needs to be stopped.</p>  <p>  I welcomed this Bill as a step in the right direction to deal with the issue of below-cost contracts which lead to many of the issues we have just raised.  I welcome that consideration of past performance is central to the Bill.  Often the Government will stop our Bills just for the sake of stopping them or bury them at a committee.  If there is a good idea, it does not matter who it comes from and whether it comes from the right, left or centre, or whether the Government likes the party it comes from.  If an idea a good, we should embrace it.  That is what leads to a successful society.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to take the Bill on board and hopefully we can progress it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900045#WW00300"><p>I thank Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Patricia Ryan, the proposers of the Bill.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the subject of abnormally low tenders and poor past performance in the procurement of public works contracts.  The Bill is well intended and seeks to address the issue that arises on public works tenders from time to time where a contractor will bid low to win the contract and seek to recover its costs through claims under the contract.</p>  <p>  The Government, having considered and reflected on the proposals in the Bill has decided to oppose it on two grounds.  First, the provisions to exclude abnormally low tenders and tenderers for poor past performance already exist in the regulations that govern the award of public contracts, and, second, the proposals may have an adverse impact on the award of public works contracts.</p>  <p>  The Government has significant concerns about the Bill's potential impact on the ability of the State to seek value for money on all projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the national development plan and the implications for Ireland of the Bill with respect to EU public procurement directives.</p>  <p>  Public procurement is governed by EU legislation and national rules and guidelines with the aim of promoting an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime, which delivers best value for money.  The measures proposed in the Bill seek to modify those, which are already provided for under the 2016 European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations.</p>  <p>  The capital works management framework, CWMF, is the tool a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the national development plan.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has introduced amendments to the public works contracts in the interest of improving tender outcomes.  This work will continue in the ongoing review of the capital works management framework.</p>  <p>  The measures already introduced include the following.  Fully measured bills of quantities are required for those projects which use the traditional contract type.  This measure increases the focus of the design team in preparing more comprehensive design information that can be accurately measured for pricing purposes.  With a comprehensive price breakdown, it is easier to identify abnormally low pricing strategies.  A mechanism to directly tender specialist works was also introduced so that these critical work elements are priced directly by the specialist, thus reducing the extent of the contract sum for which the main contractor has overall price responsibility.</p>  <p>  A review of construction procurement policy is under way and will deliver significant changes to the capital works management framework over the coming years.  One of the work streams identified as part of the review is performance evaluation.  Engagement will take place with industry on developing robust key performance indicators as part of this work stream in 2022.</p>  <p>  The reform of the public procurement function is driven by the need to obtain value for public money in procuring goods, services and works.  It is essential that value for money is not adversely affected and projects are not delayed by arbitrary formulas and onerous administrative and reporting procedures that go beyond the provisions already set down in the national regulations transposed from the EU procurement directives.</p>  <p>  There is a balance to be struck in deciding to award a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome.</p> <p>From the perspective of a public body's duty to taxpayers, it can be difficult to justify a decision to reject the lowest price as being out of hand, particularly in circumstances where the contractor who has bid the price is willing to undertake the project.</p> <p> I will now discuss the Government's concerns in respect of the proposals within the Bill.  In order to avail of the long-standing provisions, as set down in the EU procurement directives for dealing with abnormally low tenders, it is vital that projects are adequately defined so that a proper analysis of the constituent elements of the project can be undertaken.  The existing regulations already impose a duty on contracting authorities that require economic operators to explain the price or cost proposed where the tenders seem abnormally low regarding works, supplies and services.  When investigating what appears to be an abnormally low tender, contracting authorities must take into consideration the possibility that the tenderer may be obtaining terms that are more favourable from suppliers and subcontractors than rival tenderers.  A contracting authority is not obliged to reject an abnormally low tender except where it is established that the tender is abnormally low because it does comply with relevant labour, social and environmental law.  In that case, it must be rejected.  The Bill does not address this aspect and if enacted, it may conflict with this important provision of EU procurement law.</p> <p> Guidance on abnormally low tenders is published by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, under the capital works management framework, CWMF, and in the public procurement guidelines for goods and services.  The CWMF guidance on abnormally low tenders applies to all contract values above and below the EU thresholds, and is included in all CWMF instructions to tenderers templates.</p> <p> The provisions in section 2 seek to define an abnormally low tender where no such definition exists in the regulations or in the EU directives.  It defines an abnormally low tender as a tender that is 15% lower than the adjusted average of the tenders received.  The adjusted average is the average of all tender prices provided excluding the highest tender price.  The arbitrary nature of the definition may have unintended consequences given the range of tender prices that can arise on some works tenders.  While it is fair to say prices may be received that are below pre-tender estimate, prices well in excess of that estimate may also be received.  It also raises the question as to whether the operation must be repeated should a tender identified as abnormally low is rejected, and perhaps lead to further rejections as the average value increases depending on the range of tender prices.</p> <p> In common with existing regulations, a contracting authority is not obliged to exclude a tender that is identified as abnormally low.  However, the provisions in section 2 would force a contracting authority to engage with the tenderer and, in so doing, would have to disclose the other prices received as part of the tender in order to explain to the tenderer why his or her tender was identified as abnormally low.  In accordance with the principle of equal treatment, that information would then have to be shared with all tenderers, which may raise questions with respect to broader competition in the market.  Under the existing regulations, the price of the successful tenderer is only required to be disclosed upon the publication of the contract award notice, which must be no later than 30 days after the contract is awarded.</p> <p> The Bill also caters for situations where fewer than four tenders are received.  However, the provisions proposed in subsections (2) and (3) leave it to the discretion of the contracting authority, or on the basis of professional advice, to determine whether a tender is abnormally low.  The term "discretion" is problematic.  It is not found in the existing regulations and would leave the contracting authority open to a challenge on the grounds that there had been a breach of the principles of transparency and equal treatment.</p> <p> The view of the Government is that the Bill may drive tender prices higher than might otherwise be bid, as contractors seek to avoid the examination that follows identification of an abnormally low tender based on the formula proposed.  It may disadvantage smaller contractors who may be able to offer lower prices than their larger competitors.  It may significantly delay the award of a contract, and it may give rise to procurement challenges both from those whose tenders are rejected and who believe a tender should have been rejected.</p> <p> It is not clear how the role of the chief procurement officer in the OGP, as proposed in the Bill, will fit with the public spending code and devolved authority to accounting officers.  There are provisions for oversight of capital projects in the public spending code, and it is a matter for the contracting authority and the approving authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the code.</p> <p> Section 4 permits a contracting authority to exclude a tenderer where the economic operator has shown significant or persistent deficiencies or failures in the performance of a prior public contract.  The existing regulations already contain this provision and, crucially, the Bill does not require evidence of that poor performance.  The regulations require poor past performance to be demonstrated through the early termination of a prior public contract, damages or a comparable sanction.  This is a key balancing provision to ensure a contracting authority may not abuse its position.  The proposed section 4, therefore, extends the contracting authority's power to exclude tenderers beyond the parameters in Article 57(4)(g) of the EU Directive 2014/24 on procurement and, to this extent, is unlikely to be permitted under EU law.  The key to the successful deployment of this provision is consistent contract administration and the application of the sanctions that are already available under the public works contract to address poor performance.  A contractor may not be excluded simply because he or she raised claims or adopted an adversarial approach under a prior contract.</p> <p> The Bill refers only to works procured under the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations as transposed from EU Directive 2014/24.  There is no reference to works procured under the utilities directive or concessions directives.</p> <p> Ambiguity in the project requirements can easily result in a price that may adequately cover the tenderer's interpretation of the tender documents, but may not necessarily align with the contracting authority's expectations.  The formula approach set out in section 2 may impact upon innovation, particularly in a design and build tender where there is real scope for innovation from a construction point of view.  The formula approach may result in a tender being categorised as abnormally low that is well considered and very efficient to build, meets the brief and output specification and is generally cheaper to build.  Whilst it may pass the test set out in section 3(1)(a) and-or (c), meaning it does not have to be rejected, it will nonetheless have been identified as potentially being an abnormally low tender leaving the decision of the contracting authority to award the contract open to challenge from other tenderers.</p> <p> The Bill, which deals with how the State regulates for abnormally low tenders for construction works with a contract value equal to or above the EU threshold for public works, and poor past performance to be grounds for exclusion from participation in a procurement procedure, has not undergone a regulatory impact assessment.  It places an additional administrative burden on contracting authorities and the chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement.</p> <p> The Government appreciates the intention behind the Bill.  However, for the reasons I have outlined, the Government has significant concerns regarding the Bill's potential impact on the ability of the State to seek value for money on all projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the national development plan and the implications of the Bill for Ireland with respect to EU public procurement directives.  I thank Members for the opportunity to address them on this.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his response, and I thank especially Deputy Farrell and her colleagues for taking the time to construct a thoughtful and well considered Bill that is designed to address the issue colloquially known as low-balling.</p>  <p>  I accept the Minister of State and the Department are making efforts to improve the procurement situation and the management framework for major projects.  It is fair to say that some lessons have been learned from the catastrophe, in the context of public expenditure, that is the national children's hospital and the national broadband process farrago.  Have the Government's interventions gone far enough?  It is arguable that they have not.</p>  <p>  The Bill attempts to address some of the inadequacies inherent in the system.  It is crucially important that those inadequacies are addressed in the context of the vast sums of taxpayers' money, derived from the hard work of the citizens of Ireland, that will be deployed in delivering the &euro;140 billion national development plan over a period of ten years.</p> <p>Never were value for money, transparency in public tendering and delivering on tenders for critical public infrastructure more important than they are now.  Over the years, tenderers and contractors have, quite frankly, taken the State for a ride.  They have routinely added fat to contracts, safe in the knowledge that, if they came in with a lowball tender way below what anyone would consider a reasonable price for a job, they would get the job and could then come calling again to say that they did not have sufficient resources to compete the job and the State would ask how much was needed and when it could put the money in their bank account.  I am summarising the course of events, but that has been the case.  It has been quite typical of situations we have seen over the years.<br/><br/>In fairness, the Bill presents a considered approach to the problem.  If we do not address the question of lowballing in tendering and procurement in a comprehensive way, we will end up paying a very heavy price.  There will be a cost to the State.  This will not only be a financial cost, but a cost in terms of the underdevelopment of the critical infrastructure we need to make our economy and society work.  There will also be a critical cost in respect of the State meeting its climate mitigation and adaptation targets.  We are in trouble on that count, as the Minister of State will know from the report the Climate Change Advisory Council published yesterday.<br/><br/>I am very interested in section 2 and the way in which the Bill seeks to address that particular issue, which is that a red light goes off when it becomes clear that a tender is way of the radar.  I know there are structures within the Department to examine abnormally low tenders but nobody could say that they are effective enough.  Section 2 of this Bill tries to go a little bit further and to enhance and improve the system as it relates to the examination of those issues.  The Minister of State mentioned that it is a requirement under the current code of practice in the Department to examine absurdly or abnormally low tenders.  It is the case that there is a requirement to reject tenders that do not comply with social, environmental or labour law or regulation.  However, while this is theoretically true, it has not always been put into practice.  We know that from direct experience.  I know that from speaking to the constituents I represent and my trade union colleagues.  I have been raising this issue time and time again, <i>ad nauseam</i>, for as long as I have been in these Houses.<br/><br/>I will now address one of the key issues, which was referenced by colleagues in their earlier contributions.  This is the issue of bogus self-employment and the misrepresentation of the reality of the employment relationships of construction workers.  That goes to the absolute core of this problem.  While the Minister of State may say that labour law must be complied with, the reality is that the practice of bogus self-employment is not, in itself, unlawful in this country.  It is undesirable and not something that should be tolerated, but it is tolerated.  I will go further and say that, in some respects, the gaps in our law encourage the practice.<br/><br/>I introduced legislation in the Seanad in 2017 in respect of the misclassification of someone's employment status and the misrepresentation of its true nature and my colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, introduced legislation with a similar intent this year.  The 2017 Bill was rejected out of hand when it was quite routine, under the guise of the so-called new politics, that much-derided term, to simply send Bills to the place where Bills go to die with the promise that Government would consider them at some point in the distant future.  However, the Government at that time made a point of voting against the Bill in question on Second Stage.  I find that curious because the reality is that there is only one winner when it comes to the phenomenon of bogus self-employment, that is, dodgy and bad bosses.<br/><br/>The truth is that the phenomenon of bogus self-employment cheats the State by way of lost PRSI and income tax revenue.  Because the employment status of workers is deliberately misclassified, their entitlements under the social protection system are affected.  Misclassifying the employment status of their workers enables dodgy contractors to win contracts but it leaves those workers in a tremendously invidious situation as regards their employment rights and social benefits, including holiday leave, sick leave and so on.  This issue is at the core of the problem, which is why I am dwelling on it in the context of the Bill before us.  It is real problem.  I have made attempts to ensure that those who are caught up in these insidious practices are protected and that the true reality of their relationships with their de facto employers are recognised properly.<br/><br/>The contractors operating these kinds of systems should be subject to the full force of the law.  That is why the legislation which I and my colleagues introduced sought to describe employers who are involved in these kinds of practices as tax cheats and to ensure they were treated as such.  If you decide to tender for a contract with the Department of Transport, you need a tax clearance certificate.  You need a clean bill of health from that point of view.  It is high time that we started treating employment rights and the phenomenon of bogus self-employment in the same way.  The Minister of State is right that, theoretically, if a contractor does not comply with social, labour or environmental laws he or she will not be considered for a contract, but the situation is somewhat different in practice.<br/><br/>This goes back to the very grey area of bogus self-employment.  I had reasons for establishing the sectoral employment order system back in 2015, a system which is operating in the construction sector.  One of the reasons was that I wanted to ensure a level playing pitch with regard to labour costs for all of those decent contractors who were applying for various tenders in the normal way, through the procurement process.  Those decent employers are being undercut all the time by people who are engaged in dodgy practices.  It is simply not good enough.  It is not something this Government, or any government, should stand over.<br/><br/>We are not going to be able to deliver the national development plan or to successfully award the kinds of contracts the Department wishes to under that plan if we do not have a sufficient number of skilled building workers to deliver the projects.  The Minister of State should mark my words: we need to deal with the issue of bogus self-employment.  We know from our own experience on the ground that, while the number of apprentices is improving, there are families across the country who have been tradespeople for generations but who will not encourage their own sons or daughters to get involved in the building sector because of the phenomenon of bogus self-employment.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recently concluded that we need approximately 30,000 additional building workers in this country.  There is no chance whatsoever that we will achieve that target if we do not deal with the fundamental issue affecting that sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900047#YY00200"><p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, I commend Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Patricia Ryan for bringing forward this timely, well-drafted legislation.  The Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2021 would ensure that some of the problems that have arisen from the gross mismanagement of projects such as the national children's hospital, mismanagement that we are, unfortunately, all too familiar with, does not happen again.</p> <p>This legislation provides specifically for two important regulations.  It would put in place a system for identifying abnormally low tenders and then disqualifying them from the selection process for a public contract, if the contractor cannot provide a credible explanation for its bid and how it would be achieved.  This is vital, as abnormally low tenders are warning signs of contractors lowballing bids, with a likely consequence of cost escalation further down the line.  Unfortunately, we have had far too many examples of this in our State.  Who picks up the tab in these cases?  Unfortunately, it is the Irish taxpayers.</p> <p> Section 2 provides for the mechanism for identifying abnormally low tenders for public work contracts.  These mechanisms are robust, work successfully in other jurisdictions and offer clear guidance for Departments and contracting authorities.</p> <p> Section 3 allows for the regulation and disqualification of abnormally low tenders.  If a tender bid is identified as abnormally low and if an explanation from the contractor fails to adequately demonstrate how the price could be delivered, the contracting authority would then disqualify it.  It will also put in place a system for identifying and disqualifying contractors that have shown significant and persistent deficiencies in prior public contracts.  That is a crucial section and provision in this Bill.</p> <p> Section 4 allows for the contracting authority to exclude those contractors who have ripped off the State and shown consistent deficiencies in previous public contracts.  Both of these regulations would have gone some way towards protecting the taxpayer and the State from the debacle at the heart of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, NCH, and would put in place a robust system to safeguard the public purse and to deliver capital projects at cost.  The fact that neither the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, nor, indeed, any Minister in the Cabinet, including the Minister of State sitting opposite me, can tell the Houses of the Oireachtas at this stage in 2021 the cost of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital speaks loudly as to why it is so crucial that this legislation, drafted by the Deputies I mentioned, is debated and enacted in this House.</p> <p> It is worth noting that this Bill simply enforces regulations already provided for in EU regulations on the awarding of public contracts.  Governments, now and in the past, have abjectly failed to implement these regulations, with no evidence that any circulars or guidance notes have been issued from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to Departments or contracting authorities on their provision.  These regulations are in place in the North, however, and with some considerable success.  Indeed, these regulations are implemented by the Department of Finance there, under my party colleague, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Conor Murphy.  I also welcome the announcement by the Executive in the North that it has approved and awarded a living wage.  Unlike here, that means that all those employed in the public sector and Civil Service in the North will be provided with a living wage.  Not only that, those who provide ancillary services to those buildings must also be paid a living wage.</p> <p> Furthermore, that provision includes all public contracts awarded in the North.  I mention this aspect to the Minister of State because the money we spend on public contracts can be used for greater social good.  In the North, all winning tenderers for public contracts will now have to show that they are also living wage employers.  In April 2019, in a response to a parliamentary question tabled by my party, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, informed us that no economic operator had been disqualified since 2014 on the grounds of abnormally low bidding.  I ask the current holder of that portfolio to update us in respect of whether that is still the case for every Department.  This legislation would sharpen how and to whom we award public contracts and, crucially, it would defend the Irish taxpayer in the process.  Similarly, I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to inform the D&aacute;il of how many economic operators have been disqualified from a tender process on the grounds of poor past performance.  I am sure that there are many who should be struck off as a result.  </p> <p> Successive Governments have destroyed public confidence in the ability of the State to deliver capital projects on time and on budget due to a history of overruns.  Unfortunately, we are seeing the debacle of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital reopened, with the information given to this House simply being either misleading or untrue.  We also now see that the consortium has very little skin in the game in respect of the national broadband plan, NBP.  It has only put &euro;500,000 of investment into the project and only &euro;2 million in equity, as opposed to &euro;220 million.  The &euro;98 million is made up of loans.  Crucially as well, the commitments and assurances that the Irish taxpayers were given by Ministers, through this House, that no money would be expended by the taxpayer until milestones had been achieved and the full equity had been put in is simply not true and does not now hold up to scrutiny.  Indeed, we see that the Minister of State&rsquo;s party colleague has actually allowed that contractor to take the &euro;20 million, was a reserve and a confidence provision for the taxpayer, and draw it down.  We also know, through the Minister, that significant amounts of taxpayers' money have been put into this project without the full equity being installed and, crucially, the Government has also allowed the company to draw down taxpayers' money without a single home being connected to the scheme.  That really sums up all of what is wrong regarding the awarding of public contracts and the need for this legislation, drawn up by Deputies Patricia Ryan and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, to be taken on by the Government and supported.  It can be tweaked, if need be, on Committee Stage, as we do with all legislation, and then enshrined in law.</p> <p> The State has a history of overruns with public contracts.  For example, the Dublin Port Tunnel involved an overrun of 160% on its initial budget.  It was a total of &euro;500 million of an overrun.  The construction of the first Luas lines had an overrun of 289% and a budget cost to the tune of &euro;600 million.  As I mentioned, the national broadband plan project has seen the cost rise from an initial &euro;500 million to almost six times that in official estimates, at a reported cost of &euro;3 billion.  Yet, we cannot afford HEPA filters in our schools or free antigen tests.  The Government is opposing this Bill, but, by God, this is about saving not millions of euro but potentially billions of euro for Irish taxpayers in the future.  The Government will still try to find holes in and poke at this legislation.</p> <p> The National Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s is the largest capital investment project ever undertaken in Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system.  Since the project was established, the estimated cost of this investment has doubled.  In 2013, the estimated budget for construction was &euro;790 million and the latest estimate now is &euro;1.9 billion, with the Minister unable or unwilling to give an updated figure.  That is actually a laughable situation.  We have a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that cannot tell us the cost of the biggest healthcare contract awarded in the history of the State.  Seriously, there is something wrong here.  Go into any primary school and talk to fifth or six class students and they would tell us that we have a problem with this contract if we have a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that cannot tell us what the ultimate cost of this project will be.  We have a problem with how we award contracts and with how they are designed, and those are problems that this legislation can start to deal with.</p> <p> This legislation is about enforcing regulations that will deliver value for money for the taxpayer and protect the taxpayer by ensuring that economic operators that perform badly and that fail to deliver on quality, on time and within budget can be disqualified from future contracts.  It would also provide that companies that lowball bids with the intention of ramping up costs down the line can be identified and disqualified.  The taxpayer should be defended.  That is what this legislation is about and that is what Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Patricia Ryan are doing here.  This legislation is concerned with ensuring that value for money should be delivered and this Bill should be supported by everyone in this House.  This legislation will go some way towards remedying the incompetence that we have witnessed in public project delivery and it will protect the taxpayer.</p></speech>

It would also specifically address the issues of lowball tenders and bogus self-employment within its remit.  It is disappointing for the Minister of State to say that the Government is going to oppose this Bill.  The Government&rsquo;s record on provision in this area is nothing to boast about.  He cannot stand there and tell us that everything is all right and that the Government has this issue under control.  It was said that the Government has significant concerns regarding the Bill's potential impact on the ability of the State to seek value for money on all projects.  I do not know what to say about that.  Whoever wrote that speech for the Minister of State has some neck</p> <p>These lowball tenders turn out to be wrecking balls for the taxpayer and the economy.  We only have to look at the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan to see the carnage that is inflicted on the public finances.  That carnage is felt in the personal lives of workers, carers and families.  Every few million in cost overruns on the lowball tenders are a few million snatched away from neurology, housing, mental health, special education or from the residential respite that our carers need just to keep on living.</p> <p> I had questions down to the Minister for Transport on the overruns in my constituency in Sallins in respect of the widening of a section of the N4 as my Kildare colleague, Deputy Ryan, has already noted.  We are at &euro;23 million in overruns now and counting, which is 40% of the original price.  We have to look at our record here.  The sum of &euro;23 million is an awful lot of nurses in Naas General Hospital, if we are going to talk about nurses' salaries.  It is an awful lot of psychologists or special education places, an awful lot of houses and an awful lot of silent nights for the families looking for respite and who are at the end of their tether.</p> <p> Too often these lowball tenders are not only a false economy but also an exploitation of the public good and of the workers who are employed or, more correctly, bogusly self-employed.  Bogus self-employment is a blight on our workers and our economy.  It is accurately described as a corruption by the tireless campaigner and whistleblower, Martin McMahon of the Tortoise Shack podcasts.  Bogus self-employment allows companies to come in low and continue acting low, in fact, to act in the lowest way possible by devouring all the benefits of profit while spitting out the workers who made it for them.  By telling workers not to look to them for PRSI contributions, that the workers are on their tod and self-employed, those companies have all the rights to our public money but no responsibilities to their workers whose taxes actually fund that public purse.  Alongside the exploitation of our workers by wealth funds and cuckoo funds, bogus self-employment is right up there.  It is socially repulsive and perverse.</p> <p> This Bill will set out to make it anything but normal for hard-working people in a modern democratic society.  If a company cannot explain why it is coming in at 15% below the others, it would be "thanks but no thanks" to them, for a change.  For the sake of the public and our workers and the way it should be, I challenge the Minister of State if he is saying he is going to oppose this Bill and I hope he will have a rethink.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-09a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900049#AAA00200"><p>I thank the Deputies.  I will address one or two of the points raised.  Deputy Farrell raised the question of cost overruns.  They are real and on particular projects there have been some dramatic overruns which have been the subject of investigations.  We can learn from those and make sure we do not repeat them in the future.  It has to be borne in mind that when we are comparing the cost agreed and the actual cost outturn, we need to compare the irrevocable contract price that was signed on the tender, not the price that was discussed by project proposers years earlier at the start of the process.  Sometimes a road might be proposed for &euro;100 million but by the time it goes to tender and goes through everything, it is signed at &euro;500 million and comes in at &euro;600 million.  That is an overrun of &euro;100 million.  The final cost can be compared with whatever was the imaginary, guessed price before the contracts come in, but nobody knows what a project really costs until the bids have come in under tender.  That is not to say that cost overruns do not happen.  They do.</p>  <p>  Deputy Farrell is looking for new objective criteria for what is an abnormally low tender.  There is a problem if we are saying that the contracting authority can use its discretion to decide what an abnormally low tender is, particularly where there is a small number of bids.  That is not an objective way to go about it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Nash talked about the problem of bogus self-employment, as did Deputy Cronin.  Bogus self-employment is dealt with under the public works contracts.  Contractors who are not complying with employment law may have deductions applied to their payments under the contract.  Enforcement of labour laws is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission.  Public works contracts require the contractor to retain extensive records with regard to payments to all workers engaged on site.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley talked about companies with no track record winning bids.  This Bill does not address that, however.  What this Bill addresses is poor past performance.  We are limited by European law in how we can exclude people for poor past performance.  The limit is that we can exclude somebody who bids for a contract if they have poor past performance, but only where we have direct evidence of it.  For example, has the company been convicted of non-compliance with contract?  Is there a judgment against it?  Where it is simply a case that it was a nightmare to work with that contractor and we were constantly fighting with them, we cannot exclude them under European law.  If it was private procurement, we would.  If I previously had painters in and had been fighting with them all the time, I would not hire them to paint my house a second time.  However, under public procurement we are obliged to be non-discriminatory and not to exclude people unless we have actual evidence that they have underperformed.</p>  <p>  I outlined in my earlier contribution the issues that the Government has identified with the Bill.  The existing regulations already contain carefully balanced provisions drafted in the context of the rights and obligations of both contracting authorities and economic operators.  The Bill seeks to shift that balance, which may not necessarily result in a better outcome for the economic operator, the contracting authority or indeed the taxpayer.  Also it is not clear how the oversight role of the chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, proposed in the Bill will fit with the public spending code and with the devolved authority to Accounting Officers in managing expenditure.  The Accounting Officer is the person responsible for the expenditure of any given Department.  If a Department that has a huge contract that overruns the price and there are problems with the way it was specified in the first place, the Accounting Officer is the person who has to go before the Oireachtas committee and explain to the Comptroller and Auditor General why the contract did not work out.  The Accounting Officer and not the chief procurement officer is the person who appears before the Oireachtas committee to explain himself or herself.  It would be a huge change of role if we said the chief procurement officer was responsible for all cost overruns.</p></speech>

Every time I come in here with any kind of a Bill, all I hear from Government is that it will kick the can down the road for nine months, it will not engage on it, it disagrees, it will not bring the Bill to Committee Stage, it will not have the discussion or look at it.  It does my head in.  We put work into these things.  We look at these proposals and we are willing to work.  I was very clear in my opening statement that I am happy to work with the Government on this, as my colleague, Deputy Doherty also said.  We can bring it to Committee Stage and look at the different suggestions and amendments the Government has.  However, again from the Government the answer is "No".  The Government is not happy to work with the Opposition on different Bills it is bringing forward.  This is the fourth piece of legislation that I have brought before the D&aacute;il.  That is not just an easy thing we do overnight.  It takes a lot of work.  If the Government is not willing to engage with the Opposition on different Bills and proposals, I am really disheartened and shocked.</p>  <p>  The Government is not implementing the stuff that needs to be implemented to ensure this is dealt with.  The Minister of State was talking about cost overruns.  We are not saying this is a panacea for cost overruns, far from it.  I said that very clearly.  We need to look at the issue of abnormally lowball offers, however.  This is not just something my party is talking about.  It is something those on the Government benches have spoken about as well.  There is no definition for that.  That is what the experts in procurement law say.</p> <p>There is no clear definition.  The Minister of State said that in deciding to award a public contract, a balance needs to be struck between value for money and a quality project outcome.  We are all saying that.  It is clear that it needs to be done.  We are not saying it needs to be in just one sense or the other.  The Minister of State stated the existing regulations already impose a duty on contracting authorities to require economic operators to explain the price or cost proposed where tenders seem abnormally low in relation to works, supplies and services.  I will table a parliamentary question to find out how many bidders that Departments have disqualified on grounds of abnormally low tenders.  I would be really interested in knowing that.  The Minister of State also stated the provisions in the Bill seek to define an abnormally low tender where no such definition exists in the regulations or EU directives.  We have a definition.  The Minister of State is concerned about the definition.  We would be willing to work with him on this.  That is the whole point of this Parliament.  The whole point is that we are supposed to work together to get the best outcome for the taxpayer and ordinary people.  To be honest, I have not seen many best outcomes for ordinary people from this Government at all.  I am really annoyed about this.  As the Minister of State knows, I am always willing to work with the Government.  I am always very calm and collected &mdash; most of the time anyway &mdash; but this really does annoy me.</p> <p> The Minister of State said the Bill, as drafted, would drive tender prices higher than might otherwise be bid as contractors seek to avoid the examination that follows the identification of an abnormally low tender based on the formula proposed.  It should not be very difficult.  We are not trying to make it more difficult; we are just trying to deal with the issue.  We should not be running scared of this.  We know we have an issue so we should deal with it and make it easier for people.</p> <p> The Minister of State also stated the Bill could disadvantage smaller contractors who may be able to offer prices that are lower than those of their larger competitors.  I said very clearly in my opening speech that there could be reasons for having a lower tender.  That is brilliant; fair play to those concerned.  The Minister of State, however, is referring to disadvantaging smaller contractors.  Unfortunately, my colleague Deputy Stanley is gone.  He has done significant work on community wealth building.  I cannot wait to see the work the Government has done in this regard.</p> <p> I have said most of what I have time to say.  I am genuinely disappointed.  We are putting together legislation and want to work with the Government and have the best outcome.  We are all supposed to be doing our best for the public, the taxpayer.  The Government's position is really disheartening and frustrating.  I will be introducing another Bill in a few weeks and I look forward to the Minister of State supporting it.</p></speech>

That is all I can say at this point.  I cannot understand why members of the Government come in here and oppose Bill after Bill after Bill.  In my opening speech, I referred to successive Governments being careless with public money.  This one is no better.  I thought it might change some legislation but all it does is constantly oppose Bills we introduce.  We are parliamentarians for a reason.  We are elected by the people to do a job for them.  We are here to do what they want.  The money is not our money or the Government's money; it is the taxpayers' money.  This matter needs to be addressed properly.  We cannot be wasting taxpayers' money constantly.</p>  <p>  Deputies Stanley and Nash spoke about bogus self-employers.  The Minister of State tells us there is no such thing as a bogus self-employer.  There is.  I do not know what planet the Minister of State is living on because there are plenty of them.  Deputy Stanley mentioned how many he has come across.  I assure the Minister of State that Deputy Stanley is not the only one who has come across bogus self-employers.  Many of us have.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty spoke about value for money.  The Minister of State does not care about value for money.  The expenditure is considered fine because it is not his money.  Deputy Cronin spoke about over-expenditure on the Sallins bypass.  We should consider what the money would do.  My constituency is very poverty-stricken and there is a lack of housing.  There is no one to build houses and no one wants to build them.  Every day, there are people in my constituency office who tell me how they cannot get houses.</p>  <p>  I am a spokesperson for older people.  Older people are living in poverty, yet it is okay to spend millions upon millions of euro without anybody being interested in where it goes.  It is time that the Minister of State stood up to the plate and did what he was asked to do.  It is time that he did what this country needs, made a change and looked after the public money.</p>  <p>  As somebody who worked as a shop steward many years ago for people who lived on very low wages, I believe it is time that the living wage was implemented in this country and that the Government got off its backside and did it.</p></speech>
