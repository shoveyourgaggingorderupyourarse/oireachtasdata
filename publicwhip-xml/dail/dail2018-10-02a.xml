We have read the Defence Forces climate survey by the University of Limerick, which was published last year.  Today, we read in a major story in <i>The Irish Times</i>that two naval vessels, the <i>L&Eacute; Orla</i>and the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>, were unable to set sail due to crew shortages and reservists were drafted in to crew the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>.  If we look at all of that together, the picture being painted is one in which the Defence Forces are very seriously depleted and going through a severe retention crisis, with a shortage of specialist personnel in terms of bomb disposal experts and so forth, very low morale all around and poor pay and conditions of service.</p><p>In addition, among the Defences Forces, there is a very real sense of a lack of respect and, indeed, contempt from Government towards the Defence Forces.  This view is also being articulated by retired personnel who are particularly angry at what they see as a continuing dismantling of our Defence Forces, a once proud force representing our country.  One former retired officer describes the relationship between the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence as &quot;toxic, broken, dysfunctional and dangerous&quot;.  The general secretary of RACO said the Defence Forces &quot;governance and command structure is breaking down&quot;.  Within the Air Corps, we are told there is a shortfall in pilots of 30%.  It is clear there is a depletion among the officer ranks, with some even buying their way out of the Army.  There is a critical shortage of specialist officers, from Army bomb disposal experts to aeronautical engineers and pilots.</p><p>We remember the quotes from members of the Defence Forces in the Defence Forces climate survey.</p><p>One said the Defence Forces are being turned into a JobBridge scheme.  The authors spoke about private soldiers struggling to survive and depending on their parents.  Others were saying they could not get a mortgage.  Another said he had to live with his parents along with his wife and kids.  The officers were saying that they could not help them.  The only thing they can do is give the soldiers time off so they can save a day's childcare.  Through all of this, the Government is in denial.<br/><br/>Does the Taoiseach accept that morale is very low within the Defence Forces, that the conditions of service are very poor, and that there is a retention crisis?  Will he confirm the report in <i>The Irish Times </i>this morning<i></i>regarding the inability of two vessels to set sail because of the shortage of crew?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200004#B00200"><p>I cannot confirm that.  The Chief of Staff is compiling a report for the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on that.  I can say that the Naval Service, which has about 1,000 personnel, is at about 92% strength at the moment.  The Chief of Staff will prepare a report on that for the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.</p>  <p>  The Government is a strong supporter of our Defence Forces.  We value the role that they play, whether it is in peacekeeping overseas, acting on behalf of the State during emergencies at home, for example, natural disasters that happened last year, or providing aid to the civil power and support for the Garda when needed.  We are now investing again in our Defence Forces.  In contrast to what the Deputy has said, the budget for our Defence Forces increased by &euro;25 million this year and we have a major investment programme under way in upgrading our Defence Forces after years of neglect.  There is &euro;250 million for new vessels, for example, &euro;55 million for new armoured personnel carriers, &euro;32 million for new aircraft, and &euro;11 million for new armoured utilities as well as upgrades at the Curragh, Cathal Brugha, Athlone and many other barracks.  We are now once again investing in our Defence Forces after years of neglect and cutbacks that happened for reasons the Deputy will understand.</p>  <p>  PDFORRA has its conference today and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will attend.  We as a Government will continue to engage with PDFORRA and RACO on the issues that now arise.  We have a pay agreement with all public servants.  That applies for three years.  We are only in the first year of it.  It provides for pay restoration for all public servants earning less than &euro;40,000 by the end of this year and all public servants earning less than &euro;70,000 by the end of 2020.  For the Defence Forces, it is about a 7% pay increase as well as reversal of the 5% cuts to their allowances, which the Deputy will recall.</p>  <p>  There is a high turnover rate.  That is correct.  There is about an 8% turnover rate in the Defence Forces every year and a 92% retention rate.  That is not uncommon in defence forces.  Being in the Defence Forces tends to be a job for younger men and women.  It tends not to be a job for life.  If people are not moving up the ranks, they will generally move on, often to better opportunities in the private sector, taking with them the skills they have built up.  They also get early pensions in their 40s and 50s, which are set up to enable people to move on to new careers.  A turnover rate of around 8% is not uncommon.</p>  <p>  However, there has been an increase in departures in recent years.  We acknowledge that as a Government.  It is a change in recent years and there are particular issues around losing Defence Forces personnel with particular expertise that is now very valuable in the private sector.  That was not the case during the recession but it certainly is now as we enter a period of full and high employment.  The Deputy is right that there is a shortage when it comes to experts, pilots and engineers.  More generally, there is an issue across the Defence Forces when it comes to 24 hour duty, for example.  We have a mechanism by which we can examine that and resolve it, which is through the Public Sector Pay Commission.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have made a submission to it, as have the representative organisations, PDFORRA and RACO.  We will work through that with them and will have an evidence-based report from the Public Sector Pay Commission which will allow us to act and to make improvements in terms and conditions over and above those agreed.</p></speech>

He is the Minister for Defence.  He is in charge of the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps.  Why can he not confirm that story?  It was revealed early this morning.  We have learned there was an emergency meeting on this in Haulbowline last Friday between the Chief of Staff, the assistant chief of staff and the flag officer commanding.</p><p>By the way, there was no denial this morning by the Naval Service.  There was a carefully worded statement but no denial.  Why can the Taoiseach not confirm this?  Did he not get on the telephone?  Did he not talk to the Secretary General of his Department and ask the simple question: "Is it the case that two ships could not set sail because we could not crew them?"  The Taoiseach is failing and continues to fail the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces climate survey last year was a warning to everybody.  This is not about departures or high turnover.  That is lovely language, language that masks the reality of a critical lack of morale among members of the Defence Forces.  There is an urgent need for a comprehensive response from the Government, not just parking the issue and using the Public Service Pay Commission as a way of dismissing them and saying, "Sure we know you're not going to stay too long anyway.  Sure won't you all leave eventually?"  What faith and respect in the Defence Forces emanate from that language?  It is a proud force.  People have had long careers in the Army.  One can travel to locations throughout the country where families have pride in being members of the Army and serving overseas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200005#C02100"><p>In an interview published in this morning's edition of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>the leader of the DUP Arlene Foster had this to say:</p><blockquote>It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can&rsquo;t touch the Belfast Agreement.  Things evolve, even in the EU context.<br /><br />There has been a lot of misinterpretation, holding it [the Good Friday Agreement] up as a sacrosanct piece of legislation.</blockquote><p>Such comments are not just unacceptable and wrong, they are, in fact, dangerous and reprehensible.  They reveal a reckless disregard for the peace process, prosperity and progress.  It should be remembered, of course, that Arlene Foster left the Ulster Unionist Party in 2003 because of her opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and it appears that the leader of the DUP has learned nothing in the intervening 15 years.  It is entirely wrong to describe the Good Friday Agreement as &quot;a piece of legislation&quot; to be altered or changed on a whim.  It is, in fact, an agreement between all backgrounds and strands of political outlook in the North and the South.  It is a fundamental component of the constitutional landscape of this country.  It is also an international treaty between this state and Britain which has been lodged with the United Nations.  It is the people's agreement, not a bargaining chip.  Perhaps the leader of the DUP needs to be reminded that the agreement was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of citizens on this island, by more than 70% of the electorate in the North and 94% of voters in this state.  It was the first time since partition that unionists and nationalists, including republicans, had voted together in common cause.  Incidentally, the second such instance was the Brexit referendum.  The DUP rejected the Good Friday Agreement and embraces Brexit.  On both counts it acts in defiance of the democratic wishes of the people of the North.</p><p>I want to make it clear that the Good Friday Agreement is not up for renegotiation as part of Brexit.  It is, in fact, sacrosanct.  The best way forward for everyone on our island is not to dismiss the agreement but to embrace it.  Instead of play-acting and pandering to extremes, the DUP should fully commit to the implementation of that agreement rather than seeking to undermine it.  It should stop denying citizens rights.  That, of course, would unlock the pathway to re-establishing the North's institutions.</p> <p> Last year it was agreed that the Good Friday Agreement must be protected in all its parts.  Will the Taoiseach agree with me that this is not only absolutely essential but it is non-negotiable?  Will he agree with me that the Good Friday Agreement is, in fact, sacrosanct and will be protected in all of its parts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200006#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy McDonald for the question.  This is a very important matter, as everyone in the House will agree.  The Government stands by the Good Friday Agreement and will defend its primacy.  We see our role, as the Irish Government, as being co-defenders of that agreement.  We should not forget all that has been gained from the Good Friday Agreement.  It may not be operating as it should be at the moment but look at what has been gained: peace in Britain and Ireland, power-sharing most of the time in Northern Ireland and ever-closer co-operation between North and South.  It is not a piece of British legislation.  It is, as Deputy McDonald says, an international agreement between the British and Irish Governments, as well as a multi-party agreement among the various parties.  It is an agreement that was put to referendum and adopted in 1997 with over 70% support in Northern Ireland and over 95% support in this State.  While it may be factually correct to say that the Good Friday Agreement, just like any international treaty or agreement, could be changed, it could only be changed with the agreement of the British and Irish Governments and with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, cross-community consent at that.  It is not something that can be changed by any one political party or by any one Government.  Certainly, as far as this Government is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation in these talks over Brexit.</p></speech>

I echo his sentiments in respect of the achievements of the last 20 years.  All of that should be acknowledged in spite of the fact the institutions are currently not operational.  It needs to be acknowledged also that in order for power-sharing to work, in order for the institutions to be re-established, the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement must be embraced in their totality.  I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that the Good Friday Agreement is not up for renegotiation or change on the basis of Brexit or to facilitate the extremes of hard Brexiteers.  When the Taoiseach takes to his feet again, I ask him to respond directly to Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, and to insist of her, as a political leader, that she respects the Good Friday Agreement and that she, in fact, becomes part of the full implementation of that agreement.</p></speech>

She is a woman I like and respect.  I had the opportunity to be her counterpart for three and a half years when we were both responsible for tourism on the two different parts of the island and we worked very well together when the Good Friday Agreement was operating.  I would say to any political party in Northern Ireland or, indeed, on these islands that we should all respect the Good Friday Agreement and we should all work as hard as we can to make sure those institutions are back up and running again, with the Assembly giving expression to the democratic will of people living in Northern Ireland, and an Executive so that decisions are made not by civil servants or politicians in London or not made at all, but are made in Stormont, Belfast, where they should be made.  It would also mean we can get the North-South bodies up and running again.  The bodies still operate but the North-South Ministerial Council does not, which is of great regret when we are talking about important projects ranging from the A5, which is important in connecting Derry and Donegal to Dublin and Leinster, to the North-South interconnector and all the issues that arise as a result of Brexit.</p><p>We could manage these issues much better if we had the institutions up and running.  I call on everyone to respect the agreement and the decision of the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to embrace it and make it work.</p></speech>

Report after report was presented to the public in the past few years to try to sell this plan.  When others and I read the reports more closely, it was obvious that the plan had the potential to have catastrophic consequences for west Cork and the county generally.  I immediately called on my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group to table a motion in the D&aacute;il against implementation of the plan.  In spite of receiving support from Deputies from counties Kerry, Tipperary, Clare, Galway and Dublin, I received no support from any D&aacute;il Deputy from Cork.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent Alliance Deputies all voted down the motion as party leaders and deputy leaders cracked the Whip, forcing many to turn their backs on their own constituency in return for a promised compensation package that we were told would be put in place for the county for ten years.  At a meeting held in the council chambers on 13 September, to which all Oireachtas Members were invited, we discovered that a new wording was being proposed for the package.  It looks like it will not be for ten years but will instead be reviewed sometime in the first three.  It could happen in the first two months.  By law the city council will not be compelled to pay compensation which may well lead to a legal suit between the two local authorities in the not-so-distant future, which would have further serious consequences.  In their thousands, the people of Ballincollig signed petitions about not being forced inside the city boundaries.  It also looks like the people of Blarney and Tower will be forced inside the city boundaries against their will.  The people of west Cork where I have seen seven businesses close in the past few weeks are completely against the plan.  However, democracy has been kicked out the window in order to force the plan down people's throats.  The county council voted unanimously against this happening, but the extension of the city boundaries is being railroaded through, notwithstanding the fact that every honest politician in Cork knows how rural communities will see a major loss of commercial rates, development charges and property tax revenue.  </p>  <p>  At a special meeting of Cork County Council for all Oireachtas Members on 13 September the newly worded proposals were rejected by those Members present as shockingly bad, with serious consequences for the whole county.  In the two meetings held by Cork County Council to advise Members of the Oireachtas of the consequences for the county, the non-attendance of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, sent a clear message to me and the councillors present that they ignored their councillors on the ground and favoured a boundaries extension which would throw the whole county to the wolves.  Opposition to our motion 12 months ago indicated that some senior party members had forced the Whip on their Deputies to vote against the motion.  In other words, they forced their own Deputies to vote against their own constituency, which was nothing short of shameful, but it is not too late.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene personally where others have not and sideline the boundaries extension until all potential disasters have been explored.  They have been overlooked to date.  I ask him to follow in the steps of my fellow west Corkman, General Michael Collins, and govern for the country, rural and urban.  He must not allow politicians who are not acting in the interests of all the people to win out.</p></speech>

The Government supports the proposed redrawing of the boundaries for Cork city and county councils.  We are ambitious for Cork which is our southern capital and second city.  We want the population of Cork to grow by at least 50% by 2040.  We want the population of Cork to grow twice as fast as that of Dublin between now and then.  We are willing to stand behind the city in the case of any structural development required to ensure that will happen.  We see Cork as part of an Atlantic economic corridor stretching to Limerick, Galway and beyond and acting as an alternative pole of development to the greater Dublin region.  That is very much at the centre of the Government's balanced regional development policy and ambition.  We see Cork as a university city and industry hub, with a developing airport and rapidly expanding port.  We see it in having its own directly elected mayor in a few years to provide the city with a strong personality at its helm who will hold executive powers.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge absolutely that this is a change and that all changes and reforms are difficult.</p><p>In some cases, and it will be the case in other counties, it may result in a loss in revenue, in this case a loss in revenue to the county from property tax and certain business rates.  There will, therefore, be a compensation package.  Compensation is necessary to ensure the county area does not lose out and we continue to be able to invest in the many large towns, small towns and villages throughout County Cork.  I have every confidence that this will be worked out between the two councils and with the Minister.</p></speech>

Can he tell me the amount of revenue that will be lost to Cork county in the next five to ten years if this plan is implemented?  Can he tell me what services will be lost?  The mayor of Cork County Council and his colleagues will travel to Dublin on Thursday to try to get an understanding from the politicians here of how serious it would be if this plan were implemented.  If the Taoiseach cannot withdraw the plan, can he at least ensure it is written into law that no review can take place of the package for the county for ten years and that the city council will have to pay each year, as previously proposed?</p></speech>

People living in Cork county will continue to receive the services from their local authority that they receive now.  In terms of revenue, there will need to be a compensation package.  This must be worked out.  It is the case that as a result of areas moving from what is now the county into the city, commercial rates could be lost to the county.  Those areas will also transfer, however, and the cost of providing the services in them will no longer fall to the county but to the city, so expenditure will fall as well.  As I said, this was done very successfully in Limerick, as will be the case when a similar process follows in Galway.  There will be a compensation package to ensure that this transition can happen seamlessly and that services and the financial stability of the county are protected.  The Deputy has my assurance on that.</p></speech>

There are now significant concerns as to how the process to date has been managed, whether the awarding of the contract, if we get to that stage, will have been done in the best manner possible and whether the State will get the best possible deal.  We know there will have been no competitive tendering for what is one of the largest and potentially most lucrative communications infrastructure projects in the country to date.  Just last week, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was scathing about the potential monopoly within the waste sector, yet here we are in this process with only one bidder.  The remaining bidding consortium has changed so fundamentally from the initial bid that it is almost unrecognisable from the entity which first entered the process.  We had Eir and SIRO exit the process, while Enet remained as the leader of the remaining consortium.  In July of this year, SSE pulled out of the consortium.  Enet replaced SSE with the State-backed Irish Infrastructure Fund, yet the consortium continued to morph and just last month it emerged that Enet is no longer leading the consortium but is now a partner alongside other companies, including Actavo, formerly known as Siteserv.  Enet, the original bidder, is therefore now only one part of the consortium, which is now led by a private investment firm, Granahan McCourt.</p>  <p>  Surely the Taoiseach has concerns about this process and the substantial changes that have occurred within the bidding process since it was first launched.  He must be concerned about the links that will inevitably be drawn between the awarding of previous controversial contracts and some of the same personnel involved in this consortium.  After all, Fine Gael was in government when the Irish Water contracts were awarded to a subsidiary of Siteserv, which is now the subject of a commission of investigation.</p><p>Fine Gael was in government when the second mobile phone licence was awarded to Esat which then became the subject of the Moriarty tribunal.  It is now looking like Fine Gael will be in government when the national broadband plan contract is awarded to a consortium in which the same high profile businesspeople are involved.  It is vital that the process for awarding the tender be above reproach.  Would it not be better and more pertinent to ask the questions now, before any contract is awarded, in order to make sure there is absolute public confidence in both the process and the outcome?  My questions are as follows.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the bidding process, in which only one bidder is involved, will deliver broadband and best value for money?  Does he have concerns about the sustainability of the remainder of the consortium, given that it has changed so much since it entered the process?  How stable will it be into the future?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the money spent on the process thus far has achieved the desired outcome?</p></speech>

Our ambition is for Ireland to become one of the first countries in the world to be able to do so.  It is probably the most ambitious project for rural Ireland since the rural electrification scheme and will probably involve the biggest ever infrastructural investment in rural Ireland.  It is a project of that scale, enormity and importance, which is why we have to get it right and we are absolutely determined to do so.  It is not true to say there is no competitive tendering.  There were many bidders and we are now down to one.  Of course, we would much prefer it if there were more, but that is the way markets work.  If there are more bidders, one will probably get a better price, but we are down to only one for many reasons.  The Department will carry out due diligence to ensure the consortium is capable of delivering and getting the job done, which is the most important thing; to ensure we will get the best price possible, notwithstanding the fact that there is only one bidder still involved in the process; that the process is robust and fair; that we will learn from the mistakes of the past and be aware of the risk of legal challenges which, of course, everyone will want to avoid.</p>  <p>  On broadband provision more generally, it is important to acknowledge the enormous progress made by the Government of Fine Gael and Independent Members since Deputy Denis Naughten became Minister.  We have seen an expansion of access to high speed broadband across the country.</p></speech>

It is now over 70% and will be close to 80% by the end of the year.  The increase has been driven very much by the national broadband plan.  Commercial investors knew that this was coming and got in ahead of it, put the infrastructure in the ground and provided broadband for homes.  However, it will still leave approximately 550,000 premises that will not be provided for by the commercial sector.  That is where the Government must intervene.  Where the market cannot provide, the Government must intervene.  We see this as a project of enormous importance.  It is possibly the largest single infrastructural investment in rural Ireland since the rural electrification scheme and it one we are determined to deliver.</p></speech>

I echo his remarks about the need for the national broadband plan.  I do not think anyone wants anything other than for the plan to work, but the process has to be robust.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last November about the procurement process.  It stated the process was still competitive because there were two strong operators in the telecoms field involved.  In February I received another reply which stated there was still competitive tension because there were two strong competitors.  There is now one bidder remaining and that bidder has changed completely since the process commenced.  It has been so unstable it has morphed into something entirely different.  How can the Taoiseach give any guarantee that it will still exist in six months or a year or that it will deliver?  There are so many questions about the national broadband plan.</p><p>Care has to be taken that there is public confidence in how the process works.  If the process is faulty, then the outcome is likely to be faulty as well.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct to draw attention to this.  It is important we get this right because it is an enormous investment that will run for 25 to 30 years.  There is the expression, act in haste and repent at leisure.  We need to ensure this process is robust.  We are confident it is.  It is new and unprecedented.  That is what makes it different from other contracts.  It has not been done before, even by other countries.  That in itself brings about an inherent risk.  That is not a good enough reason, however, not to do it.</p>  <p>  The remaining bidder in the national broadband plan put in its final tender to the Department on Tuesday, 19 September.  Over the coming weeks, the Department&rsquo;s procurement team will evaluate the submission.  The Minister looks forward to receiving the output from that particular evaluation.  As I mentioned, it is unique in terms of its level of ambition and vision.  The focus is to ensure that a future-proofed technical solution will allow this and future generations to participate fully in digital society.</p></speech>

We opposed that proposal at the Business Committee.  The Order of Business is an important platform for Members, particularly those from the larger parliamentary parties, and only takes about 30 minutes each day.  I do not see the necessity of eliminating it in budget week.  I have no difficulty in agreeing to give as much time as Members want to contribute on the budget.  However, I do not understand why the Order of Business has to be suppressed next Wednesday and Thursday.  As a matter of routine, the Topical Issue debate should also continue but I understand some compromise has been effected on that.  I ask that the House reconsider this matter.  The Order of Business should be standard in sitting weeks of the House.  I do not consider the budget to be a reason to eliminate it, particularly on the Wednesday and Thursday.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Taoiseach is familiar with the issue.  Professor Douglas Kell, a UK based biochemist, resigned in August because of what he believed to be an utter lack of transparency in the Science Foundation Ireland process and because UCC did not appeal the decision on the Infant Centre which was set up in 2013.  This raises fundamental issues about research and sustainability.  The team there had already received awards from the American Heart Association for its groundbreaking work on the life threatening condition of pre-eclampsia.  In the overall context of patient safety and patient safety legislation, it defies logic that we would end very valuable research of this quality.  Professor Louise Kenny who believes the decision was political stated they had not been given a full explanation as to why their proposal had been rejected.  Will the Taoiseach to inquire into this matter to see if he can obtain some satisfactory responses for us?</p></speech>

I do not believe there is any substance to the suggestion that there is political interference, nor should there be.  I will, however, ask the Minister to provide a report for the Deputy and Science Foundation Ireland to meet those involved in the Infant Centre to explain why they did not receive the funding on this occasion.</p></speech>

Where lies the promise the Government made to have everyone out of emergency accommodation by last summer and what research is the Government doing on the number of pregnant women in homeless accommodation?  The #MyNameIs campaign said: "We have spoken about the indignity of treating children as just statistics, but it appears that newborns born into homelessness [do] not even mak[e] it as ... a statistic."  The Government does not even keep records.  The Depaul charity said 27 pregnant women were sleeping in its homeless accommodation last year.  It spoke about these women getting up and walking the streets and having to give birth not knowing what their newborn child would face.  I have seen people who have had this experience.  There are 18 in the Dublin north-central area affected by homelessness and five born into homelessness.  This is an outrage.</p>  <p>  No one can say what caused this incident to happen, but if a woman is pregnant and cannot access fresh food and water and is living under stress, she will have problems with her pregnancy.</p></speech>

It is a very sad moment for any family, and those of us who have experience of stillbirth or miscarriage will know and understand that and will also understand, as Deputy Coppinger rightly points out, that there are many causes of stillbirth and it is not right to jump to any conclusions in that regard.  I am sure no one is doing that.</p>  <p>  In the past year the Government has lifted 5,000 people out of homelessness and provided secure tenancies for them, but many more become homeless every day.  It is a real struggle to keep on top of this issue.  The development of family hubs, with more than 20 provided, offers much more appropriate accommodation for families.  I know every effort is made to prioritise those who are ill or pregnant.</p>  <p>  I cannot answer the question on research but I will ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or the Minister of State, Deputy English, to give some details on that.</p></speech>

What will he do to change the tax on stallions, the land tax and the capital gains system that was set up for good reason for family farms and the transfer of land to put some kind of reins &ndash; this is not funny - on the horsing conglomerate in Tipperary, especially Coolmore Stud, which is buying up every piece of land?  It has amassed well over 20,000 acres.  The Government refused to do it last year and has refused to do it for several years.  We asked that a land tax might be included in the Finance Bill last year to bring some fairness and equity to the small and family farms in Tipperary and in other parts of the country, and to other conglomerates.  I support Coolmore's racing prowess and the employment it gives but someone has to cry halt when it has amassed more than 20,000 acres, buying up land that is zoned for housing in delicate areas in villages and towns and buying cottage plots and acres.  It is buying up everything.  The Government sits idly by and there are many demands on the budget.  There is no stallion tax.  It was brought in for good reason by a former Minister, Charles Haughey, long ago but now it is long past the day when it should be changed.  There should be some kind of land tax on farms of more than 750 acres.  There is no land commission.  It is the wild west out there.  It is hoovering everything up.</p></speech>

I met the Minister of State, Deputy English, to discuss the strain that homeowners in my constituency of Dublin-Rathdown are under.  He indicated that he would meet them but regrettably he subsequently changed his mind and no such meeting will now take place.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Green Party has, on many occasions, called on the Government to investigate practical measures to help these homeowners.  Nearly two years ago, the D&aacute;il supported a Green Party motion calling on the Government to set up a scheme to remediate legacy defects.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government made a similar call earlier this year.  Does the Government intend to investigate this issue at national level?  Will it take steps in budget 2019 to mitigate the pain and distress these people are burdened with, or will they remain abandoned?</p></speech>

As is the case in the Deputy's constituency, there are also apartment buildings with defects in my constituency.  The cost of repairing those defects, even when divided among the different homeowners or apartments, is very large for one individual or group of individuals to carry.  Before we commit taxpayers' money, whether through tax incentives, write-offs or grants, to the repair of private homes, duplexes or apartments, we need to have an understanding of the kind of cost we could be imposing on taxpayers in general and on the rest of society.

Two weeks ago, he said efficacy was an issue.</p><p>When I raised with the Taoiseach last week the fact that it was not and that it was an effective drug, he said he wanted to check it and would read the report.  Has he read it and can he now confirm to the House that the drug is effective, that efficacy is not an issue and that it is solely down to cost?  Families are waiting for a decision from the HSE.  The Minister for Health has still not responded to them, despite me asking the Taoiseach on two previous occasions to direct him to do so.  Will the Taoiseach now do so?</p></speech>

This day two weeks ago I raised the exact same issue with the Taoiseach.  I hope he did not take it out of context, but I did say I hoped the Government was not hiding behind bureaucracy.  The programme for Government commits to trying to get these drugs on a European-wide basis.  On this side of the House we are finding it very difficult to understand how other European countries with which we are supposed to be working in an alliance have secured this drug for their citizens.  There are 25 children in this country in need of it, two of them in my constituency, and the timing really matters.  I hope there will be an effort to ensure a speedy response on the issue.</p></speech>

It is not a matter of giving a direction to the Minister.  As a House, we decided in legislation that whether drugs were to be reimbursed should not be a political decision and it is not for good reason.  Whether a new medicine is to be licensed for use is a decision either for the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, or the European Medicines Agency, while whether it is to be reimbursed is a decision to be made by the HSE national drugs committee based on best clinical advice.  As I mentioned to Deputy Lisa Chambers on the previous occasion she raised the issue, it is not simply a matter of whether a medicine is effective but how effective it is</p></speech>

When one measures the cost against efficacy, the ratio is 10:1 or 20:1, which, unfortunately, is not a very good figure.  One would expect the cost to benefit ratio to be more like 1:1. but, unfortunately, it is 10:1 or 20:1.  However, that does not mean that the medicine cannot be approved.  It is always possible for the company to come back with new data and new information to demonstrate that the drug is more effective than the experts believe it is.</p></speech>

I bring to the Taoiseach's attention that the complete opposite is taking place in County Louth.  One community policing van has to be shared between Drogheda and Dundalk, the two largest towns in the county, while there are only two patrol cars to service the entire Drogheda area which includes Clogherhead, Termonfeckin, Dunleer and Monasterboice.  There is no uniformed inspector in the entire county.  It has been reported that garda&iacute; have to walk, cycle or use their own cars when carrying out serious investigations or making house calls.  How does the Taoiseach propose that rural parts of the county will be patrolled or policed as we approach the dark evenings of the winter?  It makes a mockery of what community policing is supposed to be about.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to fund the purchase of Garda vehicles to the tune of &euro;34 million.</p></speech>

I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, visited Dundalk Garda station where he spoke to Chief Superintendent Mangan and when I understand this issue was raised.  It is a major issue in the constituency and further exacerbates the problems we face.  There have been three murders by stabbing, an issue I have raised in the D&aacute;il as one that needs to be addressed.

The Bill is very valuable legislation which will permit public servants work beyond the age of 66 should they choose to do so.  It will be very valuable in retaining the experience and skills of many public servants in their late 60s who often feel they have to retire long before they are ready to do so.  The legislation has passed through the Seanad and we anticipate it will come before the D&aacute;il later in this session with a view to it being enacted before the end of the year.</p></speech>

It is a Bill that has the active support of campaigners in Ireland and is gathering huge momentum internationally as well.  I thank the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fur Free Alliance, the National Animal Rights Association, the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, Respect for Animals and many other campaigners who support this Bill and are campaigning for a ban on fur farming in Ireland.  I welcome those in the Gallery who are watching the beginning of this debate today and who have been waiting anxiously for this to be raised in the Parliament.</p><p>In Ireland, fur farming is done on three farms where there are approximately 200,000 mink.  In the past, there was fox farming here as well, which is still legal although it is not done at the moment.  I emphasise that mink are not domesticated animals and they fear humans.  All other farmed animals generally are domesticated and do not fear humans in their daily contact.  The EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare has described fur farming as inherently unethical and stated that it is not possible to stop it being cruel through regulation.</p><p>Mink are native to North America and Russia.  They are semi-aquatic and live as solo hunters.  In fur farms, they are kept in cages and away from what would be considered their natural habitat.  Given that they are ferocious hunters-----</p></speech>

Given that they are ferocious hunters, they are kept within strictly secure premises.  The first law related to mink in Ireland was aimed at keeping them out of Ireland and to have regulations attached to any that might be here.</p>  <p>  Public opinion is very firmly against fur farming and the fur industry.  That is reflected in the fact that none of the major retailers in Ireland stocks fur products.  When fur is identified in stores by campaigners, it is usually swiftly removed by retailers.  Fur is produced here for the export market.</p>  <p>  Fur farming is already illegal in Britain, the North and a range of countries across Europe.  The Bill amends the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 to clarify that fur farming would be illegal here.  The Act prohibits farming that is not in line with an animal's nature, type, species and breed, development, adaptation, domestication, psychological and behavioural needs.  However, the Minister continues to issue fur farming licences.  This Bill will give legal clarity on the need to ban fur farming.</p>  <p>  To address the history of this issue in the D&aacute;il, fur farming was to be wound down following a Government decision in 2009.  Unfortunately, in 2011 the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government reversed that decision.  While we would welcome a decision by the Minister not to renew licences and to issue regulations on this matter, I believe law is needed to prevent future Ministers reversing any such decision.  People are aware that Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted for the 2005 Bill to ban fur farming before reversing their position in a later decision.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt an argument will be made about jobs.  The work on fur farms is seasonal and generally done by people who do not live here and travel in and out of the country.  This is an idea whose time has come.  Solidarity proposed a ban on circus animals and the Government acted swiftly in advance of that Bill being debated in the D&aacute;il to regulate in that area.  I appeal to Members of the D&aacute;il of all parties to support the Bill.  I also appeal to people who care about the issue to campaign vociferously and to ask Deputies and Senators to support the Bill.  Under capitalism, the cruel treatment of animals can be highly profitable but any measures to stop cruel practices can challenge the profits of an industry.  I have no doubt the fur farming industry will retaliate.  It is, therefore, important that people lobby their public representatives to support this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200019#R00200"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the establishment of a commission to make recommendations and report annually on the adequacy of social welfare rates in the State; and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>I am delighted to introduce the Social Welfare Commission Bill, honouring a commitment made by Sinn F&eacute;in as part of our manifesto in the previous general election.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a social welfare commission.  The principal function of the commission would be to examine the minimum income required by different household types in receipt of social welfare to develop a minimum essential standard of living for these citizens.</p><p>The commission would make associated annual recommendations to the Oireachtas for adjustments to social welfare rates ahead of budget time.  The commission would build on the evidence-based consensus budgeting model developed by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and its membership would include representation from those impacted by budgetary decisions.</p><p>The Bill also allows for the commission to recommend that any Department undertake a poverty impact assessment before implementing a specific policy measure.  If this had been done, for example, on the policy that saw the age limit for payment of the one-parent family payment reduced, lone parents might not have been put in a situation where they were financially better off on welfare rather than at work.</p><p>The commission would be made up of members appointed by the Minister and the members would have a wide variety of expertise and knowledge.  It would comprise four members from independent organisations involved in social justice; two members with particular knowledge in economics, statistics, employment law; and two members with an understanding or interest in particular issues faced by some or all of the following - lone parents, older people, pensioners, children, people with disabilities, the unemployed, young people and widows.  The chairperson would be the ninth member and would also be appointed by the Minister.  This structure is similar to that of the Low Pay Commission.</p><p>The commission, in its recommendations to the Oireachtas, will have the overall objective of ensuring that all household types receive a level of income that will allow them an acceptable standard of living.  The commission will be free to invite submissions from various organisations to assist it in its annual report of recommendations.</p><p>The Bill will take the political football out of social welfare increases such as we see every year ahead of the budget around the State pension.  It will ensure that all households in receipt of social welfare are protected from poverty and can attain an adequate standard of living whether they are rural or urban, one parent or two, working or unemployed.  Based on the annual budget made available to the Low Pay Commission of &euro;480,000, Sinn F&eacute;in has allowed for this amount in our alternative budget launched this morning.</p><p>We believe that this is a practical and sensible step for the Government to take.  The establishment of such a commission will assist us in reducing poverty and meeting our targets to reduce child poverty by lifting 95,000 children out of poverty by 2020.</p><p>I am proud to introduce this legislation and I urge all parties, particularly Government, not only to allow the legislation to proceed but to work to implement it as quickly as possible and remove it from being a political football every year as to whether pensioners and other recipients of social welfare payments are going to get them in the first place.  It needs to be evidence based, and establishing this commission will move us along that way.</p></speech>

This visit took place as Austria began its six-month Presidency of the Council of the European Union and followed my visit to Vienna in February.  I am pleased that Chancellor Kurz chose Ireland as the first member state to visit under the Austrian Presidency.  Topics discussed during our meeting included Brexit, migration, trade, the digital agenda and the post-2020 EU budget.  These issues all feature on the EU's agenda during the current Austrian Presidency.  I also met Chancellor Kurz at the informal meeting of EU leaders which took place on 19 and 20 September in Salzburg.</p>  <p>  In July I travelled to Croatia, Romania and Italy, meeting the Croatian President, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, the Croatian Prime Minister, Andrej Plenković, and the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Gordan Jandroković, in Zagreb on 23 July.  I met the Romanian President, Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian Prime Minister, Viorica Dăncilă, and the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Liviu Dragnea, in Bucharest on 24 July.  I met the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, in Rome on 26 July.</p>  <p>  Topics discussed at meetings with my European Council colleagues included Brexit, migration and the post-2020 EU budget.  Bilateral relations, which are excellent with all three countries, were also discussed during the meetings.  My visit to Romania was especially timely as the country will take over the EU Presidency in the first half of 2019, the period during which the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 6 August, I met the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, in Athens.  I took the opportunity to express my condolences following the tragic loss of life due to the fires in the Attica region two weeks previously.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, in turn expressed his sorrow at the death of an Irish citizen.  I subsequently wrote to the rescue staff in Greece who helped to rescue one of our citizens there.  Our exchanges also covered Brexit, migration and economic issues, where in particular I congratulated the Prime Minister on Greece&rsquo;s exit from its economic adjustment programme.</p>  <p>  I also briefly met several of my European Council colleagues in the margins of my recent visit to the United Nations last Monday, including the Prime Minister of Estonia, J&uuml;ri Ratas, the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, and the President of Cyprus.</p>  <p>  Ongoing engagement and further upcoming bilateral meetings are envisaged for the period ahead and these will be confirmed when the details have been finalised.  I will continue to take advantage of every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests with my fellow members of the European Council.</p></reply>

I have no doubt they expressed support for Ireland regarding Brexit and the backstop for the Border.  The October summit will be important but the general view is that a major decision will not be made until November.  I now hear talk, however, of another European Council summit in December and that decisions on Brexit may be left over until December.  I believe that would be a retrograde step.  The European Parliament must ratify the withdrawal treaty, as must the other EU states.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the timetable in that regard.</p>  <p>  I notice that migration was a major issue for discussion with these EU leaders.  It is a big challenge facing the European Union.  I note what the EU has agreed in that regard at European Council meetings regarding disembarkation platforms, control centres and reform of the common European asylum system, especially the Dublin regulation.  I note also that Ireland has opted into relocation and resettlement measures.  Ireland can learn from the mistakes of other EU countries.  We need to manage diversity and implement successful integration policies.  There is no room for Ireland to have complacency in that regard.  I ask the Taoiseach to assure me that we are pursuing successful integration policies here and that we are managing diversity, because it is a huge issue in Europe.</p><p>There are European Parliament elections coming up next year and migration will be a big issue in those elections.  I want the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, to assure us we are doing everything possible in this country to ensure the successful management of migration.</p></speech>

It is becoming increasingly clear that the absence of a working Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive is causing major problems in regard to the Brexit negotiations.  Instead of having a cross-community democratic body speaking up for the people of Northern Ireland, the majority of whom are anti-Brexit, we have party agendas dominating.  The appalling comments today concerning the Good Friday Agreement confirm the damage.  In this case, it would have been expected that the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive were an absolute priority for the Taoiseach yet the evidence is that, for the first time, the whole area seems to have been effectively subcontracted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach does not see relations between Government Buildings and Downing Street as central to the process.</p>  <p>  This is the only conclusion we can draw from the irregular contact which the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May maintain.  Earlier this year they went seven weeks without speaking.  Before Salzburg they went ten weeks without speaking.  They do not appear to have had a bilateral session focused primarily on Northern Ireland since the shambolic visit to Stormont in February, when the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister flew in to take the glory for a deal which never materialised.  While Michel Barnier is our chief negotiator on Brexit, the Taoiseach is supposed to be our chief negotiator on Northern Ireland.  What initiatives does he intend to take to engage the British Government on this?  Is it his position that irregular and short conversations display a decent working relationship or a real priority for Northern Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200020#S00500"><p>It should at this juncture be clear even to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that at the heart of the crisis and the hiatus in the institutions in the North is the fact that the DUP has not embraced the Good Friday Agreement.  We can only have a functioning system of power-sharing where we have parties that are open to power-sharing.  We cannot indefinitely suspend the expectations of an entire society and tell people to wait and then wait some more while one party, the DUP, refuses to play ball.  Those are the facts.  Nobody regrets more than I the fact that the agreement in February was not taken over the line but responsibility for that rests at the feet of the DUP.  Responsibility for the toxic relationship between the Tories and the DUP rests with Theresa May and Arlene Foster, respectively.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin when he says the North needs to be a priority for the Taoiseach, that the commitment needs to be strong and that the channels of communication need to be open, which is fair enough.  However, frankly, I do not think it is fair and it is not dealing with the very challenging realities to play a game of make-believe and to say everybody is wrong in this scenario.  The difficulty and the fault squarely lie with one party, and that party is the DUP.  We need to try to resolve that but we can only do it if we are prepared to say that out loud and to challenge Arlene Foster in particular in that regard.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach tell us what he said to Chancellor Kurz on the issue of migration?  Did he challenge him?  Did he challenge his partners in government?  As to our management of migration here, I think it has been fairly disastrous.  One only needs to look to the system of direct provision to have proof positive that, far from managing migration, we are failing spectacularly in that regard.</p></speech>

It is an important ongoing process and the right thing to do.</p>  <p>  I spent the weekend before last at the British Labour Party conference.  I met a variety of different groupings, including small firms' representatives and the representatives of very large businesses.  Without exception, all of them outlined the negative impacts that Brexit will have on the economy and on employment in the United Kingdom.  However, none of them knew how to articulate this without fear of being overwhelmed with criticism.  That is the background music in the UK right now.</p>  <p>  Much of the focus politically, and I think it will be the same at the Tory conference under way right now, is on what will happen next year in the final chapter leading up to the UK exit, for example, what will happen in parliament and will there be a majority for this or for that?  I continue to try to focus on the Irish backstop.  If there is no agreed legal formulation for an Irish backstop, we will not get to a vote in the British Parliament in terms of a withdrawal agreement because there will not be one.</p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of the date when the British Government will finally publish its legal understanding of what it politically agreed to in December of last year?  We know it has dismissed the Barnier interpretation of that, and Barnier is going to have another go at it.  We understand from repeated commitments that the British Government is going to set out its legal understanding.  When will that happen?  In the event of it not happening in advance of the October EU summit, that is, in the event of the British not setting out their legal understanding of the backstop, what will be the Taoiseach's response?</p></speech>

Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with his European counterparts about the passing of the nation-state law in Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu?  On top of the long list of apartheid and racist measures directed against the Arab and Palestinian population, the nation-state law is an explicitly racist and apartheid law which flies in the face of international law and the right of Arab and Palestinian people to national self-determination.  I wonder if Europe intends to do anything at all, or to make any statement, about how repugnant and in breach of international law and rights this nation-state law is.</p>  <p>  Was anything said about the shooting of migrants by Moroccan forces?  To add to the atrocities being committed against desperate people fleeing the Mediterranean, this latest incident was pretty shocking.</p></speech>

That has yet to be confirmed but we agreed there would be one if it is needed either to confirm an agreement or to study the fact that we do not yet have an agreement.  Obviously, I would much prefer it if we could conclude the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the political declaration on the new relationship, which are the three elements that go together and have to be agreed, at the October summit rather than having to have a special summit in November.  I certainly would not want to wait until December but that is not something that is entirely under our control.  The timeline obviously works back from the end of March, when the UK will leave the EU, and sufficient time has to be available for the UK Parliament and the European Parliament to ratify any agreement.  I imagine that if they had to, both Parliaments could do that quite quickly, but it would be far from ideal to have a situation where this was left to run on into November or December, or even into the new year.  That would be most regrettable and I sincerely hope we are all able to avoid that.  I think we would start to see a significant impact on confidence in our economies if it was allowed to run on that long, so I will do everything I can to make sure we have an agreement sooner rather than later.</p>  <p>  In terms of integration and diversity, I disagree with Deputy McDonald's assessment.</p><p>I appreciate that there are plenty of issues and shortcomings, of which direct provision may be one, but one in six people in Ireland was not born here, which is very high relative to that in other countries.  It is higher than the figure in Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands.  We have done much better on integration than those countries, largely because immigration has been diverse, rather than migrants coming mainly from one country.  They have come here from other parts of Europe and all over the world.  In addition, they are very well integrated into the labour market and, in fact, more likely to be working than the average Irish person and paying tax.  In many areas, in particular the health service, they are holding up public services, as well as helping to bring investment from large companies to Ireland, whether by Facebook, Google or others.  The other day I was at a very good project which was led by Deputy David Stanton but which also very much involved the private sector to encourage migrants who were not part of the labour market to become involved in it and overcome the barriers they were facing.  A lot of good work is being done in these areas, albeit it is never going to be perfect.  No country can state it has achieved perfection in dealing with migration and integration, but we have done pretty well relative to other states, given, in particular, that one in six people in Ireland was not born here.  This suddenly became a net inward migration country, when for decades there was outward migration.  I am pleased and proud that during the deep recession when there was very high unemployment and living standards were falling, people did not turn to anti-immigration or racist politics in the way they have in other countries when times have been tough.  </p> <p> Shall I continue?</p></speech>

Recent developments in these areas include the publication of the pensions road map by the Minister for Employment and Social Protection and the Government's decision to prepare a "future jobs" programme focused on creating high productivity jobs, increasing levels of participation in the labour market and tackling the opportunities and risks we face in areas such as digital transformation and the low carbon economy.  The most recent meeting of Cabinet committee A took place on 9 July and the next meeting is scheduled to take place later this month.  Of course, the full Cabinet also considers these issues on an regular basis.</p></reply>

Now it comes from a source that the Taoiseach cannot dismiss quite so easily.  The report outlines how 90 of the richest individuals in the country are declaring taxable incomes which are less than the average industrial wage.  In 2016 these high net worth individuals claimed &euro;96 million in various tax credits and reliefs.  By the way, they are people whose individual wealth is estimated to exceed &euro;50 million.  It is absolutely shocking when one thinks of some of the social problems people in this country face that some of the richest people are availing of tax reliefs and credits to bring their taxable income down to negligible levels.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also points to something else we have said repeatedly about the extent of corporate tax loopholes.  As someone who has spoken a lot about this issue, the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures stagger even me.  In 2016, &euro;296 billion was available in allowances and forward losses to be offset against profits.  It is estimated that in future years it could rob Revenue of approximately &euro;29 billion.</p></speech>

I also add issues related to the taxation of intangible assets held by multinationals, a loophole which was partially closed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, but which requires a full and final resolution.  I noticed in the Taoiseach's Twitter account that he had had sight of some of Sinn F&eacute;in's budgetary proposals.  I suggest he read the document in full and absorb it properly before tweeting again.  We have made a range of proposals on investment in public services, tackling the cost of living and building prosperity and set out in detail the choices we would make within the fiscal parameters.  I realise the Taoiseach's choices are likely to be different, but I appeal to him to study our proposals.  As he has often said, no one in this Chamber has a monopoly of empathy.  Certainly, the Government benches do not have a monopoly of wisdom when it comes to prudent and sound economic management.</p></speech>

That crisis which is now over five years' old is having a significant impact on inward investment and disposable incomes which are being reduced by exorbitant rents.  It is causing missed opportunities and a lack of mobility.  There are growing signs that Brexit is beginning to have an impact on consumer confidence, as well as potentially causing disruption in the United Kingdom market.  An important aspect is a sense of deflation which has followed the complacency arising from the overselling of last December's deal.  Where once businesses were told that they had an iron clad assurance of the <i>status quo</i>continuing and that the United Kingdom as a whole was leaning towards a soft or low impact Brexit, today the public feels a general degree of anxiety and a higher level of fear.  The Copenhagen study which remains the Government's only attempt to quantify the impact of Brexit states we face a loss of over 7% of national income in the event of a chaotic, no-deal Brexit and 4% in the event that there is some form of comprehensive free trade agreement.  For example, a Canada plus agreement would lead to a decline of 4%.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that these projections remain the basis for Ireland's Brexit planning and does he believe the measures taken so far and their impact are of sufficient scale to respond to a loss of between 4% and 7% of national income?  One must take into account the divergence in the economy between the domestic, indigenous economy which relies heavily on exports to the United Kingdom and the multinational base which will probably prove to be more resilient.  The indigenous sector, in particular, agrifood companies and companies in the west, the north west and the midlands which export mainly to Britain, could be in significant difficulty, even in the event that there is a free trade agreement along the lines of Canada plus.</p></speech>

I believe everyone should pay his or her fair share of tax in Ireland.  As a Government, we have prioritised taking the lowest-paid out of the income tax net altogether.  Approximately 30% of people in Ireland, the lowest-paid, no longer have to pay income tax, which is a very good thing.  Our focus now is very much on reducing income tax for those on middle incomes, who in many ways often pay the highest tax burden because the very rich can find ways not to pay, whether through legitimate tax incentives or aggressive tax planning and in some cases tax avoidance.  It is very often the middle that bears the largest burden of income taxation.  This is why it has been our priority to raise the standard rate cut-off point in order that fewer people have to pay that highest rate of income tax and to ensure that people pay less in income tax and universal social charge, USC.  While in any one budget this might only be &euro;300 or &euro;400 for a single person and &euro;600 or &euro;800 for a couple, this really starts to add up over three budgets, to &euro;1,800 for a couple.  The three-year effect - we have been doing this for three years now - and five-year effect of these taxation changes really make a difference to the take-home pay of those on middle incomes.</p>  <p>  It is important, though, to make a distinction between wealth and income.  Wealth and income are not the same thing.  In our constituencies we all meet people, often elderly people, who own a house that is worth over &euro;1 million or perhaps have life savings but whose income can actually be very small.  It may only be &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000.  They might be on a modest pension so they have a low income and do not pay much income tax but they may have quite a lot in assets.</p></speech>

Many people claim to be rich but might not be that rich at all when the levels of debts and borrowings they have are taken into account.  Of course, one may own a business that is valued quite highly but not have any income from that business.  Businesses are loss-making.  One often sees this with farmers as well, that on paper the farm may be worth many millions but that the income the farmer derives from that farm can be very small.  It is therefore important to understand the difference-----</p></speech>

This is why we are recognised by the OECD and others as being compliant and transparent when it comes to our corporation profits tax, notwithstanding what others may say about us.  This is why we have seen a very big increase in the take from corporation profits tax this year.  We will see another very big one this month when the Exchequer returns come out and we will see this escalate.  We are now taking in a lot of money from corporations in corporation profits tax.  This is a risk because we cannot assume that this money will be there next year or the year after.  Because loopholes have been changed or closed and because of accounting changes, we will probably have a windfall of corporation profits tax this year which may not be there next year or the year after.  While some will be busily finding ways to spend this money, as a responsible Government we need to consider the possibility that this narrative about us not collecting a lot in corporation profits tax is not correct.  We are collecting a lot, and there is a risk that as corporation profits tax returns continue to escalate, as we continue to take in more and more of it, it could become our new stamp duty.  We could be vulnerable in this area.  We must be careful not to think that a bumper year of corporation profits tax is something on the back of which we can make five- or ten-year long-term spending commitments.  We will not make that mistake, having learned from the mistakes of the past.  On Friday we will have the White Paper, which will give the up-to-date calculations on the deficit.  While the changes, the projections that Deputy Howlin mentioned will reduce the deficit, this will be counteracted by overspending in other areas, most particularly in health but also in justice and some other areas.  We therefore expect to come in bang on the nose in or around a deficit of 0.2% this year, as projected, with the good things being outweighed by overruns in other areas.</p>  <p>  I had a chance over lunch to look at the Sinn F&eacute;in budget.

The meeting provided an opportunity for both of us to discuss a number of issues, though regrettably not at any great length because of the short duration of our meeting.  I welcomed Pope Francis, who thanked me for the warm welcome he had received on arrival.  We spoke of the legacy of pain and suffering caused by the failures of the church and the State in Ireland.  We discussed how Ireland is still a country with strong faith but that there is much to be done to bring about justice, truth and healing for the victims and survivors.  I thanked Pope Francis for his statements on climate change, encouraging countries to accept refugees, and international development.  We also spoke of Irish missionaries and how they continue their work today and about the Pope's home country of Argentina and the role of the Irish there.  I used the opportunity during my speech later that day to expand on these issues and to express my strong wish that words be followed by actions.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe in a greater separation of church and State and in freedom of and respect for religion.  I hope the visit of Pope Francis will be the opening of a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church, one in which the church is no longer at the centre of our society but still has an important role to play.</p>  <p>  It is very beneficial that Government should engage with churches and faith communities in a structured way.  On 22 January 2018 several Cabinet Ministers and I met representatives of the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian and Methodist churches in a formal meeting under the structured dialogue process between church and State.  This was the second in a series of meetings I will hold with dialogue partners.  We discussed important social and economic issues facing Irish society, including Brexit, education issues, the eight amendment and international development.  On 31 August, some of my colleagues and I held formal meetings under the structured dialogue process with representatives of the Catholic Church, led by Archbishop Eamon Martin.  A wide-ranging discussion took place on a range of important national and international issues, including education, Northern Ireland, overseas development and social justice.  Some of the issues we discussed at these meetings were very challenging.  They are issues on which people have deeply held views and which some consider to be matters of conscience.  Our discussions were valuable, not just because they dealt with important issues, but particularly because they were conducted in an atmosphere of respect for the views of others, where everyone sought to be more constructive.</p>  <p>  Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events.  In particular, with the recent visit of Pope Francis, I attended several events that were also attended by representatives of various religious groups.  I have also had the opportunity to engage with the Muslim community around Eid and our Jewish community around Passover.</p></reply>

In it he set out the ambition of "a new covenant", if I am quoting him correctly.  Later in the speech I think he made a point about our hospital services, saying he was looking for a hospital service based on a civic and scientific ethos.  I agree.  The real question, however, is what exactly does this civic component include.</p><p>I hope it does and can include communities and people of religious faith because they bring a lot to our society.  They should not be central or have control over the State in any way, but they have a contribution to make.  I am interested to know where the Taoiseach thinks that covenant would be constructed.  I hear of his Cabinet meetings but is there any wider mechanism he sees us partaking in to develop that type of civic society?  I was very taken by a book published by a number of people, including Fr Gerry O'Hanlon SJ, entitled <i>A Dialogue of Hope</i>.  He set out how the churches could be useful in the dialogue the State needs to have across all our work.  I think, however, that it has changed slightly.  The conversation around such a covenant might be a useful mechanism for the church to engage, in a synodal way, with other churches and with people of no faith in answering the question of what the roles of churches and those of all faiths and none in our society are.  Would the Taoiseach consider such a synodal approach in bringing people in to consider that covenant question?</p></speech>

He reflected on the fact that he had visited the site in a personal capacity.  I understand he has made a commitment to meet Catherine Corless and the survivors.  He might inform us if there has been any progress made on such a meeting.</p>  <p>  When the Pope visited, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, met him, spoke to him and gave him a letter relating to the abuses carried out in mother and baby homes.  While the church has a responsibility and a case to answer in that regard, so too does the State.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the burial site at the Tuam mother and baby home must be secured, the remains exhumed and every effort made to reunite the remains of the babies and children buried there with their families.  That is the Government's decision to make.  It is the right thing to do.  I urge the Taoiseach to meet, with some urgency, Catherine Corless and the survivors.  They want to meet with him before the Minister, Deputy Zappone, concludes her work.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated in her letter that she was of the view that the church should contribute significantly to whatever decision is made.  She stated that it "should be done willingly, unconditionally and quickly".  Has there been a response from the Pope to the Minister's letter?  If so, what was that response?  Was it justified and reasonable?  What is the financial ask of the church?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200023#V00300"><p>In the Taoiseach's speech to Pope Francis he talked about a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church.  The repeal referendum and, perhaps, the visit itself, given that the numbers going to see the Pope were far lower than expected, clearly indicate, as the Taoiseach mentioned, that the relationship the majority of people in this country want is a separation of the institutions of the State from church and religious doctrine.  The question is whether the Taoiseach's vision of that is going to be different from the old relationship when it comes to who runs critical services and what services they provide, particularly in areas such as health and education.</p><p>I especially want to ask the Taoiseach about the national maternity hospital.  I and others have asked about it and we are deeply concerned about it.  Dr. Peter Boylan wrote an alarming letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>in August in which he pointed out that the Religious Sisters of Charity says that the St. Vincent's group will have to uphold the values and vision of Mother Mary Aikenhead, foundress of the Religious Sisters of Charity, and that the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference published in its <i>Code of Ethical Standards for Healthcare</i>that Catholic health facilities will not provide assisted fertility treatment, artificial contraception, morning-after pills, surrogacy, abortion, a referral elsewhere for abortion, sterilisation, or gender reassignment surgery.  If that were to be the situation in the national maternity hospital run by the new St. Vincent's group, it would be absolutely unacceptable.  I want reassurance, as do the women of Ireland, that the national maternity hospital will not be abiding by that sort of code of ethics.</p></speech>

I am very strongly in support of the point made in respect of the Tuam mother and baby home.  I understand that an initial document was handed to the Pope by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, on his visit and that a second letter, a more comprehensive statement of fact, was submitted to the Vatican.  I would certainly be interested in hearing what response, if any, has been received to those letters.  I presume the response was directed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but has the Taoiseach had sight of it?  Should we have openness in respect of the contents of this correspondence?</p>  <p>  On the general principles set out in the Taoiseach's speech in Dublin Castle, there is now a suggestion of a citizens' assembly.  That is a very good model.  It has worked very well on a number of seemingly intractable, difficult and challenging questions.  The Taoiseach might now consider using that model for the examination of the future ownership and control of education in this country.</p></speech>

In an era in which organised religions have moved to a different role and significance in society, tolerance and respect for different faiths should not just apply to smaller religions.  The recent visit of the Pope was very welcome, as was his open and sincere approach to the issues which were raised with him.</p>  <p>  It is now eight years since the Government announced the transfer of 50% of church schools to alternative patronage.  The result delivered has been the dramatic slowing down of divestment.  The process adopted has crawled along and the opportunity seems to have been missed to take up Archbishop Martin's offer immediately to divest a large number of schools in Dublin.  Will the Taoiseach explain whether he has taken any initiative to move the divestment process out of its slumber?  Has he followed up the Pope's visit with any specific engagement on the issues raised by him and others during the visit, issues which have been referenced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200023#V00600"><p>On hospitals and healthcare institutions, the Minister for Health has asked Ms Catherine Day, former head of the civil service in the European Union, to lead some work on the future relationship and governance of our hospitals for us.  I have not had sight of that work yet.  I am not quite sure how advanced it is but I look forward to seeing the outcome once it is ready.</p>  <p>  Volunteerism in health and education does have value.  Faith-based bodies and churches have often, though not always, brought a good ethos, a tradition and a loyalty to schools and hospitals.  While things need to change, I would not like to see all those good things lost.  We know of the valuable work that religious and faith-inspired charities do in areas such as housing and homelessness and the alleviation of poverty.  I would not like to see a separation of church and State that is so rigid and cold that all that would be lost and that the State would refuse to engage with all of that good work and the positive spirit of volunteerism that exists in health and education.</p>  <p>  The new national maternity hospital will be publicly owned and any medical procedure that is legal in Ireland, including assisted human reproduction and the termination of pregnancy, will be available in that hospital.  It will be publicly built and publicly owned.  That is how we intend it to develop.  I should point out that the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street is a voluntary hospital.  While he does not attend the meetings any more, the chairman of the board is the Archbishop of Dublin.  It is important to recognise the starting point as well as what we intend to be the end point.</p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan made some good suggestions.  I will certainly give consideration to the proposals he has made.</p><p> On the former mother and baby home in Tuam, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is developing proposals for how we should deal with the site and, most particularly, the remains of the children buried there.  When she has this work done, or substantially complete, it is my intention, alongside her, to organise the meetings.  I do not know if there has yet been a reply to her letters from Pope Francis or the Vatican, but to the best of my knowledge there has not been.  However, I might not be up to date on the matter, but I will certainly raise it with her if I see her tomorrow.</p> <p> We have a few citizens' assemblies in train.  There is one planned on gender equality to consider how we can further advance that agenda.  There is also one planned on the reform of local government in Dublin, a Dublin Citizens' Assembly.  We have taken on board Deputy Eamon Ryan's suggestion that it include not just citizens but also councillors and perhaps even Deputies and people with experience of local government.  It will probably be a little more like the Constitutional Convention model, with a ratio of one third to two thirds.  These are the ones we want to have in 2019.  We only have the bandwidth to have so many at any given time, but we may able to have more after that.</p></speech>

My Department and I continue to work rigorously with the Taoiseach and all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on this commitment.</p>  <p>  A first and significant step in the delivery process has been Project Ireland 2040 which gives explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage to our sustainable development in the next decade and beyond.  This recognition is underpinned by the unprecedented commitment made by the Government to invest &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, language and heritage in the ten-year implementation period of the national development plan.  In April I was delighted to launch my Department's sectoral plan, Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 to 2027.  The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis in the next ten years, prioritised across three areas, namely, &euro;785 million for culture, &euro;295 million for heritage and &euro;178 million for our language.  This level of investment will transform cultural and heritage infrastructure across the country.  It will go a long way towards honouring the commitment to double the Government&rsquo;s spending on the arts, culture and heritage.</p>  <p>  On current funding, allocations fall to be determined annually as part of the Estimates process.  In 2018 total current funding for my Department increased by &euro;11.5 million, or just under 5%, to &euro;248.659 million, including an additional &euro;2.8 million for the Arts Council, an additional &euro;1.7 million across all of the national cultural institutions, just under &euro;1 million in additional funding for the heritage programme and an extra &euro;1.4 million for the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector.  The Estimates for 2019 are due to be presented on 9 October.  I can assure the Deputy of my ongoing commitment to achieve the best possible result for the arts and culture sector within the parameters set out in the summer economic statement and mid-year expenditure report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

I had the pleasure of hosting the group in Leinster House to make a presentation on its pre-budget submission.  As an umbrella organisation which represents the arts across the country, it is concerned about how the roadmap has been set out by the Government and the stated objective of doubling the investment.  Doubling the investment is a commitment and a real promise which artists took with all sincerity.  However, the National Campaign for the Arts is concerned that there might be a dilution of the commitment by combining capital and current expenditure.  While the announcement on capital investment through Project Ireland 2040 is welcome, there is no point in having stages without actors, galleries without art or exhibition spaces without exhibits.  Will the Minister make a firm commitment to double expenditure on arts through current expenditure in the next seven years?</p></speech>

Funding is allocated on a yearly basis.  Current expenditure in 2017 was &euro;237 million, which went up to &euro;249 million in 2018, an increase of 5%.  Capital expenditure in 2017 was &euro;51 million, which went up to &euro;54 million in 2018, an increase of 5.8%.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the work of the Arts Council.  Work is also done by the cultural institutions, including by the National Library of Ireland and other project developments under the national development plan.  We also want to support the endeavours of Creative Ireland in enabling the creative potential of each child, in enabling cultural creativity in every community, in investing in cultural infrastructure, as well as in having Ireland as a centre of excellence for media production and unifying its global reputation in that regard.  We have seen a steady increase during the years and I will do everything I can to assist.</p></speech>

The doubling of current expenditure is where it is at for artists and the National Campaign for the Arts.  The Minister alluded to the Arts Council which we know plays a pivotal role in delivering funding to artists.  There is a good working relationship between artists and the Arts Council.  That autonomy and the arm's length principle the Arts Council has established and maintains with artists across the country are important.  For that reason, the National Campaign for the Arts has asked that in the upcoming budget increased funding of &euro;13.2 million be made available to the Arts Council to bring back to its spend in 2008, &euro;82 million.  It is important that we remain focused on the council.  There is a good working relationship and good faith between it and artists.  It is important that it be maintained and that the Government has faith to ensure the Arts Council will receive the money it needs to do its job.</p></speech>

The moneys my Department has given to it have increased significantly in the past few years and I will be endeavouring to obtain as much as I can this year.  It is important to stress, however, that the spend in 2008 was probably unsustainable.  While I am endeavouring to ensure I will get as much funding as I can, it is important that we remember the context.  The national development plan is limited to capital investment and does not consider current funding for artists and arts organisations which is distributed by the Arts Council.</p><p>That said, there are vital links between the Arts Council's work and the delivery of my Department's culture and creativity investment programme under the plan.  It is important that we support the artists on the ground.  They are the people who need our assistance most.  That is something very close to my heart in my role as Minister, but there is an arm's length principle in that regard.  I have to try to secure as much as I can for my Department to implement our commitment to double funding over the next seven years, and within that will be an allocation to the Arts Council.  I will do all I can to endeavour to do that.</p></speech>

Irish workers are known throughout the world for their skill and their craft.  It is our objective as a party to build, strengthen and improve the experience of all the stakeholders within the sector and to grow it further.  To that end, last July, an all-party Oireachtas committee carried out significant research on the film industry in Ireland and produced a report with 11 key recommendations to reform the industry.  It identified significant difficulties that needed to be reformed.  What steps has the Minister taken to implement these reforms?</p></reply>

I note it was launched last July just a few weeks after the Government published its audiovisual action plan.  Both the committee's report and the action plan have similar objectives in that they both seek to develop and improve employment in the audiovisual industry.</p>  <p>  The committee's report highlights the fact that "Section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish Film Industry" and that it should "remain central in the industry into the future".  Likewise the audiovisual action plan identifies section 481 as a "critical support for the Irish production sector, generating jobs, and providing a strong value proposition for the public purse".  There is significant overlap across recommendations of the action plan and the Oireachtas committee report, of which the Deputy is probably aware, particularly in the areas of section 481 and training.</p>  <p>  One of the key inputs to the audiovisual action plan is a report by international audiovisual consultants Olsberg SPI with Nordicity that identified the challenges faced by the Irish audiovisual industry and provided policy responses.  One of the consultant's key recommendations was the establishment of an oversight steering group charged with the overall implementation of the plan's recommendations. This steering group has been established and has met twice since the action plan was published last July.  The group includes representatives of all Departments and State agencies with involvement in the audiovisual industry.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the report of the Oireachtas committee was discussed at the recent meeting of the steering group which took place on 27 September.  This included discussions regarding the importance of section 481, compliance of the industry with aspects of tax and employment law, and the holding of specific conferences and workshops to consider the development of the industry, including the need for an appropriate forum to consider employment issues.  Further work is being carried out on all these initiatives and announcements in regard to them will be made in due course.  The steering group will report to me at regular intervals.  I thank the Deputy for his question.</p></speech>

Recently, as the Minister will know, Mel Gibson's attorneys have accused the producer of "The Professor and the Madman" of seeking to swindle Ireland's tax authorities.  Allegations have been made that expenses related to the making of the film have been inflated so that the amount of tax relief achieved by the film is higher than it should be and, therefore, the workers and the taxpayers of this country would be at a loss if those allegations are true.   If they are true, it means that section 481 is not rigid enough.  There has been a review of section 481 by another Department recently.  The Minister might advise the D&aacute;il the results of that review.  Did it seek to close those loopholes?</p>  <p>  The report also contains the finding that &euro;73 million of section 481 relief is concentrated within 12 companies.  That was considered to be a very uneven spread of that tax relief and that this relief might be militating against jobs coming to Ireland due to the oligopolistic nature of the Irish producers sector.  The committee called for an international comparative study.  Perhaps the Minister will commit here today to the carrying out of an international comparative study with regard to the way in which section 481 could be strengthened.</p></speech>

I am not going to comment on any specifics the Deputy mentioned regarding section 481.  That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and others to investigate, but suffice it to say section 481 film relief is a very valuable asset to the film industry in Ireland.  It is one of the primary mechanisms by which the Government supports the film industry and attracts new film projects to Ireland.  The existing scheme concludes on 31 December 2020.  It provides support in the form of a corporation tax credit related to the cost of film production.  The minimum amount that must be spent on the production is &euro;250,000 and the eligible expenditure amount to qualify is &euro;125,000.  The extension of section 481 beyond 2020 and its administration will be considered further in light of the recommendations arising from the consultant's report.</p><p>I remind the Deputy of the key points of the audiovisual action plan.  One of the recommendations was to consider extending section 481 tax relief as well as increasing the expenditure ceiling, revising the regulations and, <i>inter alia</i>, extending the relief to Ireland's games sector<i>.</i></p></speech>

The Minister mentioned training in the first part of her response.  I am still receiving allegations of production companies crewing their staff with a massive number of trainees to try to keep down their crew costs.  That is a difficulty that is happening in some elements of the industry.  One of the recommendations in our report related to the disconnect between craft grades and the Irish Film Board.  I mentioned to the Minister previously that someone from the craft grades should be nominated as a member of the Irish Film Board to ensure there would be proper communications between all elements of the industry here.</p>  <p>  Last March and again in July, I mentioned to the Minister the idea that a film forum would be set up as part of Screen Ireland.  I do not believe that has happened yet, and I ask the Minister to push for that as well.</p>  <p>  Also, the precarious nature of workers within the sector is a grievance.  The Minister mentioned there would be an examination of that element.  I urge her to ensure that work within the sector is not precarious because, when it is precarious, serious problems such as the exploitation of workers can arise.  Given we are funding the sector so much, there should be zero tolerance of any exploitation.</p></speech>

As we know, new legislation from the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will address all of these issues.  Protections for workers in the film industry will be part of that legislation she will bring forward.</p><p>There will also be improved training and education as a key objective of the audiovisual action plan.  Screen Ireland has taken steps to strengthen its training arm.  It is also considering the practical issues around the establishment of a suitable forum, which is something that could be considered also.  The Olsberg report identified the importance of section 481 in underpinning the Irish industry.  The Department of Finance is undertaking an economic analysis of the relief.  We have to make sure, however, that people who are working, even if it is on an <i>ad hoc</i>or on a loose contract basis, are protected regardless of the industry they are working in, but especially in the film industry.</p></speech>

Yesterday morning, I was with film workers outside Ardmore Studios where they were protesting.  They say there is no industry.  There is an awful lot of money going into the hands of ten or 12 companies who employ next to nobody.  The workers who worked on production after production for those same companies for ten, 15 or 20 years have been disowned by the companies and have no security of employment.  This is precarious employment and a denial of rights.  These workers have asked to meet the Minister but she has refused a meeting.  They say they are now being blacklisted because they are insisting on the quality of employment that was promised under the legislation, which was supposed to be attached to section 481 tax relief.  How will the Minister respond to them?</p></reply>

The committee's report and the audiovisual action plan have significant overlap and share the objectives of developing the Irish audiovisual industry and improving employment within it, which goes to the heart of the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  A steering group has been established to implement the audiovisual action plan and has already met twice since the action plan was published.  The group includes representatives of all Departments and State agencies that have an interest or involvement in the audiovisual industry.</p><p>The report of the joint committee was discussed at the recent meeting of the steering group on 27 September. This included discussions regarding the importance of section 481, compliance of the industry with aspects of tax and employment law, and the holding of specific conferences and workshops to consider the development of the industry, including the need for an appropriate forum to consider employment issues.  Further work is being carried out on all these initiatives and announcements in regard to them will be made in due course.  The steering group will report to me at regular intervals.</p> <p> On the specific details supplied by the Deputy, it is important to note that employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.  I draw attention to legislation being brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  This legislation responds specifically to the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  I am happy to report that the Bill completed Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il on 12 July 2018 and it is anticipated that it will be introduced in the Seanad this autumn.</p></speech>

We need to consider matters such as Mel Gibson suing a company that has produced a film, stating that the producers benefiting from section 481 tax relief are defrauding that tax relief by artificially inflating costs and expenses and milking the taxpayer.  That is a very serious matter.</p>  <p>  Business cannot continue as usual when there are workers outside Ardmore Studios who say, and I have seen evidence to back this up, they are being blacklisted, even though they have worked for many years for these production companies which are getting &euro;80 million a year from these loans, grants and section 481 tax relief which are intended to give employment.  The GMB and the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, has asked to meet the Minister.  Will she meet them to hear what they have to say?</p></speech>

It delivers training programmes for the film industry and approximately 500 participants take part in the training every year.  I am committed to ensuring that any requirements related to training deliver good quality outcomes for trainees in return for generous tax credits provided by the Government.  I am not going to comment on Mel Gibson's issue.  That is a matter for him.</p></speech>

The Department will address the issue of training by working closely with Screen Ireland and having regard to the recommendations of the Crowe Horwath report.  Over the past two years there have been sporadic industrial relations incidents made manifest through protests by film workers outside film sets and various Oireachtas offices.  Screen Ireland is addressing that and I hope that a forum will develop from that in which all the stakeholders can be involved and through which they can come to an amicable resolution.</p></speech>

She is obviously meeting Screen Ireland.  Will she meet these workers, who have asked to meet her, to hear their side of the story?  It is a direct question and I wish she would answer it.  Unless she gets all the stakeholders involved in this discussion, she is not being serious about trying to address the problems.</p>  <p>  The Mel Gibson action is very serious.  That could shred our international reputation, never mind the fact that serious sums of public money are involved.  That needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency.  Whatever about the individual case, we need to establish whether there are loopholes that can be exploited and are being exploited.  Something needs to be done about the fact that we are putting &euro;80 million into an industry and there is no standing workforce.  A child could take &euro;80 million and employ a few hundred people or 1,000 people for a year, but there is no standing workforce.  It is, so to speak, a hire 'em and fire 'em workforce.  If anyone dares say a word about their rights, compliance with EU directives or the working time directive, and if he or she does not sign up to certain agreements that are imposed on him or her, that person is blacklisted.  That cannot go on.</p></speech>

They were convened in the context of a production downturn, and attendees included trade unions and Screen Producers Ireland and, in some instances, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and RTE.  These meetings referred to an industry forum.  They ceased when production activity picked up.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht met five organisations in January and February of this year.  These organisations included Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, SIPTU, the IFWA and the GMB union.  SIPTU disputed in writing some of the evidence given to the committee by GMB and the IFWA.  It is clear that there is an inter-union rivalry on some issues.  Nonetheless there are good reasons for holding an industry forum, as called for in the July report on developments and working conditions in the Irish film industry as published.  There is validity in that.  There is a willingness to put this in place and the Department has been in discussions with Screen Ireland in this regard.  Consideration has been given to the most appropriate mechanism to convene a forum and a possible role for an independent chair.  The matter will be discussed at a meeting planned with Screen Ireland on 27 October.</p></speech>

The Government has committed &euro;15 million towards the funding of Galway 2020 as European City of Culture.  As outlined in my response to Question No. 21 of 21 June 2018, the Department provided a first tranche of funding in 2017 amounting to &euro;250,000 to Galway 2020 towards certified expenditure incurred by Galway 2020.</p>  <p>  A performance delivery agreement to set out the mutual responsibilities of Galway 2020 and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the terms of the drawdown of the funds under the agreement, is being progressed by officials in the Department.  They are working closely with the Galway 2020 team to put in place the agreement, as well as support it in its work to deliver a strong culture programme in 2020.  In this regard, officials from the Department will be meeting senior management from Galway 2020 next week and I expect that the agreement will be signed this month.</p>  <p>  The stepping down of the creative director in May and, more recently, the chief executive officer, CEO, has been a cause for concern.  I will talk to the Deputy in the supplementary replies about the new chief executive who has been appointed.  This has created uncertainty around the mechanisms for the delivery phase of the project and did not assist the finalisation of the performance delivery agreement.  I and the officials are engaging on an ongoing basis to assist in resolving the current difficulties.</p>  <p>  In this regard I met the chairperson of the Galway 2020 board on 13 September to discuss recent developments, including the stepping down of the CEO, who has only today been replaced, and cultural leadership plans.  I advised the chairperson that I wish to see the leadership matters resolved as quickly as possible in order that Galway 2020 can move forward to focus on the delivery of what is an ambitious and exciting programme for the year.  While I share the concern regarding the recent difficulties, I am confident that the issues can be resolved.  Significant public resources are being provided for this year.</p></speech>

I want her to clarify who has been appointed today.  The question I asked, further to previous questions, was how much money has been given to date.  The Minister referred to &euro;250,000 at a particular time.  The concerns did not arise today or yesterday but have been ongoing for some time.  Serious questions arise concerning the manner of the exit of a number of key personnel and whether money was involved in exit packages.</p>  <p>  It is not my job today to discuss the content.  It is my job to ask questions about robust management structures, which the Minister has not answered.  We know from the debacle of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema that there was a lack of governance and management by the Department.  A post-project review is planned for that in the coming year.  Lessons have apparently been learned and more will be learned.  What has delayed the performance delivery agreement?  It was due immediately after I last questioned the Minister, which was some time ago.  Why has the agreement not been signed?  Who has been appointed today?  What is the position regarding the Irish language officer?  These are simple, practical questions which will help to instil confidence.  I would appreciate if the Minister could answer them.</p></speech>

She was director of services in Galway City Council.  She stated in a press release issued today that she is very excited about working with Galway 2020, a project which has been close to her heart, and she looks forward to working with the team to make it an exceptional year for County Galway and the council.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's specific questions, the performance delivery agreement is being drawn up by the Department in consultation with Galway 2020.  The resignations that occurred slowed down the process.  I, as Minister, expressed my concern to Aideen McGinley when she came in and she accepts that this has to be expedited.  The delivery agreement sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of the Department in the provision and expenditure of the grant, key deliverables, performance indicators, the drawdown of the grant and the monitoring and reporting arrangements to be put in place.  As we move into the delivery phase, Galway 2020 is signing contracts with organisations, artists and performers and it is expected that it will announce many of the contracted performances under the programme in a showcase event in November.  With regard to funding, as I stated, the Department provided a first tranche of &euro;250,000 in December 2017 towards certified expenditure already incurred for Galway 2020.</p></speech>

I come from a bilingual city, chathair dh&aacute;theangach.  I asked the Minister a specific question about the Irish language officer.  It would have been helpful if she had responded.  With regard to governance structures, if we have learned anything, even with the most recent debacle relating to the President's Establishment and expenses, we want robust structures that we can rely on.  It is good to meet with the chairperson but alongside that we need robust management structures.  The Committee of Public Accounts is retrospectively examining a project that became a debacle, namely, the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema, a public building which is now under a private entity.  We are all very proud of Galway, the multicultural city that it is and its bilingual status, but this is not coming across in Galway 2020.  Recently, the company failed to provide a spokesperson for a discussion in Irish on a radio station.  I am reluctantly raising this matters because I am proud Galwegian who is very happy that the city will be European Capital of Culture in 2020.  However, I will certainly not remain quiet when I see a number of people walking out a door with no questions being asked or properly replied to.  Is the Minister confirming that no money other than the &euro;250,000 has been provided?</p></speech>

The majority of Government committed funding will flow over 2019 and 2020 with the remaining amount to be provided in 2021.  These final funding figures will be agreed with me in the current period.  It is difficult to answer all the Deputy's questions given the time constraints.  I can provide her with a full written response to her questions.  I appreciate and understand her concerns.  I want Galway 2020 to be a success.  Robust structures have to be put in place and I am determined that will be the case.</p>  <p>  Senior management of Galway 2020 are in the process of finalising a job specification for the Irish language officer which will issue shortly.  The recruitment of an Irish language officer is part of the delivery phase of the programme currently progressing.  The bid book, which sets out the planned programme for the year as part of Ireland's bid to the European Commission for the European Capital of Culture, identified language as one of its three key themes.  As Irish is a key element of Galway's cultural identity, it is important that the project has an Irish language officer.  The process to appoint the officer is taking place.  It is also important to note that the EU has a monitoring role and regularly monitors expenditure on the success of Galway 2020.</p></speech>

This working group meets regularly and is currently working on a draft of the conservation management plan.  The new plan will inform a list of priority conservation and site management actions and measures for the lands that are in State ownership and inform future interventions on the site, aided by the ongoing monitoring of visitor numbers by the OPW.</p>  <p>  The online survey was available to the public between 21 March and 15 May and I am pleased to note that it received approximately 400 submissions.  It was undertaken for my Department by the Heritage Council and was widely advertised online and through social media by the organisations engaged with the steering group.  The survey was designed to identify what members of the public value most about the Hill of Tara, what they perceive as the issues with the site and what they suggest needs to be done to preserve it for the future.  The results of the public survey will help to inform the conservation management plan and will, therefore, be a very valuable input.  The results will be made available as an appendix to the plan when it is published.  The survey responses show clearly that Tara means many things to many people and that the perceptions of the site vary from it being an accessible amenity and recreation area for surrounding communities, to it being a site that attracts many visitors and tourists from around the globe and a place of great heritage significance and symbolism.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the conservation management plan will identify conservation priorities for the site and guide future investment decisions in visitor and interpretation facilities that are compatible with its international standing and significance.  The plan will address on-site archaeological and natural heritage protection and outline actions to mitigate its vulnerabilities and promote its conservation for future generations.</p></speech>

The priorities of my constituents are the same as my own.  As the Minister mentioned, one priority is to recognise the international and Irish importance of this site.  Another is to recognise that this has been a community of people since the dawn of time, one which continues today.  We are not looking for a repeat of the Tara Skryne landscape conservation plan which generated so much anger in the local community without delivering any benefit for the site.  Apart from the preservation of the site, which the Minister needs to provide for urgently, what people want most is for basic facilities to be provided at the Tara site.  Some of these would be the responsibility of the Department and the Office of Public, while others would be the responsibility of Meath County Council.  I welcome the establishment of a steering group but it cannot become a talking shop.  It must deliver results for the Hill of Tara and the surrounding community, who love it and know it best.</p></speech>

Policies arising from it will be aimed at ensuring the long-term preservation of the site balanced with its enjoyment by the public.  The steering group has been gathering information about the significance of Tara.  It has met six times and it will meet again on 2 October of this year.  Deputy Thomas Byrne outlined some of the concerns.  The main issues of concern that arise through the visitor surveys include vulnerability of the archaeology and the need to protect it, visitor footfall, car parking and traffic management, the use of the site for recreation by local groups and dog walkers, and the need for an enhanced interpretation strategy for the monuments.  Some of the issues listed, namely, car parking and traffic management, are primarily the responsibility of Meath County Council while the OPW has responsibility for day-to-day management of the site and visitor facilities.  The Tara conservation management plan steering group is currently translating the issues and concerns into long-term sustainable policies for the site.</p></speech>

They are what we need but we also need the action to follow the words.  I will continue to press the Minister and her Department to deliver on the plan.</p>  <p>  I have one concern relating to the Minister's reply.  She mentioned that Meath County Council is responsible for parking and roads.  That may well be factually the case in terms of its responsibility outside the site but I somewhat disagree about parking.  I am not sure how the council is responsible for parking although it is certainly responsible for roads.  What has happened on the Hill of Tara for a number of years is that we have heard one area is the responsibility of the Government through Meath County Council, something else is the responsibility of the OPW and another area again is the responsibility of the Department.  A single-track approach is required.  I am confident that is being led by the Minister currently, but I am concerned about an element of passing the buck that is beginning to creep into the debate.  That cannot happen.  The Minister's words today, which I by and large agree with, must be met with resources.  This is our most important heritage site.  It is beautiful and is steeped in the lore of this country.  The site is so valued by people all over the world that we must do it right.  The situation at Tara is shameful compared to Newgrange and many other monuments all around the country.</p></speech>

I raised this issue with the Minister last January.  At the time I tried to impress upon her the importance of the Hill of Tara in historical and archaeological terms and in terms of the Irish psyche.  A quarter of a million people and 1,000 buses go to the Hill of Tara every year.  Last January we had the same type of conversation and the situation has not moved on in the meantime.  Virtually no progress has been made on the Hill of Tara.</p>  <p>  A survey is being carried out currently.  I am told a traffic survey was carried out last weekend.  However, it was done after the summer season ended so the figures will not be reflective of the amount of people who go up on the hill during the summer.  I believe a local business person and private individuals are running the car parks at the site.  One of the car parks was closed over the weekend, which caused chaos in the system there.</p>  <p>  Currently the council has no real development plan for the Hill of Tara.  The site is only functioning through the hard work and dedication of the local community.  The situation there is currently a disaster.</p></speech>

The steering group has met six times.  It is chaired by the chief archaeologist of the National Monuments Service.  A draft plan has already been produced and a plan will be ready by the end of 2018.  The steering group is anxious to finalise the policies by that deadline.  Any delay in meeting the deadline will be necessitated by ensuring the quality of the policies and their long-term sustainability.  The draft plan outlines the methodologies of the plan, its strategic objectives and the consultation process.  It states the significance of Tara, which both Deputy Byrne and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n pointed out.  It is the symbolic capital of Ireland.  We accept that and that is why the work has to be done in such a way that it balances the protection of the site as well as managing the traffic, which is primarily the responsibility of Meath County Council.  However, the issue needs to be examined.  The plan contains policies for the conservation of the site as well.  The policies and implementation strategies have not yet been agreed but the group is currently discussing those issues with the aim of finalising the plan by the end of 2018.  I will meet with the group on 2 October 2018.</p></speech>

The potential of the waterway is not being realised to any significant extent.  As the Minister is aware, feasibility studies have been carried out into the possibility of making that stretch of water navigable.  The Minister indicated to me in reply to a previous parliamentary question that Waterways Ireland would engage with Cavan County Council and local interests on the possibility of developing a blueway on that stretch of water.  Could the Minister indicate to me how those plans are progressing?  I have a second question on a related subject.</p></reply>

Waterways Ireland manages and maintains the navigation on the River Erne in County Cavan as part of the Shannon&ndash;Erne Waterway.  Waterways Ireland public jetties are provided in both Belturbet and Kilconny - Deputy Smith should forgive me if I mispronounce the name - and the navigation channel is provided with navigation markers and signage, as and where required.  The upper limit of the managed navigation on the River Erne is currently just below Erne Bridge between Belturbet and Kilconny.</p>  <p>  While there is no specific legal obligation on Waterways Ireland to deliver a navigation plan for the Lough Oughter complex, the preparation of a draft navigation plan was initiated in line with the organisation's overall recreational remit in 2008.  Waterways Ireland initiated a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, of this draft plan to establish a new navigation on Lough Oughter from Belturbet to Killashandra.</p>  <p>  The SEA process indicated that considerable environmental and hydrological assessment would be required to complete any proposed Lough Oughter navigation plan.  The expenditure necessary to carry out this work is estimated to be in the region of &euro;300,000 and the result is likely to confirm the initial assessment that significant environmental impact will occur to the designated Lough Oughter habitat and a works project would not be permitted under current environmental regulations.</p>  <p>  There may however be potential in the waters of the Lough Oughter area being promoted as a distinct blueway.  While I understand from Waterways Ireland that it has no plans to develop a blueway in Lough Oughter, Blueways Ireland, a group that includes the National Trails Office, Canoeing Ireland and a range of other State bodies which is involved in, or with an interest in the development of blueways is currently considering the establishment of blueways beyond the Waterways Ireland network of inland waterways.</p>  <p>  To that end Waterways Ireland has met with the chief executive of Cavan County Council, council officials and elected representatives concerning blueways developed successfully on the Waterways Ireland network to advise on possible ways forward.  Waterways Ireland is happy to support Cavan County Council with advice should it decide to develop a blueway on the River Erne from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killashandra.</p></speech>

I was told in the late 1980s that it was not feasible from an engineering point of view to restore the then Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, which became the Shannon-Erne waterway and has been phenomenally successful, as the Minister is aware.  The studies should be revisited on the basis that, given the progress of engineering technology, it may be possible for that stretch of water to be made a navigable continuation of the Shannon-Erne waterway.   I appeal to the Minister to ask Waterways Ireland to revisit the issue.</p>  <p>  Another issue related to the development of blueways is that Waterways Ireland only has jurisdiction over navigable waterways.  The stretch we are discussing is not currently navigable.  Therefore, Waterways Ireland would not be responsible for developing the blueway.  It would be preferable for it to be the project promoter of a blueway in view of the fact that it is hoped the waterway will be made navigable.  I ask the Minister to go back to Waterways Ireland to ask it about the possibility of having the studies revisited and the position in the development of blueways.</p></speech>

Studies were carried out in 2008 and 2009 when the strategic environmental assessment was completed.  It became clear in the initial gathering of information that the changes in water levels necessary to create navigation would be unacceptable in the proposed area in view of its level of international conservation designations.  The lough has several international conservation designations, including being a candidate for a special area of conservation, a special protection area, a proposed natural heritage area, a Ramsar site and a Natura 2000 site.  There are several national and local monuments and sites of historical and archaeological interest in the Lough Oughter area.  The initial work also identified the costs associated with completing the studies to which I alluded in my original statement and which would be required for the strategic environmental assessment to be carried out.  No further studies have been carried out, which has raised such a level of concern for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.</p></speech>

However, the restoration of the canal has been of benefit to drainage in the area.  We were told that the opposite would be the case before the work was carried out.  The project was given the go-ahead in 1989, at a time when North-South and east-west relations were very difficult.  We may think we have difficult relations with Britain, but that was an entirely different era.  The Minister is aware from her visits to County Monaghan and other parts of the country of the success of the Shannon-Erne waterway.  The Ulster Canal will now join the network.  The addition of the stretch to which I have referred will be a significant complementary asset in the inland waterways system.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to Waterways Ireland to ask it to have further studies carried out and to bear in mind that the same concerns were raised in 1989 about the then Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.  I have no doubt that, in the light of the progress of engineering technology, the project could be made a reality.</p></speech>

Cumann Seanchais Bhreifne is a local historical group in the area which spends much of its time imparting knowledge of the rich heritage of Lough Oughter.  Last summer it brought 50 or 60 people on a tour of the area.  Speaking as a person from County Cavan, I learned a great deal on the tour.  The lough has huge tourism potential for the county and its rich heritage must be maintained and developed.  It is of great importance for the Minister to do whatever she can in support of my colleague's request.</p></speech>

I will pass on their observations to Waterways Ireland which will be updated on the matter.  It was clear when the studies were carried out that the project could not proceed as the environmental damage to the conserved area would be unacceptable and that spending further resources on further studies would be fruitless.  There does not currently appear to be a viable option.  However, we can re-examine the issue and I will pass on the request to Waterways Ireland.  As the Deputies have pointed out, blueways confer benefits in terms of recreational activity.  As I stated, Waterways Ireland is responsible for 1,000 km of navigable inland waterways, principally for recreational purposes.  Waterways Ireland is continuing work in the Deputies' constituency with Monaghan County Council, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and many other councils in the area to maximise what we can do in terms of blueways and greenways.  It is also progressing a project which received Government approval in 2015, namely, to open a navigation on a 2.5 km stretch of the River Finn from the Erne navigation to the international scout centre at Castle Saunderson in County Cavan.</p></speech>

The programme is led by local authorities, each of which has established a cross-sectoral culture team led by a Creative Ireland co-ordinator.  In that regard, this year my Department allocated &euro;2 million, while the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated &euro;1 million to the 31 local authorities.  That has allowed us to allocate approximately &euro;96,000 to each local authority which has enabled them to support an extensive programme of activities, initiatives and events in each county. </p><p>So far in 2018, over 400 initiatives around Ireland have been funded under pillar 2 of the programme, a significant increase on the figure for 2017.  The initiatives include a range of multi-disciplinary projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, workshops and other activities.  They cover a wide range of topics such as archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, dance, film, history, literature, music, photography, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts.  In Deputy Niamh Smyth's area, very exciting and innovative projects are being pursued such as song writing workshops in Breifne College in Cavan town and innovative theatre projects which bring work onto the streets of Cavan to get as many people involved in culture and creativity as possible.  County Monaghan also has an exciting programme of events, with some great initiatives for children and young people such as the Creative Enterprise showcase for primary schools.  Such activities form part of each local authority's five-year culture and creative strategies which were launched by me, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on 12 September.  The strategies highlight the critical role local authorities play as providers and enablers of cultural and creative experiences in communities across Ireland, with all of the vitally important social and economic consequences that follow.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>With collaboration and shared purpose at the heart of the Creative Ireland programme, each strategy provides meaningful opportunities for people and their communities, together with the local authority, to build and nurture a creative society.  The strategies are available online and my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and I look forward to supporting their continued implementation.</p></speech>

That said, I am very interested in what has been achieved in practical terms.  The Minister mentioned conferences, courses, festivals, grants and so on, but I ask her to address the specifics of the commitments given in the programme.</p><p>Pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland programme is entitled Enabling Every Community.  There are six specific commitments under that pillar, one of which is Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca.  As the Minister will be aware, Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca was very successful in its first term and I understood it was intended to be rolled out every year.  However, it was scrapped and in its place Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, an event to celebrate creativity for children, was introduced.  Will the Minister set out the roadmap for the way these events, projects, concerts and conferences are being measured in terms of what they are achieving?  What measuring tool is the Minister using to determine if they are achieving the criteria and objectives set out by Creative Ireland in the first place?</p></speech>

These are the programmes for Cavan and Monaghan, and both the cathaoirleach of Cavan County Council, Councillor Madeleine Argue, and the cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Councillor Cathy Bennett, set out their ambitious targets for their culture plans, which we launched recently.</p>  <p>  We spent &euro;1,25 million on Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca in 2017.  This year, we had Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g on 23 June.  Additional funding of &euro;650,000 was given to the local authorities.  The local authorities must account for how they spend the moneys we give to them, which is growing every year.  It involves all of the community and many moving parts to encourage children, the elderly and everybody to be creative and explore their imagination and innovation in terms of culture.</p></speech>

I spoke to many artists and there is a concern, which I mentioned previously to the Minster, that Creative Ireland might not have the arm's length approach that is respected and understood to be happening within the Arts Council.  To return to the question, the most important aspect of any funding streams is delivery but also to analyse the projects being delivered to determine if they are meeting the aims and criteria in terms of what they were set up to do.  What is the Minister's measuring tool to ensure that Creative Ireland and the programme pillars are achieving what they set out to do?</p></speech>

The legacy programme of Creative Ireland has been a success in terms of the five pillars to enable every child to have access to tuition in music, drama, art and coding.  That is the first pillar.  The Deputy delineated a question specifically on enabling creativity in every community.  Each local authority produced a culture and creativity plan last year.  We have the breakdown of the spend on Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca, which, as I said, was &euro;1.25 million.  The local authority partnership last year was &euro;1 million, and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gave &euro;1 million, so they got &euro;64,000 each.  We will increase that.</p>  <p>  The spend on the citizen engagement was &euro;900,000.  We have a breakdown of that.  The figure for the events, festivals and partnerships was &euro;490,000.  The spend on digital content was &euro;400,000, online-international was &euro;200,000, and administrative was &euro;500,000, making a grand total of &euro;5 million for last year.</p>  <p>  It is an all-of-Government initiative, primarily delivered through existing structures.  The Arts Council has its role.  There is no competing in that regard.  The Arts Council is at arm's length.  It is up to it how it spends its money.  There is also the film board, the relevant Departments and the local authorities.  The objectives are delivered.  The Arts Council gets funding every year to deliver its objectives, one of which is Making Great Art Work.</p></speech>

It will provide a coherent national heritage policy, recognising its importance to local communities and global visitors alike.  Community engagement will lie at the heart of Heritage Ireland 2030, reflecting the values, visions and concerns of our citizens, communities, farmers, tourists and businesses.  It will provide the opportunity for stakeholders to engage with our heritage, building on the priorities and key investment targets set out in Investing in our Culture, Heritage and Language.</p><p>A steering group headed up by my Department has been engaged in consultation with key stakeholders throughout the year to gauge and inform thinking on the broad pillars of the Heritage Ireland 2030 plan and to help to frame the public consultation process.</p><p>It is a revitalised national heritage plan.  It will provide the overarching framework for Ireland&rsquo;s heritage policy, reflecting and recognising its importance to local communities and global visitors alike.  Ultimately, community engagement will lie at the core of Heritage Ireland 2030, reflecting the values, visions and concerns of our citizens, communities, farmers, tourists and businesses.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the consultations with key stakeholders, and this critical phase is now nearing completion.  The steering group has facilitated inputs by many partners by extending the original closing date for submissions.  The resulting engagement has identified additional needs and opportunities across the broad built and natural heritage space, building on the priorities and key investment targets previously set out in Investing in our Culture, Heritage and Language launched earlier this year. To gather the views of the wider community, a public consultation document informed by the stakeholder engagement is being drafted by the steering group.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The development of Heritage Ireland 2030 is a unique opportunity to rethink how we care for our habitats, landscapes, wildlife, historic buildings and monuments so they can be celebrated and enjoyed long into the future.  It is my intention to start the public consultation phase in November 2018 with the aim that it will conclude in spring 2019 and that finalisation of the plan will be achieved in the period following.</p><p>Our heritage is recognised as a vital contributor to national health, well-being, enjoyment and sustainable economic growth.  There is also ever-increasing public awareness of the immense inherent value of Ireland's heritage and more and more stakeholder buy-in to its protection.  Heritage Ireland 2030 will therefore provide an important policy framework within which we can protect, develop and share our national heritage.</p></reply>

Funding will be a key element of any plan.  As we provide more money under Project Ireland 2040, good schemes such as the built heritage investment scheme will require increased investment as we emerge from the lost decade.  These are very good schemes but they have not been able to do what we would like them to do due to the lack of funding.  Resources for schemes are crucial, as is investment in the key staff who deliver them.  Most local authorities have one heritage officer and one conservation officer, who do great work.  They are very busy and are critical in terms of the community engagement piece.  They are well placed on the ground to work with community groups.  In my experience of dealing with graveyard committees and other small voluntary groups, the community-led groups do much of that work, but the heritage professionals in the council tend to be that link.  They are very busy and consideration will have to be given to giving them extra resources and staff to make sure they can do the great work they do in working with the community groups who do the work on the ground.</p></speech>

Resources are critical in terms of implementing our objectives for any plan, particularly an ambitious plan like Heritage 2030.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, in his constituency in Kildare, in 2017, funding of &euro;71,680 was given towards the built heritage investment scheme, and the figure for the structure at risk fund was &euro;53,000.  In 2018, funding for the built heritage investment scheme was &euro;50,000, and &euro;66,000 for the structure at risk fund.  Overall, we have provided funding of &euro;3.3 million for 431 projects throughout the country in 2018.  Some of those have been completed but the majority are on site.  There are sites bustling with activity across every local authority in the country where we can see specialist heritage trades and crafts being put to good use in saving and restoring our historic buildings.  These two schemes have funded 920 projects since the start of 2017 across every local authority in the country, 767 under the built heritage investment scheme and 153 under the structure at risk fund.</p>  <p>  The historic towns initiative was also rolled out nationwide for the first time in 2018.  Six towns have shared in &euro;1 million in funding via the Heritage Council.</p></speech>

The heritage officers work closely with the local community groups, and the scheme has been very successful, which shows the value of putting in money and investment.</p><p>On the Department engaging with heritage professionals in every county, they are key stakeholders and if they have not been consulted, they should be part of the public consultation process or a consultation process of their own.  The small built heritage and cultural heritage projects are great, but it will be hard in 2030 to identify how successful the plan will have been because of all the small schemes.  It is really important that consideration be given to undertaking some large-scale flagship projects.  An example I can think of in County Kildare is the Curragh Plains, a 5,000 acre expanse of land that covers everything in the built heritage and the cultural heritage.  It is an outwash where St. Brigid threw her cloak and, from the Race of the Black Pig to Donnelly's Hollow to the Little Curragh, there are so many stories.  It is an area of which we are extremely proud in County Kildare and many Kildare people use it for recreational purposes.  It is a huge tourist attraction, but it is not well managed.  We need an active conservation and management plan.  It is of key importance to incorporate such a flagship project in Heritage Ireland 2030.</p></speech>

I note the Deputy's comments on integrating the Curragh Plains into the overall strategy for Heritage Ireland 2030.  The consultation process is a critical part of the development of the document and a key stakeholder input has been gathered in the form of written submissions and face to face meetings with organisations such as the Heritage Council, the input of which is crucial in informing the plan.  I am very grateful to the organisations and bodies that have contributed so extensively.  The process is almost complete.  I understand there were bodies still engaged as late as last week and I am sure everyone here will agree that it is very important that they be allowed the time they need to make their contribution.  The open public consultation process will begin in November and include an invitation to make written submissions, social media engagement and a series of regional public workshops which will culminate in a national discussion day, I hope in February 2019.  Publication of the final plan will take place before the end of 2019 and reflect the outcome of all of the consultations.</p></speech>

Under its previous owners, the de Br&uacute;n family, public access to Lough Dan and the surrounding area was guaranteed.  With its sale, there are real fears that any new owner could cut off access to Lough Dan and the surrounding area and that access to this precious piece of our cultural heritage could be lost.

As outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 823 of 18 September, there is no change in my Department's position.  The sale and any apportionment of the property into lots are commercial matters for the vendor.</p><p>Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 ha.  These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country and include a large area of County Wicklow and the 5,000 acres of lands in Glenasmole and the Featherbeds purchased in recent years.  Given the limited resources available for capital investment within the national parks and nature reserves, I recognise the need to focus on the core responsibilities in the management of the existing national parks and reserve lands.  While the lands in question would represent a significant addition to the stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands, my Department could only consider acquiring the property if the price fell to within a certain range,<b></b>or in the context of a donation or bequest.  This is known to the vendors.  Clearly, the Glenasmole purchase of 5,000 acres of land sets a precedent and, although the circumstances pertaining to it are very dissimilar, it is certainly a market factor.  As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to seek to negotiate indirectly or publicly.  Suffice it to say I am absolutely aware of the public good value of the property. </p><p>My Department's relationship with the Guinness estate here and more generally has been positive.  It is one of mutual respect and being good neighbours and often of working together on shared issues of interest.  They include herd management and husbandry, habitat oversight, film-making, signage, visitor accommodation, trail maintenance and designation management.  For the most part, the boundary between the private estate and the national park is invisible to the visitor and tourist, with pre-eminence being given to the idyllic shared land, lake and mountain-scape.  My officials remain in constructive contact with the agents for the vendors in this matter.</p></speech>

There are big petitions ongoing and the matter has been raised a number of times in the House.  It would be completely unacceptable if the area was to be fenced off as private property and become inaccessible.  There would be uproar.  Any restriction of access to the vista at Lough Dan would be totally unacceptable.  We need an assurance that the Minister is going to do something about the matter.  If the house is a problem, can the Minister give security about the surrounding lands, guaranteeing access to Lough Dan, the walks and viewing points?  Will she at least guarantee that they will be taken into public ownership in order that public access to this unique and beautiful piece of our heritage will not be restricted?  If that is allowed to happen, it will be beyond shame.</p></speech>

Question No. 10 in my name is about the same matter.  This is part of the heritage of every Irish person.  It is a place with which people are very familiar.  I am certainly very familiar with it since I was first brought there as a small child.  What I am really upset about is that "private property" signs, as I am sure the Minister is aware, have begun to appear on the road above the lake.  Mountaineering Ireland has written to the Minister specifically about the Luggala estate.  Will she agree to meet its representatives who really look after the mountains?  We also know of a gate beside the estate that is being closed, it appears, at 5.30 p.m.  We know that the owners of the Guinness Trust are resident in the Channel Islands and, I think, Guernsey.  The Luggala estate is a precious piece of our heritage which was magnificently looked after and utilised not just for estate purposes but also for films and music by Garech de Br&uacute;n whose death, sadly, took place recently.  We must not allow a trust in the Channel Islands to decide that the Irish people - men, women and children - should lose what has been part of their heritage practically forever.  The Minister needs to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding petitions - there can, unfortunately, be petitions on many matters - the sale is ultimately a commercial matter between the owners of the property in question and the parties interested in purchasing.  The estate is located near Roundwood and within the vicinity of the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  The lands fall within objective 8 of the management plan for Wicklow Mountains National Park and are adjacent to the 1,600 acres of land the State purchased from the estate in 2006.</p><p>As such they are within the target area where acquisition by the State could be considered.  However, while the estate falls within the core of the park's target area and encompasses some of the most iconic views of Wicklow - it is beautiful, as both the Deputies have described - it would not have the same strategic significance to the National Parks and Wildlife Service as the 2006 lands which linked two unconnected pieces of the national park.  The 2006 purchase, in effect, provided the National Parks and Wildlife Service with a continuous tract of land stretching from the Dublin border to just north of Lugnaquilla Mountain.</p> <p> Given the scarce resources for capital investment available in our national parks and mindful of the need to focus on core responsibilities relating to the management of existing parks, the Department could only consider acquiring this property if the price fell within a certain range.</p></speech>

Some things are too important to simply allow the highest bidder to come along and take them.  As has been mentioned, "private property" signs are appearing on the road with views over Luggala.  That is a very ominous sign of what could come down the line if the State does not step in to secure this site.  It provides value in terms of tourism, walking and access to Lough Dan, and is irreplaceable.  The Government needs to give firm assurances that it will not let this land go to the highest bidder with so much heritage and access for the public going a begging.

While we had lots of sympathy from the Government last week, for example, when the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, took Leaders' Questions, the truth is that this lady had to put herself and her family at considerable risk to achieve the just outcome she deserved.  Thankfully, she has since started college, but the case has left a number of serious issues to be resolved.</p><p>It is important to put on the record some of the issues that came to light during this court case.  Approximately 54,500 students sat the leaving certificate examinations this year.  I am told the State Examinations Commission issued 383,764 grades from approximately 600,000 individual scripts.  The proportion of appeals lodged against grades issued this year is very low, at 9,092 scripts from 5,200 students, or approximately 10%.  When appeals over oral exams are included, I believe the number of items to be corrected on appeal was about 15,000.</p><p>Even though 10% of students and less than 2% of scripts go to appeal, it takes 40 days to recheck the appeals as opposed to 54 days to mark the entire leaving certificate.  This is a system that is not fit for purpose.  A total of 1,652 examiners corrected the scripts at first instance.  This drops to about 400 for the appeals process.  These figures came out during the court hearing and I am grateful to my correspondent who gave me them.  The State Examinations Commission has offered no explanation for the 75% reduction in the number of examiners available for appeal.  Why does that happen?  The judge in the case noted that if the same number of examiners, who had been available for the initial corrections, were available for the appeal, then all the appeal scripts could have been completed in one day.</p><p>Given the facts revealed to us in a court action by a citizen at cost to her family, it is not surprising that Mr. Justice Humphreys stated that the system was &quot;manifestly not fit for purpose&quot;.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs.  I have no wish to make a political football of this because the State Examinations Commission must be seen to be a non-political, impartial, fair judge of the achievements of students in leaving certificate examinations.  However, the Minister and the State Examinations Commission need to get on top of this for next year.</p><p>We need to establish the scale of the issue and some of the facts have been set out very starkly in the court action before Mr. Justice Humphreys.  Many other students are waiting to have their appeals finalised by the second week of October and some of them will also have missed college entry.  We estimate - the Minister might confirm this - that approximately 300 students every year could have their points increased sufficiently to get a particular college place that they otherwise would not have been offered.  This weekend, <i>The Irish Times</i>indicated that several hundred students annually end up securing higher-preference college places.  Is it in the region of 300 students?</p><p>Is this an issue that is linked to business studies or is it a general issue?  As I mentioned in a radio interview, I am certainly aware of another case where marks for a business studies paper were incorrectly moved from the front of the exam paper to the exam sheet.  Is the Minister aware of other cases?  Is there a timeline for a review?  Is the State Examinations Commission appealing this decision?  Is it not accepting the judge's findings?  Crucially, is it paying the costs of Rebecca Carter and her family in this action?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200033#FF02200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I also thank him for withdrawing it last week when I was unable to take it because I wanted to give it seriousness.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that Rebecca Carter got the course she wanted, which is great.  However, the Deputy is right that we do not want young people having to go to court to get access to college courses.  Since the ruling was made, as the Deputy knows, the State Examinations Commission has met.  It arranged for the correction of Ms Carter's paper.  It also has indicated to its executive that it wants an urgent review of the timelines involved.  It is clearly taking responsibility in this.  I have convened for this week a meeting of State Examinations Commission and the higher education institutions to find out how we can resolve the issue.</p>  <p>  As a backdrop to this - I will deal with some of the points the Deputy made - one of the key changes made this year, as the Deputy probably knows, is that UCD issued a decision that students who, after 30 September, got upgrades in their results could not participate in this year's course.</p><p>That was a significant change.  However, as the Deputy rightly said, the case has also revealed long time lags in the appeals process and, while the State Examinations Commission is independent, we will need to look at them.  Some of them start from the process the commission undertakes after 15 August when it issues all scripts back to schools for examination and gives until 5 September for a decision to be made as to whether a case will be appealed.  It then takes from 5 September to 10 October to retrieve the scripts, dispatch them to the examiners and have the examination carried out.  The commission also applies more due diligence or quality assurance to the rechecking than the initial process, with a higher level of re-sampling of scripts corrected.  Clearly, while it is right that the commission has a robust system in place, we have to shorten the timescale.</p> <p> Another factor at play is that, increasingly, colleges are starting their terms much earlier than they used to.  There was a time when they did not start so early and the schedule was in line.  Therefore, UCD makes a reasonable point that a student starting six weeks into a course is going to miss something.  We need to resolve this issue.  I have to recognise the independence of both the colleges in determining their admission policies and the State Examinations Commission, given that this independence is something the public rightly values.  Notwithstanding that, we can do a lot better in shortening the timescale.</p> <p> On the turnover of results, the Deputy is correct.  The level of 9,800 this year is not low and is typical, with 9,500 being the figure for last year and approximately 9,000 for other years.  Some 14.5%, or approximately 1,400, are upgraded.  The figure for those who receive offers is significant, with over 400 receiving offers as a result of an upgrade.  The vast majority take up the offers in the same year, but some opt for deferral to the following year, although this option was not available in UCD as there had been a change.  We can do much better in that regard.  I will be working with the two bodies concerned to make sure we resolve this issue.</p></speech>

I can well understand why some of the higher education institutions want to get this done as early as possible -  I imagine veterinary science, in particular, is one relevant subject - given that there are limits on the numbers of students who can take practical lessons and so on.</p>  <p>  The Minister's key role is to try to join the education system together.  Clearly, in this case, he has allowed it to slide.  UCD was allowed to make the change without any reference to the Minister or the State Examinations Commission, yet the Minister is only calling a meeting to discuss it after the horse has bolted, somebody has put their financial security at risk by taking a High Court action and others have lost out.  However, it happened this year and we cannot blame UCD for it.  The blame really lies with the Minister for not bringing everyone together to try to work out a common-sense solution.  It takes too long to deal with appeals.  It seems to be an administrative process that has been allowed to slide.  The approach appears to be, "It happens every year and this is the way we do it.  We are independent and no one can interfere with us."  That has to end.</p>  <p>  What the Minister has not said is whether he accepts the decision of the High Court and whether he and the State Examinations Commission will appeal the decision of Mr. Justice Humphreys who will, I understand, be issuing a written judgment in the next few weeks and ordered that the system be changed before next summer.  The Minister needs to give an indication that, apart from having a meeting this week with the universities and the State Examinations Commission, which is way too late, given that it should have been done when it became apparent that UCD was changing its policy, the system will change for next year's examinations in accordance with the order of the High Court.  Is this something the Minister has agreed to do, or will the State Examinations Commission faff around for the next few weeks and then appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal?  The Minister needs to let us know because students and the universities need to know.  We need certainty and an examination system in which people can have confidence.  Unless the Minister accepts the judgment of Mr. Justice Humphreys, confidence in the State examinations system will be shattered.</p></speech>

It is an independent body and was established as such.  In the case of any examination script where a student can apply for rectification, the commission has criteria whereby it re-tots and immediately gives the result.  In other cases it does not provide for rectification because the issues are more complex and it needs to look at a paper to evaluate it.

If he looks at the Official Report, he will see what he said.  The board has accepted the court judgment.  It has rechecked and made a decision that its executive should review the unacceptable timelines.  I have not seen the written judgment, nor have they.  Obviously, they will have to see the written judgment, but from my point of view, we are determined to ensure this will not happen again.  We have to ensure the timelines will be shortened, while in no way undermining confidence in the leaving certificate examinations process.  That is in everyone's interests.  The colleges rely exclusively on the State Examinations Commission in their admission policies.  They do not have independent admission policies, although they are independent in changing the rules.  Tthere is something of an anomaly in that they can change the rules without notifying the commission, but that is their right.  I am determined to ensure we will resolve the issue without impinging on the independence of either of the bodies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200034#GG00900"><p>It is welcome that I finally have the opportunity to raise this issue.  There is the roll-out of broadband to many homes, although other homes just metres away will not be able to avail of the roll-out.  This and the previous Government's record in the roll-out of broadband has been dire.  The facts do not lie.  Ireland lies 42nd in the global ranking for the distribution of high speed broadband, while 40% of the population and 96% of the country lack access to commercial or fibre broadband coverage.  That represents a figure of approximately 2.3 million premises.  </p>  <p>  On behalf of the Government, the Minister signed an agreement with Eir to provide broadband for 300,000 premises.  I want to know how these premises were identified.  Clearly, it was done by way of a desktop exercise, with no relevance given to how it would impact on the ground.  I can give scores of examples where there is the roll-out of broadband to one house on a road but not to the next, or it is occurring at either end of the road, leaving five houses in the middle without a connection to broadband.  They include places such as Lynn Road, Mullingar; Tornanstown; Gaybrook; Knockaville; Killucan; Cumminstown; Ballinacarrig; Irishtown, Mullingar; Kilbeggan; Coola Lawns, where certain houses in the estate have access to broadband, while others do not; Ballinamudda; Moate; and Killinure North, Athlone.  These are just a number of examples.</p>  <p>  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said any decision by the company to provide a service for premises not covered by the commitment agreement would be a matter for it, not one in which he had any role.  That is factually incorrect.  No matter when I contact the company about the provision of broadband in all of these areas, it states it is prohibited from rolling out the service any further.  It is disgraceful.</p></speech>

It is about whether the contract needs to be altered by the Government to allow Eir to proceed.  There are scores of areas throughout the country, including my own, where the Eir roll-out is coming.  We can talk about the major issue in relation to broadband, but this is specifically about the contract that has been given by the Government to Eir.  We have communities in places where the company is stopping, yet there are only three or four more houses to go on the line.  Instead, a different line comes from a different direction.  We have places like Banteer, Knocknagree, Bweeng, Cullen, Newmarket, Lisrobin, Boherbue and Ballinora where this is coming to a specific location.  We have contacted the Department which says it is Eir's responsibility to extend the line.  When we contact Eir, it says it is prohibited from going any further because of the contract it has been given by the State.  Someone needs to tell us who is blocking this and how it can be changed.  It makes no sense from a logistical or common-sense point of view to have roads being divided completely by this.  The Minister must look at it and ensure there is flexibility within the contract to allow the company to complete a particular section of road which may involve only three or four houses.  In some instances, there are different telephone exchanges coming from either side, with one or two houses are left in the middle.  Eir tells us the Government and the contract prohibit it from extending it and the Government tells us it is Eir.  Both cannot be right.  Someone somewhere is telling untrue stories.  We need to get to the bottom of it and we need flexibility to allow common sense to prevail.  There is a whole different argument about the fact that the different commitments on broadband do not add up.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the matter.  As appears from the reply to Question No. 78 of 18 September 2018, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, signed a commitment agreement with Eir in April 2017 on the plan to provide high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir states that to date more than 177,000 premises have been provided for.  The national broadband plan aims to deliver high-speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland.  This has been achieved through a combination of commercial investment and State-led intervention.  Under EU competition rules, the State can only intervene where there is evidence of market failure and where commercial investment is unlikely.  Eir selected some 300,000 premises for high-speed broadband based on the company's own analysis.  These premises had been categorised for inclusion in the State intervention area under the national broadband plan.  In April 2017, my Department determined that the company's deployment plans were credible and, accordingly, the premises were deemed commercial and removed from the State intervention area.</p>  <p>  The Deputies queried the assessment of properties on a case-by-case basis.  Eir has selected the premises to be included in its roll-out on the basis of internal commercial criteria as permitted when commerciality of an area can be demonstrated.  Neither the Minister, Deputy Naughten, nor I nor my Department had any input in that process.  My role and that of the Minister relate only to oversight and verification that these premises are passed according to the milestones laid out in the commitment agreement.  Eir has stated publicly that it is not in a position to include additional premises on a case-by-case basis and this is entirely a matter for the company.  All commercial decisions are matters for private operators in the market.  I appreciate the frustration felt by people who see the deployment by operators throughout the country but who themselves continue to wait for a high-speed broadband service.  Those premises not served through a commercial investment will be included in the State intervention area, which will build a high-speed broadband network in the areas not served by the commercial operators.</p>  <p>  The Department is engaged in the formal procurement process to select a company to roll out a high-speed broadband network in the State intervention area and is now evaluating the final tender submission received from the bidding consortium on 18 September 2018.  This is a significant milestone as the national broadband plan procurement process enters its final stages.  I assure the House that every day more and more people in every county benefit from access to high-speed broadband as a direct result of the Government's action on the national broadband plan.  I continue to be committed to the delivery of high-speed broadband to every home and business in Ireland.  Today, of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland, seven out of every ten have access to high-speed broadband and it is anticipated that by the end of the year, that will grow to eight out of ten.  The milestones are important.  It is expected that a tender will be signed with the final bidder before the end of the year with roll-out to start in the intervention area for all 540,000 premises from 2019 on.  That will take time.  It is expected that from early 2019, every house will be told exactly when it will be connected.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputies' frustration regarding the process under which Eir selected the houses.  I have made representations as a constituency Deputy to the company on houses which have been left out when the line has not been extended further up a road.  I share the frustrations all Members have and, like them, I can identify areas of need.  We also accept, however, that the push with the national broadband plan and the pressure applied to the commercial operators mean Eir has agreed a commitment contract with the Department which will deliver 300,000 connections.  We must appreciate that.  While people have been left out, 300,000 will be connected to high-speed broadband because of the commitment contract signed with the State.  Unfortunately and no more than with the intervention area decided on, not every house can be connected in the one year, month or week.  Things have to start somewhere and we want to ensure a regional spread when the intervention area is rolled out.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has not given them any hope.  He is telling them the tender process for the national broadband plan will not be completed until the end of this year.  We know, based on the past record of the Government, that the timetable might not even be adhered to.  It will take a number of years until such time as it is rolled out.  People in the areas I have outlined could be waiting for between three and five years to have access to broadband.  Meanwhile, there is a broadband provider in their vicinity and on their roads providing broadband to their neighbours which they cannot avail of.  We need a little bit of creativity and some thinking outside the box.  As Deputy Michael Moynihan said, it makes logistical, creative and economic sense if we are going to pay a contractor in an area to have it finish out the area rather than leave people without broadband.  If we are serious about encouraging people to live in rural Ireland and about having businesses operate there, we must be serious about rolling out broadband for rural areas.  Unfortunately, the Government has not been serious about that.</p></speech>

There are small numbers of people at the very end of each line to whom broadband should be extended.  If there are eight to ten houses, the line should be completed.  It is common sense for the Department to call Eir ask whether there are communities where a small amount of further investment on the contract would complete the roll-out of broadband locally.  The Minister of State provided all of the statistics on the roll-out of broadband.  I have listened to that for four or five years and I consider it to be pie in the sky.  I cannot see any future to it.  I ask the Minister of State about the five to ten houses at the end of communities and whether the Department will ask Eir to apply some flexibility.  Eir tells us it cannot do it because of Department rules while the Department says it is Eir.  Will the company be brought in to discuss it for the sake of a very small number?  It is common sense and financial sense.  Above all, it would solve the problem on the ground.</p></speech>

The Government signed a commitment contract with Eir to connect 300,000 houses which the company identified.  The houses the Deputies talked about which are at the ends of roads will be part of the intervention area under the national broadband plan.  The final tender has been received and is being evaluated by the Department and it is expected that a contract will be signed before the end of the year with an expectation that, from 2019 onwards, these houses will be connected.  I cannot provide the Deputies with a timeline for each house, but it is expected that from 2019 on, every house will know when exactly it will be connected.</p><p> As to who will decide where in the intervention area the houses to which the Deputies refer will be connected or where they will start, it would make perfect sense to me, and possibly to the Deputies, that where Eir goes halfway up a road connecting houses, this would continue as part of the intervention area under the contract.  This is not for me to decide; the tender must be evaluated.  I understand Eir will look at the best technical and engineering solution to the roll-out.  The most important thing is that we have a geographic spread, all areas are covered and there is a timeline such that there is certainty for those households not currently connected.  From my understanding, my Department is neither involved in nor aware of any process for the inclusion of premises in Eir's deployment on a case-by-case basis.  Eir is entitled to deploy outside the areas planned under the 300,000 deployment, as any operator would be, but it publicly and very strongly indicated it is not in a position to do so on request.  It states that it can make decisions on a commercial basis, but the Government has signed off on, and Eir has given a commitment to, the 300,000, so Eir must ensure that those 300,000 houses are complete.  What Eir does after that on a commercial basis is up to the company, but those houses that are not covered on a commercial basis will be covered under the national broadband plan intervention area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200036#JJ00300"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for debate.  Overcrowding at the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, continues to be a major problem.  In the past two months alone, a staggering 900 patients at the hospital have been placed on trolleys, the highest number recorded in the country.  There are many contributory factors to this, including that some surgical theatres and consultants are not available seven days a week, but the major issue is a lack of acute bed capacity in the region.  In fairness to management at UHL, it has put forward two projects to boost significantly bed capacity, namely, a 60-bed modular unit and a new 96-bed block proposal.</p>  <p>  The 60-bed modular unit was recently granted full planning permission by Limerick City and County Council.  It is extremely regrettable, however, that this vital project has been stalled because of a planning objection on the part of a resident of Dooradoyle in Limerick.  This project is of critical importance to healthcare provision in the mid-west region, servicing counties Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary, as it will improve patient flow throughout the hospital, patient comfort, patient safety, privacy and patient dignity.  It is outrageous that one individual can hold up a project of such importance.  I have taken this matter up with the Minister of State with responsibility for planning, Deputy Damien English.  It is my view that strategic projects such as this should be lodged directly with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While I have no wish to deprive people of the right to appeal against planning decisions, it makes sense to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la the right to deal directly with applications for major public service projects as such an approach would streamline the process and allow people have their views considered without compromising the public interest.</p>  <p>  What is the Minister of State's position on this project?  With winter almost upon us, what contingency plans are in place to deal with the severe overcrowding at UHL?  More can and must be done with the smaller hospitals in the region, including at Ennis and Nenagh and St. John's.  Does the Minister of State agree with this?  What plans does he have to involve these hospitals more?</p></speech>

We have been told to use these facilities, particularly the injury clinics.  If I injure myself playing a match, the first place I will think of is UHL in Dooradoyle.  We do not know what specific services are provided by the other hospitals, whether St. John's, Ennis or Nenagh.  A major communications strategy needs to be put in place to ensure these facilities are used to their capacity to try to take the heat off the emergency department in Dooradoyle.  I have asked for such a communication plan before.  It is now paramount this is done, given where we are.  I welcome that the Government is moving on the 96-bed unit project in conjunction with the hospital group.  I understand it is at design stage and I hope it will soon proceed to tendering.  I would like an outline of the design timelines for the project.</p>  <p>  As for the modular unit, everyone has a right to appeal and to object - I have no problems with that - but with this process we are looking for something so urgently that I echo Deputy Carey's sentiments that the likes of this should go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I mean no disrespect to the council, on which I sat for a number of years, but this is a strategic project that warrants a streamlining and fast-tracking of deadlines.  We are talking a number of months.  As Deputy Carey said, 880 people were placed on trolleys in UHL in June and use of the hospital's emergency department increased by 17% in the past year, and is ramping up all the time.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on this and I will follow up on them afterwards.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Joe Carey on his great work on health in County Clare and Deputy Tom Neville on his support for services throughout Limerick.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to breaking the cycle of overcrowding in our health service.  Emergency department overcrowding has been linked to many adverse outcomes, such as longer wait times, worse patient outcomes, treatment delays and growing staff and patient dissatisfaction.  The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 67,000 attendances annually.  Demand for ED services at the hospital continues to rise, with an increase of 6% in ED attendances in UHL in 2017 compared with 2016.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health undertook a health service capacity review in line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, the findings of which provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  If reforms are implemented, the report concludes that nearly 2,600 additional hospital beds will be required by 2031.  The national development plan provides for the full 2,600 beds by 2028, three years ahead of schedule.  The national development plan announcement earlier this year includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at University Hospital Limerick.  The HSE has provided capital funding in 2018 to progress the design phase of this project.  Further funding will be considered in the context of the capital allocation for health, having regard to the availability of funding and the level of contractual commitments already in place.  Subject to funding and the successful completion of the planning, design and tender phases, it is currently anticipated that construction is unlikely to commence before 2021.</p>  <p>  Given the current pressures on our hospital emergency departments, the Department of Health has engaged with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019.  A proposal from the HSE, which identifies approximately 600 additional acute beds and 290 additional residential care beds to be phased in between 2018 and 2020, is under consideration in the Department.  These proposals include a 60-bed modular unit at University Hospital Limerick.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while I understand the Deputies' wish to have a clear response today on the provision of additional beds in UHL to alleviate the ongoing pressures on the ED, I must await the outcome of the processes currently under way.  These include matters which are being considered in the context of the 2019 Estimates process.  I will convey the Deputies' sensible concerns and suggestions to the Minister.</p></speech>

Ennis hospital is a vital cog in the wheel here, and I believe more could be done in Ennis to try to reduce the burden on UHL.  I welcome the fact that Clare County Council recently granted planning permission to the hospital group to develop a new outpatient department just off the Kilrush Road in Ennis.  We need to see further investment in Ennis hospital, particularly in surgical theatres, and an expansion in the opening hours of the medical assessment unit and the minor injuries clinics.</p><p>I know the Minister has a view that smaller hospitals can play a bigger role.  Does the Minister of State support that position?  Will he convey the opinion being expressed here this evening that the smaller, model 2, hospitals in the region need to be better resourced in order that they can play a bigger role?</p></speech>

From what I hear, dates are being shifted out all the time.  The Minister of State is saying today that it will commence in 2021.  We need to get this moving faster.  I ask that we find a way to fast-track this process.  I ask that the person who is appealing the decision to grant planning permission for the project, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Minister sit down, iron out their differences and come up with a solution so that we can move this forward.  People are lying on trolleys under bright lights and having their privacy compromised.  I have had phone calls this weekend in respect of some specific cases.  Some people have been on trolleys for three or four days.  We have been dealing with this for a considerable period.</p>  <p>  On diagnostics, I also suggest that we move beyond the nine to five, Monday to Friday model.  This has happened in the private sector where people move to weekend shifts and are remunerated and paid bonuses and shift allowances accordingly.  We need to start thinking differently in this regard.  It is getting too serious.  </p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the staff in University Hospital Limerick who are working under extreme pressure.  A total of 67,800 people attended the hospital's accident and emergency department last year.  I understand the new facility will deal with the most acute cases and those who have reached the end of the admissions process for whom staff are trying to get beds.  I commend the staff and management because a large number of people have passed through the hospital.  It is essential that we get the project through as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200037#KK00300"><p>Again, I thank the Deputies for raising this very important issue.  They made many points which I strongly support.  For example, I agree with Deputy Joe Carey on using Ennis general hospital to take some of the burden.  He also raised issues regarding the medical assessment unit.  As to whether I agree that smaller hospitals can play a bigger role in dealing with this issue, I absolutely agree, and I will convey that view at Cabinet and to the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  Deputy Tom Neville spoke of speeding up the process, fast-tracking the project and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is something on which we have to act.  I agree that it is not acceptable to have patients on trolleys for two or three days.  We need to be more proactive and think differently.  That is very important when we are planning and designing the health service.</p>  <p>  The health service capacity review indicates that Ireland has one of the highest bed occupancy rates in the developed world, at 94%.  That is significantly ahead of the OECD average of 77%.  This is why the Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health - &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years.  This will provide for major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand, the issue raised by the Deputies.  However, increasing capacity alone will not address the challenges faced by the health system.  Investment and reform must go hand in hand.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which was recently published, provides the framework for how our health service reforms can be realised across primary and social care, as well as acute care.  We have now commenced the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  </p>  <p>  We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant.  Of that there is little doubt.  However, it is my firm belief that all of us here want to find the right solutions.  I have heard some of the Deputies' suggestions but solutions have to be patient-centred, evidence-based, results-focused and sustainable in order to deal with the challenges facing our health services.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200037#KK00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am here this evening to introduce the Mental Health (Renewal Orders) Bill 2018 to the House.  As Deputies will be aware, this is an emergency Bill which is required as a result of a finding of unconstitutionality of part of the Mental Health Act 2001.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Whip&rsquo;s office and the House for agreeing to consider this emergency legislation at short notice.  I also acknowledge the support of our colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  There is an urgency to the introduction of the legislation which comes from the finding by the Court of Appeal on 3 May 2018 that section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 is unconstitutional.  Section 15(3) of the Act provides for the involuntary detention of patients for periods not exceeding six months and not exceeding 12 months.  The court found that the lack of a mechanism for a patient to seek an independent review of his or her detention within a reasonable time meant that this section breached Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution, which states &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  Acknowledging that this finding had potentially serious consequences for the mental health system, Mr. Justice Hogan placed a stay on the judgment until 8 November 2018 to allow time for the Oireachtas and Government to remedy the position and for the necessary operational changes to be put in place.  Failure to legislate to address this judgment and implement the necessary changes within the time allowed by the court, that is, by 8 November 2018, would result in the detention of patients becoming unlawful on the expiry of the stay.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to provide a lawful basis for the reception, detention and treatment of persons who are detained involuntarily on renewal orders under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act.</p>  <p>  The decision to detain a patient involuntarily is a serious one.  It is primarily taken in circumstances where persons suffering from mental disorders as defined in the Act present a danger to themselves or, in a small number of cases, to others.  Under the Mental Health Act, such a decision can be made only after a registered medical practitioner refers a patient to the clinical director of an approved centre or a consultant psychiatrist on the staff of the approved centre.  If the psychiatrist makes a decision to admit the patient, the patient&rsquo;s case will be reviewed within a 21-day period by an independent psychiatrist appointed by the Mental Health Commission and by a mental health tribunal consisting of a consultant psychiatrist, a lawyer and an independent layperson.  To be involuntarily detained, a registered medical practitioner, two psychiatrists and a tribunal must all decide that the circumstances of the patient&rsquo;s case are such that detention is warranted.</p>  <p>  Any time a patient&rsquo;s detention is extended by a renewal order the patient is again examined by his or her consultant psychiatrist, further examined by an independent psychiatrist appointed by the Mental Health Commission and the detention is reviewed by a tribunal.  Where the tribunal affirms the order for the patient&rsquo;s detention, the patient can appeal this decision to the Circuit Court.  The patient&rsquo;s consultant psychiatrist must revoke an order if he or she becomes of the opinion that the patient is no longer suffering from a mental disorder.  When a patient&rsquo;s order is revoked he or she may leave the approved centre or he or she may agree to stay to receive treatment on a voluntary basis.  A total of 1,653 orders were revoked by consultant psychiatrists in 2017.  This amounts to 47% of all the orders made.</p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal found that the provisions of section 15(1) and (2) provide a mechanism for a patient to seek an independent review of his or her mental health status within a reasonable time.  In 2017, 3,245 of the total of 3,524 admission and renewal orders issued, approximately 92% were made under these sections of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Currently, section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act allows for periods of detention of up to six months and up to 12 months.  It was this provision that the Court of Appeal held to be unconstitutional.  The court found that it was not, as such, the fact that the renewal orders in question could last for six months or even 12 months that gave rise to this finding, but rather that there is not a means for a patient to access a review of his or her mental health status within a reasonable time.</p>  <p>  I will now go through the Bill section by section.  Section 1 is an interpretation section standard to most Bills.  Section 2 is an expenses section which deals with any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill and is, likewise, standard to most Bills.</p>  <p>  Section 3 is a provision that provides for replacing the section 15(3) renewal orders under which patients are currently detained with new orders made under an amended section 15(3).  Section 3(1) provides for the patient&rsquo;s consultant psychiatrist to examine him or her within five days, or eight days if the Minister permits in writing, of the commencement of the section.  Where the consultant psychiatrist is satisfied that the patient continues to suffer from a mental disorder, he or she will make a new renewal order for a maximum duration of six months.  Section 3(2) provides that the replacement renewal order is in substitution for and not in addition to the unexpired renewal order.  The replacement renewal order takes effect as if it were an order made under section 15(3), and attracts the provisions of sections 16 to 18, inclusive.  These provisions relate to a review of the renewal order by a tribunal, which cease to apply to the unexpired renewal order.  Section 3(3) explains what can happen to an unexpired renewal order on commencement of the section.</p>  <p>  Section 4 amends section 15 of the 2001 Act by substituting a new section 15(3) for the existing section 15(3).  Its purpose is to provide for repeat renewal orders of a maximum duration of six months; to provide for a new right for the patient or his or her legal representative to apply to the Mental Health Commission for a review of his or her detention by a tribunal; to provide that the new right of review by a tribunal can be accessed at or after three months from the date the renewal order was made under section 15(3); and to provide that the new right of review to be carried out by a tribunal is a review of whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder.</p>  <p>  Section 5 is a consequential amendment of section 16 of the 2001 Act to provide for the review, as set out in section 4 of this Bill.  It provides that, at the time a patient is notified of a renewal order being made, he or she is also notified that he or she has access to the new right of review.</p><p>Section 6 is a consequential amendment of section 17 of the 2001 Act to provide for the new right of review.  It allows the Mental Health Commission to refer an application for review to a tribunal.</p> <p> Section 7 is a consequential amendment of section 18 of the 2001 Act to provide for the new right of review.  It adds that the tribunal's decision will be made not later than 21 days after the date the Mental Health Commission received the review application.</p> <p> Section 8 confirms that several existing rights under the 2001 Act are unaffected.  These are maintaining provisions for discharge under section 28 of the 2001 Act, where the consultant psychiatrist becomes of the view that the patient is no longer suffering from a mental disorder; that any court proceedings which were in train before the commencement of the legislation are unaffected by the introduction of this new legislation; and that any proceedings relating to an appeal to the Circuit Court under section 19 of the 2001 Act are unaffected by the introduction of this new legislation.</p> <p> Section 9 deals with the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement matters, and is standard to most Bills.</p> <p> In delivering its judgment, the Court of Appeal said that the finding of unconstitutionality demands an immediate and imperative response on the part of the other branches of government, namely, the Oireachtas and the Government.  Given the urgency of the situation, as well as the particularly vulnerable cohort of patients affected by this judgment, the support of all parties and Independents is critical to ensure timely commencement of this important legislation.  Above all, we have a collective responsibility always to keep the rights, will and preference of the patient to the fore.  This is reflected in the strong tradition of co-operation on mental health issues across the membership of the Houses.  For all these reasons, I recommend the enactment of this legislation and ask for the support of this House in passing it in a timely way.  I will also ask the Seanad, taking into account the particular context and circumstances of this matter, to pass an earlier signature motion, asking the President to sign the legislation earlier than the period normally applying to legislation passed by the Houses.</p></speech>

It enhances patient's rights by strengthening the human rights aspects of the lawful basis for detaining in psychiatric units those patients with mental health illnesses.  In May of this year, the Court of Appeal found that certain laws governing the detention of people in psychiatric units were unconstitutional.  The court found that section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001, which provides for the making of orders extending periods of detention by up to 12 months, breached the constitutional rights of those detained under the section.  More specifically, the court found that an order of detention of up to 12 months, without an effective mechanism to review that detention before the order of detention expired, breached patients' constitutional rights of personal liberty.</p>  <p>  The court's decision affects almost 100 patients, including 15 detained in the Central Mental Hospital.  In its judgment, the Court of Appeal acknowledged the potential chaotic and catastrophic consequences of its decision on those vulnerable patients deemed to be unconstitutionally detained by the State.  In effect, the court's decision meant that the legal basis for detaining these patients no longer existed and they would have to be released.  This posed a potential health risk to those patients themselves and, in some cases, to others.  The court, acknowledging these risks, suspended the declaration of unconstitutionality for six months until 8 November in order for the Oireachtas to enact laws to remedy the situation.  In his judgment, however, Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan stated that an immediate and imperative response on the part of the Oireachtas and the Government was required.  Accordingly, we have this amending legislation.</p>  <p>  Due to the urgency of the matter, this amending legislation must pass to allow enough time for the preparation and issue before 8 November of replacement renewal orders and associated mental health tribunals for those patients affected.  For this reason, Fianna F&aacute;il has agreed for this legislation to bypass pre legislative scrutiny.  That does not mean, however, this Bill should pass into law without comment or observations.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the report of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was published.  It recommended 165 changes to our mental health legislation to make it fit for purpose and bring it in line with international human rights laws and policies.  Since the publication of the report, we have had three Ministers with responsibility for mental health and two taoisigh.  Of that report's 165 recommendations, only one has been implemented.  Despite numerous promises, there has not even been a heads of a Bill published to address the other 164 recommendations.</p>  <p>  This fact alone should give lie to the assertion by the Government that mental health is a priority for it.  That report pointed out that the 12 month duration of certain renewal orders was too long and should be reduced, the very issue we are dealing with here today.  Had the Government prioritised mental health and acted to implement that report, we would not be rushing legislation through the House without appropriate scrutiny.</p>  <p>  In light of the proposed legislation, there is a clear need for greater access to information on how to make a complaint and for a proactive advocacy support for those using our mental health services.  This is especially the case for involuntary inpatient users of mental health services.  These patients are deprived of their most basic human right, that of their liberty.  Appropriate safeguards need to be in place to ensure that any such deprivation of liberty is no more than absolutely necessary, is done in accordance with the law and respects patients' human rights.  To achieve this, the Minister of State must ensure that the range and capacity of mental health advocacy services is expanded to meet the needs of people with long-term mental health difficulties.  Otherwise, patients' rights are meaningless.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State provide a date on which he will publish the heads of a Bill for the comprehensive reform of mental health legislation which will include the expert review group's recommendations?  Will the Minister provide greater funding and access for proactive advocacy supports for those using our mental health services in order that they can exercise their rights under this legislation and other Bills?  Will the Minister of State commence Fianna F&aacute;il's Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 which addresses some of the Government's failures to reform mental health legislation?  Will the Minister of State ensure a money message is sent as soon as possible to release Fianna F&aacute;il's Mental Health Parity Bill which passed Second Stage and is now stuck in limbo due to the Government's refusal to provide this technical step?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200038#LL00400"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill but with several caveats.  Any deprivation of liberty should be the last resort.  As it stands, while detention is permitted under section 15 of the Mental Health Act, it is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  In what other section of society could a person be treated in such circumstances?</p>  <p>  That said, there is no point in providing a lawful basis for renewal orders under the Mental Health Act if mental health advocacy services are not expanded to ensure the needs of mental health patients are met.  The mental health reform study, published in July 2017, found two thirds of patients did not know how to make a complaint and many were not confident enough to advocate for themselves.  These findings are worrying.  Access to information for patients, especially those detained involuntarily, is of paramount importance.  These people have enough going on besides being unable to access information.</p>  <p>  The lack of such services essentially renders patients' rights worthless.  I note the provision of additional services will result in a cost to the Exchequer.  Recent figures, however,  stated the HSE spend on agency staff in mental health has increased by &euro;38 million in four years.  This is not sustainable.  If this stopgap approach were addressed, it would ultimately free up moneys to ensure the advocacy service that these patients so desperately need would be available.  In addition, continuity of service is what these patients need, not the inconsistency of roll-over staff.  A little joined-up thinking and a little bit of common sense is what is needed.</p></speech>

On reflection, what a wise and prudent judgment by Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan.  Had he not given that judgment to delay by six months and by giving the Oireachtas an opportunity to legislate against the clock, there would have been a truly appalling vista for the patients involved.  The Court of Appeal delivered its decision in the case of AB <i>v.</i>Clinical Director of St. Loman's Hospital in May 2018.  Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan, giving judgment, declared a particular section of the Mental Health Act, which regulates the involuntary detention of people with mental health difficulties, to be inconsistent with the constitutional guarantee of personal liberty.  This is a pretty serious charge.</p><p>The constitutional issue lay in the argument of the complainant, Mr. AB, that there was not any effective process by which he could dispute an assessment that he continued to suffer from a mental disorder during the operation of the actual orders in existence.  In other words, Mr. AB argued, a patient could have a renewal order for 12 months affirmed under the processes that applied, yet could subsequently recover from his or her mental illness in that period but have no effective means of initiating a review of his or her detention before the end of the 12 month period.</p><p>The most significant aspect of this judgment is the remedy offered by the court.</p><p>Ordinarily, a finding of unconstitutionality will result in an immediate order declaring the law to be invalid, a remedy that has been described as a judicial death certificate for a law.  In this case, Mr. Justice Hogan made an order declaring section 15(3) to be invalid, but he suspended the effect of the declaration for a period of six months to enable this House to do its work.  The law, therefore, has been judged to be unconstitutional, but it will, as we know, remain in place until 18 November, at which point the declaration of unconstitutionality will take effect and the law will be invalid.</p> <p> The new framework proposed in this new provision will reduce the maximum period by which a detention order can be extended from 12 months to six.  It will also provide for a new means by which a patient can apply for a review of his or her detention.  We welcome this.  It is also welcome that under the new framework, following an initial admission order, a consultant psychiatrist can renew the detention of a patient for an initial period of three months under section 15(2) and thereafter for periods of six months under the revised section 15(3).  In addition, the patient will have the right, acting on his or her own behalf or through his or her legal representative, to make an application to have the merits of his or her detention reviewed after a period of three months of detention.  This will serve to protect the public and the rights of the patients involved.</p> <p> To reinforce what my colleague Deputy James Browne said, the Government has been tardy in enacting legislation and following through on publication of the report by the expert group.  Up until now it has made only one change, although the group began its work in 2012.  Fianna F&aacute;il published its Bill in 2017 and it became the Mental Health (Amendment) Act this year.  One of the key changes involved a clarification of the definition of voluntary patient, which goes to the heart of what is being proposed in this Bill.  </p> <p> I am thankful to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200039#MM00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I commend the Minister of State and his Department for their quick and comprehensive work in bringing forward the Bill which not only fixes the legal issues which arose from the High Court's ruling but also improves the rights of patients in terms of their access to a review of their detention and creates a fairer and more humane approach to the unfortunate but often necessary measure of involuntary admission and treatment.  The finding by Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan that long-stay detention of an individual in an inpatient unit without the opportunity for a review is unconstitutional is right and should have come as no surprise to any of us.</p>  <p>  Four years ago, in its review of the Mental Health Act, the expert group recommended the revising of the Act and many other issues related to patients' rights.  The group made a total 165 recommendations, many of which have not been acted on or even acknowledged by the Government.  The reality is that not only do we need to pass the Bill and look at the expert group's review, we also need to push forward with a comprehensive, modern and progressive new Mental Heath Act to put patients' rights at the forefront of care provision in Ireland.  I will return to this broad issue, but I would first like to address the amendments I have submitted to the Bill.  </p>  <p>  I have submitted two amendments to the Bill, but I will not be pushing the second one after discussing the finer details with the Minister of State, Deputies James Browne and Alan Kelly and having spoken to other experts.  The intent was to allow greater latitude for the patient as to when he or she would seek a tribunal, but I now believe it is no longer necessary to include that provision in the Bill.  The first amendment I am seeking to make to the Bill specifies that a patient involuntarily detained and under a renewal order should have the right to one review of each order and not, as the language may suggest, one review in the overall detention period.  We should be very careful about the conditions under which we allow the State, through the health service, to take such serious action as to deny the liberty of an individual.  It should never be done just for the sake of it or willy nilly.  The detention should continue to be treated with seriousness.  We should never allow the process to develop into a vicious cycle which perpetuates the detention.  The approval of one detention order should not make its renewal, if sought, an easier or less serious endeavour.  In fact, given the desire for services in the interests of patients to be based on a recovery model which seeks to avoid admissions and detention, where possible, everything should be done to ensure a renewal order will not be necessary.  Therefore, it should never be seen as an easy option, with a low bar for justification.  If a criminal deserves a free and fair trail, with a heavy burden of proof, the completely innocent sufferer of a mental health issue should be afforded no less, if not a great deal more, in terms of their right to liberty.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State will agree that this proposal would be a worthwhile addition to the Bill and he has told me that he will agree to it.  I also thank Deputies James Browne and Alan Kelly.  I have found the Minister of State to be someone who is interested in upholding and improving the rights of patients, but so far action has been lacking.  I have been waiting for a very long time to move forward with Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill on advance healthcare directives.  The Minister has been open to working with us on the issue, but it has been a long drawn-out process, given the far greater resources at his disposal.  I will be seeking to move forward with the Bill as soon as time is available in the D&aacute;il.  The issue is clearly of importance and the Bill seeks to deal with it appropriately.  It has been developed with experts in the field.  I hope we will be able to rely on the support of the Minister very soon, as well as that of Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties, to enable us to have the Bill passed on Second Stage and to work together to have the best Act finalised and in place for the people we represent.  </p>  <p>  The Bill we are debating is important, but it should not stall all of the other issues concerning patients' rights.  Last month in response to a parliamentary question the Minister said the general scheme of a new Mental Health Bill was in the works and that a draft would be sent to the Mental Health Commission by the end of the year.  Unfortunately, while I do not doubt that that is his intention, or what he is being told, when it comes to the Government, there is a long and storied history of deadlines being made and passed and very little happening in the realm of mental health.  When I took up this role in 2016, I was told that a review of A Vision for Change was being worked on.  We are still waiting for it and not exactly hopeful that we will receive it, given how little the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care received in the way of information from the group once it was finally set up.  I am also still waiting for the review of the role of suicide crisis assessment nurses.  In every reply I have received to a parliamentary question I have asked since 2016 about this role I have been told that it is under way.  We have also been waiting for the review of Jigsaw.  Again, we have been told that it will be available by the end of the year.  We were told that there would be mental health services 24/7, but we have been given very little information on the development of the plan or how it is being implemented.  Unsurprisingly, the first concrete piece of information on the move to the provision of out-of-hours care services indicates that "some" will be in place at the beginning of 2019.  December and January will be extremely busy months for the HSE and the Department of Health if all of these deadlines are to be achieved.  My point is that we need to commit to solving some serious legislative problems in the coming months.  So far, we have had little to give us hope this will be done.  Let us start by getting this Bill over the line, continuing with advance healthcare directives and getting the mental health Bill ready to ensure the quality of service patients in the mental health service and their families deserve.</p>  <p>  We have been talking about timeframes and so on.  I conducted some research.  Before I was elected to this House, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act was signed into law in December 2015.  It replaced the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  I hope we can work together to resolve this matter speedily.  It is a proud moment for all of us that we can work together to put these measures in place.  It is not always about scoring political points in this Chamber; it is also about caring about people and doing the right thing.  I will be following up on the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act because it is vitally important.  We need to work together.  I am very passionate about this issue.  I congratulate the Seanad on the speed at which it got this Bill to this Chamber.  It is ironic that it could be the last Bill the President signs into law because, as we all know, we are facing into the next big election.</p><p>I am very proud and I am very grateful to everyone for working together on this.</p></speech>

It is unconstitutional.  It is a big judgment and I believe it was a proper judgment.  When one reads the judgment, it is surprising that it did not happen before.  It is the correct judgment and the stay has given us time to deal with this issue.  The Labour Party will support this small but very important legislation, which is before us tonight.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments, with regard to allowing a review after three months, are the correct procedure and the correct way to go about it.  There were a couple of variations of options, and I believe the one picked by the Minister of State is the correct one.  Obviously there is the right to appeal to the Circuit Court, which is a natural right.</p>  <p>  This matter, based on the expert review, shows up the broader requirement for a new Bill in the whole area of mental health.  It has been spoken about here and I shall not repeat it.  I have raised it before.  It might be a stretch to get the heads of a Bill but in the coming months, if we could get some outline on the type of Bill, it would be progress before we all go off into election mode, whenever that is.</p>  <p>  It also opens up certain issues, such as the various advocacy organisations that are doing a job and trying to help, the area of the provision of information and the rights of individuals to make sure they are being provided with the correct information to uphold their constitutional and civic rights so their liberty is protected, and the flow of information.  This legislation and the judgment that was made remind us how important it is to protect the provision of information and people's rights.  It also gives us an opportunity to reflect on how best the information flow and provision can be maintained for individuals so they can have autonomy and they can make decisions around their own situation.  We can support the advocacy groups who are helping in so many ways.  Perhaps we can focus on that area a little bit into the future.  We need to pass this Bill and get it through before the deadline that has been set by the court.  This shines a light on the need for us all to make sure that in the meantime we also focus on those areas.</p></speech>

It is unconstitutional because it allows detention of an involuntary patient to be extended for up to 12 months without an effective or independent review within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>During this debate on this Bill, will the Minister of State clarify that the right of an individual to request a second tribunal under a six-month renewal order will not impinge on his or her right to an automatic tribunal within 21 days?  If the Minister of State cannot reply now, perhaps someone could clarify this at a later stage.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to raise the urgent need to update in full the Mental Health Act 2001.  Successive Governments have consistently neglected to do this and this Government is no different.  The Minister of State has given no indication of the date by which the draft Bill for the new mental health Act will be made available.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has stated that the Bill will be &ldquo;significantly progressed&rdquo; by the end of this year.  Mental health organisations and groups have waited more than three years to see a draft Bill and there is still no definitive date for its publication.  Mental health services across the board continue to struggle hugely within existing resources.  Massive underfunding has led to a chaotic system that is failing so many adults and children with mental health difficulties.  Many Deputies have brought this forward.  Front-line staff regularly highlight the stress they experience while trying to do their jobs in the most trying of circumstances.  Recruitment and retention of staff remains one of the biggest challenges in our health service.</p><p>I have stated the following figures many times, but I believe it is worth repeating them because the statistics are quite shocking.  Currently in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, there is less than 40% of the required number of clinical psychologists in post, less than 50% of social workers and less than 60% of occupational therapists.  Shockingly, 57.6% of Ireland is still not covered by out-of-hours CAMHS services.  This means that children or young people experiencing a mental health crisis regularly have little option but to go to overstretched accident and emergency departments.  This cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p>People Before Profit will include a substantial investment in mental health services in our budget submission for 2019.  This would bring us into line with figures contained in A Vision for Change and would represent an 8% spend of the total healthcare budget.  We should be moving towards 12% of the overall health budget, which would bring us closer to Britain's current spending on mental health services.</p><p>While I emphasise that this is an important amendment, there are other areas of legislation that also need to be urgently addressed, including the regulation of</p><p>community residences for people with mental health difficulties, ensuring that 16 and 17 year olds have legal rights to consent to admission or mental health treatment, which will be the subject of future debate and worth listening to, and that voluntary patients have rights to information and advocacy.</p><p>People Before Profit will support the Bill.  Anything that gives patients more freedom and more rights to decisions about their health and well-being is very progressive.</p></speech>

It is important to put the Bill into context.  Tomorrow it will be five months since Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan gave his judgment on 3 May.  The Minister of State has quoted the judge's language very directly.  Mr. Justice Hogan gave the Government a window of opportunity up to 8 November 2018.  Mr. Justice Hogan directed an &quot;immediate and imperative response&quot; on the part of the other branches of the Government, namely, the Oireachtas and the Government.  The Minister of State has rightly quoted that.  Mr. Justice Hogan has given the Government that window of opportunity.  I am glad the Minister of State has come forward with this Bill.</p><p>The background to this Bill is that Mr. B's order had been renewed and extended multiple times in the case that came before Mr. Justice Hogan, that of AB <i>v</i>. Clinical Director of St. Loman's Hospital.  Before I look at that case, however, I point out that pre-legislative scrutiny was waived because of the urgency of this Bill.  That is never a good thing.  I know that it had to be done in this situation but it is never a good thing.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service did not even have time to come up with a digest, but it did come up with a post and details on that, for which I and the other Deputies are very grateful.</p><p>With regard to the case background, Mr. B had been detained multiple times under the sections of the Act that have been referred to.  The finding was that there was no effective process by which Mr. B could dispute an assessment that he continued to suffer from a mental disorder during the operation of these renewal orders.  The court clearly said that this was unconstitutional, especially with regard to Article 40.4.1&deg; on personal liberty and Article 40.3.1&deg; on personal rights, and the failure to vindicate Mr. B's personal rights.  The court clearly pointed out that the Oireachtas had to legislate for some independent means by which a detained person can initiate a review of an assessment that he or she suffers from a mental disorder, and to ensure that involuntary detention of patients with mental disorders is kept under regular and independent review.  I shall return to this point later with regard to A Vision for Change.</p><p>This Bill sets out to correct that unconstitutionality.  It sets out the maximum period of detention without a review at six months.  The patient can come forward after three months, which is a welcome change.  It is a change we had to bring in.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify one question around the extant orders as this is prospective legislation and not retrospective.  With regard to existing renewal orders that have been made, section 3 states that the psychiatrist must examine the patient &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.  What does that mean?</p><p>Is there a time limit set for the renewal of those orders as soon as possible?  To put this in context, I had the privilege in another life of working as a clinical psychologist and way back in the 1980s we knew exactly what the problems were.  A document was produced by the then Government on planning for the future.  The direction was to move from psychiatric units and into the community.  However, it was not really acted upon except to take patients out of the big institutions but without providing the help on the other side.  The next big document was A Vision for Change, which brought us up to 2016.  It was an excellent document, which I have cited many times in this Chamber.</p> <p> Such was the cynicism of each Government that an independent review panel was set up as a result of pressure.  It sat for two different three-year periods and highlighted the progress being made and not being made.  The response was not to take that proactively and do something but to do away with the independent review panel.  I ask the Minister of State at the very least in the immediate term to bring back an independent review panel to review what is happening in our mental health services under A Vision for Change.  I know the strategy is under review but it has taken an appalling length of time.  I thought we would have the review in 2016 but the Government kicked for touch and went for an international review of literature.  That was not necessary.  Then it moved on to some type of review of A Vision for Change, which it has not implemented. </p> <p> We really do not need any more literature.  We do not need any more reviews.  A Vision for Change set out in the clearest of English on every level, all the suicide rates back in 2006, all the information up to then was included and it set out the way forward.  We know that the cost to the economy is astronomical.  I pay tribute to the work of the advocacy groups who tell us that for every &euro;1 spent on mental health, another &euro;4 are saved to the economy.  We know that it is costing the economy a large sum of money yet we are failing to implement A Vision for Change and kicking for touch with idiotic reports and international reviews of literature.  They may well be necessary, I do not know, but they can take place in parallel with the implementation of A Vision for Change.  </p> <p> As Deputy Gino Kenny said, there are no 24 hour services for teenagers in 57% of the country.  People with mental health problems are going into the accident and emergency department in Galway and walking out.  We know suicide rates are very high.  I do not want to repeat the figures but from my background I can say there are solutions to these problems.  We want to empower people.  This emergency legislation highlights our very complicated history of, and attitude to, the incarceration of people.  It seems to be the answer that we have always rushed to rather than empowering people.  We have used the language in A Vision for Change but we have never implemented it.  </p> <p> I have been in the D&aacute;il for two and a half years.  It is five months since the Court of Appeal forced the Government to take action on one aspect of mental health care.  There are many other aspects, for example, people are held in a voluntary way in community institutions and there is a huge grey area about their rights.  There are many other serious questions.  I appreciate the Minister of State's work commitment but we want A Vision for Change implemented.  The Minister of State can certainly update and improve it but if the Government is seriously interested in doing that, it would reinstate the independent review panel because that would give us all confidence that it is seriously interested in implementing A Vision for Change or whatever new document comes forward. </p></speech>

We fully support its passage through the D&aacute;il.  The involuntary detention of people in institutions should be kept to a minimum.  I fully support the rights of people with mental health issues.  It is important that they are given a voice.</p>  <p>  I cannot ignore the serious problems in our mental health service.  We are all too aware that people suffering from psychiatric illnesses are left waiting for long periods of time before they can access treatment.  It has been reported that waiting times and lists are getting longer and there are major gaps in services in certain parts of the country such as Cork and Kerry.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  It is a disgrace that children who need to access services are suffering.  It has emerged that, as of March this year, 2,691 children and young adults were waiting for the HSE to provide them with an appointment, including 386 waiting longer than 12 months.  There is an ongoing problem because the lack of out-of-hours and inpatient services means that children are being admitted to adult mental health services.  This is unacceptable.  Emergency response times to child and adolescent mental health issues should not be greater than 72 hours.  We need 24 hours, seven days a week access to our mental health services.  This is no fault of the staff who work tremendously hard in these services but it is the fault of the Government which has failed to provide adequate funding for mental health services year on year.</p>  <p>  There is no one in the country who does not have somebody in their lives who has had a mental health problem at some stage, whether it be depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol or drug issues, and it is a joke to think that approximately 6% of the overall health budget is spent on mental health services each year.  Mental health has been neglected and we need to address this matter urgently.  Without investment and major change the Mental Health Commission has declared that the level of care provided to vulnerable and distressed individuals will continue to be unsafe and substandard.  In my constituency, a mother had to take to our local newspaper to highlight her struggle with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to provide her with adequate supports for her child.  This lady has an autistic child who is non-verbal and has violent outbursts.  The problem is not just a question of funding but how and where the money is spent.  In this case, the lady has been approved for 30 hours home support per week but cannot fully access it because of the lack of staff at CoAction.  I can only say wonderful things about the work of CoAction and its staff but the problem of how the health and mental health budgets are spent is down to this Government and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Constituents of mine come to me with serious concerns.  It has been brought to my attention that when older adolescents come out of their facilities, such as CoAction, their parents are very concerned about what will happen to them when they can no longer care for them as there are not adequate services available to these people.  We need to consider providing more semi-independent living options to people who want to avail of the support they could access in a semi-independent living facility.  It is time for this Government to fully realise its commitments to mental health care and adequately invest in mental health services in the upcoming budget to improve the mental health outcomes of adults and children living in Ireland. </p></speech>

It is a pity that it took a court case nearly six months ago to bring us to this point.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide a lawful basis for the reception, detention and treatment of persons who are detained involuntarily on the renewal orders under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001.  This Bill seeks to provide for repeat renewal orders of a maximum duration of six months each.  I welcome that even though six months is a long time.  It is to provide for a new right of a patient detained under section 15(3) renewal order made for a period exceeding three months to access a review of his or her detention, or after three months from the date the renewal order was made.  I welcome that certainly because it gives some balance and a say to the patients.</p>  <p>  This review will be carried out by a mental health tribunal which will satisfy itself whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder.  The word "tribunal" is ill-chosen because in this country it has awful connotations of slowness, ineptitude and cost.</p> <p>I advise that we go back to calling it a monitoring committee or some other word rather than a tribunal.</p> <p> The Bill is a response to the finding by the Court of Appeal on 3 May 2018 that section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001 is unconstitutional.  It took a brave person to take that case.  This section provides for the involuntary detention of patients for periods not exceeding 12 months.  The finding was on the basis that there is no effective means for a patient to seek an independent review of his or her detention within a reasonable time.  That is a simple and straightforward finding and the only way it should have found.</p> <p> Mental health was taboo and hidden for years in our country.  A Vision for Change was a wonderful document which the Government brought in, under the then Minister of State, John Moloney.  It was very aspirational with a wonderful vision for change but with no results to back it up.  The Minister of State is well aware of that.  He promised in Tipperary that he would try to change that.  There is a cost to families, to people themselves, both men and women, to communities, to employers and to the economy.  It damages the fabric of society when people suffer mental illness with no help.  The Minister of State came to Clonmel and dealt with some people.  I appeal to him to sort out the issue with the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Cork.  We have young people, adolescents, who are being put into a paediatrics ward in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel, County Tipperary, who should not be there.  The sick young children need their own treatment.  These people are traumatised and distressed and we have to ask why.  We have to go deep here to find out what is causing all this.  It is a huge problem but there is no place for them.  I understand the hospital is not taking them now.  Where will parents bring them and what will they do?</p> <p> As Deputy Connolly said, I support people in the work they are doing.  I support Jigsaw in Tipperary, which is wonderful, and many more groups throughout the country.  There are many problems which the Minister of State needs to get his teeth into.  Get rid of the officialdom and red tape and get funds where they should be, supporting families and vulnerable people.</p></speech>

It is very welcome.  I have to talk about suicide because it is a demon which has affected many families.  Everyone talks about their own place.  In Kerry, we have had too much of it.  Teenagers have pressures in schools and colleges, then people fear becoming homeless and have financial worries and family problems.  There are many different pressures which cause mental illness.  It is hard for us to understand someone who has a mental illness.  It is a real problem.  The problem in our county is that we do not have a 24 hour service.  If someone presents at the weekend, as they often do in emergency departments, there is no real help for them.</p>  <p>  I remember getting a call a few months ago from a family on a Friday evening.  Their brother was told that he was going home and there was no place for him.  I will not say which hospital.  Families recognise when a member of the family is in trouble.  This family had lost another family member and knew that they were in bother with this person.  Gladly, he was kept there after an intervention and that boy is perfect.  That did not happen for others and there are family members who are very sore and hurt about it.</p>  <p>  We do not have enough services.  Many of these youngsters - they are youngsters, by and large - need one-to-one care.  Families are tied up.  They have other commitments, children of their own and other matters.  We do not have the services to prevent many of the suicides that I believe could have been prevented.  I appeal to the Minister of State because this affects vulnerable people.  My uncle used to say that there is only the breadth of a nail between being dead and alive.  It is a defining moment when someone commits suicide, with all that it brings with it, with so much hurt and loss for a family, and stigma too.  We have to do more for people with mental illnesses.</p></speech>

I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle, the other offices involved and the Seanad for bringing us there.  I will be brief in asking questions.  Deputy Browne and other Members asked when the general scheme of the mental health Bill will be published.  I hope to have this emergency legislation by the end of the year.  As Bills, including different Private Member's Bills come on stream, they take from the important work, though they are important too.  There are competing needs.  I have finite resources in the Department to draft legislation.  I hope to have the draft prepared and ready to go to the Mental Health Commission by the end of the year for comment.  Deputy Browne asked when the Bill will be commenced.  As the Deputy knows, there are a number of other steps.  We have to get the mental health capacity Bill, which is dependent on the decision support services office being set up.  It will be early 2020 before that will be in place.  That will hold it back.</p>  <p>  Deputy Browne asked about money messages.  As he appreciates, that is not in my gift.  That is a matter for the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is an issue with a number of Private Member's Bills which I am aware of but I am not sure of the solution for it.  A number of people mentioned advocacy groups and funding for them.  I share that belief very strongly.  I had a very constructive meeting last week with the Irish Advocacy Network.  It was a very impressive organisation to me.  I would like to see the work that it does extended to communities.  It does it in residential centres.  I undertook to work with it in the HSE.  I have approached the HSE myself.  I will continue to engage with it to see if I can increase funding.  I was impressed and think that is a very important aspect.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny asked if the new right for a patient to initiate a tribunal will impinge on the automatic right to a tribunal already in place.  It will not.  The patient will still have access to both and both carry a further right of appeal to the Circuit Court if necessary.  Deputy Connolly asked me to define "as soon as possible".  That is in the Bill.  It is five days or eight at the behest of the Minister.  I reiterate my thanks to Members.</p></speech>

One of the issues we discussed on both of those occasions was whether one could have a facility whereby builders unable to access finance on the open market would be able to access lower cost finance or finance stretched over longer maturities via HBFI.  We had some discussion at an earlier stage with officials from the Department who seemed to suggest that this might be in breach of EU state aid rules.  We pointed out at the time that the Rebuilding Ireland home loan provides such a mechanism where the State is able to lend at lower interest rates over potentially longer maturities to those seeking mortgages in that instance, on foot of information showing that they were not able to access mainstream bank finance.  It seems to me that there are no EU state aid rule prohibitions on ensuring that is the case.  What we are trying to do in the amendment is to give HBFI the option, if it so chooses in the context of its lending, to consider whether offering lower but nonetheless commercially returnable rates at lower interest or longer maturities to those kinds of builders.</p><p>I have used this example in all of the discussions we have had on the issue to date.  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, as originally designed, was intended to assist builders who were unable to proceed with housing developments because of the lack of funding for infrastructure.  In exchange, the Government was to get some kind of affordability dividend.  When HBFI was first announced in budget 2018 almost one year ago, Sinn F&eacute;in's response was that it could potentially be a good thing but that it needed to target builders who could not access finance elsewhere.  Furthermore, there had to be an affordability dividend for the home purchaser and, ultimately, for the social good, housing policy and the State.  The worry we have about the way HBFI is constructed in the legislation is a little like our concern about the LIHAF in that there is nothing to direct or guide HBFI into this kind of lending.  The amendment provides that this could be an option.  It is not prescriptive and it does not mean all HBFI lending has to be on this basis.</p><p>There is a reason this is important.  I bring to the attention of the Minister of State, a recently published working paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published by Eoin Corrigan, Daniel Foley and others, on precisely this issue of affordability.  We hear constantly in housing debates that we have an issue with housing supply, which is the case, but it is not just housing supply in and of itself, it is about having the right types of houses, at the right price and targeting the right purchasers.  If they are not part of the plan, we will not meet the need.  One of the startling findings in the June ESRI working paper is the scale of the affordability crisis.  It found that in lower income groups both in the rental sector and also in the mortgage sector there is a very large cohort of people who are now paying more than 40% of their disposable income on rental costs.  That is not just a feature of the current housing market.  The research identified that it has been a structural feature of the housing system as far back as 2003, which was the oldest data examined.</p><p>There is an urgent need for us to think about how we use Government policy and public resources to ensure that those people who need houses at lower prices are able to access them.  The difficulty is that the other schemes the Government has in place, for example, the help-to-buy scheme, the tax rebate scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, are not managing to provide assistance to working families on modest and average incomes, in particular in large urban areas such as Dublin and Cork, who are looking to buy but because of the unaffordability of prices of &euro;320,000 and more are not able to get onto the property ladder.</p><p>Our proposition is very sensible.  It has merit to provide that some or a significant portion of HBFI lending should target builders who are trying to provide these kinds of facilities.  It is also important to note that the only affordable housing project developed in the city of Dublin in recent years is a partnership between the community in Ballymun, Dublin City Council and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance.  They brought together private bank finance in conjunction with the co-operative housing model and council land to deliver homes for purchase prices of between &euro;170,000 and &euro;225,000 for good quality two and three bedroom homes.  There is a value in trying to find a way of using the HBFI loan facility to access those kinds of small builders and small co-ops in partnership with local authorities to ensure genuine affordability.  Our worry is that unless the Bill is amended and there is some element of targeted affordability for small to medium sized builders, the houses that built will be of a price beyond the range of affordability for households, for example, on a gross income of &euro;80,000 for two earners or below &euro;50,000 for a single earner and they will simply be unattainable.</p><p>In the previous discussions the Minister of State's counterpart was sympathetic to the principle of what we are trying to do but did not accept the way in which are trying to do it.  I am interested, therefore, in hearing his response in terms of how he thinks the loan fund can be used to achieve what we are seeking.</p><p>Almost the entire House believes that Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, is a good project.  Unless it is used to target and guarantee affordable homes, however, and this amendment is one way to ensure that, my fear is that, like the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, money will go to developers who do not need it and there will not be an affordable dividend for home purchasers or Government housing policy.  In light of this being funded by &euro;750 million of taxpayers' money, that would be a missed opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200044#RR00200"><p>The key question Fianna F&aacute;il has is whether the legislation will be in compliance with state aid rules, for example, if the amendment is made.  We do not want another long delay in setting up the fund.  We welcomed it when it was announced on budget day in October of last year.  Twelve months on, not a single euro has been provided by way of lending to the construction sector.  Along with others, Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently highlighted the growing affordability crisis.  There is no doubt that funding issues are a key ingredient of that crisis.  Any measure which makes available lower cost funding to help deliver projects at the lowest possible cost is to be welcomed.  My question in regard to this Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is whether  HBFI has the flexibility for to lend on terms more favourable than those available commercially.  Does that raise any state aid issues?  If it does not and the amendment can be implemented, it has merit.  That is the key question from the perspective of Fianna F&aacute;il because the &euro;20 million in equity capital which will provide for the establishment of the HBFI will come from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which by its very nature can only be off balance sheet if it is underpinning commercial investment in that respect.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.  The amendment has merit, provided that it is workable and can be delivered promptly rather than causing further delays in terms of seeking state aid approval and so on.</p></speech>

The housing crisis as a whole is a far bigger issue.  Several constituents have come to my office in a panic because they cannot afford to rent or buy and are above the threshold for the local authority housing list.  That is backed up by the housing figures for Dublin.  On the open market, such people are competing against landlords who wish to avail of high rents, pension funds and even local authorities in Dublin city and beyond.</p>  <p>  While very few single people can afford a house on their own in Dublin unless they are on quite a substantial wage, it is also very difficult for couples, particularly young couples, to afford a home.  Houses in former council estates, which at the lowest ebb of the economy in 2010, 2011 or 2012 were selling for &euro;100,000, are now selling for in excess of &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000.  Compared with the average Dublin house price of well over &euro;300,000, &euro;250,000 does not sound excessive.  However, a couple would have to earn over &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 to qualify for a loan for that amount.  That illustrates the scale of the problem.  Affordable housing is not about a discount of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000.  That is worth buttons in terms of the housing crisis in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The amendment is reasonable because it seeks to ensure that HBFI may issue bonds, debentures and other securities bearing such rate of interest including lower interest rates and longer maturities as it sees fit.  That is key in trying to create a climate of affordability.</p>  <p>  There has been much recent discussion of affordable rents.  I refer to the confusion caused when it was announced that the rents on St. Michael's estate would be 10% to 25% below market rent.  However, the market rent in Dublin is double what it ought to be.  Unless leases of indefinite term are provided, reducing market rents by 10% to 25% may not attract those who should be encouraged to avail of affordable rent.  Similarly, we must ensure that those who should be able to afford to buy a house or apartment in Dublin can do so such that they are not competing for accommodation provided for those less fortunate, taking a place on a housing list or adding to overcrowding in family homes.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendment put forward by my colleagues, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Pearse Doherty.  They have argued this case inside and outside the House for quite some time.  The amendment is reasonable.  Given the duration of the housing crisis, it does not go beyond what should be delivered under home building finance proposals that come before the House.  Any other country in Europe dealing with a problem of this scale would be much further down the road of ensuring the delivery of a measure such as this which addresses one aspect of the housing crisis.  No one is saying that it will address all of the problems but, added to other measures for which Sinn F&eacute;in, other parties and many of the housing groups in Dublin have advocated but which have not been delivered in the past ten years, it might go some way towards tackling the dire crisis which has been created by the lack of investment in social housing, the open nature of the rental market in Dublin for many decades and, in particular, the lack of Government action in recent years.  In spite of some tinkering by the Government, rents have skyrocketed to a level such that it is almost impossible for a single person or a family to rent a property in this city.</p>  <p>  A consequence of the crisis will be the re-emergence of urban sprawl, which may already be taking place.  As houses are built further away from where jobs are located, people will have to commute huge distances at significant financial and social personal cost.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment and does not force it to a vote because at this stage all parties need to come together to show unity on the issue and that we are serious about tackling the housing crisis.</p></speech>

I welcome the broad agreement on the Bill on Committee Stage and the constructive nature of contributions made on Second and Committee Stages.</p><p>Some of the points the Deputies raised can be addressed when we are dealing with the second amendment, which is also in the names of Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Pearse Doherty.</p> <p> Amendment No. 1 seeks to insert the words "including lower interest rates and longer maturities" in line 13 of the Bill.  Line 13 states: "... HBFI or any HBFI group entity may create and issue bonds, debentures and other securities, bearing such rate of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as HBFI or the HBFI group entity, as the case may be, thinks fit".  What the Deputies are seeking to achieve in their amendment, therefore, is catered for in the Bill.</p> <p> Section 13 provides that HBFI may borrow money for residential development in any currency through any type of debt it sees as appropriate.  This section limits the amount of borrowings HBFI can have outstanding at any particular time to &euro;750 million.  This figure does not include any loans provided to HBFI from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pursuant to this legislation, which was one of the points raised.  Other points will be raised in the second amendment.  The purpose of this section is to allow HBFI have access to market funding in the event that the demand for lending is such that the funding provided by the State from ISIF is insufficient.</p> <p> At present, it is not expected that HBFI will need to borrow additional funds as the funding provided by ISIF is expected to be sufficient to meet its business plan forecasts.  However, the ability to borrow funding in the market will allow flexibility for HBFI to grow in the future without Government support should the demand exist to do so.  That is important because on Committee Stage, and in some of the sentiments expressed here this evening, reference was made to the position if demand exceeds the amounts available.  It is important to note that any debt issued by HBFI will not be guaranteed by the State.</p> <p> Section 13, as drafted, places no restrictions on the rates or conditions that may attached to debt issued by HBFI, which was the point raised in the amendment tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Pearse Doherty.  It is clear, therefore, that the HBFI can issue debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities if it so wishes.  Ultimately, however, the terms and conditions of any debt issued by HBFI will be dictated by the market.  If HBFI does not issue such debt on terms and conditions that are competitive, it will struggle to find investors in any issued bonds, debentures and other securities and to raise additional funds.  I understand the sentiments expressed but it is on that basis that I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In an ideal world, I would have liked to table these amendments to section 4, but because of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, I was not able to do that.  In some sense, placing them in this section of the Bill allows us to have the debate but also to go a step further.  If I understand the Minster of State correctly, his indirect answer to Deputy Michael McGrath is that there is nothing in the amendment that would breach state aid rules, because under the initial wording of that section as per the legislation, what I am proposing is permissible.  First, in his response, will the Minister of State confirm explicitly that providing, for example, lower interest rates, albeit at market rates or longer maturities, would not be in breach of state aid rules?  My understanding is that it would not be but that point of clarity would be very useful.</p>  <p>  Second, it is about the Government's intention here.  The Government's intention, as this loan facility has been presented, is to lend at potentially slightly higher commercial rates to builders than they would get from the mainstream banking finance, but because it would be a larger portion of the overall loan, they would not have to pursue the more expensive mezzanine finance and, therefore, in the round, the cost might be a bit more competitive for them.  What we are proposing is something in addition to that.  That is the reason we believe there is a value in stipulating it in this section.</p>  <p>  I go back to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan because it is a good example.  I refer to a developer who has a viable project but is not able, for example, to borrow from a bank at 7%.  If he comes to HBFI under the current proposals as I understand them, he could be looking at an interest rate of approximately 8% on the mainstream loans.  What we are looking for is for those builders who could not access that mainstream finance at 7% to have an offering, where they demonstrate they have been turned down for mainstream finance but HBFI deems their project is viable, to provide them with a lower rate.  It is to establish the principle in the legislation of potentially two different rates of loans, perhaps a standard 8% for one group of builders but also something structured, in a similar way to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, for those who have been turned down but still have viable projects to get something at a lower rate.  The Minister of State is saying that is permissible already.  Why will he not accept the amendment because it makes that explicit as something HBFI can do?  That signals intent from Government and from the Oireachtas as to the direction in which we would like HBFI to go and, on that basis, I am still pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

I understand the terms of the funding must be competitive.  Otherwise, it will not do any business, but is it also the case that it needs to be on commercial terms?  Is there any difficulty presented by the explicit recognition that it can provide borrowing at lower interest rates and at longer maturities?  On Second Stage, the Minister pointed out that the specific rates charged by HBFI will be bespoke and will reflect the credit risk of each particular project, the quality of collateral, the creditworthiness of the borrower and the track record of the borrower in delivery of residential development projects to date.  The Minister of State needs to clarify if there is a problem with the amendment.  Does it create a difficulty?</p>  <p>  We are trying to be helpful.  We want to get this fund up and running.  It will not be a silver bullet for the woes in the construction industry but it could play a useful role in providing funding at reasonable rates to enable construction projects to hit the ground running and to deliver the units we all want to see, whether they be social, affordable or other.  We will come to that by way of the second amendment.  I am not altogether clear on the position of the Government in regard to the reason the amendment is not desirable from its point of view.</p></speech>

In some ways, he is suggesting we should not press this amendment because we should take people on trust.  I have found over the years that if something is not stated in legislation, it can be ignored, although perhaps not initially.  We are asking that the Bill would specifically state that lower interest rates and longer maturities can be taken into account.  It is not prescriptive, but it is something that should be provided, given the difficulties builders have stated they have had in accessing finance to build some of the many schemes we have seen, both private and public, but in the main, some of the private ones.  The excuse they have given me in my constituency is that they cannot access funding.  They say they have the planning permission and so on.  I do not know whether that is the real reason.  I doubt it in some cases because I believe what they are doing is flipping the land, once they get planning permission, to increase the value of the land and sell it on or hold it for a period while the values increase.  They cannot be hit by the vacant site tax because they are actively pursuing issues or the planning permission is live on it.</p>  <p>  There are companies that do not have creditworthiness and should never have been given social housing contracts or any contracts.  There are others in difficulties.  If this measure had been available for those companies, they might have been able to get longer maturities loans, which are now being called and is causing them difficulties.  There is a company in receivership in my area.  I do not know the exact financial reasons it is in receivership but it has caused mayhem in terms of the social housing projects and some private projects that company has undertaken.  It has a primary healthcare unit but also two major social housing projects, one in Dolphin Park and the other in Cherry Orchard, which are now in difficulty.  They will come out the other end of that, but if the finances were available at a different level, that company or other companies might have been able to bid for the tenders for those projects.  There is a logic to inserting these words in the Bill to make sure longer maturities in particular and the lower interest rates can be taken into account.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200046#TT00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I will take eight minutes and my party colleagues will take the remaining 12 minutes.  I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  To set out the parameters of why we brought it forward, there is no doubt that we have a problem in Irish society in terms of fraudulent claims.  It is having a deep impact on the cost of insurance and on people who are involved in business across the country and are consistently worried about the fact that a fraudulent claim could be made against them.  For that reason and after engaging with many organisations and groups representing retailers, hoteliers, publicans, those who require public liability for their everyday business, motor insurance companies, motorists themselves and just families and individuals who come to our clinics on a continual basis, we have now to accept there is an endemic problem in Ireland with regard to fraudulent claims.  That is not being alarmist, it is being factual.</p>  <p>  The work group's recommendations highlight the fact that we need to address this and penalise the cheats, to chuck out the cheats and the chancers and support the decent people who, every day of the week, get up, pay their bills, take out their insurance and go about their lawful business.  At present, someone who goes into a shop, hops over the counter and takes money from the cash register will more than likely face a penalty and be sanctioned by the State.  There would be a Garda investigation, potential prosecution and a conviction.  However, another person can walk into that same shop, throw some water in the toilet and pretend to have fallen, feign injury and take a case.  There is no sanction whatsoever for that type of fraudulent activity.  That does wear people down and has an impact on people.  I have met families who are their wits' end because they have had several cases taken against them that were shown to be clearly fraudulent by the video evidence that was produced to me.  When they went to court, the cases were eventually struck out but there was zero sanction.  It is a crime that pays because if someone is found to be making a fraudulent claim, nothing happens.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 26 of the original Act to ensure that in the event of a case being struck out because of fraudulent evidence being presented to the court, it would be automatically referred to the DPP.  That is not groundbreaking; let us be honest.  If one perjures oneself in a court of law, there is a good change the judge will refer it to the DPP anyway because it is an offence.  I believe this is the same principle.  We have to protect the integrity of the system and of the lawful business that people conduct on a daily basis.  We have to penalise and deter those who undermine the insurance concept in this country on a continual basis, which is that we all pay in and in the event of a person being genuinely hurt or injured, he or she can make a claim and receive compensation.  We cannot consistently turn a blind eye almost to the point of applauding these chancers, these extortionists, as though somehow if they get away with it, it is a victimless crime.  It is not.</p>  <p>  We have young people who cannot get car insurance because of escalating costs of insurance in general and the payouts.  It has an impact on people if they cannot afford car insurance.  Businesses are put to the pin of their collar.  In some cases, insurance costs as much as the rates themselves.  That is the case for some in my constituency.  Anybody who is supportive of those who are law abiding, who get up, work hard, pay their bills and taxes, pay their employees and contribute to society, who are on the front line of serving the public in many cases be it in shops, hotels, other retail facilities, will agree.  Faced with a chancer, a fraudster, an extortionist or sometimes a contortionist, with the way they throw themselves around in toilets to feign injury, we must say as a Parliament and as a society that it is not acceptable because this is a crime that has victims.  The victims are families running businesses the length and breadth of the country who, night in, night out, have the fear because a letter has come to them from solicitors claiming that their client slipped in a toilet and is looking for however much money in compensation.  They know full well that over a period of time they will pay that compensation because their premium rates will go up anyway; that is what happens.  I have met families that have been shattered by these experiences.  It is blatant extortion and it is not a victimless crime.  </p>  <p>  I urge that as a House, a Parliament and a Government, we take this seriously and head-on.  I ask that the Minister would support this Bill.  I know there may be challenges with it but let us not be afraid to go to places we have not gone to in rooting out this endemic undermining of decency.  We must support those who are injured and need compensation.  However, we should not allow every chancer to undermine the basic structure and fabric of insurance, which is to lighten the burden and ensure that those who are injured receive fair compensation.  Those who are undermining it have a lot to answer for.  Unfortunately they are never called to book at present.  There has never been a prosecution in terms of fraudulent court cases where evidence has been presented.  There is no referral to the DPP and, unfortunately, because we do not have a dedicated Garda insurance fraud squad - something I also urge the Minister to address - we cannot investigate these crimes.  We cannot prosecute them and, as long as we do not prosecute or sanction, we are sending out a message of encouragement to other chancers.</p>  <p>  I genuinely believe that we owe this to those who are on the front line serving the public, whose facilities are being used by the public, to ensure that they are protected and their insurance premiums go to pay for those who are genuinely injured and are seeking redress and compensation, and to dismiss those who are chancers and extortionists - that is what they are.</p>  <p>  There are two things to be done.  A lot more must be done afterwards but these are priorities in my view.  I hope the Bill gets universal support across the House.  There is also a need to establish a Garda insurance fraud squad, which is also a key recommendation from the insurance group.  That would be self-financing.  It would be funded by the industry so there would be no cost to the Exchequer but there would be a huge saving to the insurance industry and more importantly to the policy holders.  There would be integrity in the system whereby, when people who are fraudsters and chancers make a claim that is found to be fraudulent by the court, there is at least a referral to the DPP and thereafter prosecution if convicted.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

There is a belief among the public that the State sides with the insurance companies.  That is one argument.  This Bill is really trying to side with the genuine consumer - the person who is genuinely injured - and with the insurance companies against fraud.  This is a practical and long overdue piece of legislation.  It beggars belief that the Government has not initiated such a Bill.</p><p>Almost from the first day of this D&aacute;il, my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, highlighted the issue of spiralling insurance costs and it still rolls on.  The Government seems to be like a rabbit stuck in headlights with its failure to bring forward real and practical solutions to the problem.  The Bill before the House is a real and practical solution to part of the problem.<br/><br/>Business people have a litany of stories they tell public representatives with examples of fraudulent claims.  These claims have often been left until the latest possible moment as the legal deadline window is about to expire.  The cost to business people, which is then obviously passed on to the consumer, is profound with insurance premiums rising exponentially and dramatically.  We have scandalously high insurance premiums as a result of this, in part as a result of the cost of litigating claims.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to cast his mind back to March 2013.  This date featured in an articled penned by Peter Murtagh of <i>The Irish Times</i>three years later in March 2016 because that was the length of time it took for the case to be prosecuted and arrive in court.  It was a pretty surgical and forensic article, entitled Anatomy of a Scam.  It is the story of exactly a scam when the plaintiffs were forced by the weight of evidence to abandon their case and withdraw it.  Even the judge, Judge Linnane, said it was very clear this was a set-up.<br/><br/>What was scandalous was that no law enforcement officers were waiting at the back of the court to take some of these plaintiffs away in handcuffs, having clearly attempted to commit fraud in court.  Subsequently it was not the State that stepped in, even though there appeared to be sufficient legal backup, but it was one of the insurance companies that approached the Garda with a request to prosecute this.  That took place in May 2016.  The State took no action against this scam.<br/><br/>The Government took no action against this scam, just as the Government's response to rising insurance costs for individuals, businesses, sports clubs and charities has been appalling.  The Government has yet to establish a national claims information database.  The Government has yet to tackle insurance fraud.  The Government has yet to establish an anti-fraud unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All the while businesses, taxi drivers, charities, organisations and individuals face spiralling motor insurance costs.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelleher mentioned young drivers.  Drivers with older cars and older drivers have essentially been put off the road by the rising cost of motor insurance.  This Bill is part of Fianna F&aacute;il's response to this issue.  It is not our only response; we have proposed two or three other measures.  This is a very practical measure to ensure that files for those individuals who are proven to have brought fraudulent cases will be passed directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  Passing this Bill would represent a good day's work on the part of this House.</p></speech>

The country has been crying out for such legislation.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the D&aacute;il under Private Members' time to clamp down on false and fraudulent insurance claims that are happening on a daily basis.  The purpose of our Bill is to amend section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and to provide that a court that dismisses a case on the basis that it is a fraudulent action must refer the matter to the DPP.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has long called for reform of the insurance market.  In 2016, the D&aacute;il passed a Fianna F&aacute;il motion calling on the Government to reform the insurance market, to make it more transparent and ultimately to reduce premiums.  Motor insurance customers, businesses, charities, sports clubs and many more people continue to face insurance premiums that are far in excess of what is justified or fair.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, while premiums have reduced by 11% in 2017, since the start of 2012 premiums have increased by 31%.  The Government&rsquo;s response to rising insurance costs has been appalling.  After nearly two years of raising this issue we have yet to see any tangible responses from the Government.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a concrete proposal for combatting the excessive costs of insurance for businesses and customers nationwide.  When seeking to lower these costs, we must take into account the issue of fraud.  While we acknowledge the right of genuine claimants to fair compensation, false and misleading claims have negative consequences for Irish policyholders and further drive up the cost of insurance premiums across the nation.</p>  <p>  The working group on insurance costs this year concluded that the major issue in the personal injuries area is the lack of investigation and prosecution for fraud where it occurs.  While the working group reported earlier this year that section 26 - the section specifically tasked with dealing with fraud under the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 - is not working effectively, no specific action has been taken by the Government to address this.  The Government has yet to establish a national claims information database, has yet to tackle insurance fraud and has yet to take any action on stabilising personal injury claims.  The Government has not handled these issues well and I urge the Minister to take on board the measures proposed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  While the industry needs to be heard, so too do the countless customers who have been ripped off as their insurance premiums go through the roof.  The Bill aims to remedy these issues by amending the provisions of section 26 to allow that where the court has exercised its investigatory function and if it has determined there is sufficient evidence for striking out the claim on the grounds of fraud, there would be an opportunity for the DPP to take it up.  The Bill is another front in the battle against the excessive costs of insurance premiums and we look forward to getting cross-party support for it.</p>  <p>  Needless to say we have all had experience of this, as my colleagues have alluded to.  Business people come to our constituency offices who are crippled with insurance costs and claims.  It is bizarre that insurance companies do not liaise, consult or discuss with their policyholders when they decide to pay out on a claim.  When somebody makes a claim and the insurance company takes it upon itself to make a payment, the policyholders have no inkling that is happening until after the event and, of course, they pay the ultimate price when their insurance premium goes through the roof.  They should be compelled to discuss any claims or settlement with their policyholder before a settlement can be made.</p></speech>

It is a simple and practical proposed solution to an issue that has dogged business and industry in the insurance area for some time.  I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation where we have considered these issues.  Many delegations and interest groups from the sector have appeared before the committee to give evidence.  The consensus across the board has been that this item has been long in abeyance.  It is a boil that needs to be lanced and the Bill represents a step towards doing so.  I hope in the spirit of new politics the Bill will progress.  I do not know what support it will enjoy from around the House and from the Government in particular.  I hope it will be fully supported.  It is an example of sensible legislation being advanced as a Private Members' Bill.  I hope it can proceed and not be bogged down as many Private Members' Bills have been in the past.</p>  <p>  We know the cost of insurance is a huge cost preying on SMEs and the small business sector.  In many cases it cripples their ability to be competitive.  It also contributes to the cost-of-living increases for the average individual, along with things such as rent, mortgage interest rates, the cost of accessing education, and for younger people in particular, the uncertain work front in terms of the gig economy and uncertain contracts.  Insurance is yet another piece into that mix that escalates the cost of living, makes it more difficult and generates more uncertainty in the economy.</p>  <p>  Before becoming a Member of this House, one of the things I did was to study for the bar.  I was delighted to see the Minister at the Red Mass yesterday marking the start of the new legal term.  As a law student a number of years ago on court visits, I was always perplexed when I looked into courts particularly personal injury cases to find that while one party wins and one party loses, it was very clear that one party was lying or fabricating evidence and advancing a version of the truth that was found by a judge not to be true.  I was always amazed at how those people could walk out of court again unhindered and maybe try it again somewhere else a week later if the opportunity arose.</p><p>It seemed there were no consequences relating to this kind of activity, which was rife.  It was extraordinary that it was allowed to continue.  This is a simple measure which has been recommended on many fronts and I believe it needs to happen.</p> <p> I do not want to finish on a negative but I have to comment on the lack of action.  I studied the report of the cost of insurance working group's and I know many different actions were taken.  However, while there were to be 11 actions for this year, only one of these appears to have been agreed and followed through on, and that action was to set up a further sub-committee.  In terms of tangible actions which can deliver results, I do not believe we have yet seen any, which is unfortunate.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.  It provides an opportunity for all of us to put aside past delays and actions and get behind something that is comprehensive, effective and can deliver results.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate that the objective of the Bill is to deal with the issue of insurance fraud, particularly as it arises in cases which may come to be dismissed under the specific terms of section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  On behalf of the Government, I am, therefore, pleased to note the content of the Bill and to say it will not be opposed on Second Stage.  I am doing this on the basis that substantial amendments to the Bill will be required and proposed by the Government on Committee Stage for reasons that I will outline and which Deputy Kelleher will fully appreciate.  I welcome his initiative.</p>  <p>  As Members will be aware, section 26 of the 2004 Act deals with the issue of dismissal on the basis of false or misleading evidence given in a personal injuries action.  It does this both in regard to the relevant proceedings and to any affidavit sworn in support of those proceedings under section 14 of the Act.  The court shall dismiss an action in such circumstances "unless, for reasons that the court shall state in its decision, the dismissal of the action would result in injustice being done".  When considering this section, we should also remember section 25.  That section already makes it an offence to give or adduce false or misleading evidence in personal injuries cases.  It similarly makes it an offence to give, or dishonestly cause to be given, an instruction or information to a solicitor or a person acting on behalf of a solicitor or an expert in regard to a personal injuries action.  For the purposes of section 25, the act is done dishonestly if the person does it "with the intention of misleading the court".</p>  <p>  As reflected in Deputy Kelleher's introduction, the underlying challenge is, therefore, to make sections 25 and 26 of the 2004 Act more effective in their implementation, particularly in terms of dealing with any fraud which may lie behind them.  I want to assure the Deputy that this specific issue is one of which I am acutely aware.  It is among those matters being considered by the cost of insurance working group established by the Minister for Finance in July 2016 and chaired by Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy.  The objective of the working group is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer-term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs.  A significant factor identified by the working group in its reports, which are publicly available with action updates on the Department of Finance website, is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims.</p>  <p>  The group published its report in January 2017 and its further report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance in January 2018.  My own Department or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the lead entities in respect of 17 out of 48 recommendations that have arisen from these reports, and a number of them also involve the Courts Service in their delivery.  The working group has brought together all the relevant Departments and offices involved with the process, for example, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the State Claims Agency.  In addition, the working group embarked on an extensive consultation process and met with the key stakeholders, including Insurance Ireland, and considered submissions received.  As part of that process, the need has been highlighted for greater operational linkage between sections 25 and 26, and for greater follow-up to personal injury cases in terms of prosecuting alleged insurance fraud.  Key to this approach has been the convening of a fraud round-table by the Department of Finance in late 2017, which is progressing a number of fraud-specific recommendations, including with the direct support of my Department.</p>  <p>  In its report on the cost of motor insurance published in January 2017, the working group reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  It noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggests a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On the basis that much more could be done by the insurance industry and other defendants to pursue allegations of insurance fraud, and that the framework for the reporting of alleged insurance fraud cases to the Garda authorities is now being strengthened, the working group was satisfied that sections 25 and 26 did not need further review.</p>  <p>  In its January 2018 report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, the working group further acknowledged that the decision to apply section 26 is a difficult one.  There are a range of considerations to be taken into account by the judge concerned in determining whether fraudulent or misleading evidence given in any claim is &ldquo;material&rdquo; to the claim on the basis of the evidence put before him or her, or whether there is any injustice that would be caused if the claim were dismissed.  The working group was again of the view &ldquo;that appropriate use of the legislative provisions in the 2004 Act could be facilitated by encouraging industry to make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where they believed fraud to have featured in claims&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The group also believed that more could be done to establish a nexus between the relevant stakeholders to allow for the claims of fraud to be investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted.  It also considered that it was not conducive to the effective tackling of insurance fraud if there was a systematic view among defendants or their legal advisers that raising an allegation of fraud under section 26 of the 2004 Act may carry a risk of awards of aggravated damages.</p>  <p>  As a direct result of these deliberations, a number of measures are being taken by the Government by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect.  Recommendations 11 and 12 of the working group&rsquo;s January 2018 report concern the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area.  I understand it is anticipated that the necessary PULSE update will be in place for the end of this month.  Recommendation 13 of that report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims.  As a result, I am happy to report that the new guidelines for the reporting of allegations of fraudulent insurance claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were published yesterday, as agreed between the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland.</p>  <p>  I also intend to introduce, as recommended, an early amendment to section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with the matter of a verifying affidavit in a personal injuries action, as referred to in section 26 of that Act.  The amendment, if enacted, would provide for a court hearing a personal injuries action, where there is a failure to lodge an affidavit in court by the set deadline, to draw inferences and deduct costs from the party responsible for this failure.  While these are just some examples, it will be appreciated that a concerted policy approach is, therefore, being taken by the Government with the support of the cost of insurance working group and its round-table on fraud.  This represents a series of mutually reinforcing measures that, in their collective implementation, will give greater effect to sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I now turn to some specific issues that arise in regard to Deputy Kelleher's proposed amendment under the Bill that will need to be considered.  While it has been the case that judges have ordered matters to be brought to the attention of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in some instances, the director would generally refer any alleged criminal matters onwards for the consideration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The office has confirmed to my Department that it is not within the function of the director, as prescribed in the Prosecution of Offences Act of 1974, to investigate the commission of criminal offences or to direct An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do so, or as to the manner in which this should be done.  Accordingly, where there is a question of whether there should be an investigation into the commission of a criminal offence, in this case of alleged insurance fraud, it is considered that it should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Another fundamental consideration is that of differing standards of proof.  Where a case is dismissed under the terms of section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, this is a matter on which the court has been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that false or misleading evidence was intentionally provided.  It would be for another court to decide in the context of a criminal trial whether it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that an offence was committed under section 25 or any other relevant provision.</p><p>Consideration must be given to the mandatory referral of transcripts and evidence as proposed in the Bill as that might well be seen as an interference with the separation of powers in so far as it removed discretion from the Judiciary.  A number of other concerns have been raised regarding the referral of court transcripts on practical grounds of availability, cost and the fact that there may be reasons this would be contrary to the interests of justice in particular cases.  Examples might include referring an entire transcript where there is sensitive personal or medical information or transcripts involving minors or <i>in camera</i>proceedings.  However, while further consideration will be given to these and other matters, I am happy to note that the content of the Bill proposed by Deputy Billy Kelleher is not being opposed on the understanding that serious amendment will be required and proposed by the Government on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The intention behind the Bill, which is positive, is to provide that where a court has dismissed a personal injury insurance claim on the basis that it is a fraudulent action, it will be referred automatically to the DPP.  Many of us have been lobbied by businesses, community organisations, GAA clubs and so on as to the huge impact of significant insurance premiums, not only on profit-making organisations but on voluntary non-profit making organisations.  It is a major issue which is causing businesses to question their viability and community organisations to raise funds which might otherwise have been applied to equipment or renovations just to keep operations on the road.  The cost of insurance is a very real issue for society and where false claims are made, money is being taken indirectly or directly from the pockets of other citizens, including those making legitimate claims.  Those who make false claims cause an injury to society as a whole.</p><p>As matters stands, where a personal injury claim is brought before the courts and dismissed on the basis that false or misleading evidence was given by the person taking the claim, it is rare that a prosecution for attempted insurance fraud occurs.  The Bill intends to change that state of affairs and to act as a deterrent to the bringing of fraudulent claims by providing for all files to be sent to the DPP.  The Minister has referred to the separation of powers and to the different burdens of proof which apply and these are reasonable.  However, the legislation does not propose that this process would lead automatically to a criminal case in court.  Rather, it merely contemplates the DPP receiving the file.  It would be the function of the DPP thereafter to consider it.  Potentially, that would require additional resources as this could be labour intensive work and that is a question of whether we are serious about tackling insurance fraud.  The DPP could evaluate the merits of an individual case and state whether there was a chance of success on the basis of a burden of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt.  I do not know, therefore, if the Minister's concerns are borne out in that it does not automatically follow that there would be a subsequent court case.  If a second court case occurred, judges would have to take into account the nature of the evidence presented, whether there was an intention to mislead the courts in seeking or obtaining a financial settlement and whether it is proper that this happens given that we see a knock-on effect on those seeking to get insured with costs being exorbitant.</p><p>While Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Bill and hopes to see it progress, it cannot be taken in isolation when it comes to the overall reform of the insurance industry.  While the Bill represents a sensible step, it will not do all that much to tackle high insurance costs borne by individuals and businesses.  Section 2 proposes to insert a subsection at section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which deals with fraudulent actions.  To a certain extent, section 25(2) of the Act already deals with the issue and provides:</p><blockquote>If, after the commencement of this section, a person gives, or dishonestly causes to be given, an instruction or information, in relation to a personal injuries action, to a solicitor, or person acting on behalf of a solicitor, or an expert, that&mdash;(<i>a</i>) is false or misleading in any material respect, and<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) he or she knows to be false or misleading,he or she shall be guilty of an offence.</blockquote><p>The Bill appears to create a mechanism to further advance the law as it exists to ensure it is enforced on a more frequent and firm basis.</p><p>Last month, new judicial guidelines for personal injury claims were recommended as a matter of urgency in an official report of Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns who stated that while genuine claimants need adequate compensation, the negative impact of high premiums on businesses and consumers had to be recognised.  According to the Personal Injuries Commission, compensation for whiplash claims in the State are running at 4.4 times the level in Britain.  The commission found that the average soft-tissue award in Ireland is &euro;17,338 compared with just &euro;3,984 in Britain.  Having said that, there is a balance to be struck in these matters.  The Law Society has expressed the view that simply lowering damages will not automatically mean lower premiums.  It could be that simply reducing damages in a blunt way could take money from deserving persons who have suffered injury through not fault of their own and put it in the pockets of what are already very profitable insurance companies.  While we should proceed, it should be with due care for the interests of genuine claimants who I would like to think represent a substantial category if not the majority of claimants.</p><p>The Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke, has signalled his agreement with the findings of the report and stated that an overall set of judge-made guidelines would contribute not only to consistency but to the proper calibration of the overall level of awards.  He cautioned that new guidelines should not be too rigid, which is something that needs to be taken on board.  The model referred to in the Bill might be useful and is not dissimilar to a model I have proposed more generally on sentencing guidelines in the Judicial Council Bill.  Guidelines for judges are useful tools when utilised correctly and would be highly beneficial to all parties.</p><p>Regarding insurance more generally, my party received documentation under freedom of information a few months ago which revealed a series of missed deadlines by Insurance Ireland since early 2017 to progress the proposal to set up an insurance fraud unit, funded by the insurance industry, within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Unfortunately, this has led to a delay in the establishment of that unit.  This unit has long been called for and Sinn F&eacute;in supports its establishment, which would be of use.  However, Insurance Ireland has dragged its feet.  This has been on the agenda since early 2017 and was recommended in the report on the cost of motor insurance of January 2017.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na submitted a mechanism for further co-operation with Insurance Ireland in the first quarter of 2017 and this was due to be discussed that year by Insurance Ireland.  Insurance Ireland deferred discussion until September 2017 and was due to communicate with the Garda in October 2017.  By December 2017, Insurance Ireland had come up with a proposal for a full cost-benefit analysis for a proposal it had initially proposed itself, subject to approval by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>Given that Insurance Ireland has made a point of identifying fraud as a cause of insurance premium increases, one would have thought that a cost-benefit analysis would have been relatively straightforward.  It is unfortunate that we have allowed time to slip by.  One has to question how serious Insurance Ireland was about the proposal in the first place.  Insurance fraud is theft and should be pursued rigorously and prosecuted.  However, this is not a model we should have spent time waiting on.  We have serious concerns about the proposal that a section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be funded by industry.  The independence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is essential but a direct funding relationship with private interests would undermine that independence.</p><p> There are, more generally, alternatives to a pure reliance on the private market.  The State makes motor insurance compulsory but leaves it up to the private market to provide it.  That is the deal, but the private market is not upholding its part of the deal.  The State should, therefore, seriously examine alternatives.  In New Zealand, for example, all drivers are covered for the basic legal requirements by paying their registration and, if they have petrol vehicles, a few cents at the pump.  No young person or isolated family would face being off the road because of the whims of an industry that cannot get its story straight as to why premiums are so high and in constant flux.  This is a viable alternative.  Of course, there would have to be discussions with the EU, but the Central Bank in briefings has not ruled this out as contrary to EU or Irish legislation.  This is the kind of thinking we need and the kind that Sinn F&eacute;in believes we must pursue.</p> <p> The insurance industry is under investigation by the competition authorities not only domestically but also at EU level over anti-competitive practices, so any such Garda fraud unit should be funded by the State and at the cost of approximately &euro;1 million.  I believe this is within the capacity of Government.  This has been allowed to slip off the agenda or at least has been slowed down by an abdication of the State's responsibility in allowing Insurance Ireland to string the rest of it along.  If we are serious about tackling fraud, sound bites will not suffice.  The lack of action in this area is unfortunate.  Insurance fraud is not to be taken lightly and has wider ramifications for society as a whole.  I outlined at the start of my contribution that it has serious implications not only for employers but also for voluntary organisations and community associations.  It must be tackled head-on using a suite of measures.  I hope all parties can commit to this on a legislative basis and in a broader policy sense.  It is time for a serious discussion on where we go from here regarding the insurance sector more generally.  I also hope all parties and stakeholders will come together to tackle an industry on which the softly-softly approach has not worked.  We must act in the interests of people rather than the interests of the industry, and I hope this legislation falls within that approach.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, said, Sinn F&eacute;in will support it.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to amend the 2004 Act such that when a court has dismissed a case on the basis of it being a fraudulent action, it is automatically referred to the DPP.  The current situation, whereby someone appears before a court and tells what can be clearly proven to be blatant lies in trying to get compensation and whereby the defendant must take it upon himself or herself to seek justice, is simply not acceptable.  Such cases should be automatically referred to the DPP.  I am a member of the business committee, as Deputy Lawless said earlier.  As part of the recent report we did on the cost of doing business in this country, we had many stakeholders and businesses before the committee and we talked about the issues affecting them such as rates, pay and so on.  The biggest issue, however, and the one that dominated our discussion was insurance: the ever-increasing cost of insurance premiums and the cost borne by people having to defend cases that are clearly false.</p>  <p>  The Alliance for Insurance Reform has done sterling work on this issue.  The alliance is a non-political group that brings together 20 civic and business organisations from across Ireland, including charities, representing 35,000 members, more than 633,000 employees and 41,000 volunteers in community groups throughout the State.  The alliance has been at the fore in campaigning for action to be taken on escalating insurance costs for businesses and charities.  It has cited amendment of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 as one of its ten asks in addressing the problem of escalating insurance costs.  As part of the presentation - not the business presentation, but the outreach to different groups and so on - we saw various videos in which people basically staged fraudulent future claims.  They were busying themselves falling in shops and restaurants and they were throwing water on the ground and then suddenly slipping on it.  The person who threw the water on the ground for the other person to slip on was the witness.  These cases were brought to court and there was no prosecution of the people involved when the cases were subsequently discovered to be fraudulent.  In some cases, insurance companies did not pursue the fraudulent person but the insurance premium of the company increased massively.</p>  <p>  The alliance has expressed its huge and intense disappointment with the slow pace of reform and has said policyholders have been thrown to the wolves by the Government, with which I agree.  Over many years, the cost of public liability insurance has been a consistent problem.  Not alone does it affect small and medium-sized businesses, pubs and other local sites of social activities throughout Ireland, in particular rural Ireland, but it also affects things like children's playgrounds, GAA social club centres and taxi drivers.  It has the effect of closing down many small enterprises, with the consequence that people become unemployed.  Businesses are being bled dry by outrageous increases in insurance premiums, which are forcing some low-margin enterprises out of business.  I am sure all Deputies have heard the same stories from businesses and community groups that I have heard again and again about the large premium increases, which are hampering their growth and forcing some businesses to close down.</p>  <p>  We need a serious, far-reaching and radical shake-up of the insurance system in Ireland.  The recently announced Garda fraud unit is welcome, but there is significant concern that it will be funded directly by insurers, which should not be the case.  Earlier Sinn F&eacute;in launched its pre-budget proposals, which contained provisions to fund the Garda fraud unit from public sources.  There is a clear need for such a unit.  However, it is the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to form such a unit, and it should be funded from State resources.  Fine Gael has been in government for seven years, and it seems all we have got so far is the cost of insurance working group.  This group, however, has not brought about any reduction whatsoever in insurance costs.  The Government's approach has been described as death by 1,000 consultations, which is an accurate portrayal.  Every time we raise this issue we are referred to some new report, consultation, discussion or working group.  We do not need any more of this; we need real, tangible and far-reaching action.</p>  <p>  I again thank Deputy Kelleher for bringing forward this Bill.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will use some of its influence in the coalition deal to ensure that insurance costs are tackled to help businesses across Ireland.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is that in the future, when a court has dismissed a case on the basis of it being a fraudulent action, it is automatically referred to the DPP.  I welcome this change because, currently, our system allows people to get away with fraudulent cases in the courts.  If an insurance claim is taken to court and the evidence presented shows it to be fraudulent, it is often the case that no action is taken against the claimant.  Our insurance companies tell us that to factor in fraudulent claims, a cost is built into insurance premiums.  We are too well aware of the crippling insurance costs being experienced by anyone who has car, home, farm or business insurance.  The list is endless because the bottom line is that right across the board, insurance costs have risen to an all-time high and it is clear that these increased premiums are because of insurance companies having to factor in fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  I am inundated with representations from constituents who are distressed and upset because of the quotes they are getting for motor insurance.  Why should the honest, everyday person have to suffer these high premiums because of the illegal activities of others?  It is time we stood up and took action.  I welcome this Bill as it is a step in the right direction.  I support any individuals and business owners who go about their day-to-day lives and business lawfully.  We have seen businesses suffer greatly with crippling insurance costs, with their public liability insurance increasing by as much as 70% in the past four years.  An example of this is a wonderful business in my constituency that had to go public on this matter.  I refer to the West Cork Secret gardens in Kilbrittain, an important amenity in west Cork.  It is used by people far and wide and provides much needed employment in a rural area.  It has found its insurance premium going from under &euro;5,000 a year to more than &euro;20,000, which is outrageous.  How does the Minister or anyone else expect any business to cover an insurance hike as high as that?</p>  <p>  The rising cost of insurance premiums is putting significant pressure on businesses and is not in any way helping any business to keep its doors open.  It is clear that fraudulent insurance claims are having a negative impact on businesses and their owners.  Can this Government put its hand on its heart and say it has considered the emotional and psychological impact of this on small business owners?  I have met constituents who are business owners, such as garage owners, self-employed people, tradespeople, publicans, nightclub owners, hoteliers - the list goes on.  These business owners can often be threatened by being taken to court by fraudsters, and what normally happens is that the insurance company settles out of court because fighting the claim in court is not worth the hassle.</p><p>This has to stop.  Going forward, if an insurance claim is taken to court and the evidence presented shows it to be fraudulent, the Director of Public Prosecutions needs to prosecute these fraudsters.  There is an opportunity here for the Garda and an insurance fraud squad to be employed to investigate these fraudsters.  It is high time we stopped allowing these fraudulent claims to continue.  I have not seen this Government make a meaningful effort to address this issue.  Under the programme for Government there is an obligation on the Government to act on this issue, particularly given that the cost of insurance working group was established with that purpose in mind.  I urge this Government to address this matter in a meaningful way.  There should be no more pussyfooting around.  It is time real action was taken.  I commend Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-02a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="21:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200051#YY00200"><p>I am delighted to be able to speak on the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018.  I thank Deputy Kelleher for bringing it forward.  The provision for the transfer of court transcripts to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in cases where individuals have made fraudulent claims is long overdue and very welcome.  I only hope that the Director of Public Prosecutions will have the resources, staff and appetite to deal with it.  As Deputy Kelleher noted when introducing the Bill on First Stage, there is good evidence to suggest that, in order to factor in the cost of fraudulent claims, a large cost is built into the insurance premiums of businesses across the State, which leads to uncompetitiveness.</p><p>I have to declare that I am a businessman myself.  I have insurance and it is just out of control.  One pays for everything.  One gets less and less cover while paying more and more.  If the insurance companies were proactive and challenged the fraudsters they would do a lot better.  Deputy Kelleher also reminded the House that evidence provided by Insurance Ireland and many other groups dealing with the matter indicates a systematic abuse of the courts process by fraudulent claimants and that businesses throughout the country have seen their public liability insurance increase by as much as 70% in the past four years.  Some have seen increases of 100% and a startling 150%.</p><p>While all this is true, I still think the focus of the Bill is misplaced.  Of course we need to challenge those who make fraudulent claims, but what of the insurance companies themselves that seek to manipulate the level of risk to justify exorbitant and scandalous increases in premiums?  Deputy Stanton is a Government Minister.  There was a report compiled; it went on for nearly two years and came up with something like 70 recommendations.  A maximum of five would have done.  That was passing the buck and diluting it further, so nothing came out of it.  Who is going to challenge these people or these organisations when they submit highly misleading data on the nature of the risks they face in order to squeeze the last drop of financial blood from young drivers or from those seeking to renew their insurance cover?  It is a cartel.  If it looks like a cartel and walks like a cartel, it is a cartel.  That is what it is.  Whether someone is a young driver or an old driver, a haulier or working in plant hire, a shopkeeper or an undertaker, a hairdresser or a chemist, everyone is facing it.  It is just beyond a joke.  We are standing idly by while these people are forced out of business.  They really are persecuted by these exorbitant rates and they have nowhere else to go.</p><p>I accept that the Bill before us needed to be targeted and specific, but it remains the case that we urgently need to introduce a system in this State whereby, when insurance companies cannot verify their pricing levels, a file be prepared and be sent to something akin to the fraud squad for investigation.  Of course, the fraud squad is understaffed.  There is no appetite across all the regulators and other bodies to deal with this.  A blind person could see what is going on.  </p><p>Last year we saw motor insurance providers in Ireland being subjected to a series of raids - which we welcome - as part of an investigation into suspected anti-competitive practices by agents from the European competition authorities.  Europeans had to come in.  It was not our own regulators or our own agents.  They all seem to be - I will not say complicit - ignoring what is going on.  The agents were accompanied by their counterparts from the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, during the operation.  It is a case of bringing a horse to water but not being able to make it drink.  Why did the CCPC not do this itself?  Why did we have to have the Europeans come in?  Everybody knows it is a scam.  </p><p>In a statement the European Commission said it had, &quot;concerns that the companies involved may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position&quot;.  Anti-competitiveness is exactly what Deputy Kelleher said he hoped this Bill would tackle.  It is just a pity it does not include the insurance companies as well as those who seek to rip them off, because they are all part of it.  We saw the advertisement about the fraudulent claimants with their hands in our pockets on RT&Eacute; for a long time, but the insurance companies have their hands in our pockets and they have the lining burst.  They have gone down to the bottom of the cuffs of the trousers.  They are just piling on the premiums and they do not care about the people they are hurting.  As I have said, there are excesses for this and that and they will not challenge these cases.  They will settle them on the steps of the court.  One ends up paying out for a huge legal bill from both the insurance company and the claimant.  It is farcical.  The lawyers, the fat cats, have to take their share of the blame as well.  </p><p>This stinks to high heaven.  It is crippling our fledgling businesses, it is turning off entrepreneurs and it is destroying community groups, GAA clubs and whatever else one could name.  There were nightclub owners in here telling us about 200% increases in their premiums.  We cannot afford it.  When people are intoxicated and fall down steps in a nightclub, cognisance must be taken of such things.  We cannot have a kindergarten minding people inside the nightclub.  We must have <i>realpolitik</i>here.  We must tackle the insurance companies as well as the fraudsters because they are all in it together.  Money is going around but he who pays the piper calls the tune.  People are tired of paying the piper.  They cannot afford to do it any more.  This is damaging jobs.</p></speech>

As we know, this Bill seeks to reduce the number of fraudulent insurance claims by ensuring that false claims are dealt with under the law, and rightly so.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, on bringing this forward.  Fraudulent insurance claims are costing each and every consumer hundred of euro.  It adds to the costs of businesses, car owners, house owners, and sports and community buildings.  They are all impacted.  One of the most effective and visual advertisements that I have ever seen on our screens is that particular advertisement that shows people taking money out of our pockets.  That is absolutely what fraudulent insurance claims are doing and that is why insurance premiums are continuing to rise.  It is absolutely down to fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  We know from the CSO that since the start of 2012 premiums have increased by 31%.  It was even higher, but last year there was a slight reduction.  Unfortunately we do not by how much business insurance has increased because no index is kept.  That is also wrong because we need to be able to measure these things in order to be able to help and support businesses when they are in crisis.  This is one of the things that puts them into crisis.  We simply must make would-be fraudsters think twice about making false claims.  We absolutely must clamp down on false insurance claims because they are driving up the premiums for everyone else and adding to the rising cost of living.</p>  <p>  Currently, even when false claims are identified, legal action against them most often does not ensure.  This absolutely needs to be dealt with.  That is why Deputy Kelleher drafted this Bill.  If passed, this Bill will ensure that those who engage in this criminal activity - and let us not for a second think it is anything else - will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We need to make it absolutely clear to would-be false claimants that if their claim is determined to be false they will face consequences.  Anyone who suffers injury or harm resulting from an accident is, of course, deserving of fair compensation.  We absolutely acknowledge the right of genuine claimants to fair compensation.  However, many criminals are making false claims for compensation and, very unfortunately, insurers in Ireland have a habit of paying out compensation without appropriate investigations and without any consultation with those who are paying their insurance premiums.  In many cases, the person who has had a claim made against him or her only finds out when his or her premium rises the following year.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that false and misleading claims have very many negative consequences for Irish policyholders and further drive up the cost of insurance premiums.  We absolutely need to make sure that we stop that and show the decent people of this country that we are on their side and are doing our best to stop these fraudulent claims.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il has long called for reform of the insurance market.  In June 2016, a D&aacute;il motion was successfully passed by our party calling on the Government to reform the market, make it more transparent and reduce the cost of premiums.  However, the Government's response to rising insurance costs for individuals, businesses, sporting clubs and charities has been appalling.  After two years of raising this issue, we have yet to see any tangible responses from the Government.  The Government has yet to establish a national claims information database, tackle insurance fraud, establish an anti-fraud unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, establish an index to track business insurance premiums and take any action on stabilising personal injury claims.</p> <p> This is another front in the battle against the excessive costs of insurance premiums.  We look forward to getting cross-party support for this Bill on Second Stage.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

I commend my party colleague, Deputy Kelleher, on his work in this area.  For the past several years, premiums for motor, public liability, house and health insurance have all risen.  I have dealt with many small businesses in Enniscorthy, Gorey, New Ross and Wexford where insurance costs are crippling their opportunities to trade.  Individuals, charities, community groups and sports clubs are also badly affected.  Their insurance bills are a kick in the teeth for their honest hard work and, even more so, when those bills are going up because of fraud.</p>  <p>  I want to specifically address the growing scam of cash-for-crash cases.  They involve a set-up where a car is rolled into a wall or deliberately driven into the back of a friend's car to allow all involved put in claims.  These manufactured collisions put other people's livelihoods of risk, risk injuries and drive up premiums.  It is dangerous, reckless and relies on intimidation, theft, fraud, perjury and conspiracy.  Those involved are not worried about being caught because, even if they are, there is no follow-up.  The Garda claims it does not have the resources to follow up on these types of fraud.</p>  <p>  Effectively, the con is on because these people are getting away with it.  Until individuals are sent to prison, it will not stop.  We need to see more action in this area to tackle those fraudsters, to see them brought before the courts and going to prison.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher is bang on the button with the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018.  The public is frustrated by the Government's slow response in respect of this issue.  While I acknowledge that certain actions have been taken, the reality is that addressing this needs to be speeded up and we need to get results.</p>  <p>  I have raised before in this Chamber the example of a local family hotel in my constituency.  Several years ago, its public liability insurance cost &euro;12,500.  When it was reassessed, it increased to &euro;21,000.  It is now at &euro;50,000 because the hotel had two small claims made against it.  Only last night, a family member told me that they will not be able to continue in business if this continues.  There is not a realisation as to how many groups and businesses are on the brink because of massive insurance costs.</p>  <p>  The organising committee of one of the country's most famous and oldest fairs, the Ballinasloe horse fair, had to have several meetings this year to see if it could obtain insurance cover.  Its insurance this year to cover a few days came to a whopping &euro;14,000.  This is a voluntary group in Ballinasloe town that has been organising the fair for many years.  It had asked public representatives to help but there was little we could do.  To fork out &euro;14,000, before even covering other costs, is a high price for a community group.</p>  <p>  GAA clubs and other voluntary groups are telling us that their insurance costs have increased.  Many involved are asking whether, in light of rising insurance costs, their community groups can remain in existence.  Festivals add to the economy.  If we did not have them in many counties, local economic activity would be reduced.  The organising committees involved are asking serious questions regarding what they can do about rising insurance costs.</p>  <p>  The Government seems to roll over on certain issues and is moving slowly.  We must leap into action, get decisions quickly and deal with these fraudsters and others who, without question, have got away with unacceptable behaviour for many years.  The European Commission is continuing its investigation into alleged anti-competitive behaviour in the Irish insurance market.  That inquiry has been going on for some time now.  Surely some results should be coming from that.  We hope that in the near future we will get those results.</p>  <p>  I commend the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the house.  I hope we can move forward in bringing reductions to insurance costs to the many groups and organisations to which I have referred.</p></speech>

I also thank those Members who have participated in enriching our debate on Second Stage.  As the Minister stated, there is a common objective shared by Deputy Kelleher's Bill and the Government's initiative of establishing the cost of insurance working group and its round-table on fraud to reform the insurance sector.  I also acknowledge the various concerns expressed by Deputies about the high cost of insurance in this jurisdiction and the adverse impacts of such high insurance costs on private citizens and enterprise.  I have had discussions with businesses and concerned citizens about this.  The Government is taking this matter seriously, as are all Members who spoke tonight.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to address these issues and what is colloquially described as the claims culture that drives it.  As has been outlined, the Department of Justice and Equality is doing its part in addressing these matters under 17 of the 48 recommendations made in the reports of the cost of insurance working group.  These reports cover in their scope motor insurance, personal liability insurance and employer insurance as areas which give rise to particular concern.  Along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who chairs the working group, all members of the Government are determined that real headway now be made in addressing these matters with lasting effect.</p>  <p>  The reform measures recommended by the cost of insurance working group extend beyond those which fall under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality or Deputy's Kelleher's proposed amendment.  For example, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018, introduced by the Minister for Finance, passed Second Stage on 20 September 2018.  This is a product of the work of the cost of insurance working group where it emerged that it was essential that there be an improvement in transparency around what was causing premiums to be so volatile, both up and down, over relatively short periods.  The group, therefore, recommended the establishment of a national claims information database on a legislative basis to facilitate a more in-depth analysis of annual claims trends of motor insurance claims.  This will be key to developing an understanding of how claims costs are impacting premiums, in particular understanding the relationship between the price paid by a customer for motor insurance and the cost to insurance undertakings.</p>  <p>  A key component of these overall reform efforts is the need to tackle insurance fraud.  This includes giving renewed focus and effective follow-up in the courts to the provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Court Act 2004, which lies at the root of Deputy Kelleher's Bill.  It is fair to say that we are on the same road in this regard.</p><p>To bring these initiatives to their shared destination, we just need to adjust some of the signposts along the way.</p> <p> Given the broad range of challenges being faced, section 26 of the 2004 Act will not solve all our problems on its own; even if amended, it can only give rise to a limited number of outcomes in terms of alleged insurance fraud.  In making these remarks I would therefore draw renewed attention to the fact that in its report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, the working group expressed the belief that "in order for section 26 to achieve more effectively its aim of tackling personal injury fraud, there is a major onus on defendants to challenge misleading evidence, where appropriate by taking it to court, rather than settling on the court steps for fear of an unsatisfactory outcome&rdquo;.  As mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the working group was also of the view "that appropriate use of the legislative provisions in the 2004 Act could be facilitated by encouraging industry to make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where they believe fraud to have featured in claims".  Yesterday's publication of the new guidelines for the reporting of allegations of fraudulent insurance claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which have been agreed between the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland, is, I believe Members will agree, a good example of the kind of encouraging measures that we need in this regard.</p> <p> These concerted reform initiatives represent a series of mutually reinforcing measures that, in their collective implementation, will strengthen sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act.  I look forward with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to our ongoing consideration of Deputy Kelleher's amendment Bill, including the substantial amendments to the Bill that will be required and which I expect will be proposed by the Government on Committee Stage.  As the Minister said earlier, we are not opposing this proposed legislation.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, the cost of living is very high and part of that is attributable to the cost of insurance.  It is crippling people.  Therefore, anything that can be done to alleviate this problem is very welcome.</p>  <p>  Spiralling business and motor insurance costs are undermining the competitiveness of the State and putting businesses and households under severe pressure.  In my constituency of Cork South-West, I have been inundated with people contacting me who quite simply cannot cover the cost of insurance for their property, be it their car, house or business, and often those who do manage to come up with the money are struggling financially in other parts of their lives.  </p>  <p>  As my colleague pointed out, anyone who suffers injury as a result of an accident is entitled to fair compensation.  However, criminals who are all but making a career from false insurance claims need to feel the full force of the law.  The very fact that premiums have increased by 31% since 2012 is indicative of a system that is lawless and without recourse.  That coupled with the lack of any reasonable interactive method of recording information relating to those who make false claims is simply unbelievable in this day and age.  </p>  <p>  As the law stands, even those with false claim allegations levied against them may not face a legal action.  This amendment will go a long way towards remedying this as a fundamental claim may be referred by the court to the DPP.  I am glad that the Minister of State is supporting this Bill.</p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, on once again highlighting it, as well as Deputy Michael McGrath, who has been working on this topic for many years.</p>  <p>  A consistent question I am asked in constituency clinics and when I meet the people of Kerry is: "Why are insurance costs so high?"  They find the costs very difficult to comprehend.  They also ask why we, as legislators, cannot do something about it.  There is an onus on us, once and for all, to do something about the spiralling insurance costs that are crippling many businesses.  </p>  <p>  I attended a briefing given by the Alliance for Insurance Reform in the audiovisual room a few months ago.  More than 20 different industry groups were represented, including hoteliers, the car rental sector, the Construction Industry Federation, the Galway City Business Association and so on.  A person attending that briefing who, I believe, was from a Galway fast-food chain showed a video of an individual setting himself up for a false insurance claim.  He went into the washroom area of one of the facilities, threw water on the floor, broke up his mobile phone, put water on himself and then went out and claimed he had fallen and broken his phone, and looked for &euro;500.  Thankfully, the owner has closed circuit television, CCTV, footage of the incident and that cleared him.  He brought the footage to the Garda but decided not to proceed because of what it would cost him to bring the individual to court and the almost inevitable outcome of the individual being given a warning or a fine which would not deter him from carrying out such fraud.</p>  <p>  Legislation is needed to make sure that false insurance claims are adequately dealt with.  The enactment of this legislation would go a long way towards achieving that.  We also need to examine closely the compensation levels that are paid in Ireland.  Why are we paying up to four times more than our UK counterparts for minor injuries such as whiplash?  I believe the very high compensation levels that are available in this country are attracting people inclined to engage in fraud and something needs to be done about that also.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a willingness in the House, once and for all, to tackle this scourge.  The business people, homeowners and law-abiding citizens of this country deserve fair insurance rates.  By introducing this measure, it will be one element of reforming the industry that we all need but unfortunately few of us can now afford.</p></speech>

There is unanimity in the House that something has to be done to address the issue of fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  I am not a font of knowledge on this issue.  The only expertise I can claim is that I am bringing the messages that have been clearly outlined to me by business associations, farmers' organisations, those in the retail sector, individuals who come to my clinic or those I meet in my constituency on a daily and weekly basis.  They are saying they can no longer function in a market that is weighing them down with costs, one of the biggest costs being insurance.  From public liability to health insurance to motor insurance, it is a major issue across the board.</p>  <p>  This Bill is about sending out a strong message that if someone goes about making a fraudulent claim, there will be a consequence.  To date, unfortunately, there has not been a consequence.  There have not been any prosecutions of people who went to court and fraudulently claimed they had been injured.  It is important to send out a signal that the apparatus of the State, in terms of its prosecutorial arm, will step in to protect those people who are lawfully paying their insurance, the payment of which provides protection to the public using their facilities, in the context of public liability.  This provides for a person to claim and to seek compensation and redress in the event of there being an injury.  The idea that somebody can pretend he or she was injured in a premises and there be no consequence is wholly unacceptable.  It undermines the basic decency of society.  We have to protect those who, through taking out insurance, are protecting others.  That is what they are doing, and we must be very conscious of that. </p><p> Reference was made to the fact that public liability insurance has increased to &euro;50,000 for rural hoteliers.  These are country hotels in the middle tier; not at the high end.  We now have a situation where insurance costs more than rates in some parts of the State.  That undermines the competitiveness of industry and commerce and puts jobs at risk.</p> <p> There is a final area where it is evident.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and others raised the issue of motor insurance for young people  Younger drivers who live in rural or isolated areas simply cannot go to work or college because they cannot afford the motor insurance.  An element of the cost built into motor insurance premia is the scam artists, chancers and criminals who go about this country plying their trade knowing that there is no sanction whatsoever.  It is the same as going into a shop and robbing the till, but if one was to do that, there would be a sanction, a Garda investigation, a file to the DPP and a potential prosecution.  One can, however, throw water on the floor or empty a Lucozade bottle onto the floor of a premises and pretend to fall around the place.  It can be blatantly obvious through video and CCTV that a real fall never took place, yet nothing happens.  That same person will go to another shop or another retail outlet the following day and do the same thing.  This eats people up because they do not like being wronged.  They would like the State to protect them when they have been wronged.  Chancers and fraudsters who continually go to courts on a fraudulent basis are doing this in spades in the State.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for his words of support.  I also thank the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am open and amendable to amendments but the general principle has to be that we must do something to protect businesses and individuals from chancers and cheats.</p></speech>
