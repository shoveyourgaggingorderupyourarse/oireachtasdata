I accept that it is not responsible for the full response of the Government but the Department has a key role to play and the report of the Children's Rights Alliance refers to a number of initiatives.  The report serves to highlight the challenges that children and their families face with child poverty and, in particular, homelessness.  However, teachers also face a challenge in dealing with the crises as presented to them in school.</p></reply>

These include National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, supports and Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, supports.</p>  <p>  Identification of need and early intervention strategies are considered key components to supporting children who experience homelessness.  NEPS works with schools through the Department of Education and Skills continuum of support framework.  The NEPS model of service works through a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to principals and teachers on individual students' needs and in the development of whole-school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.</p>  <p>  DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage.  DEIS provides additional supports, through the DEIS school support programme, to schools identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged communities.  Schools can use the additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort, including the additional needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  DEIS schools can also avail of home-school community liaison and school completion supports provided by Tusla's educational welfare service in relation to school attendance, retention and progression which can be areas of particular challenge to pupils experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Employment and Social Protection runs the school meals programme, which provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,580 schools and organisations benefitting 250,000 children.  My Department is also represented on the homelessness inter-agency group established by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to co-ordinate the State's efforts to tackle homelessness.</p></reply>

I accept that this is not primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Skills but the alliance recommends that the Government set up an inter-agency group involving the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to steer services and to see what each Department can do.  The Department of Education and Skills has a particular role.  The Children's Rights Alliance has recommended that the school completion programme would be extended to homeless children in non-DEIS schools.  What is happening in the private rental sector in particular is that children are not necessarily in DEIS schools.  If one is in a local authority estate and the local school is a DEIS school then one has access to all the services based on the demographic of the area.  However, if one is in the private rented sector in a non-DEIS area one does not have access to many of the services.  Children are losing out significantly on their education whether through non-attendance or due to being exhausted in school.  As the Children's Rights Alliance recommends, the Department must track the progress of those children to ensure that they do not lose out on educational attainments.</p><p>Something else the Minister could and should do immediately, which is also recommended by the Children's Rights Alliance, is issue a circular providing advice and guidance to schools on educational provision for children experiencing homelessness.  There could also be recommendations to boards of management to address school costs, voluntary donations etc.  Some instructional advice from the Department of Education and Skills would go a long way.</p></speech>

Anecdotally, I am picking up more examples of the prevalence of child homelessness in feedback from teachers dealing with children in homelessness.  It would be a wise and important suggestion to ensure that all the information on whatever supports are available is provided to schools.  Reading excerpts from the report of the research carried out by the Children's Rights Alliance, one of the areas highlighted is a failure to retain predictability in educational continuity.  That is important in education.  I will ensure that boards of management and school principals are aware of the available supports.</p></speech>

Has the Department statistics or information on the extent of the problem in schools?  One of the recommendations from the Children's Rights Alliance is that the educational attainments of children be tracked.  I am concerned, however, that the Minister and the Department do not have information about individual children.</p>  <p>  We know from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government how many children have been left homeless but the Minister for Education and Skills and his Department do not know what is happening to those children in schools.  It is not known what schools they are concentrated in, how their educational attainments are being mishandled because of this crisis and what resources schools need.  The Department needs to up its game on this issue and make sure these children are looked after and that they do not lose out educationally because of the homelessness situation in which they and their families find themselves.</p></speech>

Currenlty, we are reviewing the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme and educational disadvantage.  Educational disadvantage changes and evolves and new issues and challenges arise.  As part of our review of DEIS, we are using data we are compiling from postcodes on where people are living and also information on unemployment issues in regard to certain families.  We need, however, to be adaptable regarding the changing nature of educational disadvantage.  Over the past five to ten years, homelessness has certainly become a major issue.  My officials are aware of that and I will ensure, whatever measuring instruments are used to tackle educational disadvantage, that continuity of education and the disruption and lack of certainty for families and children going to school is part of any analysis in the future.</p></speech>

What is the Department's plan to address the acute shortage of ASD classes and services being provided for children in both primary and post-primary education?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800004#B00900"><p> My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of special needs organisers, SENOs, for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.  For the 2018-19 school year, 160 new special classes have been opened.  That means there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  There are 1,196 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes. </p>  <p>  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school.  Enrolment in a special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he or she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day, even with appropriate supports.  The placement decision is based on a recommendation made by a relevant professional.  While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. </p>  <p>  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required.  In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, when commenced, will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs.  Section 8 of the Act, which will commence from Monday, 3 December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800004#B01000"><p>I thank the Minister.  Some of what he said is welcome.  I am aware of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which we debated in the House.  My fear is that we again have a situation where children who have an additional need or a disability are falling through the cracks or being left behind.  They are being treated differently from children starting in mainstream schools with no additional needs.  It is often at the last minute when the parents of children with an additional need finally find out they have secured a place in an ASD unit.  There are long waiting lists and we know that they are increasing.  A study in 2016 found that one in every 65 students has an ASD diagnosis and, therefore, we are very much playing catch-up in this area.</p>  <p> One of my main concerns is the attitude of schools when it comes to children with a diagnosis of autism.  Many schools are good, as are many teachers.  There are also, unfortunately, many schools that just do not want to know about ASD and will encourage parents to send their children elsewhere.  There is no written proof but we all know that it happens.  Kids are put on a reduced-hour day, perhaps two or three hours, with the hope that the parents will eventually just give up on that school and go somewhere else.  We need to tackle that attitude as well as tackling the provision of places.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800004#B01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because we have been grappling with it over the past ten to 15 years.  The statistics from 2011 reported 548 special classes.  That is now up to nearly 1,459.  We are making gains but, at the same time, affording choice to parents has to be at the heart of that provision.  I refer to whether they want their children to go to a special school or a special class or if they need ASD provision.  The increase in the number of ASD units throughout the country has proved to be a significant success.  That is attributable to the great work of the SENOs and the NCSE, as well as the work the Deputies did on the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which gave the Minister for Education and Skills the power to compel schools, where there is insufficient supply of ASD classes or special classes, to ensure that provision is made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800004#B01200"><p>I agree that where ASD units are operational they are, in the main, successful.  That, however, is the reason I raised this issue.  Greater access is needed for students.  There are many different examples of where that is needed and I am not the only person who could cite examples; every Deputy could probably do so.  Some students cannot start school.  They have to go to a special school and were supposed to start in September 2018 but they cannot start until September 2019 because of the lack of access.  Those students cannot get access to any more pre-school provision because they have used up their two years.  That puts a child with an additional need at a disadvantage.  Parents are also being told that their children can have a place in an ASD unit but the unit is miles from their home.  They will have to spend an hour and a half on a bus before getting to school.  That again puts a child at a disadvantage.  In the main, that is not the case for children attending school who do not have an additional need and that is what we need to focus on and tackle.</p><p> We seem to be okay with treating children who have an additional need differently and saying to them that they have to wait, that they might not be able to start until October because we do not have a place for them and they have to put up with being on the bus for an hour and a half.  In my opinion that is not good enough, and I am sure it is the opinion of the vast majority of people.  That is why we need to ensure we have places.  This was one of the good parts of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.  I hope that we will put the pressure on schools that want to turn a blind eye or direct people to the school down the road.  That attitude has to change.</p></speech>

In my early meetings with the officials in this area, I raised the question, even prior to the 3 December change, of compelling schools in cases where there is insufficient supply, a problem with a class or a need for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit.  My message to officials from day one has been to look with favour on any building request from a school for an extension which will accommodate an ASD unit and free up another classroom.  That is the message coming across from Deputy Funchion as well.  It is important to ensure equality of access for parents who want the best standards for their son or daughter.  If they want their son or daughter to be in a mainstream school they cannot be disadvantaged.  If they do not have a special class or ASD unit they are disadvantaged.  That is the philosophy behind compelling the Minister to ensure this happens where there is an insufficient supply.</p></speech>

I would also like to thank all concerned for their patience and understanding over the last several weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department will now be moving as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at the 42 schools and, following on from this, to implement the permanent remediation works required.  The Department fully intends to pursue the company through all contractual and legal channels for the cost of the precautionary measures and the remediation work.</p>  <p>  It is also my intention to initiate an independent review of the Department&rsquo;s design and build programme, including aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight, both before and after implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014.  This will also involve the role and responsibilities of clerks of works, project managers, architects, designers and other professionals.  This will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity outside the Department and will be informed by the more detailed structural investigations to be carried out in the next phase of the programme.</p></speech>

Will this individual, whoever he or she is, have the statutory powers to get to the nub of the issue?  If one takes a case to the High Court, powers of compellability, evidence discovery etc. can be utilised.  In the first instance anyone who is responsible needs to be brought to court, but in the second instance the Department must carry out a review with strong powers.</p>  <p>  One of the aspects of this case that caused some concern was that the project management firm KSN Project Management, KSNPM, was originally involved in quite a number of the projects as a project manager for the Department.  It was then involved in advising the Department over recent weeks.  Has it raised any concerns for the Minister that KSNPM was involved?  Maybe they are excellent people.  They probably are.  However, the firm was there at the start and it is still advising the Department.  It is giving some people the perception of a possible conflict of interest.  Did this cause any concern on the part of the Minister? </p></speech>

I will keep the Deputy up to date on that.</p>  <p>  In regard to the current situation, last week I was in Tyrrelstown along with the Taoiseach.  We met representatives from KSNPM who have been working through this.  We met with members of the board of management and the principals of both schools in Tyrrelstown.  We are still trying to get the first and second floors into a fit state for the students to come back in the next two to three weeks.  That is the focus.</p>  <p>  In regard to KSNPM's involvement, at no point in this process was the firm involved in any certification of compliance.  The responsibility at all times, on any project before or since the 2014 legislation, is with the contractor, the builder, the architects and the design team.  At no time was KSNPM involved in any certification of compliance.  Second, KSNPM's knowledge of the buildings was very helpful during the process that took place over the Hallowe'en break when we were under pressure to get work done in a very speedy way.  My first personal contact with KSNPM was last week.  I met a few of the firm's officials and I would like to acknowledge all the work they did over the last several weeks.</p></speech>

Information can be given to people for various reasons.  One piece of information I have discovered is that of the 42 schools, 13 were originally project-managed by KSNPM and 27 were project-managed by another company, which I understand was Turner &amp;amp; Townsend.  I understand that of the 13 originally project-managed by KSNPM, 12 passed the recent audit and one failed.  Of the 27 that were originally project-managed by Turner &amp;amp; Townsend but examined this time by KSNPM and the Department's other advisers, 20 failed and seven passed.  I do not know if the Minister can confirm that information.  Does it cause the Minister, his advisers or his officials any concern if it is correct?  The builder is ultimately responsible for this, but we want to make sure the Minister is satisfied that there are no issues or conflicts and that he has the best possible advice.</p></speech>

It has to happen quickly.  That review will be independent.  We are going to look at every aspect, including KSNPM, Turner &amp;amp; Townsend, the contractor and the Department's own clerks of works, which since 2017 have been appointed on every site.</p>  <p>  Second, it is important to put on record that we have set up an independent unit within the building unit in Tullamore.  We now have dedicated officials working on this issue to take it through the independent review and to do everything to make sure that the remediation and precautionary work is paid for.  A lot of scaffolding and fencing was required.  Some of it was imported at short notice.  At the three school campuses at Ashbourne, for example, 3 km of fencing went up over a weekend.  That costs money, and the taxpayer will want to know who has paid for anything that costs money.  My officials are determined to look at culpability and accountability and follow the people who put children's lives at risk.</p></speech>

There has been an incredible 50% drop in investment per student since 2008.  This crisis will bite very badly at every level and will cause hardship among many students unless we address it by means of significant increases in investment and assistance for students experiencing accommodation problems, poverty, difficulties paying fees and so on.</p></reply>

This year alone, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;400 million on access measures for further and higher education students.  This includes circa &euro;380 million on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 78,000 further and higher education students.  In terms of access initiatives, under the national access plan approximately 16,000 students are expected to be assisted in 2018 through the student assistance fund at a cost of &euro;9 million, whereas 12,000 students are expected to be assisted through the fund for students with disabilities at a cost of &euro;10 million.  Approximately 400 students will benefit from the 1916 bursary fund under the programme for access to higher education, PATH, at a cost of &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>  The national student accommodation strategy, NSAS, was published in July 2017 to enable an enhanced supply of student accommodation as part of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  It set a target of 7,000 additional purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces to be delivered by the end of 2019 and construction of at least 21,000 bed spaces by 2024.  This initial target is expected to be exceeded, with over 10,000 bed spaces either completed or on site as of October 2018.  The Government is also developing measures to provide better rent predictability in purpose-built student accommodation in the forthcoming residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.</p>  <p>  Finally, the block grant paid to higher education institutions includes a specific weighting to promote access to higher education.  This involves an additional premium for all eligible access students.  This takes account of the cost of additional measures to support the enrolment and retention of students from under-represented backgrounds.  For those from targeted socioeconomic groups and mature students, this is applied for the first two years of course duration to reflect the higher support needs during this period.  For people with disabilities, a further weighting is applied for the entire length of the course to reflect the higher support resources required.</p></speech>

With regard to access, 90% of students in Donnybrook attend university but 16% of students in Darndale do so.  This reflects the fact there are so many different barriers to access.  The cost of living per annum while studying at third level is &euro;12,000, which is a big expense.  We have some of the highest registration fees anywhere in Europe and accommodation costs increased 11.5% in the first quarter of 2018 alone.</p>  <p>  Ms Michelle Byrne, vice president of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, spoke at a meeting we held during the week and she told me an incredible story that she says is typical.  She related how a young postgraduate student is travelling every day from Cork to Dublin and back again to attend her third-level institution because she cannot afford student accommodation.  At Dublin City University, student accommodation providers tried to increase rents by 27%.  The Irish Universities Association has pointed out that we are now have one of the lowest levels of investment per student anywhere in Europe and, as already stated, that investment has dropped 50% since 2008.  There was only a 1% overall increase in the recent budget, which is not good enough.</p></speech>

The first is providing the platform to ensure students stay on after the junior certificate to sit the leaving certificate.  I came across a very positive story at Larkin community college in Dublin's north-east inner city.  When I spoke with the principal and staff at the college, I was informed that there is an 80% progression rate from leaving certificate to third level, including for trades and apprenticeships.  It is an ambitious school and it is able to compete on the points scale as well, with students getting into the top courses and universities.  There are examples of the fact that people will get to third level if the support system is provided.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's second point related to the barriers of cost and I can pick that up in my county, with parents making the decision as to whether it is affordable to send a son or daughter to college in Dublin.  These are the questions on the minds of parents.  We need to continue an all-of-Government inclusive support.  I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling their motions, which we support, seeking to ensure that we can have more supports in high-pressure zones and where the rental costs are high.  We must continue to work in an all-of-Government and inclusive manner because this is such an important matter.</p></speech>

This accommodation costs an absolute fortune.  It is a complete waste of time because people are just making money out of a student accommodation crisis.  We need purpose-built low-cost student accommodation on or near campuses.  That needs significant investment.  I will make a simple point on overall investment in third-level education.  We give &euro;700 million in research and development tax credits, mostly to big multinationals in this country.  That money should be redirected to our universities and third-level education.  Instead of giving money to Apple and Google through tax breaks for so-called research and development, it should go to our universities in order to offset the chronic underinvestment to which I refer.</p>  <p>  This crisis is taking a serious toll on students.  We have the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in the world.  The USI report indicates an absolutely massive demand for counselling services in universities, with tens of thousands of students needing counselling and a large number reporting burnout or an inability to carry on because of the stress they are being put under on all fronts, including in the context of costs, accommodation, overcrowding, etc.  There is a serious problem and we need a hell of a lot more investment and support to address the crisis.</p></speech>

I know some students go on their own and do not have that support.  I realise that there is pressure.  There is an acknowledgement that we must ensure there is accommodation on campuses.  A number of important provisions in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which was passed by this Oireachtas, facilitate higher education institutes in borrowing money from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of financing student accommodation provision on campus.  That is happening not just in the capital but throughout the country.  Universities and other third-level institutions are considering at ways to make more accommodation available for students.  There are also rapid planning applications for student accommodation developments with in excess of 200 student beds.  They are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  We must continue to focus on affordability and what universities can do.  We should also acknowledge that universities and other third-level institutions are under financial pressure as well but we must examine ways to keep affordability at the heart of this conversation.</p></speech>

I have been a public representative for a long time but I have never seen this matter raised as much as now.  When we try to deal with one matter, another pops up.  Of the 16 major projects for the area, only two are at the on-site stage.  In addition, we have had the problem at Ardgillan community college and other issues.  This is unsustainable in a growing area and we need a serious strategy to deal with such concerns.</p></reply>

When I walk down the corridor and meet Deputies and Senators from north County Dublin, it is the only matter they raise.</p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years up to 2022, including six new primary and two new post-primary schools to be established in north Dublin.  The four year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for additional school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p> <p> I know that the issue for the Deputy is the here and now, what happens today and what happens in September in the context of enrolments.  I am working very closely on this with my officials to see if we can expedite the land acquisition, provide temporary accommodation and ensure that we meet the basic needs of students next September.</p></speech>

We all saw the day that was in it yesterday but parents, teachers and students from St. Joseph's Secondary School in Rush organised a protest in the town.  They walked from the existing school to the field where the new school is supposed to be built.  The school is oversubscribed this year by 140 students.  They were outside the D&aacute;il earlier this term and while it is an incredibly useful education for them in the need to protest to get things delivered, they should not have had to do that.  What answer does the Minister have for them today?  I appreciate that the Minister has outlined the method that the Department is using but I am telling the Minister that it is not working.  The situation is critical for St. Joseph's and for St. Maloga's school in Balbriggan, which I have discussed with the Minister previously.  In that school, 58% of students are in 20 year old, crumbling prefabs in the current appalling weather.  St. Maloga's is only at the project brief stage even though it has been in the pipeline for so long.  The same situation prevails at St. Michael's House in Skerries.  We have been told that it is a priority but the Department has not even acquired a site yet.  The system is broken.  The needs of these young people whose education is time sensitive must be addressed in a better way.</p></speech>

There is a drive on now to acquire the site for St. Joseph's.  The project is included in the Department's six-year plan up to 2021.  The capital funding has been ring fenced and there is no question of this not happening.  We must try to move forward within the time constraints and pressure.</p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that there has been an explosion in housing in north county Dublin.  We are constantly hearing in this House that the Government is not building enough houses but there has been an explosion in the provision of accommodation in north county Dublin in the last five years.  However, that is not an excuse for not acting.  I will bring the concerns of colleagues from north county Dublin back to the officials in the building unit in my Department and ensure that this issue is kept on the radar.</p>  <p>  In respect of St. Joseph's school, the Department will be providing two science laboratories, one technical graphics, design and communications room and one general classroom as an interim measure.  The main issue is completing the site acquisition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="11:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800007#E00400"><p>The problem is that the population explosion did not happen in the last five years but happened well before then.  The children who live in that community and who are part of a population that has been growing for the past 20 years are now in primary and secondary school.  They are facing a logjam, not to mention the children to whom the Minister refers who will be starting school in the next few years.  It is critical at this stage and the point I am making is that the system is broken.  To take St. Joseph's as an example, the issues in that school have been long flagged.  It is not the case that the school community has only taken to the streets in the last month: they saw this coming.  The Department was warned and the concerns were flagged.  The issue has been raised in this House and with the local authority.  In this House, we are told that the local authority is dealing with the matter and is looking for a site but when local councillors raise it with the local authority they are told that no-one in the Department has contacted the authority about finding a site.  Meanwhile, children and their parents are out on the streets, protesting.  The story of St. Joseph's is replicated in other areas, including Skerries and other parts of north Dublin.  I did not even get a chance to address Swords, a town with a population approaching 40,000 where there is a critical school accommodation problem.  I have tabled another question on that matter which we will come to later, hopefully.</p>  <p>  The system is broken and the children and their parents who were out in the rain yesterday deserve better.  We really need to look at this.</p></speech>

Obviously the population in the area has been growing over the last ten to 20 years.  Our Geographical Information Science, GIS, system is factoring in recent house building and family formation in the context of future planning.  That is why we have identified the need for 42 new schools nationally.  There is obviously a gap in this area and that is something of which I am very conscious.  I will continue to liaise with colleagues on this issue and keep the pressure on with regard to the land acquisition.  The Deputy is correct in saying that there are similar issues in Skerries and other parts of north county Dublin.  In terms of school planning areas, the list includes Beaumont, Whitehall, Swords, Scribblestown, Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Donaghmede, Castleknock, Carpenterstown and so on.  There has been a population explosion in north Dublin with which we must deal and this is a priority for me.</p></speech>

The answer to this question is a little different.  It is a variation of the previous response so I will put it on the record.</p>  <p>  The safety of the school students and staff has been my priority from when the initial invasive work was done in Ardgillan on 19 October.  It continues to be my overriding priority.  I shall give a summary of the outcome.  Nineteen schools were cleared to open in full without any precautionary works, 19 were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of fencing around all or part of the building and protective decking, and three were enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal and external precautionary measures.  The latter relates to two schools in Tyrrelstown and Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Lucan.  One building, namely phase 1 of Ardgillan Community College, closed completely.</p>  <p>  Internal precautionary works are currently ongoing on the upper floors of the three schools that were opened initially at ground floor levels only.  I assure the Deputy that the Department's priority is to have these works completed to enable all three schools to open fully and the students who were temporarily decanted off site to return in the coming weeks.  I acknowledge the impact this has had on parents, staff and boards of management in recent weeks.  I thank them not only for their patience and understanding but also for their proactivity.  They have been proactive in ensuring whatever measures needed to be put in place would be put in place.  I was in Tyrrelstown last week.  I watched how the work was organised.  It included garda&iacute;, stewards and staff decanting students on a day-to-day basis in the rain.  It was exceptional work in a short period.</p>  <p>  Let me focus on what happens next.  We will move as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations in all 42 schools, even the 19 that did not have any structural issues.  Following this, the objective is to implement the permanent remediation works required. </p>  <p>  It is also my intention to initiate an independent review of the Department's design-and-build programme, to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight, examining aspects both before and after the implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014.  This will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity outside the Department.  This review will be informed by the more detailed structural investigations to be carried out in the next phase of the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="11:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800008#F00900"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  The final part is important and the key.  There is no doubt that the schools have done great work in opening and dealing with the issues that have arisen.  The fact, however, is that these are brand-new schools and they should not have to deal with these issues.  That also has to be recognised by the Department.  As the Minister said, more than half of the 42 schools built by the company concerned, Western Building Systems, have been confirmed as needing remediation work or at least precautionary protective measures pending further investigation.  I am thankful the Educate Together school in Letterkenny was one of the schools that showed no problems when reviewed and was able to resume activity.  It is clear, however, that the Department's design-and-build programme was compromised in some way or another, and that is the crux of the problem.  It might have been through not thoroughly investigating companies in the procurement process prior to signing the contract or through not inspecting buildings properly.</p>  <p>  I have seen from previous commentary that questions remain as to who is ultimately responsible.  That is what we need to get to.  Ultimately, the Department is responsible because it is the procurement body and it is paying.  The people are not getting what they are paying for and this has to be addressed and examined by the Department.  Changes have to be put in place to make sure contractors comply with what is required of them.</p></speech>

We are in a responsible position and have to ensure not only that there is value for money but also that if we are sending young people into schools, they are safe.  My officials were working in the understanding that the schools were safe structurally.  There is a massive break of trust in terms of who signed off and who was ultimately responsible.</p><p>That is why I want the independent review to examine all aspects of the process, beginning with procurement.  The idea that we must have people looking over the shoulder of a bricklayer to check whether wall ties have been installed is not normal in construction.  There must be a degree of responsibility.  However, if checks are necessary before the cavity walls are closed to ensure wall ties are of the right place and number, that will be done.</p></speech>

The Department has been neglectful in regard to such checks.</p>  <p>  The constant drive always to get projects constructed as cheaply as possible is at the root of this problem.  These schools will no longer be value for money in the light of the costs incurred in recent months for investigations and remedial works.  None of that was considered when the cheapest possible tender was selected.  These schools are ultimately going to prove very expensive as a result of the short-term view taken in opting for the cheapest tender when the priority should have been for the Minister to ensure that the schools were built to the proper standard.  Schools offer value for money when they operate for 20 years without requiring additional work to counteract substandard work carried out under the contract.  A low-cost tender does not necessarily indicate value for money.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

Does he propose to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover the cost of the works on the schools?  We do not want a further disaster in terms of the existing building programme being further delayed due to the significant amount of remediation work involved.  As the Minister is aware having visited them, the schools in my locality have been wrapped.  A massive amount of work is being done on them.</p></speech>

There is a deficit of information regarding a permanent fix for these school building projects.  Parents are asking me what is happening.  They are not reassured by the temporary fixes that are in place.  Has the timetable slipped considerably in that regard?</p></speech>

There has been an average 18% increase in the cost of private sector construction, including of houses, hotels and apartment blocks, because of the delay involved in ensuring a fire officer inspects the project and ensures every step has been properly completed</p>  <p>  On the speed of the works, many of them were built within a 24 to 26 week period.  That is not to say that rapid build cannot be done properly.  Rapid build construction is being employed to deal with the housing crisis and for several student accommodation projects, as was raised earlier.  It works if it is done properly.  The message that must go out is that whether a building is to be completed in 24, 36 or 42 weeks, it must be done properly.  There was obviously carelessness and unacceptable standards in the construction of these schools.</p>  <p>  A Supplementary Estimate was submitted for the Department of Education and Skills.  We do not have a specific figure for the costs because we must first undertake a comprehensive assessment of all 42 schools.</p>  <p>  In regard to the timeframe that Deputy Byrne mentioned, I refer to the decanting of students from Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Lucan and the two schools in Tyrellstown.  It was envisaged that the works on the first and second floors would be completed as a priority in the coming weeks.  That work is continuing, with working hours extended after 3 p.m. and at weekends.  We hope to get those students back into their schools.</p>  <p>  The second piece of work, which is significant, will be a comprehensive analysis.  We have set up a new section in the building unit to deal with it.  Once that has been completed, we will maximise the holiday period to progress any work that is required.</p></speech>

I congratulate him and wish him well in his new role.</p><p>My question regards a matter of great interest to his and my home country, namely, the status of the site acquisition for the Crana College three-school campus.  What is the status of the project in terms of the capital plan?</p></reply>

We have worked closely together on this issue for too long.  We are on the same hymn sheet in terms of trying to get the issue resolved as a matter of priority.  I look forward to continued engagement on the issue.  As the Deputy is aware, the education campus project to which he refers is included in my Department's capital programme 2016 to 2021 and the money required will be ring-fenced.</p>  <p>  Negotiations with the landowner in respect of the preferred site option to accommodate the campus are under way.  The Deputy will appreciate that negotiations in respect of site acquisitions are, by their nature, sensitive and for that reason I am not in a position to provide further information at this time.  However, I assure him that all parties are working to bring matters to a conclusion at the earliest possible date and Department officials will continue to keep the relevant school authorities appraised of progress.  In that regard, a meeting between school authorities and Department officials has been arranged for later this week.</p>  <p>  When the site acquisition is complete, the next stage of the process involves the project for the campus progressing to architectural planning.  At this stage it is premature to give a timeframe for completion of the building project.  I acknowledge that the local community, including the parents who have sons or daughters in the three schools, have been waiting patiently for the campus.  The issue must be taken very seriously as they have been waiting almost two decades for it to be resolved.  I look forward to continued engagement with the Deputy on the issue.</p></speech>

I join him in acknowledging the patience of the local community and the combined work and effort of the three schools, their management and the parents in terms of working towards an outcome where the three schools will be on the one campus.  Unfortunately, the patience and goodwill of the parents in recent years has not been mirrored by Government action on the issue.  It is disgraceful that no site has been provided over 11 years after the three schools agreed to amalgamate.  The Government has messed around for far too long by not prioritising the issue.  The preferred site was identified in 2013, over five years ago.  However, once that was done the Government reset the clock and restarted the process.  It is only now that I have faith that this can be brought to a conclusion.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to confirm that the ongoing negotiations relate to the first preferred site and to give an assurance that they are meaningful such that we can have some hope that there will very soon be a conclusion.</p></speech>

Frustrations manifest themselves in many ways.  We have a tremendous opportunity to bring together three great schools on a Crana College campus, including a Gaelscoil and a Gaelchol&aacute;iste.</p><p>It is an ideal scenario.  The Government's priority has always been to provide the funding.  The funding is ring-fenced under the 2016-21 programme.  There is no question about that.  The delays are being caused by negotiations with a private owner.  At this stage, all parties should be afforded the space to ensure these sensitive negotiations are carried through in a timely way.  We need to ensure we get the proper result for the community.  The various partners involved in this project, including Donegal County Council and Donegal Education and Training Board, DETB, are all on the same hymn sheet.</p></speech>

Those who run over time should be conscious that other Deputies are waiting to have their questions answered and they are preventing this from happening.  In the interests of fairness, I appeal to Deputies to watch the clock that flashes in front of them when they exceed the time available to them, as they are well aware.  This applies to everybody.  Let us to try to operate within the time constraints that exist.</p></speech>

It has taken too long to get the site that is needed as a first step.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that the ongoing negotiations relate to the first preferred site.  As he knows, recent local media coverage suggested that the site in question had been sold.  There is no doubt that this preferred site needs to be acquired if at all possible.  Every effort needs to be made to secure it for these schools.  I urge him to expedite this project in his capacity as Minister and as a representative of Donegal.  It has gone on for too long.  There is no doubt that it has not been prioritised by the Government in recent years.  It needs to be prioritised in order that the site can be secured.  DETB wrote to the previous Minister on a number of occasions to seek meetings, but it did not receive a reply for a long period.  This matter was not being prioritised at that juncture.  I will work with the Minister in any way I can to ensure it is now brought to a conclusion.  The parents, teachers and, in particular, pupils of these three schools deserve a new school, which needs to be a priority for the Government.</p></speech>

The officials in my Department are working on it.  I assure the Deputy that they are providing the necessary focus to try to bring this to a conclusion as speedily as possible.  I am conscious of the frustrations, dreams and visions of those whose sons and daughters have attended these schools and have come out the other end.  If all partners and stakeholders can work to bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible, that will be met with a tremendous drive.  The Deputy spoke about the energy in these three schools.  Like him, I am in touch with the principals and the teams in the staffrooms on a daily basis.  There is an energy to drive this project.  The development of this physical building would be a tremendous bonus to future education in this area.</p></speech>

People are making plans and preparations.  There is an additional worry for the parents of the pupils of St. Molaga's national school in Balbriggan.  They are fearful that the prefabs their kids are forced to learn in will come down around their ears.  The last time we had a heavy downpour, it was raining in one of those classrooms.  On behalf of the parents and on my own behalf, I ask the Minister to provide some words of comfort by indicating when the school will get its new accommodation and when the refurbishment works will be carried out.</p></reply>

The project will consist of an extension to include 12 mainstream classrooms, a two-classroom special needs unit and some refurbishment works to the existing accommodation.  The schedule of accommodation for the project has been finalised and provided to the school authority.  The project brief has also been finalised.  It was advised to the school recently that it is intended that the project will be progressed under the Department's ADAPT programme.  ADAPT is an accelerated programme which uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the respective design teams on each project.  My Department will be in further contact with the school when the project manager has been appointed.</p></speech>

At the moment, 58% of pupils in the school are learning in prefabs.  The prefabs are 18 years old, which is young in human terms but ancient in prefab terms.  We are aware that there has been some progress.  We need to hear that this project will be fast-tracked.  We need to hear exact timeframes from the Minister.  That is what the parents want to know.  When they woke up this morning, they knew this problem would not be fixed by the time their kids arrived in school.  They are nervous and worried.  Like most average people, these parents do not want to contact their local representatives.  They are happy never to have to see us as we go about our business.  They have been driven to contact their local representatives because the conditions their kids are in at the moment are unacceptable.  They need to hear a timeframe.  We have been told again and again that there will be action as part of a programme.  A timeframe is needed.</p></speech>

It is important to appoint an ADAPT project manager.  The Deputy is articulating this strongly and my officials are listening to her.  She mentioned the existing prefabs in the context of today's stormy conditions.  Two of the school's older prefabs have been in poor condition since Storm Ali earlier this year.  While I understand that some repairs have been carried out to the prefabs under the school's insurance policy, a condition report prepared at the school's request has indicated that further remedial works are needed.  The Department has advised the school to complete an emergency works application form with a view to undertaking remedial work to these prefabs pending their replacement as part of the proposed building project.</p>  <p> The Deputy and the school authorities are trying to do two things.  They want pupils to be able to get on with their daily lives in the education system.  They are keeping the larger project in mind as well.  They are keen to ensure the prefabs are of a standard that meets all the safety requirements.  I am taking on board what the Deputy has said..</p></speech>

I would appreciate a timeframe.  If the Minister cannot give one to me now, I would be happy to receive it in written correspondence.  It is not as if these parents are not patient; they are extremely patient.  They are looking for their kids to be able to go to school in a place that is safe.  The Minister and I want the same for our kids.  The parents are seeking a timeframe.  They are aware that this matter has been brought to his attention.  They know that this school is in the pipeline.  They want to know at what stage they will start to see some concrete movement.</p></speech>

It is intended that the process of procuring a project manager will be initiated shortly.  We could get into a more definitive explanation of what is meant by "shortly".  Some people might think it means before Christmas and others might think it means after Christmas.  In fairness, many school authorities and young people are resilient.  They will put up with lower standards if they know things are certain to come down the line.  I get that as well.  People like to be kept in the picture and in the know.  I will get my officials to give the Deputy a direct call on this matter.</p></speech>

I apologise to the students for being unable to meet with them last week; I was at an event at the Aviva Stadium.  I thank them for their correspondence.</p>  <p>  A major capital project for the provision of permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils is being addressed through my Department's capital programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has been liaising with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, with a view to providing the new 1,000 pupil school on the site of Bray Institute of Further Education, BIFE, in a campus-type arrangement.  The site in question is almost 12 acres.  It was envisaged that the master planning of the site would also provide an opportunity to put plans in place to provide modern fit-for-purpose accommodation for BIFE through a multi-million euro investment.  Unfortunately, my Department understands that the board of the ETB does not agree with this approach.</p>  <p>  My Department will have to consider this development and the next steps to address the long-term accommodation needs of the school.  This will be done as a matter of priority given the urgent need to find a permanent home for the school.</p>  <p>  With regard with the school's interim accommodation, the lease on the school's temporary accommodation on Putland Road is due to expire on 30 April 2019 and the property is up for sale.  My Department&rsquo;s preferred option for interim accommodation is for the school to remain in this location.  Accordingly, my Department has indicated to the owner of the property that it would be interested in exploring the potential to licence or lease the property from the purchaser should the purchaser be amenable to such an arrangement. </p>  <p>  My Department is also exploring other options should it not be possible for the school to remain in the Putland Road property.  In this context, it is engaging with the patron body of the school and KWETB regarding all other short-term accommodation solutions.  My Department is meeting with the patron and school management tomorrow regarding the accommodation issues.</p></speech>

I have been asking questions about this for the past two years, particularly regarding the concerns relating to the BIFE site.  I pointed out that there were issues with the identification of that site by the ex-CEO, Mr. Sean Nash, and with the engagement with the Department, which I believe should be investigated.  It is only now that the Department has acknowledged that there is a difficulty.  The KWETB board met yesterday and made a unanimous decision not to proceed with co-location on the BIFE site.  This was all flagged.  There is now a crisis.</p>  <p>  Patronage was awarded to the North Wicklow Educate Together school in 2013 and it moved into its temporary accommodation in 2016.  I do not take any comfort from what the Minister has said; he is dealing in hopes and aspirations.  There has been a suggestion that the school could temporarily relocate to the old Colaiste Ra&iacute;th&iacute;n premises in Bray.  If the Minister and the KWETB are looking at that as an option, they should know that it is not fit for purpose.  It was not fit for purpose for Colaiste Ra&iacute;th&iacute;n, which, after a lengthy campaign, moved into its new accommodation recently.  It will not be suitable for North Wicklow Educate Together in the short or long term.</p>  <p>  The simple solution to this is for the Department to purchase the Putland Road site.  Is that being considered by the Minister and his officials?  </p></speech>

I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about it yesterday.  Looking at it in a common sense, value for money way, the BIFE site is 12 acres and owned by the State.  It will not cost money to acquire, and, therefore, it is an option.   There is also a constraint on the Putland Road site because there is a protected structure on it.  It is a smaller site of some 4.3 acres.  We have to ask whether the school can do what it wants to do on a 4.3 acre site.  The Deputy believes it can.  We need local engagement now more than ever.  I have spoken to the Minister for Health, about this matter, and Deputy Brady has raised this on a number of occasions with me.  A meeting of minds is required at tomorrow's meeting.  The formal decision by the board of the ETB to reject the BIFE site as a preferred location was only taken earlier this week.  We have to take that on board.  From a taxpayer's point of view, it must be acknowledged that the officials were considering a site that would not cost anything.  The Putland Road site would cost money, and it is also zoned.  I do not know what the valuation of the site is or what it might cost.  Patronage was awarded in 2013 and the school was up and running in 2016.  Education is the most important issue, and I will focus on that.  We need certainty on what the next stage will be.  Tomorrow's meeting will be crucial in that regard.</p></speech>

We are talking about taxpayers and pupils, learners who are going to be homeless.  They will have nowhere to go at the end of April 2019.  While the Minister is thinking of cost-benefit, I think of the benefit that will accrue for the pupils and their parents, as well as the teachers, and pupils who are due to enrol in that school next September.  The school is due to increase to 300 pupils.</p>  <p>  I do not take any comfort from what the Minister said.  We need to move away from the BIFE site.  The Department must immediately refocus and examine the Putland Road site.  The school faces an immediate short-term crisis, because it will need temporary accommodation whatever happens.  I mentioned the Colaiste Ra&iacute;th&iacute;n premises, which is not fit for purpose for a number of reasons.  It is a split site and uses really old prefabricated classrooms and a VEC building; it is not fit for purpose and should be ruled out.  That leaves the Putland Road site, where the school is currently based on a temporary basis.  If the owner of that site is not open to extending the lease or to putting in place a licence, we must have a plan B, and I have not heard the Minister mention one.  We need one, and I am hopeful that such an alternative plan will be outlined at the meeting with the patrons of the school and the principal tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I am not getting any solid answers from the Minister, and I did not get any solid answers from his predecessor over the past two years.  Immediate answers are required.  Without them, 180 pupils will have no school at the end of April next year, and 60 of those will be sitting their junior certificate examinations in a hedge school.  I am sure the Minister does not want that to happen on his watch, and I, as a Deputy for that constituency, certainly do not want it to happen on my watch.  The Minister has spoken about other Ministers.  He referenced the Minister for Health.  I remind him that he is the Minister for Education and Sills and that it is his sole responsibility.</p></speech>

Alternative temporary solutions are being worked on, and we have been focusing on this issue.  The significant question is how to address the long-term issue here.  The meeting tomorrow is a follow-up to consider the decision made by the ETB.  There must be a meeting of minds, and there must be focus on the long term.  The short-term issues will be dealt with.  Certainty is also needed.  There is no point in my saying that the school will be located at a certain site.  That would do a disservice to the community and the process in place.  It is good that the ETB has now made a decision.  I understand the Deputy's frustration.  This matter has been ongoing for a number of years.  However, we need certainty, and I believe things will happen quite quickly after tomorrow's meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800012#K00200"><p>Yesterday the Taoiseach, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and crucially the Minister for Finance stated that no decision had been made or would be made on the broadband tendering process and particularly that no decision would be made on the last remaining bid.  However, in today's<i>Irish Independent </i>we read that the lead bidder for the national broadband plan is preparing to fast-track rural connections next year.  The report stated:</p><blockquote>The move would mean that the first of 540,000 rural homes and businesses under the State-sponsored scheme would get high-speed broadband in 2019, ahead of the expected 2020 rollout...<br /><br />A contract is expected to be signed in January, with the subsidy cost and other contractual terms to be finalised in the coming weeks.</blockquote><p>It is all in marked contrast to what we were told yesterday in this House.  Is this the case?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that a decision to proceed has actually been taken behind the scenes?  We note that only &euro;74 million was allocated in the 2019 Estimate for the roll-out of this plan, which compares with an industry estimate of anything from &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion as the actual cost of the plan.</p><p>Two discussions seem to be under way in parallel: one in the D&aacute;il where nothing is actually disclosed by Government and where the actual potential cost of the project is not spelled out or detailed in any way; and then in the media, helped by Government and other sources, a different story is spun.  There is a need for much more transparency and honesty in the D&aacute;il about the national broadband plan roll-out.  We need to ground the plan in some reality and not with repeated broken promises.</p><p>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach a very basic question as to whether the new bidder was a new consortium.  His reply was quite remarkable.  He said:</p><blockquote>The consortium has changed but it is not a new consortium.  It is a consortium that has changed in its composition during the process, not a new one.</blockquote><p>For the record, the September 2017 consortium that submitted to the tendering process comprised Enet - the leader, Granahan McCourt Capital, SSE plc and John Laing Group.  By the final tender in September 2018 it was Granahan McCourt Capital - the leader, Nokia, Actavo, the Kelly Group and the KN Group are all now suddenly at the 11th hour in there.  That is a changed consortium.  The key question is as follows.  Is the Government satisfied that the new consortium has the capacity to deliver this project?</p><p><i>The Irish Times</i>has an interesting article by Eoin Burke Kennedy with substantial questions.  Why has the industry in Ireland shunned this particular project given the significant Government subsidy?</p></speech>

I appreciate that 500,000 homes, businesses and farms throughout the country do not currently have access to high-speed broadband.  There are 1 million people living in those homes and the more people who get connected, the more frustrated the people who are being left out become.  I am determined to ensure we get this done as quickly as it can be done and as affordably as possible.  I receive reports on the matter from the Department at least every two weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's questions, I obviously cannot comment on behalf of industry; the Deputy would need to ask its representatives his question about industry.  On the newspapers, I do not write the newspapers.  I know the Deputy believes I do on occasion; it is one of his conspiracy theories.  </p></speech>

The Department is now evaluating that with the help of KPMG and some other external experts.  We anticipate that the Government will be able to make a decision in the coming weeks as to whether we can accept that tender.</p>  <p>  I have seen various estimates of costs.  It is important to say that as this is a 30 year project, the cost will be spread over 30 years.  It is a bit like a motorway building project, for example.  We do not pay for it all in the Estimates this year; the cost is spread over 30 years.  That explains why next year's Estimates do not provide for hundreds of millions or billions of euro.  It is a bit like a mortgage; one pays for it over a period of 25 or 30 years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the consortium.  I said yesterday - the Deputy quoted me correctly - that it is not a new consortium, but the composition has changed, and that is my position.  In that regard, it is a little bit like Fianna F&aacute;il, its composition changes from time to time.  Its members are not the same people who were here three years ago or five years ago-----</p></speech>

This is a multibillion euro project.  It is not a laughing matter.  I asked the Taoiseach a very serious question.  This is a new consortium.  Is it the new norm that in a major tendering process organised by Government the bidder can change at the last minute?  There is an uneasy silence about this.  It is being glossed over.  It might not suit people to directly analyse and assess this.  I believe it raises fundamental questions about how we go about tendering major State contracts.  A State subsidy of up to &euro;500 million is involved here.</p></speech>

Any family with small children would state that is now 27 sleeps until Santa arrives.  For many families, the reality of making Christmas happen is one of stress and expense.  Regrettably, providing even essentials is beyond the means of many.  That unfortunate reality means that many families resort to borrowing money, some from friends, family members, credit unions or banks.  However, that will not be an option for others and many of them will resort to borrowing from moneylenders and loan sharks who, in many cases, are unlicensed and charge punitive and frankly disgusting interest rates.  They are a scourge on our society.</p>  <p>  There is also a licensed moneylending industry in this State whose practices are equally repulsive.  A UK-based moneylender, Amigo Loans, has been given a licence by the Central Bank to operate in Ireland.  The Central Bank has sanctioned it to offer loans with interest rates of up to 49.9% to people who have been excluded from accessing mainstream finance.  Amigo Loans considers that to be mid-cost credit.  I would call it daylight robbery.  Amigo Loans is not the only entity involved in this game.  A fortnight ago, the Centre for Co-operative Studies at UCC published a report on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.  That report indicates that moneylenders in this State are licensed to charge interest rates of up to 187% which, when collection charges are added, rises to an  average percentage rate, APR, of 287%.  The report also states that a total of 21 of the 28 EU member states apply caps to high-cost credit.  That includes Ireland but, ironically, the only cap we apply is in respect of credit unions.  We do not apply any cap on moneylenders.  That is the reason moneylenders go door to door delivering leaflets at this time of year, preying on the vulnerabilities of people coming up to Christmas and charging these kinds of extortionate rates.  Moneylenders are getting rich on the back of hard-pressed people who are simply trying to provide for their families.  They can do this because the system in place allows them to do it.  This is State-sponsored robbery.  There is an urgent need to introduce a cap on the interest rates these types of outfits can charge.  There is also a need for more wide-ranging reform of the regulation of moneylenders and the policing of illegal loan sharks.</p></speech>

I put it to the Taoiseach that it is now time to introduce a cap on moneylenders to ensure they can no longer get away with their daylight robbery.</p></speech>

It is now less than a month from Christmas, which is a wonderful time for families and children.  It is a time for excitement, friends and celebration, but it can also be a very stressful time, particularly when it comes to getting the house ready, buying presents and finding the money to do all of that.  I absolutely acknowledge that.  To assist  people and families, particularly those on low incomes, with the cost of Christmas, we fully restored the Christmas bonus in the budget.  In the next week or so, the Christmas bonus will be paid at 100%.  That is the first time it has been paid at 100% in seven or eight years.  It is a shame that Sinn F&eacute;in is not supporting the budget.  It should support it.  One of the reasons it should do so is that the budget makes provision for the 100% Christmas bonus, as does the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration 2018.</p>  <p>  In March, there will be further increases in the working family payment for low income families who are working, increases in the qualified child payment for families on welfare and increases in the minimum wage will come into effect in January.  As a Government, we are working very hard to increase pay in a sustainable way, reduce taxes in a sustainable way, increase welfare in a sustainable way and also reduce the cost of living where that is under our control.</p>  <p>  In terms of regulation of financial services, as the Deputy is aware, we have a system of independent financial regulation.  The Central Bank is the regulator.  It is not the Government that is issuing licences to banks, moneylenders or the financial services industry.  As far as I am aware, the Deputy is not proposing that the Government should take over the Central Bank and become the regulator.  We have independent financial services in Ireland for very good reasons.  That is the norm across Europe and it should remain the case.</p>  <p>  Regarding moneylenders or people offering high-interest loans, I echo the Deputy's sentiments.  It is important that people are very careful in taking out such loans and that, if they do, they are confident they can pay them back.  Anyone who takes out a loan is responsible for repaying it.  Anyone who takes out a loan has a responsibility to make sure they are able to pay it back.</p>  <p>  There are alternatives.  For example, the credit unions, working with the Department of Social Protection, offer low-cost loans.  We call it the It Makes Sense loan.  It is not available in every credit union but is available in many of them.  I launched it when I was Minister for Social Protection.  It has been very successful and allows people to take out a short-term loan at a low interest rate to meet costs such as Christmas.  That can then be deducted from their credit union account or welfare payment.</p>  <p> People can also seek urgent needs payments from their community welfare officers.  I would ask people to consider alternatives and, if they do take out a loan, to always consider the fact that they may not be able to pay it back.</p></speech>

His Government presides over an Ireland of soup kitchens, child homelessness, mothers queuing for formula and nappies, insecure employment and 300,000 people living in consistent poverty.  To be clear, many of those people are at work.  They get up at the crack of dawn and still struggle and fail to meet their basic requirements.  I take it the Taoiseach is not suggesting that an interest rate of 49.9% is anything other than absolutely extortionate.  Whatever argument he might make about the regulation of the financial services sector globally, there is no excuse for a Government standing over such a scandalous situation.  That the State sanctions these outfits - ironically, in this case it is called Amigo Loans but I assure the Taoisesch that this amigo is no friend of anybody who borrows from it - and stands idly by and allows that to happen is nothing short of disgraceful.</p>  <p>  We have put it to this House previously and we will again that we need a cap.  I want the Taoiseach to commit to that and to accept, like me, that this is an outrageous situation.  By the way, this is what is called mid-cost credit.  Does the Taoiseach regard it as such?</p></speech>

Low-cost loans are available from the credit union through the It Makes Sense scheme.  I appreciate it is not available in every credit union, but one need not go to the closest credit union nor be a member of a particular credit union to avail of that loan.  For people who qualify, there is the possibility of getting an urgent needs payment or an exceptional needs payment if necessary.</p>  <p>  I would also consider the interest rate that the Deputy suggested to be high rather than mid-cost and, therefore, I agree with her in that regard.  We will examine any legislation she may wish to bring forward.  We need to strike a balance here.  People ultimately have personal freedom and if we restrict people from taking out loans, that is a restriction on their choice and freedom.</p></speech>

As the Christmas lights go up, it should be a time of excitement, happiness and joy, particularly for children and families.  In truth, it will be a tale of two very different Christmases, depending on where one is positioned in Irish society and, in particular, whether one has a roof over one's head.  Imagine the situation faced by Elaine and her three children, for example, who visited my office in the past few weeks and who are about to be evicted, having exhausted all appeals through the Residential Tenancies Board and with nowhere to go.  Another family with three children, who would rather not have their names mentioned, face eviction before Christmas, while the father of yet another family, who visited me this week and who are living in emergency accommodation in Wicklow, must take his children to three different schools in south Dublin, sit in the car all day waiting for them to finish school and then drive back to Wicklow every day.  Other families are experiencing their second or even third Christmas in emergency accommodation.  It is shameful that people are being evicted in the midst of this situation and that children must go through a second or third Christmas like this.  For others, however, it will be a bumper Christmas.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to this property supplement from a newspaper which states: "Strong residential investment deals.  Over 1,600 apartments sold.  Total value &euro;610 million."  The vast majority of these, of which approximately four are in my area, are National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, properties that were sold or are being sold to real estate investment trusts, REITs, or wealth asset management companies.  The average price is approximately &euro;380,000.  The most recent one to be sold in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, comprising 214 apartments, cost &euro;95 million at an average price of &euro;440,000 per unit.  The article helpfully goes on to state how that block will generate approximately &euro;5 million in rental revenue for the new purchasers.  These properties are being sold by NAMA.  They are publicly owned and they are being sold to Kennedy Wilson, REITs and other wealth asset management companies which in some cases, to add insult to injury, will then lease them back to local authorities at extortionate prices, boasting about the amount of profit they are making.  At the same time, families will suffer a miserable Christmas in emergency accommodation or face eviction.</p>  <p>  We face a large demonstration on Saturday which will call for an end to evictions into homelessness.  Should the Government not take emergency measures to ensure no kids or families are evicted as Christmas approaches?  Will it do anything to stop NAMA selling thousands of properties that could be used to provide secure, affordable, permanent homes for these families who are suffering trauma and hardship as Christmas approaches?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800014#M00700"><p>I acknowledge that Christmas is, and can be, a stressful time for some families, particularly those who are living in emergency accommodation or looking for a new place to rent.  I can imagine the concerns parents must have in the run-up to Christmas when they are asked by kids how Santa will visit if the hotel room does not have a chimney, or where the Christmas tree will be put.  I totally understand the Deputy's concerns and, whether he believes it or not, I share those concerns.  I also think about those families in the run-up to Christmas.</p>  <p>  Figures on emergency accommodation will be released this week.  I do not have them yet but I understand from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that they will show a fall in the number of children and families in emergency accommodation and a reduction in the number of families presenting as homeless in Dublin.  On the other hand, they will show an increase in the number of individuals who are in emergency accommodation.  Those figures will be available later today or tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The only solution to this is supply.  While it is not the entire solution, it is at the centre of it.  We are seeing a real increase in the supply of new homes across Ireland.  By the end of this year, we expect 18,000 new houses and apartments to have been built, and that is not just a number.  Behind it are 18,000 people, that is, 18,000 families getting keys to a new house or apartment for the first time this year.  Some 18,000 families, therefore, will be in a new home this Christmas which they were not in last year.  We need to recognise the progress made in that regard.  There will also be an increase of approximately 8,000 in the social housing stock this year, more than half of which are new builds by local authorities and affordable housing bodies, while the rest will be acquired through Part V leasing and acquisition.  That is a significant change and increase compared with the situation last year.</p>  <p>  On evictions, the Deputy will have seen the figures.  I do not have the exact number but I think there were approximately 300 evictions this year.  Evictions happen for all sorts of reasons and not all of them are evictions into homelessness, although some are.  They can also be related to anti-social behaviour and people who live on a street where neighbours have caused havoc will understand why evictions are sometimes sadly necessary.  The courts tend to take a sympathetic view of families if an eviction order is sought.  We will bring forward legislation, which is being championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to strengthen the power of the courts to refuse eviction orders and eviction requests where they relate to a family.</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach recognises this as an emergency, why does he not save those children and families the trauma and hardship they face by immediately instigating emergency legislation that states they will not be evicted and that there will be no evictions while this emergency continues, particularly not in the winter months or facing into Christmas?  In other European states, it is against the law to evict people at this time of year, but that will happen here.</p>  <p>  It infuriates me when the Taoiseach talks about supply.  He did not answer the central question about the article, which is evidence of the supply.  Public property is being flogged off to vulture funds.  Some 700 of the properties are in my area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and they would resolve the emergency homelessness crisis there.  In Lucan and Santry there are hundreds of apartments that we had in our hands and that could be used to house those families who are in the hubs and who face eviction but we are flogging the apartments off.  In the docklands, rents of &euro;3,300 a month will then be charged and will go to Kennedy Wilson, an American vulture fund.  Why does the Taoiseach allow that to happen?  Why does he allow public property be sold to people who charge extortionate rents and evict people who cannot pay them, when that property could be used to house the families who are in the hubs, on the waiting lists and facing eviction?  It is a scandal.</p></speech>

A Programme for a Partnership Government refers to: supporting the post office network and expanding and developing services delivered through post offices; expanding social welfare contracts; the provision of Government services through the network; the development of banking services by means of a community banking structure; and the development of post offices one-stop shops or hubs for Government services.  That makes perfect sense in maximising the national asset that we have in our rural post office network and in supporting rural communities.  These are communities that have had post offices since the foundation of the State, yet the Government is decommissioning these services in rural Ireland.  Nowhere in A Programme for a Partnership Government is it suggested that there should be a closure of 390 post offices, which is what will happen during the lifetime of this Government.  The Government is going to allow this happen.</p>  <p>  Rural communities are not seeking handouts.  An Post and postmasters are not looking for handouts in order to preserve their services, they are looking for what is committed to in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il referred to the public service obligation prior to the budget.  Perhaps this has also been discussed in the context of the confidence and supply agreement.  The post office network is not looking for handouts, it is seeking to provide services that are meaningful to the population that will support rural communities.</p>  <p>  This matter has reached crisis point.  Some 50 post offices are due to close in January.  A total of 159 will have closed by the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 390 are earmarked for closure under the An Post programme.  This is not what was expected from the Government.  Such is the level of demoralisation, there is difficulty in attracting postmasters to run post offices which are deemed viable by An Post.</p>  <p>  How can the Taoiseach speak of a republic of opportunity without offering rural Ireland a hope as his policies reduce services within rural communities?  Rural transport is not being developed, rural medical services are being allowed to diminish, rural financial services delivered by An Post are being diminished and rural broadband is not being rolled out.  This Government is not addressing the sustainability of rural communities.  Even at this late stage, will the Taoiseach call a halt to the closure of our post offices and the destruction of our post office network?  It is not good enough for him to shrug his shoulders and state that this is a commercial decision when the social consequences for rural communities are so far-reaching.</p></speech>

However, the network must also be viable.  The best way to ensure that it is extensive and remains so is that it is viable.  The Government does not close post offices.  In most cases, postmasters are retiring and are accepting retirement packages they have negotiated with An Post, which is a semi-State company.  In many cases, there is no one willing to take on that contract because it is not viable.  Where it is viable, the post office will remain open and if there is a shop or other service nearby which is willing to take it over, that will be considered.  It is not just being left up to An Post, there is an independent review mechanism to assess viability.</p>  <p>  Times are changing and we need to reflect on that and be realistic.  Footfall at our post offices is decreasing.  There are many fewer unemployed people in rural Ireland and, as a consequence, there are fewer people collecting jobseeker's payments from their post offices.  More people who retire do not collect their pensions from post offices.  Instead, they have it paid directly into their bank accounts because that is how they had been paid over previous decades.  As we extend broadband to more rural areas, more people will access public services, bank and pay for their television licences and motor tax online.  The solutions which are often put forward can be contradictory because the more we extend services such as broadband to rural areas, the fewer people use the post offices.  We need to be realistic about these things.</p>  <p>  When it comes to investing in rural Ireland, it is important that we invest in the technologies of the future which is why we are so committed to ensuring that the national broadband plan happens, why we launched the rural fund on Friday last, which will be major investment in improving the public realm in rural Ireland and modernising our towns and villages so that they are more attractive for people to live in, and investing in enterprise and tourism so that we can bring new jobs to rural Ireland.  The best way we can give rural Ireland a good future is by investing in new technologies, jobs and services.</p></speech>

A Programme for Partnership Government outlines a process which would expand services in rural post offices.  Of course, rural Ireland is changing and people are moving to online services, but the post office is much more than online services and facilitating social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to the independent appeals process.  It is a sham.  I am not aware of any post office that has successfully gone through the independent appeals process.  The only criteria used relate to whether there is a population of greater than 500 in an area or whether a post office is greater than 15 km from the next nearest post office.  Communities are spending vast amounts of time developing business cases to support their view that their post offices should be retained and in respect of the level of services that they would like to be delivered in them.  All those appeals are being rejected purely on the grounds of population size and distance to the nearest post office.  Times are changing and An Post needs to change.  The programme for Government, to which I keep returning, included a process through which post offices would change; they would be given extra services, would act as Government hubs and be utilised.  A national asset of 1,100 post offices should not be thrown away purely on the basis of an economic model which does not allow for the sustainability of the communities that will lose their post offices.</p></speech>

We must also ensure that any island with a significant population has its own post office.  There is scope for additional services and this is happening.  The Deputy will be aware that post offices are now offering foreign exchange services and some offer banking services, which is very welcome.  We are also piloting and progressing digital assist for people who are unable to use the Internet or who are uncomfortable doing so.  Digital assist will enable them to access those online services at their post offices.</p><p>That will only work to a certain extent.  It will make some post offices viable and we want to do that, but we also need to accept there will be some post offices that are not viable precisely because the world has changed, there are many fewer people in rural Ireland who are unemployed and pensioners in rural Ireland, generally speaking, want to receive their pension into their bank account, because that is the way they are used to getting paid.  People turning 66 are quite young these days.  We also need to recognise that as we extend broadband to more and more parts of rural Ireland, those services that people say can save the post offices, like motor tax, banking and all of those things, will be increasingly accessed by people in their own kitchens, using 4G or high-speed broadband.</p></speech>

We are joined for this commemoration by Mrs. Doris Calleary and Mrs. M&aacute;ire Ardagh and their families: John, Conall, Dara and S&iacute;ofra Calleary, daughters-in-law Trish and Siobhan, son-in-law John, grandchildren Laura, David and Anna, and family friends; and the Ardagh family are represented by Charlie and Rory Ardagh, Se&aacute;n's sons, and their wives Catherine and Deirdre, and by Darragh McShea, Senator Catherine Ardagh's husband, and four grandchildren, Charlotte, Jane, Jamie and Arabella.</p>  <p>  The two Se&aacute;ns were people it was an absolute privilege to have known.  They were honourable men, with very different personalities, but they served their people here with dignity and integrity.  Neither of them undervalued the honour bestowed on them by their constituents.  Se&aacute;n Calleary did his utmost for the people of his beloved Mayo and the country, and Se&aacute;n Ardagh did his utmost for the people of Dublin South-Central and Ireland.  Knowing both Se&aacute;ns as well as I did, I know how thrilled they would be that the next Calleary and Ardagh generation have taken the political baton and continue to work for the people they represent.  To our colleagues, Catherine and Dara, and the wider Ardagh and Calleary families, I renew my condolences to them on their sad loss.  Their fathers served their party, their Parliament and their country with absolute distinction and their families should be very proud of that work.  We, their Oireachtas colleagues, salute it here in this Chamber today.</p></speech>

B'fhear stuama, cneasta, gn&iacute;omhach agus cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;il &eacute;.  Duine ciallmhar agus polaiteoir den scoth a bh&iacute; ann.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&iacute;lis d&aacute; mhuintir f&eacute;in agus d'oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach Domhnach is d&aacute;lach ar son mhuintir a dh&uacute;iche f&eacute;in.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar a shuaimhneas agus an-&eacute;ifeachtach ar fad sa Pharlaimint, go h&aacute;irithe i gcoist&iacute; na D&aacute;la, an Coiste Chuntais Phoibl&iacute; agus an Coiste um Dhl&iacute; agus Cheart agus Comhionannas ach go h&aacute;irithe.</p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Ardagh was one of the great gentlemen of Irish politics and one of the kindest people one could meet.  I always appreciated his advice on a personal level but also his continual good nature.  He was immensely hard working, courteous and committed.  He was also enormously popular with his colleagues and, of course, his constituents.  There is no greater testament to that popularity than the fact that every time he contested an election, he won that election.  His first campaign was in 1985 when he ran in the local elections.  He had to share the ticket on that occasion, I believe, with no less a celebrity than Sonny Knowles, who has recently passed away, and we extend our sympathies to his family also.  Se&aacute;n was the highest polling of the four Fianna F&aacute;il candidates.  He ran for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on three occasions.  Not only did he win every time but he also increased his vote on each occasion.  At his final outing in 2007, he topped the poll and was elected on the first count.</p>  <p>  He was a very fine and brilliant parliamentarian in the true sense of that word.  In particular, he was a very eminent and solid chairperson of a number of Oireachtas committees.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, he established himself very firmly during the DIRT hearings in the late 1990s.  Obviously, he was greatly aided by his own accountancy background in this endeavour but, for a first-time Deputy, he quickly acquired an authoritative reputation that would have been more in keeping with a more experienced Member of the House.  After his re-election in 2002 and 2007, he chaired the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which was always one of the busiest.  Again, he carried out the role with aplomb.  He really was a natural.  He was rarely adversarial.  He never prejudged an issue and was always open in his approach and dealings, and he maintained that during his tenure as Chair of the Committee on the Constitution during the 30th D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt his equable temperament on political matters gave him great strength when he faced serious health issues during his time in the House.  He was first diagnosed with cancer in his first term.  He got past it that time only for it to re-occur again in 2010, when he was absent from the D&aacute;il because of illness for a period of the year.  He tackled his diagnosis with great dignity and inner strength and, of course, with the help of his close family.  Before Se&aacute;n passed away in 2016, he happily and proudly saw his daughter Catherine elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and he took great pride in her achievement.  He was a keen supporter of her campaigns and may well have enjoyed them more than his own.  Indeed, when we knock on doors, as I do with Catherine from time to time in that constituency, Se&aacute;n's name is always mentioned with the highest of esteem and affection.</p>  <p>  One constant in his life throughout was M&aacute;ire and for 45 years they were together.  They were best friends, hand in glove, and she too was elected to public office.  They were both very committed to public service and to politics.  It is often a clich&eacute; at times like this but I believe Se&aacute;n Ardagh was one of the true gentlemen of Irish politics.  His decency, integrity and good nature were transparent at all times, qualities that are invaluable in political life.  He always had good advice for people and he led by example.  Se&aacute;n did not seek the headlines but what he said mattered.  Any time he spoke, he was listened to as people respected him greatly.  If he did not have anything good to say about people, he did not say anything.</p>  <p>  I again extend my deepest sympathies to all of Se&aacute;n's family - his wife M&aacute;ire, sons Rory and Charlie and, of course, Catherine.  He is still very fondly remembered and sadly missed.</p>  <p>  Aire, Teachta agus polaiteoir den scoth ab ea Se&aacute;n Calleary.  Bh&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta ina chlann &oacute; thosach.  Thuig s&eacute; t&aacute;bhacht sheirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  D'oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach Domhnach is d&aacute;lach ar son mhuintir a dh&uacute;iche f&eacute;in.  Bh&iacute; suim faoi leith aige i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; sp&oacute;irt.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil s&eacute; seo ar eolas ag daoine, ach d'imir s&eacute; peil, sacar agus rugba&iacute;.  Peilead&oacute;ir den scoth a bh&iacute; ann.  Mar Aire dhein s&eacute; an-chuid, go h&aacute;irithe nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Eachtracha i gceannas ar an rann&oacute;g le haghaidh t&iacute;ortha at&aacute; f&oacute;s ag forbairt san Afraic.  Sheas s&eacute; go doimhin lena phrionsabail i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.</p>  <p>  One of Ireland's greatest public servants and gentlemen, Se&aacute;n Calleary served Mayo as a Deputy for 19 years, eight of these as a Government Minister.  He discharged his duties with distinction and honour in the 1980s and early 1990s as Minister of State in the Departments of Labour, Public Service, Industry and Commerce and then Foreign Affairs.  Politics was in the blood, of course.  His father, Phelim, won a by-election when Se&aacute;n was eight months old.  However, he first came to prominence through a very ecumenical sporting ability.  He played junior football with Mayo and he lined out for University College Galway and won the Sigerson Cup in 1955.  However, he did not let it rest there.</p><p>In the same year he lined out for UCG in soccer and won the Collingwood Cup, the first ever victory for UCG and stopped University College Dublin, UCD, from winning an eighth in a row.  He had a deep and lifelong love for rugby and his great performances for Galwegians helped the club to achieve a regional dominance.  This was at a time when the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, did not allow members to play or even attend what were termed "foreign games".  Se&aacute;n, a member of the Mayo junior team, simply adopted the pseudonym, J. J. Kelly, also known as Jacko.  As his celebrity as a player grew, a journalist said "I don't know if you have seen that Jacko Kelly but if you're half the player he is, you'll be very good."  Following his playing career he performed leadership roles in Mayo GAA as selector and Connacht Rugby as president of the Connacht branch of the Irish Rugby and Football Union, IRFU.  He was particularly pleased to be inducted into the Mayo sports star hall of fame in 2014.</p> <p> His political career began with election in 1967 to the county council.  This started an uninterrupted series of electoral successes, which stretched over the next 22 years, and he spent 19 years as a Member of the D&aacute;il.  He quickly made a name for himself in Leinster House as a decent and considerate man who drew great strength from the community he served.  It was in his five years as Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs that he made his biggest impact.  His primary responsibility was overseas development aid but he played a much wider role and often stood in for his senior Minister, Brian Lenihan Snr, at major international meetings as well as in the D&aacute;il.  He presented the shamrock to the first President Bush standing in for the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and for Brian Lenihan.  He was the first Mayo man to present the shamrock in the White House through circumstance.</p> <p> Ireland's strong international standing for its overseas development work is because of people like Se&aacute;n Calleary who brought his engineering background to bear on the development of water solutions for many of the people in Africa.  He may not have had the resources available to him then that subsequent economic growth provided but he demonstrated leadership and determination in policies that have benefitted millions of the world's poorest people.  His greatest pride, of course, was in his family and his wife, Doris.  At his funeral in Mayo last June, his son Dara told us he was "privileged to have a ringside seat at one of the world's greatest love stories, Se&aacute;n and Doris.  They were devoted to each other."  He was proud of all his children's achievements and took great pride in Dara being elected to serve the people of Mayo in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2007.  He was ever available to give my good self advice on the fortunes of the party from 2011 on and the re-emergence and renewal of the party.  His advice was always strongly given and with effect.  On behalf of the party and on my own behalf, I extend our sympathies to his wife, Doris, to Dara, Conall, John, and his daughter S&iacute;ofra.

Se&aacute;n was loved by all sides in this Chamber, and was respected by all and could work with all.  I was fortunate to serve with him on the Joint Committee for Economic Regulatory Affairs during my first term in the D&aacute;il and benefitted a lot from his kindness and advice.  I also saw close up his forensic ability to get to the heart of an issue, his sound judgment and his determination to serve the public good.</p>  <p>  One obituary suggested that Se&aacute;n Ardagh might have gone further in politics only for the fact that he had not a bad word to say about anyone, including his political opponents.  I hope that is not true because I believe we need more people like Se&aacute;n Ardagh to make our politics work better.  On the Committee on Public Accounts, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, and as a Deputy and a councillor, he did the State considerable service.  Those who knew him will remember him above all as a gentleman and as an astute politician, someone who served the people of Dublin South Central with distinction and who never neglected his family.  I know how proud he was that his daughter, Catherine, was elected to the Seanad shortly before his death and I suspect it will not be too long before she takes up his former seat in this House.  On behalf of the Fine Gael party, I offer my deepest condolences to his widow, M&aacute;ire, his sons, Rory and Charlie, his daughter, Catherine, his grandchildren, extended family and colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il party.  </p>  <p>  I also welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Se&aacute;n Calleary as someone who epitomised the spirit of public service at home and abroad and who was a true Irish patriot.  Se&aacute;n Calleary was a firm believer in something Se&aacute;n Lemass once said: "Irish people are citizens of the world as well as Ireland".  Over the course of a distinguished career in politics, he served as a Minister of State in several Departments.  He oversaw our overseas development aid programme and in many ways got that going.  He also worked to combat famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s.  He defended the Irish in Britain who faced discrimination, supported German reunification and was Ireland's lead negotiator on the Lom&eacute; Convention, with African Caribbean and Pacific countries, and we can still see the value of that work today.  At home he championed the building of Ireland West Airport at Knock and the restoration of the C&eacute;ide Fields when others were sceptical about both projects.  In his work on local councils, as mayor of Ballina, as a Deputy and as a Minister of State, Se&aacute;n Calleary worked to make his county and country much better places.  </p>  <p>  Many people have said he was a gentleman who never lost his patience with people, a rare ability among politicians, but he loved politics and was a wise counsel for many Governments and Fianna F&aacute;il leaders.  He was also, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, an accomplished sportsman, excelling at Gaelic football, hurling soccer and rugby, although I believe he sometimes had to play rugby under an alias because of the ban and I glad that today I have finally learned what that alias was.  </p>  <p>  Very few families can say they have had three generations who have served the public with honour and distinction.  The Callearys can be proud of their contribution to Irish political life, first through Phelim Calleary, who served the people of Mayo in this House for many years, then through Se&aacute;n and now through Deputy Dara Calleary.  I know how justifiably proud Se&aacute;n's children were of his achievements, and I know he was immensely proud of them.  I offer my condolences to Se&aacute;n's wife, Doris, his daughter, S&iacute;ofra, his sons, John, Conall and Dara, and to all his grandchildren and relatives.  I also extend my condolences to Deputy Martin and the Fianna F&aacute;il party on this loss.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanameacha uaisle.</p></speech>

On my own behalf and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, I wish to express sincere and heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of former Deputy, Se&aacute;n Ardagh, who passed away in May 2016.  Se&aacute;n, as we have heard had a lengthy and distinguished career in politics at local and national level, serving as a member of Dublin County Council for 14 years, a member of Dublin City Council and in this House for three terms.  His daughter, Catherine, whom we acknowledge today, is also a former Dublin City councillor and a Member of the Seanad.  I have absolutely no doubt that her father was beyond proud when she assumed office in the Seanad.</p>  <p>  I join with everyone in extending sympathy and condolences to Catherine, and to all of Se&aacute;n's loved ones, particularly his wife, M&aacute;ire, his sons, Rory and Charlie, all his grandchildren, relatives and friends and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  He made his mark and made a difference.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom freisin comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Sinn F&eacute;in le clann agus cairde an iar-Theachta Se&aacute;n Calleary, a fuair b&aacute;s i m&iacute; an Mheithimh i mbliana.  On my behalf and that of my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, I equally extend sincere condolences and heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of former Deputy, Se&aacute;n Calleary, who passed away last June.  I did not know Se&aacute;n but he had a lengthy and distinguished career in this place and, as we have discovered, a formidable sporting career as well.</p><p>Se&aacute;n Calleary served in the House from 1973 to 1992, representing the fine people of Mayo as a Teachta D&aacute;la, like his father Phelim before him, and his son, our colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary.  It is a formidable political family tree and I know Deputy Calleary takes enormous pride in the record and standing of his father.  I have no doubt that Se&aacute;n was equally proud of Dara.  During his time in the House, Se&aacute;n Calleary served in three junior ministerial positions in the Departments of Labour and Public Service, Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs.  I join colleagues in extending sympathy and condolences to Se&aacute;n's wife Doris, his children, John, Conall, Dara and S&iacute;ofra, his grandchildren, relatives, friends and colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.

The Ceann Comhairle rightly spoke of the two as being honourable men.  There are many parliaments in which that title is given to members as a matter of course.  In the case of Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Se&aacute;n Calleary, it was completely merited and earned.  They understood fully and embraced and accepted the privilege it is to serve one's community in our national Parliament.  They worked to advance not only their own constituents' interests but to contribute to the national good.  Both men could be described as rocks of sense.  The views they expressed were always listened to carefully by other Members.  At committees and during debates in the House, one listens to the views expressed by certain individuals in order to test one's own views.  Very often, the views expressed by Se&aacute;n Calleary and Se&aacute;n Ardagh were so thoughtful, anchored in logic and obviously carefully considered that they altered the views of others, including even those who came here with fixed positions.</p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Calleary and Se&aacute;n Ardagh represented the highest standards expected of Members of the House.  Se&aacute;n Calleary had a distinguished ministerial career and graced several portfolios with discernment and ability.  I have always had an interest in overseas development aid and I helped to establish the Parliamentarians for Africa group.  Se&aacute;n Calleary was a pathfinder in that area.  When Ireland was poor, or certainly much poorer than it is now, he built awareness of our responsibilities to developing parts of the planet.  That will be a very important and long-lasting legacy memorial of his.  His sporting achievements have been referred to by a number of speakers.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred to Sean's talent in this regard.  One can well imagine his delight had he been present at the Aviva Stadium two weekends ago to see Ireland beat the All Blacks, which achievement few of his generation of rugby players could have envisaged.</p>  <p>  The House is the poorer for the loss of people of the calibre and ability of Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Se&aacute;n Calleary.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I express sincere sympathy but also congratulations to the families of Se&aacute;n Ardagh and Se&aacute;n Calleary and the broad band of friends and supporters each of them had and, indeed, to their political family in Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I knew Se&aacute;n Ardagh and I express my sympathy to his wife, M&aacute;ire, his daughter, Senator Catherine Ardagh, and other family members.  They know themselves the contribution he made.  When I was a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, I heard his wise counsel at many meetings and I noted his sensible approach to most issues.  He did a great deal of work on different committees.  On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to Se&aacute;n Ardagh.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  I express my condolences also to the family of Se&aacute;n Calleary, particularly his wife, Doris, and his son, Deputy Dara Calleary, who is the third generation of his family in the House.  If I am listening right, I think the next generation is represented among the daoine &oacute;ga in the Gallery.  I compliment Se&aacute;n Calleary on the work he did in difficult times in Ireland and as a champion for overseas aid.  He had the honour to be in the White House on that famous occasion to present the shamrock and he served in and represented many Departments over a number of years.  I happened to be in Mayo last Friday night in a public house which belongs to a former Member or his family and I heard in what high esteem Deputy Calleary and his late father and grandfather are held.  They have no worries for the future either.  On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to Se&aacute;n Calleary.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I thank their families for the tremendous contributions they made to the House and our country over many years.  I served with former Deputy Ardagh in three D&aacute;ileanna and noted his distinguished contribution as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts - I was also a member - and the Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  He brought his forensic skills as an accountant to bear on his work, particularly as part of the six-person DIRT inquiry.  Se&aacute;n Calleary was in the House for two decades before my time, but I know he was a stalwart of the Haughey Governments and of Fianna F&aacute;il in that period.  On my behalf and on behalf of our group, I pay tribute to both former Members and thank their families for their contributions.</p></speech>

I express to Se&aacute;n Calleary's family, particularly his son, Deputy Dara Calleary, my sincerest sympathy on the loss of a father and husband.  As one who grew up in Tuam, County Galway, known for the Tuam Stars, I know how highly regarded Se&aacute;n Calleary was in Galway circles, especially by those in UCG, those at Galwegians and people involved in Gaelic football and soccer.  His was a name I grew up hearing.  I did not know Se&aacute;n personally, but I heard of his great work and I know he was deeply proud that his son, Deputy Dara Calleary, was elected as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  I note to the family of Se&aacute;n Ardagh that he was a very special friend of mine, as Senator Catherine Ardagh and M&aacute;ire Ardagh will know, and he will always have a very special place in my heart.  He was an amazing politician of great skill and integrity and, above all, he was a very compassionate man.  M&aacute;ire, Catherine, Charlie, Rory and family have experienced a very sad loss.  Se&aacute;n was very close to me during many difficult times in my life and he was very friendly with my late wife, Anne.  He was always very kind during the years of great difficulty, sadness and illness in our family.  I will never forget that.  The members of the Ardagh family know I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  M&aacute;ire Ardagh served as a councillor when I was a city councillor and we got on well together and had many great nights and a lot of craic.   We enjoyed the moments.  Se&aacute;n Ardagh always encouraged us all to enjoy the moments, notwithstanding differences in our politics.  He was very proud of Senator Catherine Ardagh and rang me about her campaign when he was very ill.</p><p>He was very strong, so he would have been very proud of Catherine becoming a Senator and he spent a lot of time talking about her.  As the parent of two daughters also, we had many chats between breaks at the justice committee.</p> <p> On a personal and political level, Se&aacute;n was very professional as chairman of the justice committee.  He really enjoyed diversity and difference and we had many debates, rows and differences of opinions.  He was always trying to get me on board because I was the maverick, rogue Independent on the committee at the time.  He was always trying to get me to reach consensus.</p></speech>

He enjoyed diversity and inclusion, and he got it.  Nowadays it is accepted as part of politics, but in those days it was not easy to work with Independents and people with different views when one was in a mainstream party, but Se&aacute;n was able to do that on the committee.  As my colleagues said, he was a top class, professional politician and I was very proud when we went to Rome to talk about equality, international justice and criminal justice issues that Se&aacute;n was the captain of the Oireachtas committee on justice.</p><p>When I hear words being spoken about Se&aacute;n Ardagh, I think of the words &quot;decency&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot;.  He is a sad loss. </p><p>Again I offer my sincerest sympathy to both families.  We are thinking of them on what is a sad but also a proud day for the families.</p></speech>

This is a difficult day for the family but it is also a proud one, hearing so many kind words in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n served as a Deputy for 19 years, eight of those as a Government Minister, and by any standards that is an exceptional record of public service and one to be extremely proud of.  For me in my first term in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that level of service is something to aspire to and to admire.</p>  <p>  In my personal interactions with Se&aacute;n, he was always a very considered man, an intellectual, somebody who was well read and somebody who knew his stuff.  He understood politics but, more importantly, he understood Mayo politics.  I knew that he was a strong source of support for Dara and for the wider Fianna F&aacute;il organisation across Mayo, his opinion was always asked for and he was very well regarded and respected across the constituency and across the political divide.  Within Fianna F&aacute;il, we were obviously immensely proud of him and we still are but even in Fine Gael, those with whom he worked on the county council and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had great respect and admiration for him.  He was a man of integrity, he was genuine and he was trusted and that is something that can be difficult for politicians but he was certainly trusted by the Mayo electorate which was evidenced by his continued electoral success and within the party, climbing to the ministerial rank.  He was somebody who was seen as a support, not just for his family and his son Dara, but for the organisation and he is sorely missed within Fianna F&aacute;il nationally and very deeply missed within Fianna F&aacute;il in County Mayo.</p>  <p>  As we speak today about the loss of a great public servant, I am conscious that he was a father and a husband and will be deeply missed in that regard.  That is not something that will ever be replaced, but is something that one must look back on in appreciation and learn to live with.  I am grateful for the opportunity to express sympathy to the family and thank my colleague, Dara, for being a kind person to work with.  He embodies many of the good qualities that his father had and he has been a very supportive constituency colleague.  I know that his father was immensely proud of him, as Dara was of his father.</p>  <p>  On the death of Se&aacute;n Ardagh, I offer my sympathy to my colleague and friend Catherine, who serves in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to his wife Maura, to Charlie, Rory and all of the extended family.  I know how difficult this was for Catherine.  Having been on the campaign trail with her during the Seanad elections, it was a testing time and she showed huge courage, steel, determination and all the good qualities that we look for in a public representative.  I know how much her father meant to her and how much he impacted on her as a person and influenced her career.  I am so glad that he got to see her elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I have no doubt that she will be elected to this House in the near future.  I offer my deepest sympathies to her entire family.  I did not know Se&aacute;n personally, although I met him on a couple of occasions, but a bad word has never been spoken about him nor about Catherine.  She is a fantastic colleague and she also embodies the good qualities that her father brought to this Chamber.  It is lovely to hear all of the kind words across the House for Se&aacute;n Calleary and Se&aacute;n Ardagh.</p></speech>

I served with Se&aacute;n in the House and everything said about him today was  true.  He was a man of common sense, dignity and honour and a man easy to work with in the Parliament.</p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Calleary was somebody I knew when I was a member of Mayo County Council, the town council and a D&aacute;il Deputy and he was a man that I respected greatly.  Sometimes people refer to someone as a gentleman when they die but Se&aacute;n Calleary was a gentleman, a man of honour and dignity and a man that I enjoyed meeting.  We would always start off talking about sport, be it rugby, soccer, Gaelic football or the Mayo team, but we never finished talking without talking about politics.  He loved politics and he loved Fianna F&aacute;il and he served the people of Mayo and of Ireland very well.  He was a man who had great common sense and the common touch.</p>  <p>  I have to tell his wife and family today that he loved them and he loved Fianna F&aacute;il - there is no pretending that he did not-----</p></speech>

He was an honourable man, a man I had great respect for and who served the people of Mayo.  We have had many politicians over the years but Se&aacute;n carried out his job in a very quiet, effective and decent way and when I went to him as a colleague to make representations on behalf of the constituency, he always got back to me and was always there to support and help me in whatever way he could.  I will never forget him for his kindness because whenever I would meet him, he would have a kind word for me.  He knew politics inside out and he knew the difficulties that people have in politics and he always had a kind word for people.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that those qualities have passed onto my colleague, Dara, and Deputy Lisa Chambers was correct about that.  He is somebody who I like working with, who I respect and who has carried on the tradition of the Calleary family.  It is a great honour for Dara that his grandfather and his father were elected to this House, as he has been, because it is a great honour to be elected by the people of one's county to represent them in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Se&aacute;n Calleary respected that, saw it as an honour and treated it as an honour.  He respected the people of Mayo.  He served Fianna F&aacute;il and the people of this country very well and he will certainly be missed.  Thousands of people turned up to his funeral and I said to Dara that day, joking, that I will be looking for the number twos from him because there is no doubt but that the people who turned out on the day had great respect for the Calleary family.</p>  <p>  His wife Doris, his sons Conall, John and Dara and his daughter S&iacute;ofra are the biggest losers.  They have lost a great father, a great friend and someone who I enjoyed meeting because I never left him without a smile.  He had that kind way about him.  He is a big loss to his family and to Fianna F&aacute;il.  He served the people of Mayo, of whom he was very proud.</p></speech>

I also thank the members of the Business Committee for the honour they have bestowed on us today, which is a very difficult day but one of which we as a family are very proud.  I am proud of my Dad and his achievements in this House.  He served here for 19 years and enjoyed every day he had the privilege of being here.  He contested seven elections.  For those who think this is an uncertain time, they should consider there were three elections in 14 months in 1981 and in 1982.  Dad was honoured to serve as a Minister in a number of Departments but particularly loved the honour of being the Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs in charge of overseas development aid.</p>  <p>  He had a very good sporting track record, not something I have picked up.  He played for an Oireachtas team in 1978 against the Westminster Wanderers, the Westminster soccer team.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, served on that team with him.  As Deputy Brendan Howlin said, he would have been thrilled that Ireland beat the All Blacks last Saturday week but he would have been even more thrilled that on the same day Easkey GAA won its first Connacht championship.  He also played with Easkey, even though it is a Sligo team.  He would have enjoyed both wins.</p>  <p>  He was very conscious of the honour of serving here, the integrity one had to have as a Member of this House, and of representing all of the people.  My grandparents were both active in the War of Independence and in the Civil War.  They raised my Dad and my uncle in a spirt of tolerance and respect for others.  My Dad played sport all his life and while he played to win and played the ball hard, he respected opposition and opposition voices.  If there is one thing we can do in this House now, it is to bear that in mind.</p>  <p>  He would have been honoured to share this occasion with the late Se&aacute;n Ardagh, somebody with whom he shared main traits.  They were always fond of checking in on the Mayo relations of the Ardaghs.  In as much as this is our loss, it is their loss - M&aacute;ire's and Catherine's - as well.  I am sure Catherine's Dad would have been delighted with all the endorsements she is getting from other sides of the House about taking the seat in the next general election.  We will make sure that happens for him.</p>  <p>  I thank all the party leaders for their warm words.  Our grief is very private but it is very public.  Dad would have been mortified by the turnout at the funeral, but I noted the Minister, Deputy Ring canvassed it well.  There will be a few in the box for him from there.</p>  <p>  I do not know if we have lost ourselves as a family in the past six months; is it possible to have a heart that is both broken and full of pride at the one time?  It is.  We are full of pride about the respect and integrity in which he is held and the memories people have of him.  We aspire to live up to those memories and standards as we proceed forward.  His view of politics was that it was not a game but a deadly serious profession, that we had to respect the people who put us here and to work collectively for those people.</p>  <p>  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam agus go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat le gach duine sa Teach.  I thank everybody here, the Members of my party for their support during his illness and since then, and all of the staff of the House beyond the Chamber for their support.  We are very grateful.</p></speech>

There are many issues regarding whether Sl&aacute;intecare will be followed seriously, given the meagre resources allocated towards its implementation in 2019 compared to its financial implications.  The costings of it are significant, even  though we have not been given comprehensive costings.  A timeline for implementation and a sense of a sincere approach to the implementation of the plan are required because there is considerable scepticism about the Government's commitment to it.</p></speech>

A decision on time to debate any matter in the D&aacute;il is a matter for the Business Committee but I am sure we would be happy to facilitate that.  There is a perception, which I am sure the Deputy knows is incorrect, that the &euro;20 million set aside next year for Sl&aacute;intecare implementation is all that is set aside for it.  There is a lot more to it than that.  There is a big increase in the capital budget and a big part of Sl&aacute;intecare involves investment in new IT, new capacity such as bed capacity and primary care centres.   There is also money in it to reduce prescription charges for people who have medical cards and people who do not.  There is money in it to extend eligibility for the GP visit card and increasing the income eligibility limits. There are other investments as well.  Nobody should make the mistake of thinking the &euro;20 million is all that is set aside in 2019 for Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is a raft of measures ranging from capital spending to eligibility for medical cards and reduced prescription charges.  All of those are Sl&aacute;intecare measures.</p></speech>

Jackie has been a campaigner since her beloved daughter, Nicole, whom she knew as Coco, died by suicide in January of this year after prolonged and vicious online harassment.  She was accompanied by another woman whose son is currently enduring similar harassment.  The emotion was palpable and there are many people like that who are enduring incredible pressure.  The Taoiseach will recall that there was a consensus in this House to enact legislation I brought in last year, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017.  We had co-operation across the House and with the Department of Justice and Equality to introduce this.  It is urgent.  They have been to the garda&iacute; and the garda&iacute; say there are no laws to address the type of appalling behaviour that drives children to suicide.  I ask that we agree as a House, in memory of Nicole, or Coco as her mum called her, to try to enact this quickly.</p></speech>

This is a tragic case.  The Deputy is correct that there is proposed legislation from the Labour Party but, in practical terms, the passing of legislation needs the Government to engage meaningfully.  There is cross-party support on this issue.  Last week, legislation relating to vulture funds was initiated here but was largely supported by the relevant Departments.  I ask the Taoiseach to do the same with Labour's proposed legislation on this issue, ensures the Government deals with it on a cross-party basis and advances it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I am sorry to hear about the tragic suicide which they described.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is committed to working on a cross-party basis to pass this legislation.  I understand it is on Committee Stage and he has some amendments.  There will not be a difficulty with the money message from my side.  Unfortunately, the Minister is not present at the moment.  He is in the Seanad where a filibuster is going on with other justice legislation.  The truth, whether people wish to admit it or not, is that the ongoing filibuster of justice legislation in the Seanad is causing other legislation to back up, including important legislation such as this.</p></speech>

Some 5,000 people came onto the streets to march.  As many as 3,000 marched last Saturday.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that there were issues to be dealt with in Tipperary town and I asked him to look at setting up a task force.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste neglected the town, as did the Minister, Deputy Bruton, through the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  The people are willing to collaborate and work on this.  They are not talking down the town.  They are willing to talk it up.  There is great community spirit and energy there.  Will the Taoiseach please set up a task force to look at this?  They hope to get some of the money from Project Ireland 2040.  While we got money  for Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, which the Government closed, and in Thurles, which we appreciate, Tipperary town and west Tipperary have been neglected.  Will the Taoiseach please ask his Ministers to set up a task force to examine it and meet a deputation, trying to work with the people of Tipperary instead of having Fine Gael candidates talk about all they are doing for Tipperary?  Nothing is happening there.  I ask for a task force to look at the issues and to try to work positively in Tipperary town.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether Tipperary town made an application but I know there was no allocation for Tipperary town from either the rural or urban regeneration funds.  We would need a proposal to establish a task force.  I have not seen any such proposal.  If the Deputy wishes to draft one, I will certainly ask the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, to consider it.</p></speech>

That is the issue of the lack of access to medicinal cannabis.  The Taoiseach says there is a supply issue.  We and other Deputies have a contrary view, which is that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is blocking the legislation on the medicinal cannabis programme for bureaucratic and security reasons.  This is imperative because while we might have time, the countless people for whom medicinal cannabis has a medical benefit do not have time on their side.  It is imperative that the Government comes out with a statement about when the medical access programme will be up and running.  It has been two years and the wider public is asking for answers.  I am asking the Taoiseach as leader of his party and of this country if he will give a timeframe for when the medical access programme will be running.</p></speech>

We are working proactively to make sure this product is available to people who need it and who have a prescription for it.  The HPRA advises us that there is a problem finding a supplier.  It should be borne in mind that medicines have to be produced to a certain standard.  The HPRA says there is a difficulty identifying an appropriate supplier.

So much was promised in the programme for Government on jobs in rural Ireland but I have to point out that from Kenmare to Sneem, Waterville and Cahersiveen door after door has been closed in recent times and there are no new jobs.  In one school in Cahersiveen only two children presented to be enrolled this year.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to set up a task force.  We have a new digital hub in Sneem that is all kitted out but is awaiting people.  It is the same in Dromid and Mastergeehy.  There are lovely new set-ups but no prospect of jobs.</p></speech>

The majority of jobs created in recent years has been created outside of Dublin.  Unemployment is down in every county, including Kerry.  It is down by approximately half in Kerry and employment is up.  I am not sure task forces create jobs but we have the rural fund and urban fund and I strongly encourage people who have workable ideas to create jobs and generate economic development to make applications to these funds.  Many towns and many areas have already benefitted from the announcements made in recent days.</p></speech>

Farmers' returns are just not viable.  We have raised this numerous times in recent months in the House.  Unfortunately, the situation is getting worse on a weekly basis.  Usually in the run-up to Christmas beef prices increase.  Unfortunately, the opposite is happening at the back end of 2018.  Cow prices, which are usually the barometer of the health of the beef business, are down one third since July.  We have no live exports.  As a result we have a kill that is at 40,000 head per week.  It is clear we do not have the markets to sell the beef.  Help is urgently needed if our beef industry is to survive.  Farmers have had enough.</p></speech>

The programme for Government includes a commitment to create more than 200,000 jobs by 2020 with 130,000 or 140,000 outside Dublin.  If we look at the most recent figures, this is not happening.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach was on the Roscommon and Leitrim border last Friday, when he opened an extension creating 60 extra jobs and this is good, but many rural areas are really suffering and the only thing we can hope to get into them is employment.  I acknowledge there are broadband issues and other infrastructural issues but we need to do something urgently to get jobs into these areas.  I will quote a figure I quoted previously, which is that each day more than 900 people travel from my county to work in Dublin.  Is there anything the Taoiseach can do to give hope to these people to try in some way to persuade more businesses locating in Ireland to come to some of the rural areas?</p></speech>

If we look at the numbers they show well over 60% of jobs created in recent years have been created outside of Dublin.  The lowest unemployment is now in the Border counties and the second lowest unemployment is in the south west, which is the Cork and Kerry region.  To give some small examples of the recent announcements, there were 350 in Sligo by Abtran, 200 in Athlone by Neueda, 600 in Limerick by Edwards, 400 by WuXi in Dundalk, 200 by Combilift in Monaghan, 350 by Chanelle in Loughrea, 175 by Fexco in Killorglin, 500 by Abbott in Donegal Town, 100 by Entekra in Monaghan, 100 by Overstock in Sligo, another 90 by E+I Engineering in Donegal and 80 by Crust &amp;amp; Crumb in Cavan.  The list goes on.  The whole point of Project Ireland 2040, the investment in transport and infrastructure now under way, the investment in broadband that will start next year and the rural and urban funds is to do exactly what the Deputy suggests, which is to bring economic development to all parts of the country because we have an uneven recovery.  We have a recovery everywhere but it is uneven and this is what Project Ireland 2040 is all about.</p></speech>

In west Cork, Bantry General Hospital is a modern vibrant hospital providing a wide range of services to 80,000 people in west Cork and many in Kerry.  This year, more than 1,600 patients have been excellently treated in the endoscopy unit.  A new endoscopy unit and a stand-alone rehabilitation unit were approved at a recent national capital appraisal meeting of the HSE and have been submitted to the Department of Health for funding.  When will this necessary funding for Bantry General Hospital become available?</p></speech>

Four years ago, working groups were established in both areas comprising the local authority, landowners, local development organisations and the Department.  The key to driving forward this issue is an indemnity scheme by the Department for landowners so that anybody using the land would not be in a position to claim against the landowners.  The one thing that has been holding up everything for the past 18 months is, we have been told, that primary legislation is needed to provide this indemnity insurance policy.  No progress has been made and draft legislation has not been printed.  Will the Taoiseach follow up with the relevant Minister to get this issue over the line for the 2019 season?  It has far-reaching implications if landowners refuse to co-operate and provide access in both of these areas and in many other areas throughout the country.</p></speech>

I certainly share the Deputy's sentiments.  The development of greenways and walkways throughout the country has opened it up to recreational walkers and tourism.  If done properly and fairly it can be of benefit to landowners also.  I will pursue it with the Minister, Deputy Ring.</p></speech>

The purpose is the safety and well-being of the workers on site.  Last July, I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider the introduction of an average speed camera system, similar to that in operation in the Dublin Port tunnel and which has proved to be a success.  The number of vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/h has reduced to less than 0.15%, which is a success for road safety in the Dublin Port tunnel.  The reason I ask the Taoiseach to revisit the area is there are people in the speed vans.  It is okay at present because people are aware of them but as time progresses their lives will be at stake.  The life of a speed van operator is as valuable as that of the workers on site.</p><p>I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality review the average speed system in conjunction with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

The cameras are not popular because they work.  They are effective because they pick up the average speed somebody travels at over a stretch of road rather than just the speed at the spot check or the moment-in-time speed check one gets with a GoSafe van.  I will inform the Ministers concerned that the matter was raised and ask them to examine it.</p></speech>

This morning there were 22 patients on trolleys or in hospital wards due to the overcrowding and yesterday there were 43.  The HSE confirmed to my colleague, Councillor Gerry McMonagle, yesterday that it will open the ten beds in the short stay ward in January.  Has the Government not sanctioned opening the 20 beds in that ward given the current level of overcrowding?  Some 4,700 people have been on hospital trolleys or in overcrowded wards so far this year as a result of the capacity issue.  The ward and the 20 beds are there, yet sanction has only been given from the Government to the HSE to open ten of them.  Can the Taoiseach explain why the people of Donegal are being denied the other ten beds?</p></speech>

We have sanctioned a very big increase of approximately &euro;1 billion in health spending for next year, but the sanctioning of individual budgets for hospitals or parts of hospitals is carried out at either HSE or hospital group level.  This morning, once again, there is an enormous variation in overcrowding.  There is zero or one in some hospitals such as Mullingar or Blanchardstown and very high numbers in other hospitals, including hospitals that have received extra beds.  What we must see in the new year is whether the additional beds in Letterkenny are used to the maximum benefit of the patients and whether overcrowding goes down.  If they are used to maximum benefit and bring overcrowding down, it can then be extended further.</p></speech>

Once secret matters are brought to the Cabinet, they do not remain secret, as is evident from the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>this morning.  The memorandum relates to Brexit-proofing and Brexit preparedness and, in the context of transportation, Dublin Port, Dublin Airport, Rosslare Europort and other ports and the infrastructure that might be required if the Brexit deal does not go well in the votes at Westminster.  If the latter proves to be the case, a hard Brexit is a potential outcome.  Have there been consultations with the Attorney General about preparing legislation that could give the Government emergency powers for the acquisition of sites and to circumvent the statutory planning process to ensure that we will be able to move swiftly in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Finally, with regard to our EU obligations, have there been any tentative discussions on the idea of more flexibility with budgets in respect of state aid in view of the potential risks to our economy?</p></speech>

If necessary, we will produce documents on a no-deal Brexit scenario, which will be more complicated and will put more pressure on the system to deliver.  We have been preparing for that for some time.  The memorandum mentioned by the Deputy was a memorandum for the Government and should not have been on the front of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>today.  It was a development of documents that were agreed by the Government over the summer to give an update to Government colleagues on the levels of preparation in places such as Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport, where I am glad that a great deal of positive preparation is proceeding.</p></speech>

We must do many things to rise to the challenge of climate change.  They will include investment, policies on tax and regulation and lifestyle change.  The first allocations under the climate fund were announced earlier.  Essentially, what is involved is using new technologies to reduce CO2 emissions.  The allocations include funding of over &euro;10 million to the ESB for improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles, funding to Gas Networks Ireland for anaerobic digestion and reducing emissions related to agriculture, funding for local authorities to allow them to move to light-emitting diodes, LEDs, instead of existing lights, thus reducing emissions, funding for Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council for district heating schemes, again enabling us to reduce the amount of oil used to heat homes, and funding for Irish Rail to invest in a new hybrid fleet.  As we electrify the train lines to Drogheda, Maynooth and Sallins, it can start buying hybrid trains which can operate on both diesel and electricity.</p></speech>

Costs incurred are expected to be significantly less than the spend on digital advertising in 2018 which is estimated at approximately &euro;450,000.</p>  <p>  The expenditure referenced relates to a number of major cross-Government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally during 2018.  These were Healthy Ireland, Global Ireland, Project Ireland 2040 and the self-employed benefits campaign aimed at ensuring self-employed people are aware of the new and existing benefits available to them.</p>  <p>  The majority of this expense was incurred prior to July 2018.  Public information campaigns in future will be funded mainly by relevant line Departments rather than being funded centrally by my Department.</p>  <p>  It is important to communicate across a variety of platforms, including social media, to ensure transparency and clarity for all citizens.  The Government Information Service is now required to provide a 24-7 service to media organisations on all topics of public interest, often with short response times.  It is also required to generate online content, including written, audio and video material, as well as live broadcast on occasion.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800023#V01900"><p>It is undoubtedly important to communicate and to do so on all platforms, as the Taoiseach said.  Nobody is disputing that.  I read a story in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>- I am sure the Taoiseach saw it as well - which is based on responses to freedom of information requests and which highlights the level of spending on communications and media advertising in the Taoiseach's Department since he took office.  That spending amounts to a whopping &euro;2 million.</p><p>That is an extraordinary figure in its own right, but all the more so when compared with spending on public relations under the previous Taoiseach, which was just shy of &euro;20,000.  We have discussed these matters previously.  Despite all of the Taoiseach's big budget communications, I believe that his approach with Deputy Gino Kenny earlier was uncalled for and unworthy of someone in the office of An Taoiseach.  Deputy Kenny raised a legitimate issue of public interest and rather than simply answer it, the Taoiseach chose to try to deflect and respond in a way that I cannot fathom.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach explain the &euro;2 million figure? Given that one of the reasons his spin unit was scrapped was the inappropriate use of the unit to promote Fine Gael election candidates I was surprised to see an image posted by the official Government website that makes me believe that things have not changed.  There is a picture of the Taoiseach and four Ministers.  Lo and behold, standing alongside and smiling for the camera is a Fine Gael Senator and election candidate for Mayo.  Despite all of the bluster, taxpayer's money is still being spent to promote Fine Gael candidates under the guise of public information.  The Taoiseach told us that this would end and it has not, so perhaps he could give an explanation for that also.</p></speech>

Is this done by Government Information Service, GIS, staff or is it a mixture of GIS staff and political staff?  Who co-ordinates all of that?  Is there a difference between promoting Government campaigns and personal messages from the Taoiseach, or are they treated the same?  It is interesting that the Taoiseach's twitter handle is still @campaignforleo, which really is a political slogan.  Has the Taoiseach plans to change that with regard to the office of An Taoiseach?</p><p>I shall now turn to the issue of the spending.  There has been a considerable spend and I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could confirm whether the figure quoted in <i>The Irish Mirror</i>is correct.  It is a substantial amount.  I also noted another figure, which was the cost to produce the campaign video for Ireland to win a seat on the UN Security Council.  It is reported to have cost &euro;100,000.  I watched that video.  It is a fine video and it is well produced but having been a Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I realised that the campaign for the UN Security Council is a close-up campaign.  I do not say it is hand-to-hand combat but the Taoiseach will be aware that it is about personally engaging with representatives from other countries.  Our officials do it and our Ministers do it whenever they are overseas.  When I watched the video, it looked like it was intended for a domestic audience and not one that was likely to encourage anybody on the UN Security Council to vote Ireland onto the council.  Rather it was a video that made everyone look good, including the Taoiseach, for a domestic audience.  I believe there is a serious issue in respect of the emphasis placed on public relations and the proliferation of videos with the ensuing costs.  We need better transparency on this.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would confirm whether that &euro;100,000 figure quoted in the media is true.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800024#W00300"><p>I am happy to reassure the Deputies that the &euro;2 million referred to in that particular article was not spent on promoting me or Fine Gael; it was spent on campaigns such as those I outlined earlier.  They were campaigns such as Healthy Ireland, which is all about encouraging people to take those little steps that could improve their physical or mental health such as giving up smoking, exercising more and healthier eating.  I do not believe that anyone in this House would think it money badly spent to invest in Healthy Ireland and to put across to the public those important messages regarding their own health.  One could give no better health advice than to give up smoking, exercise more and eat healthier.</p>  <p>  There was also a campaign to inform the public about Project Ireland 2040, what is in that programme and how it will affect people in their communities and their lives.  Another campaign was the public information campaign for the self-employed to let self-employed people know what new benefits are being made available to them by the Government, how their tax burden is being reduced and how the Government is increasingly investing in supporting entrepreneurship.  These are all public information campaigns.  When I first became Taoiseach, I took the decision to centralise this funding in my Department through the special communications unit so the spending relates to that.  This is why it has almost all occurred before July 2014.  My intention was to centralise communications, improve communications and reduce the costs thereof.  Given the political controversy that was caused, which became such a distraction to the project, that is no longer the case.  In future, and indeed currently, these campaigns and information campaigns are funded through the line Department and not through my Department.</p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy McDonald's comments earlier.  Anything that exposes somebody who makes false claims about health or particular cures is very much in the public interest.  The Deputy and her party do not have a very good record on this with regard to her own conduct and that of some of her party members around the issue of CervicalCheck and cervical screening.  Some of the false claims made by the Deputy's party caused increased anxiety for women in Ireland.  There were false claims in health and false information was put out.  Claims of false cures can cost lives and can damage people in the long term.  I do not believe that anyone in this House should be ashamed of exposing those who make false claims around health and particular cures.</p>  <p>  I do not have a breakdown of staffing numbers but I can provide those by correspondence.  It is the 21st century and people who work in media no longer tend to be broken into social media, broadcast media and print media.  Increasingly the platforms are all becoming one.  The number of persons dedicated to social media may well be very small, or zero, but people tend to work across platforms these days and not just in one branch of media.  My Twitter account is mine.  I own it and all the posts are either done by me or by me in conjunction with one of my two political staff - not by civil servants.</p></speech>

He simply asked about medicinal cannabis and the medical access programme.  I thought it was very clear.  The Taoiseach is being utterly disingenuous on that.</p>  <p>  The anxiety endured by the women caught up in the CervicalCheck scandal was generated by people not connected at all with me but connected with the systems of the State.  The Taoiseach knows this.</p>  <p>  I note that in his reply the Taoiseach did not answer my question on the photograph I referred to, a copy of which I have here.  The caption tells us that the "Taoiseach and the Minister Eoghan Murphy" - which is okay - are joined by "Minister Josepha Madigan" - which is grand - and the Ministers of State John Halligan and Kevin Boxer Moran - which is fair enough.  They were announcing the fund for urban regeneration and development, but why on earth does the Taoiseach have a party colleague alongside all of his Government colleagues?  What is that all about?  I do not dispute the necessity to make such an announcement or to publicise it, but I ask the Taoiseach to explain to me why his candidate for Mayo is alongside him in that photo opportunity.  This is taxpayers' money.  As the Head of the Government, he makes the announcements and he has Government colleagues with him.  Why, however, is there a general election candidate?  That is what got the Taoiseach into bother the last time around when it was regarded that State money was being used to make announcements on projects on the taxpayers' dollar, and that it was being used, misused and abused to promote not only a party political agenda but also an agenda very much connected with the electoral prospects of his party colleagues.</p></speech>

I asked about the costs of the video for the UN Security Council campaign.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would comment on the cost and necessity of that.  The issue is to try to differentiate between Government spend, party spend and party promotion.  Unfortunately, many of the campaigns the Taoiseach has spoken of - even Creative Ireland and others like it - have not been demarcated rigidly enough with regard to public service announcements and party political campaigning.  Photographs will emerge in campaigns, for example about Creative Ireland, when Ministers have to turn up when they are to discuss literature, arts or whatever.</p><p>There will always be a bit of it, but it is done to excess.  On the two funds that were announced recently for urban and rural Ireland, while no-one has any issue with funding projects, they risk the application of the appellation "political slush fund" if they turn out to be juxtaposed or used as part of a party political campaign as well as promoting candidates and so on around the place.  The original problem with the strategic communications unit was the utilisation of taxpayers' money to promote party campaigns.  That is the issue that needs to be guarded against.  I would appreciate a comment on the cost of the Security Council video.</p></speech>

I was pleased to visit the Apprentice Boys headquarters and museum where I enjoyed a tour of the museum.  I also had the opportunity to meet the chairman of the management committee, Mr. William Moore, and some of his colleagues.  I then visited Creggan Enterprises in the Rath M&oacute;r centre in Creggan, where I spoke with local business people and members of the community.  I also had the opportunity to meet those involved in projects operating from the centre.  During my visit, I also briefly met the local MP, Ms Elisha McCallion.  Finally, that evening I spoke at the St Columb&rsquo;s College annual dinner which this year was in honour of one of St Columb&rsquo;s former students, Mr. Mark Durkan. </p>  <p>  While my visit to Derry was short, it was a welcome opportunity for engagement with people from all communities.  I believe that visits like this by me as Taoiseach and by other Ministers are important in the context of our overall North-South relations, particularly at a time when the formal structures of the North-South Ministerial Council are not active.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800025#X03100"><p>I appreciate that the Taoiseach's visit was short and I welcome the fact that he went to Mark Durkan's former college to honour him.  The Taoiseach was honouring a remarkable contribution to politics and to peace on the island of Ireland.  Mr. Durkan was a close confidant of, and great adviser to, John Hume.  He was a member of the British Parliament.  Regrettably, he lost his seat in the last general election.  He is a big loss to politics in Northern Ireland.  He would have cast his vote in Westminster if he had been elected to support the draft withdrawal treaty on Brexit, which is now before the British Parliament.  In many ways, honouring Mark Durkan illustrates the silence in Northern Ireland of the anti-Brexit majority, who do not have any public or parliamentary forum through which they can articulate their views on Brexit.  It is my genuine belief that the collapse of the Executive originally and the absence of any Executive and assembly is something that has caused great damage to Northern Ireland in terms of its capacity to make a meaningful contribution to the Brexit debate.  In particular, if the Executive and assembly had not been collapsed they would act as a potential bridge between the two communities, an opportunity to channel a practical approach to Brexit that has been sorely missed to date.  I recall the letter that former Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, and First Minister, Arlene Foster, wrote together, basically referencing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland and the desire of both to work together to manage the issues facing Northern Ireland in the Brexit context.  How polarised it has become since that joint letter was issued.  The absence of representation at all levels is a big issue for the North in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>

I agree that it is extremely important that he and members of his Government regularly visit communities in the North across the board.  That in and of itself is an important confidence-building measure.</p>  <p>  I disagree that the anti-Brexit majority has been silent.  The facts speak to the contrary.  In fact, it has met the Taoiseach in political form - ourselves from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the SDLP and the Greens.  The anti-Brexit majority has spoken loudly well beyond politics in the business community with which we, and no doubt the Taoiseach, have worked closely, through agriculture, academia, the trade unions and the community sector - one could not miss them.  The message is unmissable regarding the anti-Brexit position.</p>  <p>  Of course it is absolutely disgraceful that the power-sharing institutions are not up and running.  I absolutely agree with that point.  However, the Taoiseach should not overestimate the extent to which the institutions would have influenced the Brexit debate.  He should look to Scotland.  The Scots will go into the House of Commons, 80 or so of them, and vote against the draft withdrawal agreement because Scottish interests are not to the forefront.  They are irrelevant in the Westminster debate.  They will tell us, if we have ears to listen, that they have been marginalised.  It has been a box-ticking exercise.  In fact, Scottish members of the House of Commons went so far as to leave on one occasion, such was their level of frustration.  Brexit in an essential way is a very English phenomenon.  It is a dispute, but that is just in a matter of shade.  Brexit is happening and we need to be prepared for it.</p>  <p>  What, from the Taoiseach's perspective, is the plan now to get the institutions back up and running?  What is the game plan from Government here in Dublin?</p></speech>

Mr. Mark Durkan very much deserves his honours.  He was a very effective politician as a Minister and an MP.  He is an able persuader and a witty and articulate parliamentarian.  He made a very thoughtful but also very witty speech on the night.  I regret that he lost his seat because it has left the city of Derry unrepresented in Westminster, which leaves Derry and the residents of the Foyle constituency without a vote on Brexit.</p><p>We understand there will be a series of votes in the House of Commons; it will not just be a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; vote on the withdrawal agreement.  It will be possible for MPs to table amendments on which there will be votes.  There could be specific votes on the backstop and on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the EU customs union.  That matter was only defeated by three votes a few months ago when MPs last voted on it.  There could be a vote on whether the UK should stay in the Single Market.  The Scottish National Party, SNP, is strongly pushing that option.  There could even be a vote on whether there should be a people's vote.  It is regrettable that seven constituencies in Northern Ireland will be disenfranchised and will not have a say on this important matter that affects them so much.<br/><br/>On a level beyond simple arithmetic, I am also concerned that many MPs in the House of Commons are not hearing the full story from Northern Ireland.  Many English MPs - Deputy McDonald is right to identify much of this as an English phenomenon - do not know a great deal about Northern Ireland.  They do not read the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>or the <i>Irish News</i>.  They are not really hearing from business people or farmers in Northern Ireland.  They are hearing what they are hearing around the tea and coffee rooms and bars in Westminster.  That is why it is important to be there and Sinn F&eacute;in MPs are not.  The people of Northern Ireland are being badly let down in that regard.<br/><br/>I was asked about the game plan.  To get the assembly and the Executive back up and running, we want to work with the British Government to encourage the two major parties, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, to come together, make compromises, put aside their differences and build trust.  We want them to form an Executive and restore the assembly.  It is my hope that if and when the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster approves the withdrawal agreement, then at least we will have certainty about what is going to happen and what is not going to happen for the next two years or more.  I hope that allows a window of opportunity for the parties to come together and to agree to the establishment of an Executive and assembly again.  In the absence of that, we will ensure that the other institutions, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, work, operate and meet.</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald put forward the idea, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me, that the SNP is not very relevant to the debate in Westminster in a number of ways.  For example, if the SNP were to vote in favour of the withdrawal agreement or aspects of it, it would pass by a wide margin.  SNP Members have been involved in all the talks with the British Government - I have met them.  However, nobody from the assembly or Executive in the North has been in talks as a government with the British Government on the issues relating to Brexit.  How can there be regulatory alignment with the Single Market without the Executive and the assembly up and running?</p>  <p>  As I have said for the past two years, if people do not want to take their seats in Westminster they should not stand for election and allow people who would take their seats to stand and give Northern Ireland representation on a crucial issue.  This is existential in some respects economically for the entire island if the wrong call is made by the Westminster Parliament.  I do not want to predict too far into the future - there could be an Article 50 extension and so on.  The stakes are very high for ordinary people and their jobs in sectors from agrifood to business.  Civil society has not been represented adequately.  While some anti-Brexit groups have been coming, they have been reduced to deputations to Brussels, Dublin and elsewhere.  The alternative was executive function and representation as per the Executive and parliamentarian representation as per the assembly, and likewise in Westminster on probably the greatest economic issue to have faced the country in 40 years.</p></speech>

I assure the Taoiseach that the people of Foyle in Derry are well represented by Elisha McCallion.  He said he met Ms McCallion.  It was remiss of me not to mark the very significant contribution of Mark Durkan.  Of course, the Taoiseach will not be surprised to hear me say that I was not sorry he lost his seat to my colleague, Elisha McCallion.</p>  <p>  In any event, there is a split in the executive parties in the North; the DUP is for Brexit.  Any fanciful idea of conjuring up an anti-Brexit position or a pro-withdrawal-agreement position from the Executive is not grounded in reality.  I believe that in the 1930s Eamon de Valera stood for election in South Down and he was the last Fianna F&aacute;il abstentionist.  Of course, he did not go and take an oath in the House of Commons for the reasons that none of us here would.</p></speech>

They are different scenarios.  We could debate that all day.  The core issue on which we can agree is the necessity to get the institutions of government back up and running.  To that end for the Taoiseach's benefit, I want to make it very clear that we again stand ready to do the lift that is required to make that happen.  As the Taoiseach will know, because he travelled north at the time, in February I thought we had it.  I thought we had a sufficiency of consensus to move forward.  Nobody was more disappointed than I when that did not happen.</p>  <p>  I invite the Taoiseach to elaborate on how he sees the pathway forward and the resolution of the outstanding issues.</p></speech>

I will have a follow-up meeting with the assembly parties in the next few weeks and that is probably the place to discuss it.</p>  <p>  As we are discussing the collapse of the Executive and assembly, which was very much connected to the controversy relating to the renewable heating initiative.  I have been following periodically the inquiry.  I was very interested to read all about Sinn F&eacute;in's involvement in renewable heating, which was much greater than we realised at the time.

That is documentary evidence that Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers seek approval and consent from "senior republicans" when it comes to major decisions in government.

I indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision either by the UK or the EU to end the backstop.</p>  <p>  I recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply "unless and until" alternative arrangements were in place to supercede it.  We both expressed the hope that the negotiations could conclude in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, and approval of the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship.</p>  <p>  Both sets of negotiators have worked long and hard to achieve this decisive progress, with compromises on all sides.  Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives for this stage in the negotiations have been fully achieved.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the backstop arrangements in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland provide a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  We hope that the backstop will never be used and we will work closely and continuously with our EU partners during the negotiations on the future relationship treaties that will establish the alternative arrangements.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that the protocol includes provisions allowing for a review of the backstop.  The legal text states that the backstop will stay in place unless and until alternative arrangements can be agreed and can only be ended by the mutual agreement of both sides.</p>  <p>  The EU and the UK have committed in the finalised withdrawal agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  For the avoidance of any doubt, the protocol confirms that nothing in the agreement would prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and that the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement is now part of a draft treaty between the UK and the EU, therefore strengthening and copper-fastening that principle of consent.</p>  <p>  While the backstop, if invoked, envisages some different regulatory rules applying in Northern Ireland, this does not represent a threat to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in my view.  In many ways, what the Prime Minister said yesterday mirrors other policy areas where Northern Ireland has different rules from other parts of the United Kingdom.</p></reply>

I welcome the fact that the essentials of the Good Friday Agreement have been preserved within the withdrawal agreement.  I have absolutely no doubt but that the collapse of the Executive and the Assembly was contrived nearly two years ago by Sinn F&eacute;in for political reasons.  Allegedly, it was over the renewable heat initiative.  We now know Sinn F&eacute;in was involved in trying to keep that extended as well.  The degree of cynicism involved in that act was extraordinary.  I do not accept Deputy McDonald's assertions, and I put it to the Taoiseach, that the absence of the Executive or the Assembly somehow is irrelevant to the unfolding Brexit situation.  That is an absurd assertion to make.  I have made those points on the importance of the Assembly and the Executive in terms of allowing the anti-Brexit majority in Northern Ireland to have a parliamentary voice and a voice at the Executive, and also to improve the dynamic in relations.  Brexit has damaged relations between two communities in the North.  It is polarised because of Brexit and, in my view, the absence of real politics.</p>  <p>  When a scandal hits a government, one does not collapse it.  One deals with the scandal.  It is extraordinary that a renewable heat initiative scandal that has occasioned an inquiry caused the collapse of the entire edifice of Government - the Executive and the Parliament.  I believe that is unparalleled in any European democracy and, in my view, unforgivable, given the gravity of Brexit, and compounded by the absence of any Brexit sentiment in Westminster where people did not get an opportunity to articulate their view.</p>  <p>  Brexit is about damage limitation.  We know Brexit will be bad.  Events may unfold differently in the Westminster Parliament.  We are now in the realm of speculation here as to what will occur there.  I note the Taoiseach said last week that no Government could be prepared for a no-deal scenario.  Can he assure us that the Government has a plan and is preparing diligently for a no-deal scenario even though nobody wants that and we will do everything we possibly can to avoid it?</p></speech>

At that stage, the Taoiseach can make his assessment on an informed basis as regards Sinn F&eacute;in.  What he is doing at this point is simply playing party politics.  He says he wishes, in an even-handed manner, with rigorous impartiality - that is what both Governments are committed to in the Good Friday Agreement - to ensure the restoration of the institutions of Government, yet at every opportunity, in a very partisan and partial way, the Taoiseach chooses to attack Sinn F&eacute;in and to attack me.  That is the Taoiseach's business, and it might be the party political acoustic of this Chamber, but it is a far cry from adopting a posture of rigorous impartiality.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Martin, I have not advanced any absurdities.  Unlike his party or the Taoiseach's party, we actually represent people in the North of Ireland.  We have a democratic mandate from them.  We live and work within the communities in question so I know full well the necessity and the value of good government and sustainable power sharing.  However, I am also saying to him that he is in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks there could be an agreed all-of-Executive position on Brexit with the stance that has been taken by the DUP.  He is even further in the realms of fantasy and wishful thinking if he imagines for one second that Ireland, or any representatives from Ireland, will be the decisive factor in the shape of Brexit, or Scotland for that matter.  That is not a real possibility.  As I have said previously, the withdrawal agreement is the least worst outcome.  In his bid to sooth unionists' nerves, I ask the Taoiseach to reassure the D&aacute;il that he will not give any succour to the position advanced by Arlene Foster that the backstop should be ditched.  I would like him to make that clear this afternoon.</p></speech>

However, we will be as prepared as we can be and that involves the hiring of Revenue and customs officials, which is very much under way, for our ports and airports.  It involves the hiring of veterinary officials, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is confident it can do that.  It requires significant infrastructure at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare.  Those works are under way, and the OPW is leading on those in conjunction with the port companies and the Dublin Airport Authority.  Also, the European Commission is working on its no-deal contingency plans, many of which have been published, and notices have been issued with regard to what will be done in the case of citizens' rights, aviation and so on.</p>  <p>  I do not believe a no-deal scenario is likely.  This deal can and should be ratified, but it has to include the backstop.  There can be no doubt about that.  That is a view of the European Union also.</p>  <p>  On soothing unionists' fears, I am not trying to sooth but I am trying to understand and listen.  Even if one does not agree with somebody, understanding where they are coming from is of benefit.  Listening is a benefit as well.  When I met with the Grand Master of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, and some Orangemen from the Border counties on Monday, he told me that when I used the term "precious union" in this Chamber last week it was picked up in Northern Ireland, and perhaps in the UK, as me being in some way being snide or sarcastic.  That was not my intention whatsoever.  When I used the term "precious union" in this Chamber, I did so quoting Arlene Foster because she often refers to the precious union.  I quoted it in an attempt to demonstrate that I understand how precious the union is to unionists and how important their British identity is to them.</p><p>I said it and quoted it in an attempt to demonstrate that I was listening and that I understood that unionists regard the union to be precious.  I did not mean it in any way to cause offence or sound sarcastic or snide, as I am happy to clarify.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that there may be a series of votes in Westminster, it could take a number of directions, namely, anything from a British general election or a referendum to a second vote or a series of votes that gives a different result, but that is in the realm of speculation.  It is extremely important to prepare properly.  To date, the Dutch Government, for example, has been further ahead than us and hired 1,000 customs officers.  There is a significant issue with our level of preparation across the board, including in enterprise.  The number of companies that describe themselves as not ready for Brexit in surveys such as Bord Bia's and others' is a concern.</p>  <p>  On unionism, I recall the Taoiseach's comments last week and I think he was attempting to educate me about the unionist mind.  I have talked with unionists for more than 30 years, on many occasions off the record, and in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs I managed to co-chair the discussions that resulted in the devolution of justice, which was the final act of the St. Andrews and Good Friday Agreements and which brought the administration of justice to a devolved setting in Northern Ireland.  I respect unionists' opinions, although I fundamentally disagree with them on their attitude to the withdrawal agreement because it gives Northern Ireland the best of both worlds economically.  It is a monumental failure on all sides that we are in this situation.</p>  <p>  When one compares all the complex decisions, such as decommissioning, that were taken to get the Good Friday Agreement over the line with the kinds of issues that are preventing a Government in Northern Ireland, the current issues bear no resemblance to the real issues of substance that had to be overcome to achieve the Good Friday Agreement, the devolution of justice and so on.  It reflects a monumental failure.  I do not live in cloud-cuckoo-land.  I have given much time and effort to Northern Ireland over many decades to try to understand it, coming from the republican background that I do.  I have worked well with unionists, people from the nationalist and republican communities and public representatives on all sides.  Irrespective of one's perspective, it is careless in the extreme to allow the institutions of government collapse because of a renewable heating scheme.  That is beyond the beyond.</p></speech>

They collapsed because of a perception of corruption and malpractice.  The Deputy might struggle with the notion that public opinion reacts adversely to corruption and bad practice, but that is how it happened.  If one cares to go and listen widely, people will say with clarity that they did not want a situation where the DUP, which had never signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, was not working in the power-sharing agreement.  The Deputy may say the big issue is decommissioning or policing, but many of the people whom he frequently derides and about whom he is extremely snide and sarcastic were instrumental in building that politics with others.</p><p>A whole generation of nationalists and, beyond that, progressives in the North will not wait for rights.  If that upsets the Deputy or the Taoiseach, sin &eacute;.  I accept that when the Taoiseach spoke of the &quot;precious union&quot; he was not being snide or sarcastic.  If it is any consolation to our unionist friends, the snide and sarcastic commentary in this Chamber is directed towards nationalists, be they Sinn F&eacute;in or other Northern nationalists, who do not see the world through the same prism as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Nationalists have lived and continue to live a different reality, their view point is not respected and their democratic mandate is consistently questioned by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.</p><p>I partly agree with the Taoiseach about preparation for a crash Brexit because it is unknown and uncharted territory.  I accept he has obligations but I urge him to be careful and avoid talking up the prospect of a crash or a no deal scenario.  It is not in anyone's interest and he should not rise to that bait.</p><p>As I said to Mrs. May yesterday evening, if unionists think that a crash is what will save their precious union, and that hardening the Border will resolve the matter, they are foolish because there cannot be a hard border on our island.  We are all <i>ad idem</i>on that.  While we will respectfully listen and understand, it must be understood that the interests of the whole island will be protected by all of us, not least by the Taoiseach as head of Government.</p></speech>

I am sincere about that and I mean it.  No matter what happens, we will look at this from an all-island perspective and not just from the vantage of this State.</p>  <p>  I recognise and largely concur with some of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's comments.  The architects of the Good Friday Agreement, many of whom, including the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, were from the Deputy's party, as well as others such as Tony Blair, John Hume, David Trimble and Deputy Adams, overcame such considerable obstacles in securing a ceasefire, securing British troop withdrawals from Northern Ireland, securing decommissioning, gaining acceptance for power-sharing across Northern Ireland, in which many people did not believe at one stage, and gaining acceptance of the principle of consent, that 20 years ago must have seemed too great to overcome.  They were overcome, however, which is why it behoves those who are now in office, such as me, Prime Minister May and people who hold influence in Northern Ireland and here, not to be found wanting or fall short of the high standards that were set by those people 20 years ago.</p></speech>

All the stakeholders have been making efforts and are working hard to reverse this trend.  Only last year we secured the national apprenticeship centre which is located in the town and there are over 250 apprentices based on the site today.  Our small and medium enterprises are showing initiative to drive forward despite the difficulties.  These include OMC, an engineering company based in Thurles which was founded and driven by mid-Tipperary business people, and Dew Valley Foods, a processing company, which is also a significant employer.</p>  <p>  An opportunity now presents itself to Thurles and mid-Tipperary which requires the support of Government and Government policy.  Lisheen, just outside Thurles, has been designated as a national research centre for the bioeconomy.</p><p>Thanks to the research of Professor Kevin O'Connor and his team at UCD, and the pilot work done by Glanbia, there will be a biorefinery on the site in a relatively short time.  This is just the beginning.  The research happening at the site has the potential to turn the waste from the agricultural and agrifood industries into high value, globally traded commodities.  The resulting jobs and supports connected to that can be a game changer, not just for Tipperary but for development in rural Ireland as a whole.  The energy from the bioeconomy will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th, and we in Ireland are ideally placed to capitalise on it.</p> <p> The site at Lisheen is perfect in many ways.  It is flat, it has scale, it has high voltage electricity and green energy available and it has a water supply that matches the size of the site.  However, one piece of the jigsaw is missing, namely, connection to the national gas network.  This can be solved at relatively small cost.  If we consider the benefits to the State which I have outlined, it will be an investment that makes a return to the State of a magnitude never before seen.  If this final part of the infrastructure was brought to Lisheen, the site would immediately be attractive to the pharmaceutical and food industries, or a mixture of the two.  It would fit all the criteria required for a hub for the international data centre industry.  It would be a shining example of how to create rural development and could be recreated throughout the country.</p> <p> If Lisheen was connected to the national gas network, with a bioeconomy focus on the site, it is easy to see the biogas industry being attracted.  This could help to achieve the national target of 30% of all gas used in Ireland coming from biogas by 2030.  The biogas used at Lisheen could be pulled back into the national gas grid and, given this potential payback, it is easy to justify the investment.  The gas network can be connected to the Lisheen site from Cashel in County Tipperary.  This would have the added benefit that the shortest route runs adjacent to Thurles, which is the nearest urban centre to the Lisheen site.  Lisheen would be the anchor tenant and would justify connecting Thurles in the same way Tipperary Co-op did for connecting Tipperary town, the Goodman factory did for Cahir and Arrabawn did for Nenagh.  As Thurles would provide the role of urban support to the fully functioning site, which would ultimately have hundreds of employees, it is only sensible that Thurles be connected to the network as part of this project.  That would have the effect of supporting existing industry in the town and would also make the town attractive for new industry of all kinds.</p> <p> A number of steps must be taken to progress this project.  First, a robust feasibility study must be carried out as soon as possible and this study must have input from the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It must also include input from Tipperary County Council, which is passionate about the project.  The study must include all of the aspects of climate change that the project can benefit.  This study can be done for &euro;90,000.  With the feasibility study done, it will be possible to make an application for funding to Project Ireland 2040 as early as next September.</p></speech>

I am sure he knows the way this works.  Gas Networks Ireland is a commercial State-sponsored body and is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The CRU has developed a network connections policy, under which industrial users, towns or groups of towns within a region can make an application to be considered for a connection.  The criterion the regulator sets is that the net present value of the revenues over a 25-year period must exceed the net present value of the costs of the connection.  I gather, from what I am told within the Department, that the last time the Tipperary region referred to by the Deputy applied was more than ten years ago and, at that stage, Thurles did not qualify for a connection.  Since then, the system has evolved in that groups of towns can apply, so if there are connections with Lisheen that might add additional payload, those can be included.</p>  <p>  Gas Networks Ireland would need a proposal to come forward with various payloads and the need for energy and gas usage from industrial users and from towns.  Clearly, it cannot assume that just by providing gas, everyone will connect, given there is a connection charge and also the cost of adjusting one's own heating system to a gas system.  It has to conduct this study.  As I said, the area in question has not made an application in ten years.  If the businesses that are developing in Lisheen have a gas requirement, that can be added as part of a submission, which would be evaluated under the connections policy the CRU has enunciated.  Gas Networks Ireland would then apply that.</p>  <p>  Based on what the Deputy outlined, I do not know which industrial users are in the area.  Gas Networks Ireland does not provide speculative extension of the line without having an indication that the demand is there, which is natural, given it is a commercial user.  There has to be the establishment of demand and there would have to be projects coming on stream and approved, whether by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or Teagasc.  That is the system.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining whether there are other dimensions, such as environmental dimensions, that could be a top-up to simply looking at the pure net present value.  I understand a report will come to me shortly with an evaluation of that.  That report will consider issues such as the carbon savings that might accrue and whether the net present value criteria are taking those into account.  However, the overall approach is as I have outlined.  Whatever the local promoters of the various initiatives are suggesting, whether it be biogas or otherwise, those will have to be developed to a point where they are close to approval as viable projects before Gas Networks Ireland could be in a position to supply its system.  I am trying to be as helpful as possible.  Of course, applications to the climate action fund or the disruptive technologies innovation fund can be of a more innovative type.  Where there are innovative initiatives coming forward, those could apply to the climate action fund, where they would be looked on based on their value in respect of carbon impact.</p></speech>

Ten years ago there was no Lisheen site adjacent to Thurles and no bioeconomy centre there.  The biorefinery has got serious funding and has got the largest ever grant from the EU.  That biorefinery will start on the site next year with a capacity to deal with 50,000 tonnes of lactose whey.  Tipperary County Council is very enthusiastic about the potential of the Lisheen site and what it can do.  Sustainable food production will be the byword of the 21st century.  Given the research going on into the Lisheen site and the fact it is a bioeconomy centre, I have no doubt the usage will be there.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister that the feasibility study on the potential of the Lisheen site and the gas connection, which the county council has asked for, be undertaken.  We reckon the cost of the study would be &euro;90,000.  I ask him to arrange this feasibility study.  I am confident in the extreme that he will recognise the significant potential of this site and the Thurles area.  Glanbia has bought into this biorefinery.  The location is at the heart of the agrifood industry, with Arrabawn, Dairygold, Tipperary Co-op and even Lakelands in the vicinity, as well as numerous meat factories.  The waste coming from those can be used in the bioeconomy to produce valuable commodities that can be traded commercially.</p><p>The potential of Lisheen is immense, and because Thurles is adjacent there could be a twin project to connect it too.  This could be a template for rural Ireland and rural development.  The Minister could give us the money to do the feasibility study.  We can prove that the usage will be there and the connection will ensure that this bioeconomy site thrives in the future.</p></speech>

This includes identifying the businesses that will potentially use gas and their scale - there are concessionary rates for connection charges where there are small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs; and identifying the new estates that might come on stream that would use it and other towns along the route that might connect in.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is not going to undertake an assessment of these.  This is based on projects that are coming forward, enterprises identified that are about to be approved or supported by the Industrial Development Authority, IDA or Enterprise Ireland.  When those enterprises are identified and have a demand for gas then GNI can assess whether that will be connected.  Neither GNI nor the Department go speculatively looking to see if they could create a demand for gas.  That is not the way the system works.  This has been regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The emergence of new biorefinery activities with a gas demand will trigger an application to the connections policy and provide the opportunity to pass the test applied.  It does not lay pipes in advance in the hope that industries might set up.  That is not the approval system.  There has to be a baseline of work to justify the investment it makes.  It is a commercial company and that is the way it has to operate under its regulations.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State would be aware of the scale of the problem.  Some of the women impacted by this are in the Visitors Gallery and are watching the proceedings here.</p><p>We welcome the publication of the report.  The women's voices are present throughout the report but that is coming from a fairly low base because there were not very many face-to-face interviews.  We would like to see more of the women's stories reflected in that report.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has met the women.  Before we went into the meeting, we had a very frank exchange and they had a very frank exchange with the Minister.  It is not easy to talk about some of these issues.  I raised them at Leader's Questions and know it is a difficult subject.  It is a credit to the women that they put forward their own cases, along with Melanie their representative, in a very coherent manner.  They rarely use euphemisms which is welcome.  We are all adults after all but we acknowledge this is a difficult topic.</p><p>We know that the scanners are coming but by what date?  It is impossible for many of the women to gauge the level of the problem and to know the best course of treatment.  Is there a co-operation agreement in place or can one be put in place for use of the scanner that will be installed in Belfast?  In that way at the very least we might have access to that scanner.  Will the women be afforded access to the treatment abroad scheme?  I know that is a tricky area.  I know the rules and that the Minister of State knows about this issue not only from this debate but from constituency cases.  </p><p>We have learnt from the report that the governance mechanisms were not in place at national level.  Only yesterday <i>The Guardian</i>covered this story and said that mesh implants made by one of the biggest pharmaceutical firms in the world were inserted despite the company being warned that the mesh could shrink and harden.  I met a woman today whose implant was inserted only six months ago.  I asked previously for the suspension of its use and it has been paused but this was in use until very recently.  We want to see action on all the clinical and technical issues associated with the use of mesh as a matter of urgency because while there are some women in the Gallery there are many more at home because they cannot travel, and more come forward every day of the week to tell their stories and to seek help.</p></speech>

The Deputy's consistency in this subject matter for a long time is commendable.  The report to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, from Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, on the use of urogynaecological surgery in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, SUI, and pelvic organ prolapse, POP, in women was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.  Synthetic mesh devices have been widely used in the surgical treatment of SUI and POP in women over the past two decades.  However, controversy about the safety of mesh devices has arisen in many countries because of concerns about the frequency and severity of complications associated with their use.</p><p>In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, the Minister requested the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to prepare a report for him on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.  Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies.  The report has been informed by a review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.  The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.  The Minister for Health acknowledges the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women he met and those women who have written to him in sharing what were harrowing and deeply personal experiences.</p> <p> The report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women.  These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.  The report makes 19 recommendations, including the development of patient information and informed consent materials; surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures; the development of clinical guidance; the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices; ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.  A programme of work to advance some of the report's more important recommendations has already commenced in the HSE in advance of its completion.  The HSE was also asked by the CMO on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so until a number of key recommendations have been implemented.  The Deputy acknowledged that in her contribution.</p> <p> A priority recommendation being progressed by the HSE is the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications.  This includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally.  The HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.  Decisions to remove mesh devices in women who experience complications must be made on an individual basis following detailed clinical assessment and discussion of the risks, benefits and treatment options by women with their treating clinicians.  The HSE has published a dedicated website page on vaginal mesh implants, including contact information, for women suffering complications.  I hope this is a useful resource, the link to which can be made available.</p> <p> I appreciate I have not answered the two direct questions on the date for the scanning machines and whether there is a co-operation agreement with Belfast.  I was also asked about the treatment abroad scheme.  I will get clarity on those matters for the Deputy and forward the information to her.</p></speech>

Anyone who has met these women could not fail to be moved by the manner in which they were treated.  In his reply, the Minister of State acknowledged the bravery, commitment and dignity they have shown and I wish to associate myself with those remarks.  I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he will come back to me on access.  My questions were not designed in any way to trip anyone up.  Like the Minister of State, I want to be able to tell these women when this will happen.  There is an acknowledgement of what happened to these women and there is also an acknowledgement on the part of the HSE and the Department that action must be taken.  We are looking for a timeline for that action and a date by which the women will start to see a material difference.  I spoke to the husband of a woman from the Minister of State's county, albeit not from his constituency, last week.  That couple had just cobbled together enough money to get to England to have a full removal procedure there.  The husband had spent five and a half years looking after his wife who is in agony and they could not wait.  I would dearly love to be able to tell that man when his wife would get treated.  That is all people are looking for.  While the acknowledgement and the fact that some progress has been made are very welcome, we need to join up the dots now and set out the date on which women will have access to a scanner or the treatment abroad scheme.  They will then be able to start the process of recovering.  Some of those women will never recover, but we must ensure they can get as well as possible.  I appreciate that the Minister of State will come back to me with further information.  I will be happy to share that with the women and their representative, Ms Melanie Power.</p></speech>

I assure the House that I understand very well where the Deputy is coming from and the need of these people to know the where, how and, most importantly, when of the next steps.  That is the assurance we would like to provide and as such I will certainly try to get a date for the Deputy without delay.  The Minister for Health is committed to ensuring the safe and effective use of mesh implants and that there is an appropriate and timely response to women who suffer mesh complications.  The Department has written to the HSE to request the preparation of a detailed plan for the implementation in conjunction with other stakeholders of the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO's report.  The Minister intends to meet with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in the coming weeks to discuss the report.  I assure the Deputy that I will get the answers she requests.</p></speech>

It was an oversight on my part.  I thank the Minister of State for attending to take this Topical Issue on the lack of a consultant psychiatrist in Carlow for the last period.  The position has been vacant in Carlow for a number of years at this stage.  There was a mental hospital in Carlow for many years, but it closed following the policy changes of recent years.  While the outreach service has, generally speaking, been good, the position of consultant psychiatrist has remained vacant with services being provided on a locum basis.  The locum would come on a weekly basis to meet clients, but when a new locum attended, the client had to start from scratch all over again to explain his or her story.  The lack of consistency has been a huge problem.  As difficult as the locum situation was, there has been no service at all since 1 February 2018.  There is no consultant psychiatrist at all, whether provided by a locum or otherwise.  There is no service in Carlow at all to cover what is unfortunately a great level of need locally.  Service users have now been told that their care plans will not be reviewed and that the medication they have been prescribed will have to continue to do them until a consultant psychiatrist is available or a similar service can be provided.  This is totally unsatisfactory.  At the very least, a locum service should be provided to meet the needs of people in Carlow.  If those needs did not exist, the position would not have been created to meet them.  While I appreciate that there is a huge difficulty in filling vacancies and that consultant psychiatrists are extremely hard to acquire, closing the service completely has been a regressive move.  I ask the Minister of State two questions.  When will the position be filled?  What is the possibility of renewing the locum service in the short to medium term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800032#KK00600"><p>I thank Deputy Deering for providing me with the opportunity to address this issue.  The lack of consultant psychiatry services in Carlow is an issue he has brought to my attention on numerous occasions in various fora.  To refer to the broader picture first, the Deputy acknowledged the worldwide shortage of consultant psychiatrists.  It affects us here in Ireland also.  I note that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Connolly, has a great interest in this area too.  We are currently short approximately 60 consultant psychiatrists in Ireland.  No matter what action we take and no matter how much money we spend on advertisements in medical journals in Australia, New Zealand and other countries, we cannot get sufficient cover for the positions we have created in recent years.  We are putting adequate resources in place.  If it was a question of more money, I could solve the problem overnight.  We have increased the mental health budget from the &euro;700 million provision in place when the Deputy first came to the House in 2011.</p><p>It is now more than &euro;1 billion.  Having put an additional &euro;300 million into the mental health budget over the past five years, we still face the same challenges.</p> <p> I am a firm believer that if we always do what we always did, we will always get what we always got so we have to move away from the issue of more money and resources because that is not the problem.  There is a shortage, we have an over-reliance on the consultant psychiatry and we have to look at new ways of delivering consultant psychiatry.  What I have done since becoming Minister of State is increase the number of training places for psychiatric nurses by more than 130 every year and I have introduced 114 assistant psychologists in the past year and brought 20 psychologists into the mental health system.  We have also introduced ten advanced nurse practitioners, which are effectively one step below a consultant, to try to do as much of the work that consultants do as possible and to make sure that consultant psychiatrists are only doing the work that they absolutely have to do.  We are trying to reorientate the system to be more proactive, to get more people into the system earlier, to ensure earlier intervention in the system and to get people detected at an earlier stage before they get to a higher level input.  That is an ambitious target and that is the journey we are on.</p> <p> I have also engaged extensively with numerous partners to try to bring about telehealth because that is what they are doing in Australia and America where they have the same difficulties as us.  Telehealth works through screen to screen delivery of mental health services.  A consultant psychiatrist based in Dublin can assess, diagnose, prescribe, treat and admit patients, if necessary.  Many of our consultants provide cover in areas where we have gaps and as soon as I announce that I have a consultant psychiatrist for Carlow, there will be somebody else in the Deputy's seat in a few more weeks saying that there is a consultant psychiatrist missing in their area.</p> <p> We need to look at the bigger picture, and recognise that we have a challenge here and that we need to look at how we do what we do, and that is why I have been championing telepsychiatry.  We have made good progress and we will roll out a number of pilots this year in this area.  I would love to hear from the Deputy's community health organisation, CHO, area and it is something that he might take up with HSE management in his area because we will make money available for people to apply to participate in a pilot project so that a neighbouring consultant psychiatrist can provide governance to the team that is working locally and cover without having to make a four or six-hour return journey by car.  We can eliminate the travel and do it in a clinical, supervised setting.</p> <p> Thanks to the Deputy continually raising this issue, he will be pleased to hear that we secured an adult psychiatrist in his area who started work the day before yesterday.  It is a locum position and it is not the silver bullet that I wish it would be but it ensures that there is a service there as of this week for the short term and, hopefully, the medium term.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the position has been filled on a locum basis in the past week.  I tabled this Topical Issue matter two weeks ago but the slot was not available so I am delighted the position has been filled.  It is important that there is a service, albeit it is not the silver bullet service that we might want, as the Minister of State mentioned.  It is important that people in an area who require that service can access it when they want.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the Minister of State's initiative of a teleservice.  No matter what the area of difficulty, I have always felt that we needed to look beyond the normal and traditional ways of doing things and a teleservice is definitely something to consider for the future.  The Carlow area could be considered and I will definitely take that issue up with my CHO area.  It is something that could be piloted in as many areas around the country as possible so that people will have access to that service.  My genuine initial concern was that service users would not have their service plan reviewed and they might have to deal with the same medication for months without being reviewed which I would consider to be dangerous.  I am delighted that has changed and that there is a little bit more certainty for the service users that they will have a system available to them.  Going forward, there needs to be something more definite and better planned so that they will be able to go in whenever they have an appointment and see the same face.  Continuity is important from a mental health point of view so that a patient is not starting from scratch with a clean slate every time a new issue arises.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his response and his interest in the matter and I will continuously engage with him on it over the next period and I will take up the initiative with my CHO area as we progress.</p></speech>

I am glad it has been resolved and I look forward to working with him and the CHO management team if the Deputy will instigate same to try to develop a pilot.</p>  <p>  I will give an example to the House of telepsychiatry and what I am referring to because I have visited New York and other places looking at how it works.  My ambition is to see a hub established in, say Dublin, where there would be a consultant psychiatrist on duty 24 hours a day and consultant psychiatry can be beamed into six or seven emergency departments, so that if a child or a young person in psychosis presents to an emergency department, a trolley or a cart with a screen on it will be brought up and a consultant psychiatrist will be there live and will diagnose, treat, prescribe and admit, if necessary, and that consultant psychiatrist in the hub can cover six or seven emergency departments as opposed to us trying to have a consultant psychiatrist in each one of those emergency departments 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to cover the two or three cases that might present in any given 24-hour period.  This is how they are tackling the shortage in other countries and in Ireland we have to be forward thinking and brave in this as well and embrace that new technology and new thinking.  It has been done elsewhere and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We just need to take up the challenge as opposed to trying to do what we always did because we will always get what we always got, which is not satisfactory and is not good enough as far as I am concerned.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Deputy to roll out some of these initiatives in Carlow and wish the new consultant who took up a post in adult psychiatry in Carlow on Monday the best of luck.</p></speech>

I thank him for taking this Topical Issue matter.  I raised this with him in July and there are two elements to it, one of which is to progress the delivery of the second bridge for Celbridge and the other is to look at lands that have been identified in the recent local area plan at Hazelhatch as an area of key and strategic development and to carry out a master plan for same.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge positively the work the Minister of State, his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Durkan have done with me in supporting this call to deliver the funding to progress the second bridge for Celbridge.  That has been positive and significant.  The announcement on Monday under the urban regeneration and development fund of funding to Kildare County Council to progress the bridge to route selection brings it up to, and including, the design and tender stage, which is welcome.  Celbridge has a population of more than 22,000 people and this is something that we have been seeking for many years at this stage.  There is gridlock and it can take up to 45 minutes to move 300 m or 400 m through the town, which is frustrating for people living in the area.  While a second bridge is not in place, at least now people can see clearly that there is path to delivering it.  Timelines will start to take shape and people will see an end game in sight.  That is significant and important for Celbridge to develop and grow as one of the largest towns in north Kildare.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge again and thank the Minister of State for his support and help in ensuring that this project is progressed, because when I raised this under Topical Issue matters with him in July, I highlighted the urgency of it and the need for progress in this area.  He gave me a commitment on that occasion that this funding stream would open and that he would examine it with his officials and support it as positively as he could.  He has done so along with the Minister and Deputy Durkan and I thank him for that.</p>  <p>  On the issues of the lands at Hazelhatch, they are located right beside the train station, where the frequency and capacity of services has increased in recent times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.388" nospeaker="true" time="15:30:00" ><p>We learned recently from a meeting with the National Transport Authority, NTA, that the DART will be extended to Celbridge by 2021, which is an extremely positive development.  The location of this land will provide clear access to the M7 in Naas and on to the M50 and a very accessible route to the M4.  It is beside amenities such as the Celbridge GAA club, the tennis club, schools etc.  The local area plan, which has just been approved by the local councillors and by the Minister of State's Department, has identified this land as an area for key strategic development.  When we discussed this matter in July we sought that the Minister of State's officials would engage with Kildare County Council and ask it to engage with the landowners to progress the master plan, which in turn, it is hoped, would lead to development of those lands sooner rather than later given the current crisis, the need for housing and the location of this land, which is not depending on infrastructure.  It is almost ready to go but the master plan has to be agreed between all parties, particularly Kildare County Council, the Department and the landowners.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, the Department has not issued that letter of comfort, instruction or detail to the local authority to engage on that as of yet.  I had hoped in this discussion today that consideration could be given to how soon that correspondence can issue from the Department to Kildare County Council to get it to engage with the landowners to progress the master plan for this area, which in turn will progress the development of housing, which is greatly needed in this area.  I ask that we discuss that and get a timeline for it.  At the same time, I acknowledge again the positive work the Minister of State has done in progressing the funding to help deliver the second bridge for Celbridge.</p></speech>

This matter was originally tabled for last Thursday and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, had hoped to take it as it is an issue with which he is happy to engage.  I welcome the Deputy's positive comments regarding the funding announced for project B for Celbridge and the other counties.  Deputies O'Rourke and Durkan raised it with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and myself on numerous occasions.  We recognise the importance of it.  We will have development in key areas such as Kildare and Celbridge in this case and we will be bringing forward housing proposals.  We also have to provide the necessary infrastructure in order that we provide such development in a co-ordinated and planned way.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, and the Taoiseach made it very clear when Project Ireland 2040 was announced that four or five funds would be announced later in the year, and that happened in May or June, to back-up Project Ireland 2040 and to make sure our plans are realistic.  The Deputy rightly identified the importance of the bridge and the relief road for Celbridge as key areas if we are to be able to develop these lands in a positive way for the town but also to provide housing for people from the area who want to have their own homes or other people who want to live in the area.  We are seeking to achieve a proper co-ordinated structure with good planning and infrastructural development, and that is what funding under the urban renewal fund addresses.  I recognise Deputy O'Rourke's comments in that respect and the importance of having discussions such as this one in the House to make sure we get all this right.  Deputy Durkan and himself have kept us focused on this.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's raising of this matters gives me the opportunity to outline where we are at with the development.  The Celbridge local area plan 2017-2023 was adopted by the elected members on 17 August 2017 and came into effect on 14 September 2017.  It is hard to believe it is a year ago as we had many discussions on that and other parts of the Celbridge plan.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, I welcome the fact that the plan supports the provision of a substantial new housing development in a key urban area close to Dublin.  Kildare County Council, in its current county development plan, has earmarked the population of Celbridge to grow by approximately 10,000 people over the next five to ten years.  We are discussing that planned development in the coming years but also during the next seven to ten years.  We need to plan for this increase and to ensure that Celbridge grows in a coherent fashion with the timely delivery of the new infrastructure that will be needed for this expanded population.  That includes the lands that are ready for development today but also we need to ensure we will make good use of our infrastructure, be it bridges, roads or train stations.  We planned the development close to those in a joint and co-ordinated fashion.</p>  <p>  In particular, I welcome the provisions of the plan enabling future housing growth on the southern side of the town in proximity to the existing commuter rail station at Hazelhatch, as the Deputy mentioned, and around that area.  This development strategy is consistent with established national and regional planning policy which encourages new housing accessible to such high quality public transport facilities in the interest of sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the local area plan also identifies the key pieces of strategic infrastructure that are required to be delivered as part of the planned new housing development areas.  The phasing arrangements set out in section 13 of the local area plan include requirements regarding the provision of a new road, bridge, open space and other facilities that will support the new homes to be constructed.  Design briefs are also provided for the five key development areas earmarked for future housing development which will further assist in ensuring the construction of quality residential neighbourhoods that are integrated into the existing urban fabric of the town.</p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the local area plan and in the interests of supporting the integrated development of housing within the local area plan, Kildare County Council is committed to preparing a transport mobility management plan to support the sustainable growth of the town.  State agencies, along with my Department and, I understand, the National Transport Authority, will be active in their support of the development of such a plan which will inform future infrastructure delivery.  It is very important that we get the infrastructure right.</p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water is in the process of upgrading the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant which serves Celbridge, and is also actively working to address identified constraints in the local wastewater system, in particular the upgrading of the local pumping station.  These measures will actively support the ongoing and future delivery of housing in Celbridge.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the fund, which enables lands to be developed in a co-ordinated way.  Celbridge was successful in that respect.</p>  <p>  I will check the status of the communication between the Department and Kildare County Council.  The planners and officials in the Department are happy to engage with the Deputy's team in Kildare County Council to develop the lands that are set aside for development now and also to master-plan the next phase of development.  That is what we are to do, namely, to do this work in a co-ordinated way.  We will be happy to engage around that also.  The lead authority is Kildare County Council and it has been engaged in this process under its local development plan during the past year or two.  We are happy to engage and build on that in the future.</p></speech>

They are defined as a key development area and strategic location.</p>  <p>  On the wastewater plant being upgraded, which was commissioned 12 or 14 months ago, the wastewater plant in Leixlip was upgraded to the tune of &euro;32 million.  The difficulty now is the infrastructure needed to get the wastewater to that.  Irish Water has carried out a number of site investigations and my understanding from working with the local authority is that it hopes to progress the start of the project some time in 2019, which would be timely because it would take some time to put together the master plan.</p>  <p>  The key question is how we can get the master plan done.  The key stakeholder, the landowners, are willing to carry out the master plan.  They will put in all the financial resources needed to do that but they need guidance and direction from Kildare County Council as the lead player in this.  We would not expect the local authority to do the master plan.  It would not be fair because it is not resourced.  It is under pressure doing other local area plans and dealing with planning applications for Kildare that are coming in on a regular basis.  We are not looking to the local authority to resource this work on this.  The landowners are willing to do all the resourcing of it.  They merely want to get the local authority to engage with them, bring them into a meeting  and get the process started in terms of the guidelines, being told what to do and being given a template.  Once that happens, the process will progress from that point, but Kildare County Council informs me it needs some communication from the Department to get it kick started.  As soon as that happens and all those stakeholders engage, my job, and the Minister of State&rsquo;s, is finished because they will start the discussion and the planning.  It will take whatever length of time it takes to complete it but at least it will be commenced.  The difficulty is that nothing has commenced between July and now.  It would be welcome if that could happen as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Building on Monday&rsquo;s announcement on the funding for the build to progress some of the infrastructure requirements, it is important that the local authority works quickly now.  I hope it does that and engages with all the relevant Departments to move it through the system.</p>  <p>  On foot of that and the existing plan, my Department will continue to work with Kildare County Council to support it in developing appropriately in the key locations such as Celbridge and other key urban centres across the country in accordance with adopted statutory plans.  We will get the communication going on the master planning of the different areas and developing that out too.  I want to be clear, not just in respect of Celbridge but other parts of Kildare also, that as a Minister in the area, along with our officials, we are happy to engage with both the local authority staff but also with the councillors on other zoning issues which they want to tease out and their plans for the county in regard to Leixlip and other places.</p>  <p>  In terms of Celbridge, it would be important that our Department and the local authority have those conversations about the planning system.  I will certainly engage on that and if resources are required to do the planning and the master planning, that is something we can examine in conjunction, as the Deputy said, with landowners who are happy to do that as part of their duty.  Now that some of the infrastructure has been sorted out they are appropriate conversations to have. I will certainly see what is the position on that and make sure we can progress those conversations.</p><p>The focus is for all stakeholders, including the council, local businesses, stakeholder estate agencies and the wider community, to be included in implementing the Celbridge local area plan.  I confirm that my Department and I will work proactively with Kildare County Council on infrastructure delivery and sustainable urban development.  There are many key sites that can be developed in Celbridge to make good use of infrastructure.  My own train station in Dunboyne will be upgraded to DART status.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800035#NN00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I thank all parties and Independents for facilitating the passage of all Stages of this Bill through the other House.  It is important legislation which has garnered strong support from across all parties.  I hope we can see the Bill pass in the D&aacute;il speedily so it can become law and make a difference in our society.  The Government has spoken about its support for the core objectives of our legislation.  We are open to any amendments the Government or anybody else wishes to table to improve on the work that we have brought forward.</p>  <p>  Every country has a gender pay gap and in every case we have looked at, women are paid less than men.  There are comprehensive statistics from across the OECD relating to that.  That is a fact but does not mean that it is acceptable, much less inevitable.  Equal pay for equal work is a basic principle of equality and of human rights.  Ireland has made progress on this issue.  We had a massive pay gap between men and women which is shown in the statistics from the 1940s through to the 1970s.  It has gradually declined since more progressive legislation began to be introduced after we joined the European Economic Community.  It is no surprise that when there was a marriage bar in the Civil Service and public service, there was an enormous gender pay gap.  That was removed in 1973 and from that time, women's average earnings have increased.</p>  <p>  The latest EUROSTAT figures measure Ireland's gender pay gap at 13.9% whereas the OECD has it at 10.6%.  There are different ways to precisely measure the gender pay gap.  We have to be careful to be accurate about which measuring stick we are using and what the basis of our measurement is.  EUROSTAT measures the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees as a percentage of male gross earnings.  The OECD measures the difference between the median average earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men.  Most people are already lost with those statistics.  I will put it as simply as I can.  If men are paid &euro;100 on average, women doing the same job are paid &euro;86.89.  That is a much clearer and more succinct formulation.  It adds up to a very significant difference with implications not only for the lifetime of work but for pension purposes in retirement as well as income throughout a person's working life.</p>  <p>  The Acting Cathaoirleach will be glad to know I do not intend to discuss the ins and outs of the statistics but I want to focus on the substantive issue.  It is clear that there is still a gender pay gap which is real and manifest in our society and country.  On average, women are paid significantly less than men.  It is positive that Ireland is doing better than many countries.  It is better than the EU average and the OECD average but that is not a reason to be complacent.  A number of countries are doing much better than us, such as Belgium, Italy and Romania.  We see from statistics that gender pay equality is greater among younger employees which probably does not come as a major shock or surprise.  I am glad to say that gender pay equality is higher in the public sector than in the private sector.  The worst gender pay inequality is in financial services and the insurance industry.</p>  <p>  There are a number of explanations for the gender pay gap.  Women and men play different roles throughout their lives with regard to rearing a family.  That is the normal reason given.  Women take time out for parenting and that often reduces women's earnings, more often than men's.  There is a difference in the professions that men and women are prevalent in.  More women are in healthcare and teaching, with fewer in engineering and finance.  There are unanswered questions too.  We do not know enough about gender pay differences in this economy.  We do not know, though we might suspect, that bonus payments to men, not least in those male-dominated professions and financial services, are greater than those received by women.  We want to know the truth and that is at the heart of this legislation.  We want to improve information about gender pay inequality so we can better understand and address the reasons for it, that would permit us, where necessary, to take remedial action to eliminate gender inequality.  We want to increase transparency about gender pay inequality throughout the economy.  That will raise public awareness on this very real, important equality issue and create pressure in society for enterprises to improve their own performance.  We do not have to look beyond, for example, the national broadcaster here or the BBC in Britain.  We had transparency and people were aghast to find women working side by side with colleagues, doing the same job and suddenly finding that there were manifest differences in the rates of pay for no explainable reason at all.</p>  <p>  Unequal pay for women is clearly an issue of equality and human rights, as I have said.  That is why we envisage a central role for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in our legislation.  We propose that it draws up a scheme for employers to publish their rates of pay by gender.  This will apply to medium and large employers which employ 50 or more workers.  A requirement will not be placed on the vast majority of small enterprises to comply with this legislation although we would welcome and encourage their voluntary compliance and best practice to have this sort of reporting across the economy.  In the Bill, we have specified the types of employer and employee affected by the proposed scheme alongside some minimum requirements on the type of information that we will require to be published.  This will include the difference between the average hourly rate of pay of male employees and female employees using both the arithmetic average and the median, or middle value, average.  Publication will also have to include bonus pay and refer to part-time versus full-time workers.  With regard to enforcement, we envisage fines for companies that do not meet their obligations under the legislation.  Additionally, larger employers with more than 100 workers which do not meet their obligations would have the name of their company published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p>  <p>  This is not complex legislation.  It is not an onerous demand on employers.  There is a lot of evidence that our graduates are keenly aware of equality issues and the disparity in pay.  Many enterprises will put their equality and diversity policies front and centre to attract the best employees of whatever gender.</p><p>This is a positive progressive direction in which our society is moving and our legislation is designed to nudge those employers who are laggards in this regard on the path to putting their house in order.</p> <p> Our society offers our children and young people great opportunities.  Women and men are entering into professions that did not even exist ten or 15 years ago.  Women are excelling in science, engineering and technology in our universities and in the workplace.  Women are active in every sector of our economy, although not in equal numbers to men in every sector.  However, gender inequalities persist.  Our legislation comes down to basic questions.  Would parents want their sons and daughters to have access to any job available to the opposite gender?  Would they want them to have the same rates of pay and access to the same bonuses as any other man or woman doing the same work of the same value?  Would they want them to have the same career expectations in terms of promotion and advancement?  The Labour Party has no doubt the answer to all these questions throughout Ireland will be a resounding "Yes".  This is why it is important that the Bill becomes law at the first opportunity, to advance these important principles that I believe are shared throughout the House.  I ask colleagues to support the Bill.</p></speech>

There are approximately 140 Private Members Bills before this Chamber and I am not sure of the number in the Seanad.  Overall if we add the two together there are probably about 200 Bills.  This Bill is way ahead of other Bills as it has gone through one House of the Oireachtas already and is now being debated on Second Stage here.  I urge the Minister of State to help us bring it to fruition.</p>  <p>  The Government has spoken about doing its own thing on gender pay but this is an opportunity to make it happen quickly.  It certainly cannot come quickly enough for the women in the workforce who are not being paid in accordance with equality.  It is a fundamental equality issue for women in particular.  The concept of equal pay for equal work goes right back and I campaigned on it in the 1970s and 1980s.</p></speech>

One could not possibly live in a society where one did not get equal pay for equal work and not try to fight it.  It was part of Article 141 of the European Community treaty.</p>  <p>  We are now at a stage where we know there is still a big gap in the mean and median hourly rates between males and females.  This is throughout the European Union, as Deputy Howlin has said.  More recently, the European Union has come out with specific recommendations.  In November 2017, the European Commission adopted an action plan to address the gender pay gap.  This includes a number of measures to be implemented in 2018 and 2019 that are focused on eight different areas.  These include improving the application of the equal pay principle, combatting segregation in occupations in sectors, breaking the ceiling with initiatives to combat vertical segregation, tackling the care penalty, better valorising women's skills, efforts and responsibilities and unveiling inequalities and stereotypes.  The other two, which are particularly pertinent to our Bill, are alerting and informing about the gender pay gap and enhancing partnerships to tackle the gender pay gap.  Clearly, the European Union has already directed European countries to take action in this area and we want to take action.</p>  <p>  There are a number of models and our Bill is closely modelled on the UK one.  Iceland has a different approach, which is more punitive, and Germany has a different approach again.  The main point of what we want to achieve is to have transparency so women know what is going on in their company.  As Deputy Howlin said, this can be an impetus for companies to do better.</p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission can take action through its existing powers.  In effect, the Bill is in the context of an existing statutory regime that enables the commission to acquire information, assess compliance with employment equality law and direct steps to be taken by employers where it finds institutional inequalities.  While the Bill is primarily about information it can lead to further action to deal with the issues.  This is important and we have put the Bill in the context of the commission because of the role it plays.</p>  <p>  I know there are other views on how we might do this and, as Deputy Howlin said, we are open to any amendments the Government or others wish to propose but we want to see this happen.  As well as addressing the median and mean pay gap between men and women, we also want the Bill to address issues on bonuses.  Often the advantage that male employees have, particularly at upper echelons, is the bonuses they get so we have included bonuses.  We have also included part-time work in the scheme.  The scheme also requires the breakdown of information by reference to the full-time or part-time status of employees and by reference to their age.  In many cases, women work part time.</p>  <p>  In some ways it is not covered under our legislation but it is statistically true that women tend to be in lower paid employment in general.  Areas such as childcare are predominantly female and are atrociously badly paid considering the work childcare workers do and the significantly high qualifications most of them have.   Care generally is not well paid.  There are also the hospitality, retail and cleaning sectors, to which I particularly point with regard to women.  Unfortunately, because cleaning is often contracted it might not even be captured by a company's overall employment and pay status in terms of men and women.  This is something we really need to tackle.  There are a number of elements to the fact women in society do not have the same pay status as men.  There is also the point made by Deputy Howlin on the positions women go into.  As the workforce is changing this is also changing and it is to be welcomed.  Statistics show that only approximately 19% of senior roles are held by women.  It is slightly better in the State sector.  All parties here are conscious of the importance of having gender balance on State boards.  More recently, we have seen academic imbalance highlighted and people have pointed to these issues in the arts, entertainment and communications sectors.</p>  <p>  These are all very important issues in the equality agenda.  Many years ago we got equal pay for equal work but we do not have equality.  Very often, women's childbirth role and the fact they take time out, particularly after childbirth, mean that in many cases there is an unconscious bias against women in the workplace, particularly women of childbearing age.  Employers are wary of time that will be taken off.  This needs to be addressed because it is a role that cannot be avoided if we are to have a next generation.  It must be included in the culture of the workplace.  What we want to achieve here, as well as having very specific pieces of information put into the public arena to change behaviour and, perhaps, force changed behaviour through the commission, is to change culture.  It is good for any workplace to have this type of gender balance.  It is not good for any sector of employment to be predominantly male or predominantly female.  I hope we will achieve this type of change in society.</p>  <p>  One of the statistics that comes out of the figures we have, and Ireland is at approximately 14%, is that women effectively work for free for one month a year, if we compare it with the average pay of men.  Nobody can stand over this.  There are reasons some countries have a much better achievement.  In many cases it is because they have legislation of one type or another and because they have already implemented legislation such as the Bill that has changed behaviour.  We specifically refer to larger companies that have 50 or more employees.  The Government may have a view as to this figure.</p><p>We believe it is the appropriate figure, and we are supported by many organisations in that belief.  If that information is in the public arena, it will force change.  It will also mean that women will have access to information they do not have at present.  The data show that in many cases women who are applying for employment are offered lower wages because it is expected that they might accept them in a way that perhaps a man would not.  We want to tackle that and the way we propose to do so is by having information in the public domain to change behaviour.</p> <p> We urge the Members from other parties to support this legislation.  It has reached this House of the Oireachtas and it should not take too long to be passed if it receives the support of other parties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-28a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112800037#PP00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017 which was introduced by the Labour Party in the Seanad and has been passed by that House.  The fundamental aim of this Bill, which is to address the gender pay gap, is fully in line with Government policy as expressed in the programme for a partnership Government and in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, with which not everybody is familiar.  For that reason the Government has chosen not to oppose this Private Members' Bill in either House.  We believe the debate is important and worthwhile.</p>  <p>  That said, we differ on the mechanism to address the gender pay gap.  The Bill predates the publication of the Government's proposals.  We took the opportunity to engage with stakeholders, including employer and employee representative groups, in drafting our proposals.  In particular, I thank the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development for their valuable input.  We examined the possibility of bringing forward amendments to this Bill but our legal advice is that such an approach would be excessively cumbersome and that it would be much more straightforward to bring forward a new Bill.  Having secured the Government's approval for the heads of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill, we published the legislation on 26 June and invited the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to submit its views as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, as we are required to do.  Regrettably, we have not yet received the report of the committee.  I am anxious to consider any views the committee may have and to endeavour to incorporate them into the Government's proposals.  I am also anxious to move forward with the Government's Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us proposes to amend the legislation establishing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, by assigning to the latter powers to make mandatory gender pay gap information disclosure schemes.  Under such schemes, specified categories of employers would be required to compile and publish information relating to differences in the pay of their male and female employees.  Schemes would not apply to employers with fewer than 50 employees.  Contravention by an employer of the provisions of a scheme would be an offence.  I am advised that the latter provision could mean that under Article 17.2 of the Constitution and Standing Order 179 a money message from the Government will be needed before Committee Stage of the Bill can be taken.  A decision on whether such a message is needed is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the Bills Office.</p></speech>

The gender pay gap is somewhat different in that it is the difference between the average gross hourly pay of female and male employees.  Not respecting the principle of equal pay is likely to be a contributory factor to the gender pay gap, but there are a number of other causes as well.  Among the factors which interact in creating the pay gap a number have an obvious gender dimension.  I refer to traditional role models, gender segregation in education and in the labour market, the challenges of balancing work and family life, the difference in participation of men and women in family responsibilities, the availability of quality, affordable childcare facilities and out-of-school hours care and processes within organisations where imbalance needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  To put the situation in Ireland in a broader context, it should be noted that, according to statistics from 2014, Ireland has a gender pay gap below the EU average.  It is 13.9% here and 16.7% in the EU.  However, our gender pay gap has shown no longer-term tendency to decline and, therefore, must be the focus of specific action.  Pay transparency as provided for in this Bill and in the Government's proposals is one such measure and, in recognition of that, the Government does not oppose this Bill.  Indeed, the gender pay gap is the subject of a number of actions in the programme for partnership Government.  Measures committed to include increasing investment in childcare and reviewing the lower pay of women and gender inequality in senior appointments.  To that end we have established a strategy for the private sector called Better Balance for Better Business.  It is part of the national strategy for women and girls which was published in 2017.  One of the actions in the strategy is to carry out an independent review of corporate boards in Ireland focusing initially on Irish Stock Exchange companies.  That will report to the Government in the first quarter of next year.  It will also cover gender differences in the senior management of companies, as mentioned by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan earlier.</p>  <p>  We are all agreed that it is important to approach this from a number of different angles.  Having women in senior management at board level is an incentive and support to other women and girls to move up the line and take up such positions.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was right to refer to diversity in companies.  Many companies are recognising and valuing this now.  When there is diversity in companies, it helps everybody.  Ultimately, it helps with the bottom line.  The companies are happier places in which to work and people are valued for their diverse ways.  Many companies are beginning to realise that now but we must help them with that.</p>  <p>  The Government is active on all of these issues.  The programme states that we will also seek to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 employees and more to complete a wage survey.  These commitments are reflected in the actions in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  Action 1.22 of the strategy states that we will initiate dialogue between key stakeholders, unions and employers aimed at addressing the gender pay gap, and develop and promote practical information resources to explain and increase understanding of the multifaceted aspects of the gender pay gap and its causes.  Practical tools will be developed to assist employers in calculating the gender pay gap within their organisations.  Clearly, this is an action which must be addressed before legislation such this Bill or the Bill the Government is preparing comes into effect.  Action 1.23 of the strategy pledges to promote wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results.  This is, of course, the subject matter of the Bill before us.</p>  <p>  The Government has concerns with the specific approach proposed in the Bill, and I will outline some of these.  The Bill provides for the insertion of a new section 32A in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  Subsection (1) provides for the making of a scheme by IHREC.  As set out in the subsection, the exercise of any authority or power to make a scheme would be at the sole discretion of IHREC.  There is no provision under which the Minister may require or request IHREC to make a scheme.  As such, there is no provision whereby enactment of this legislation is guaranteed to result in the introduction of wage surveys as promised in the programme for a partnership Government.  We must bear in mind and respect that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is independent under the Paris Principles.  As subsection (1) is phrased, approval of the Minister is not required for any scheme.</p>  <p>  While IHREC has undoubted expertise in this area, it would be appropriate that powers are subject to the control of the Minister, as is the case under section 31 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 whereby codes of practice can be prepared by IHREC for submission to the Minister and the Minister may, by order, approve them.  There is no similar mechanism in the Bill so it is very much out of line with the principal Act.  In effect, it gives a quasi-legislative power to IHREC with no mechanism for oversight or control.  The Bill provides not just for the publication of the overall gender pay gap figure for an employer but for disaggregation of this figure by reference to bonus pay, full-time or part-time status and the ages of employees.  In this context, we must bear in mind the data protection aspects and my Department is consulting the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the Government's Bill to ensure that it respects the general data protection regulation, GDPR.</p>  <p>  As I said, the Government wants to legislate in this area.  Our proposals have been with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 5 July last.  Our proposals are informed by the debate around this Bill in the Seanad.  Indeed, I wish to acknowledge the great work of Senator Bacik on the Bill.  She continues to make a significant contribution to advancing gender equality.</p><p>Our proposals are also shaped and informed by our consultations with employer and employee stakeholders.  The debate in the House this evening will be of considerable value as will the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, when we receive it.  I hope that Members would appreciate the value of the considered approach taken by Government in respect of this legislation.  I look forward to hearing the views of other Members in the House this evening.</p></speech>

I welcome the Labour Party Bill before the House this evening.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the legislation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that for centuries women in Ireland, and women throughout the world, have been discriminated against.  Not only have they been treated as second-class citizens they have been deprived of some of the basic rights that men took for granted for centuries.  This year we celebrate the centenary of women getting the vote in 1918, which was a significant event.  It is also important to recall that there was significant opposition to that.  It was not always the case that the path of women's suffrage and rights for women was supported by the political establishment.  Some of the biggest opponents of giving women the right to vote prior to 1918 were members of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and it was not only John Redmond.  Sir Edward Carson, as a member of the Irish Unionist Alliance, was also vigorously opposed to giving women the right to vote.  Some Irish MPs were different in that they supported universal suffrage but the political establishment prior to 1918 was very much opposed to women getting the vote.</p>  <p>  When the Irish Free State was established the marriage bar was introduced in 1932.  This prevented women from working in the Civil Service upon marriage.  This affected many women, mothers of many of us no doubt, who had to give up their jobs once they married.  We only got rid of this measure in 1973.  Legislation that was prompted to a large extent by the European Economic Community, as the EU was known, gradually resulted in greater rights being given to women in the workplace.  In 1977 the Employment Equality Act was introduced.  This important legislation was introduced by another member of the Labour Party, the former T&aacute;naiste, Michael O'Leary, a man who appears to have been airbrushed out of Irish history but who played a significant role in improving the path for the equality of women in the workplace.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Employment Equality Act 1998, which ensured that equality on the basis of gender was upheld in the workplace.  That was also a significant piece of work and a significant achievement.</p>  <p>  Today, unfortunately, we still have not attained full equality for women in the workplace.  The statistics reveal that currently there is a gender pay gap.  I note the Minister of State's comments on the causes of that, but it is not necessarily the case that the reason for the gender pay gap is that the laws, be they the Employment Equality Acts of 1977 or 1998, are being breached.  The fact of the matter is that the pay gap exists and the Oireachtas has to do something in respect of that.  We are in the fortunate position where the public sector has led the way for many years in this.  There is no suggestion or contemplation that any Member of this House who is man should be paid more than a female Deputy.  This also applies throughout the public sector and the Civil Service.  The problem appears to lie significantly in the private sector.</p>  <p>  This legislation is very useful in trying to deal with a complex problem.  One of the first stands that must be made in order to deal with a problem is to disclose the problem.  If companies over a certain size are required to publish information in respect of the gender pay gap, then it focuses attention on the issue.  Once attention is focused on the issue then we can start to resolve it and it will become a more obvious requirement for companies to ensure they do not have a significant gender pay gap.</p>  <p>  The gender pay gap that is being statistically examined in the State is at present around 14%.  We also note that the problem appears most significant at the higher end of the workforce.  This question really needs to be examined closely, and answered.  We should not permit a situation to develop where there is any breach in respect of the amounts that women are paid compared to men at the higher levels or the lower levels.</p>  <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin.</p></speech>

I also commend my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, and Sonya Lennon of the WorkEqual campaign.  They have done a huge piece of work on bringing this issue to the businesses that we need to talk about.  There is no point in us talking about this in the D&aacute;il Chamber or our colleagues talking about it in the Seanad Chamber; we need businesses to take it on board, to stop talking about it and to put practical realities into action.</p>  <p>  Equal pay for equal work has to be the cornerstone of any just and fair society.  While we talk about this I am very conscious of the pay disparity that exists for those workers who started working after a particular year, especially between teachers.  That is also absolutely wrong.</p>  <p>  One of the most worrying aspects of recent research into the gender pay gap is the fact the gap is now widening for younger women when it absolutely should be narrowing at this stage.  Progress is being made in other areas of gender equality but not, it would seem, in terms of pay.  This is why Government intervention is essential.  The strategies, consultations, reviews and symposiums have not worked.  The Government must support this Bill.  I am aware that the Minister of State has said the Government will not oppose it, but the Government should be supporting the Bill and not be neutral on it.  The Bill is an important step towards pay equality.  The Bill proposes legislation that will compel an employer with more than 50 staff to publish information on its employees' pay, a measure that already exists in the UK and Australia.  The legislation needs to be supported by improved childcare provision, improved shared parental leave, as proposed in the legislation brought forward by myself and Deputy Lisa Chambers, and by increasing the number of women in better-paid roles and occupations.</p>  <p>  The Bill has been described as a diagnostic rather than a curative measure.  To solve the problem, however, we first need to gather all the necessary information to assist in public policy formation.  This information can then be used by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Ireland continues to hold a ranking of 25th place on an international league table of overall female economic empowerment.  Our latest figures say that the gender pay gap is 13.9%.  As Deputy Broughan said, women are working for free for one month in the year.  Our boardrooms have an 18% female participation rate compared to 22% in the UK and 34% in France.  As usual, the Nordic countries are leading the way.  Progress has been excruciatingly slow in addressing the pay gap and the lack of gender diversity on boards.  Ireland is one of the worst performers in Europe for gender balance on corporate boards.  Half of all State boards are still failing to meet the 45% minimum target set in 2014.</p>  <p>  Young Irish women are constantly reading news stories about their favourite actors, musicians and celebrities fighting for equal pay in the worlds of music and film.  It is good that people are being upfront and out there about their fight.  As their representatives, we have to try to ensure parity of pay for young women here in their own country.  Great strides have been made to improve economic independence for women in Ireland in recent decades.  Bold and progressive policy changes were needed to achieve this.  The same approach should be taken to address the gender pay gap.  We would not accept different rates of pay on any other basis.  If two people are doing the same job with the same level of experience then they should be on the same salary.</p><p>It is deeply disturbing that as women progress in their careers and gain experience, their earning power drops to such a level that they earn 28% less than their male counterparts after 15 years.  Shocking research from the UK shows that Ryanair is in the top ten of those with the worst gender pay gap.  I am happy to join my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, and lead in this area in saying that Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill in an effort to progress the glacial pace at which pay equality is proceeding.</p></speech>

Like colleagues, I pay tribute to the Labour Party for bringing it forward.  I also pay tribute Deputies O'Loughlin, Lisa Chambers and O'Callaghan who are doing extraordinarily good work in this regard, particularly in respect of a Bill they brought forward recently.  I also commend Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee on her efforts to make improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  Although we have had equal pay legislation on the Statute Book for more than 40 years, we still have a significant problem regarding the gender pay gap.  The available statistical information has long shown that progression, if it takes place at all, is excruciatingly slow.  It is high time that real action was taken and that we resolved this situation once and for all.  The most up-to-date statistics from the CSO show that, on average, women are paid 14% less than men.  As Deputy O'Loughlin has pointed out, that would correspond to women working one month in the year for free.  While it is in some way understandable that the pay gap is widest for older employees, it is worrying that statistics suggest the gap is now widening for younger women too.  While we have been making progress in so many areas on gender equality, it is extraordinary to think that this remains the case.  It should not be happening.  It is clear from the lack of progression in the area that the only way the gender pay gap can be addressed is through Government intervention.  While I welcome the comments of the Minister of State this evening, I urge him and the Government to do everything in their power to come to terms with this issue.  As my colleague stated, there have been many national strategies, public consultations, reviews and symposia on the pay gap issue.  However, there seems to be very little movement at all on getting something concrete done.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill in July that would allow the mother of a newborn child to share her maternity benefit entitlements with the child's other parent, if she so wishes.  Our party believes this is an important move towards broadening parental choice, promoting gender equality and supporting a healthy work-life balance.  It is relatively unusual within Europe that parents cannot share leave.  For example, in Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Norway and Germany, there are provisions for parents to share maternity leave allocations.  A woman may wish to share her maternity leave with the child's other parent for a variety of reasons.  Certain jobs are more amenable to periods of leave.  A person at an established company may find it easier to take leave than a self-employed person.  Certain women may wish to re-enter the workforce earlier.  We believe that this should be for a woman to decide.  Parental leave policies that support fathers' involvement are a powerful policy tool to tackle gender inequality.</p>  <p>  In the EU, the gender pay gap is shown as a percentage of men's hourly earnings.  It does not take into account all of the factors that contribute to the gap such as, for example, differences in education, labour market experience, hours worked, the type of job and many other factors.  The Department of Justice and Equality states that the gender pay gap in Ireland was 17.3% in 2007.  According to the most recent figures published by EUROSTAT, in 2014 the gender pay gap in Ireland was 13.9% while the gender pay gap across the EU overall was 16.7%.  However, a report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, in February 2017 indicated that the gender pay gap in Ireland has widened over the last five years.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to support the Bill.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, we have worked together on other legislation in the same vein in order to try to advance women's equality, address the stark inequalities that exist in our society and do our job as legislators in trying to bridge that gap.  Where we see failings in legislation, we seek to make changes.  That is what this Bill certainly seeks to do.</p>  <p>  This is a very practical Bill in that it requires employers with more than 50 employees to publish information about their pay scales in order that we can see if there are any differences in how they pay their male and female employees.  It is quite simple information but it would be very effective in making changes.  It would also allow the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to create an information disclosure scheme for employers about a gender pay gap if one exists in an organisation.  Some organisations will welcome this - those that are doing a good job - while others might not.  That level of discomfort is something we need in working towards our goal.  These provisions will allow employers to benchmark against their competitors and should act as an incentive to do better, because companies need to do better.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also allow prospective employees to look at employers and decide which are best to work for, which actually value equality and which will treat them properly and equally.  The fact is that in late 2018, we are looking at a 14% gender pay gap.  Women in this country are being paid 14% less than men and the gap is widening.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan pointed out, this effectively means that from 10 November each year, women stop being paid.  That is unacceptable and wrong and there should be a sense of urgency in addressing it.  We have to address the underlying reasons that the pay gap exists in the first instance.  There are many such reasons.  The fact remains that the pay gap is wrong.  If employers know they are paying their female employees less, they should be taken to task.  They should be forced to publish that information and they should be forced to close the gap completely.</p>  <p>  Given that women are still the primary caregivers, are required to take maternity leave and are ones who will have absences from work, it is no surprise  that they are discriminated against.  A Bill that Deputy O'Loughlin and I published not long ago was not supported by Government but was supported by the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats, and the Green Party.  Basically, the entire Opposition supported the Bill but the Government opposed it.  That Bill would have allowed women to share their maternity leave entitlements with their partner if they so chose.  The effect would have been twofold.  It would have given flexibility to women to get back into the workplace quicker if they wanted.  It would also have levelled the playing field in the sense that when people were going for a job the employer might look at the female candidate and the male candidate and think that actually either of them might take maternity or parental leave.  That level of discrimination would have lessened.  However, the Government decided not to support the Bill.</p>  <p>  When listening to the Minister of State's response as to why he is not supporting the Bill, I have to say I think many of us were smirking at the true intention behind why it is not being supported.  To say that he has examined the possibility of bringing forward amendments and that it was just too cumbersome suggests it is just inconvenient, and that really the Labour Party beat Fine Gael to it.  Is that not the real reason?  The Labour Party got there ahead of Fine Gael.</p></speech>

The fact remains that the Bill is here.  It is being supported and this notion that the Government can somehow not oppose but not support at the same time just does not make sense.  The Government is sitting on the fence.  It essentially wants this to be a Fine Gael Bill but it is not, it is a Labour Party Bill.

We are very happy to support the Bill and we hope to see it pass as soon as possible.  The fight to ensure pay equality is another step in the battle to ensure equality between women and men.  Deputy O'Callaghan made reference to the distance travelled and it includes battles such as the fight to win universal suffrage - the vote essentially - a century ago; the fight against the marriage bar; in very recent times the fight to repeal the eighth amendment that caused so much harm and suffering to women over more than 30 years; and indeed now this fight for equal pay.</p>  <p>  It is a relevant issue across the world, perhaps starker in other parts of the world than here.  According to the World Economic Forum it would take 217 years to close the economic gender gap globally.  However, it is also quite significant in Ireland.  With a gap of 13.9% it would take 55 years to close the gender pay gap in this jurisdiction if we were to continue as things are.  This is a mechanism that has been introduced in other jurisdictions.  Britain has gender pay gap reporting and similar proposals have been implemented in other EU countries and in the United States.  Measures similar to the ones proposed are due to be signed off in the North in the coming months.  We welcome these moves.  They are not a silver bullet, as I am sure the Bill's proposers would agree, and many other issues need to be addressed.  It is right to shine a light particularly on those businesses that might be fearful of the Bill's provisions where there is a significant pay difference - inexplicable in many circumstances.  It is a way to bring pressure to bear.</p>  <p>  I am mystified at the Government's attitude.  It is very common to see Government Bills where the Government introduces on Committee or Report Stage practically an entirely new Bill.  It is unusual and very positive to see a Private Members' Bill pass through all stages in the Seanad and arrive into the D&aacute;il.  That is a sign of the support for it and the consensus not only in here but in society as a whole.  The Government should work with that.  The framework of the Bill is good enough and I do not know why the Government is starting with another Bill.  It should work with this Bill and we should advance it.</p>  <p>  I was pleased that a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment proposed in the Seanad was accepted.  This ensures that where a company does not comply with the legislation by refusing to publish data, the company's title would be published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It is positive that that was accepted.  Publicity will be as powerful as any fines in this.  There is a role for fines, but the focus needs to be on shining a light and putting pressure on those companies that are discriminating.</p>  <p>  Many other issues need to be addressed in tackling the gender pay gap.  Reporting of this kind will not of itself address the overall gender pay gap.  It will not capture large childcare providers which may not have a large gap between male and female employees, but the majority of them are likely to be female and the majority of them are likely to be low paid.  Throughout society in low-paid work women predominate.  Therefore, we need to take other steps to address that and ensure the playing field is levelled and people have greater flexibility with leave.  I commend the Bills introduced by Deputy Lisa Chambers and Senator Clifford-Lee in that regard.  Much more needs to be done on that and on the social welfare side as well.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.  There is a good framework here to deal with an issue that is important for society.  The Minister of State should work with it rather than try to work in a different direction at the same time.</p></speech>

As my colleague stated, we will support the Bill.  Indeed, we share the frustration of the Labour Party with Government foot-dragging on the issue.  The gender pay gap is not a new issue.  A multitude of research has been undertaken across the EU and in Ireland on the subject.  Back in 2002 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned Indecon to undertake a study on male-female wage differentials in a number of sectors.  So accepted is the fact of the gender pay gap that the EU has an annual European Equal Pay Day to highlight the gap which we all know now stands at just under 14%.</p>  <p>  With all this in mind, why on earth is the Government frustrating the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland?  When this legislation was first introduced 17 months ago, the Minister of State with responsibility for equality acknowledged that the Bill echoed current programme for Government commitments.  However, despite this, the Government failed to engage and dragged its heels before finally producing its own heads of Bill more than a year later.</p>  <p>  In justifying this decision, the Taoiseach told us last week that a new Bill was necessary as changes were needed to the Long Title and Short Title.  That is simply not credible, nor is the Minister of State's concern with the new section 32A.  His concern seems to be that oversight and initiative are robbed from the Minister and that it falls to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I am very happy to see such a change.  We have waited so long and the political establishment and the Government have been in such a state of splendid inertia on this issue, I am very happy for a commission with responsibility for human rights and equality to set the pace on this.  God knows, if we were waiting for the Government we would be waiting a very long time.  Irish women and Irish society are no longer prepared to wait.</p>  <p>  It is not just about the reporting of gender pay differentials.  We need to be honest about this and look at low-paid sectors in our economy.  We need to be honest about this and look at cost of living.  We need to be honest and say we need to do so much more, including the introduction of a living wage and rent caps.  We need market interventions.  For today, we support this legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is a reasonable person and I do not question his good faith on these matters.  I appeal to him; for God's sake let us stop the delay.  This is good legislation.  If he wants to argue for amendments, I think he is concerned unnecessarily.</p></speech>

I do not accept the reasons the Minister of State gave for not accepting it.  I heard Deputy Lisa Chambers outline the reasons the Government should support the Bill.  There are various stages in legislation that enable us to perfect Bills.  We have introduced many Bills to improve workers' rights and Fianna F&aacute;il did not support them for exactly the same reason.  That party seems to support the softer Bills but not Bills that make a real and tangible difference.  While I do not say this Bill does not do that, it simply puts an obligation on employers to publish information.</p><p>It is easy to support such Bills but there are more fundamental Bills Fianna F&aacute;il would not support.</p> <p> According to CSO figures, on average, women are paid 14% less than men.  Those figures are based on gross hourly earnings, and that gap has been growing.  At the same time, the CSO figures show that more than 55% of all women aged between 25 and 34 years had a third level qualification in 2016 compared with 43% of men in the same age group.  Even though it seems that women tend to be more highly educated and qualified than men, that is not translating into earning power.</p> <p> It is obvious from all the data and the figures which have been presented by the Labour Party spokespeople, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and the Fianna F&aacute;il Teachta&iacute; also that there is a problem.  Not enough is being done.  This Bill would go some way to at least identifying the problem and I do not see why the Minister of State's Government is not in a position to support it.</p></speech>

The PwC index is very interesting where it shows that the level of inequality - 14% less pay for women than men - is up from the figure in 2014 when it was 12%.  It is 18% in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.  An interesting comparison is that Iceland has had equal pay for the genders since 1961 - 57 years of neutral pay rates.  Interestingly, it is not a member of this great European Union - the great club - that is supposed to have brought women equal pay in the first place, an argument I have often refuted, and the statistics are before us in terms of Ireland, Britain and the rest of Europe.</p>  <p>  Self-professed experts often say there is no such thing as a pay gap and that it is a fiction.  They argue that differences in pay for the same work is illegal, that we have equal pay legislation across the European Union so how can there be a gender pay gap.  The reality is that some employers will brazenly break the law.  However, much of that gap is structural because women end up in the jobs and professions that are overwhelmingly female and overwhelmingly undervalued by this society.  It is not incidental that happens.  It is because of the structured attitude of society to the sort of work women do, such as cleaning, caring, maintenance and hands-on work that is undervalued in comparison to the muscular, more physical sector in which men generally work.  </p>  <p>  I believe that gap worsened during the years of austerity under the measures the proposers of the Bill brought in.  For example, the Labour Party, in government with Fine Gael, enforced legislation on workers' rights, the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, of which we are still feeling the impact, where workers in this House and across the public sector, both men and women, earn 10% less than people they work alongside.

Services like home help and special needs assistance, SNA, were cut, again jobs largely done by women.  Their levels and their pay were cut.  The legacy of austerity also looms large here.  It is good to document these things but they will not go away until we set out to improve our industrial relations machinery, which barely recognises the existing legislation.</p>  <p>  I note that the provisions in the Minister of State's proposed Bill argue for personnel from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to conduct on-site inspections to ensure compliance on gender information, but there is a problem.  We recently attended a committee on bogus self-employment with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  From questioning the Department we were able to show that when inspectors go on-site to check the statistics on bogus self-employment, they do not actually do it.  They do not keep statistics on bogus self-employment.  We have industrial relations machinery that is not fit for purpose.  It is certainly not fit for purpose in terms of keeping track of inequality that exists between men and women on the one hand and the same workers in the same sectors on the other because of the austerity.</p>  <p>  We have had a plethora of strikes recently including Lloyds Pharmacy, Dunnes Stores, Tesco, teachers and nurses, of which the workforce is largely female.  Those strikes in the private sector in particular are often based on the lack of a permanent secure job, precarious work, the lack of contracts and issues of inequality.  I am glad to say all those strikes took place because the workers were unionised.  From that we should learn that as well as producing papers that record inequality in a particular manner, we have to end the impact of austerity and the inequality.  However, we also must ensure that in every workplace we do as much as we possibly can to get workers into unions, and get them mobilised through those unions, to achieve their rights.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, it was revealed that Ryanair pay women on average 72% less than men in terms of mean hourly pay.  That means for every &euro;1 a man earns, a woman earns 28 cent.  Ryanair said that eight of the 555 pilots in the UK are women.  That is equivalent to 1.4% of all pilots.  The inequality is impounded by companies in which unions do not exist.  I greatly welcome the unionisation earlier this year of Ryanair and that the company, given those unequal statistics as well as its record, was forced to recognise the trade unions, which hopefully will be able to do something to close that gender pay gap.  We all know the reason for that is the nature of the work women largely do in the airline such as ground staff and crew as against the number of women being trained as pilots.</p>  <p>  We can safely say the gender pay gap in Ireland is probably the worst in the EU.  We should stop eulogising the European Union as some kind of deliverer of rights for women or advances in terms of equality because that is not the case.  Where women have fought and won equality in pay and in status in their jobs, which was mentioned by Deputies earlier in terms of fighting for same sex marriage, the repeal of the eighth amendment on abortion rights and proper childcare, that was done by women campaigning both through their unions and outside the gates of this House.</p></speech>

It is very important because for far too long women have been treated unfairly.  The further back we go, the worse it was for women.  It is only right that where women are doing the same work as men, they should be paid the same.  That inequality has existed for far too long, and I am glad to have the opportunity to support the Labour Party for bringing forward this Bill.</p>  <p>  We must recognise that women have played a very important role in all our lives.  We would not be here if it were not for women.  In the past, women worked inside and outside the home.  They kept the home going but were hardly ever remunerated.  My grandmother's husband was invalided from early in their marriage.</p><p>She had to work outside and do all the work to cut turf for sale.  I am so agitated when I hear people suggesting people should not cut turf because I know what she and that generation went through to survive.  It must be recognised and made possible that women be paid the same as men.  There are many inequalities in our system, even now.  Young teachers are not paid the same as teachers used to be or as teachers who work alongside them and were qualified earlier.  It is wrong, degrading and frustrating for young teachers who spend five or six years in college but end up working for much less than people who entered the workforce before them.  </p> <p> Likewise, nurses on the front line do vital work.  It is no wonder that many of our young graduates emigrate and take up employment in other countries because it is not fair or right that nurses are not remunerated for the hard work they do in caring for sick people to the same degree as the people who entered the workforce before them.  They must work so much harder because of all the paperwork, liability and pressure that is put on them.  They must work long hours and it is not right that they are not paid the same as the other nurses.  </p> <p> I am sorry to say that the Labour Party played a role in this issue by what it did to women in the home whose pension entitlement was changed.  We are only now starting to address that but it was wrong and unfortunate.  I met so many women who were not going to receive the same pension and they were so hurt because they felt they had paid their contributions but, as the playing pitch was changed, they would not get the same pension that other women received, and would continue to receive, alongside them.  As these women came of pension age in only 2012, they were subject to the new regulation and it hurt them badly.  I am glad this matter will start to be addressed in the coming year.</p> <p> As I said at the outset, women, whether they be wives, daughters or mothers, play such an important part in the running of our country and homes.  We must ensure that they are treated the same and that they receive the same remuneration for the same work as men.  It is great that the Bill acknowledges the great work that women and girls around the country do on behalf of men and their country.  They are as proud of our country as anyone else and they have played such an important role, not least in past times of trouble when they cared for men.  Circumstances must change and we must move on and ensure women are treated properly.  I am 100% in support of the Bill and I hope it is brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  This situation has gone on for too long and it needs to be corrected.</p></speech>

I am delighted to support the Bill and I commend the ongoing work of Senator Bacik, who has long been a champion of women's rights, on introducing it.</p>  <p>  While there has been much change in society over the past few decades and many barriers to gender equality have been broken down, this does not mean we can afford to be complacent.  Structural and cultural issues that prevent true gender equality remain and they must be overcome through positive measures such as the Bill.   It has been more than 40 years since Ireland introduced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and yet the most recent CSO figures show that, on average, women in this country are paid 14% less than men.  There are many complex reasons such a difference persists, despite laws to prevent gender pay discrimination.  Fortunately, overt discrimination has become less frequent, but there continues to be significant gender segregation by occupation and the undervaluing of occupations in sectors that are predominantly female.  </p>  <p>  Gender equality, like all matters of equality, cannot be achieved by passive acts.  It must be won through positive action.  We can write the words on paper and pass laws calling for an end to discrimination but without active enforcement, follow-up, research and work, we cannot overcome the more subtle problems.  The Bill will work to tackle these subtleties through the collection of data.  Detail will show us exactly where problems lie and inform us how we must tackle them.  In particular, I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s call for companies with more than 50 employees to publish information on the proportion of male and female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands.  There are many organisations where, while men and women on the same band are paid equally, women comprise the majority of the lower pay levels and men the majority of the upper pay levels.  Last year we learned this was the case for Departments, where women fail to break through to upper and managerial levels.  With data we can learn how systemic this is and develop the policies and supports necessary to address it. </p>  <p>  Ending the pay gap will not only be beneficial for women; rather, it will be beneficial to the economy at large.  PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that cutting the pay gap could boost OECD economies by &euro;4.9 trillion.  I hope the measures outlined in this Bill will be extended to cover companies and enterprises with fewer than 50 employees and ensure that areas with precarious employment, in which women are more likely to be employed than men, are monitored and assessed for gender biases.</p>  <p>  There is much more work to be done to value women&rsquo;s work across all sectors and advance gender equality, which is a priority of the Oireachtas women's parliamentary caucus.  Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill will make a significant positive impact in addressing gender pay issues.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago, I was struck that the charity, Dress for Success Dublin, which launched its #WorkEqual campaign, found that on 13 November the women of Ireland would effectively work for free for the remainder of 2018.</p><p>While our gender pay gap of 13.9% is lower than the European average of 16.7%, it is still far too high.  Across Europe, the gender pay gap ranges from just 5.2% in Romania up to 25.3% in Estonia.  We have had an annual European Equal Pay Day since 2011.<br/><br/>The Bill brought forward by Senator Bacik is superior to the Government&rsquo;s Gender Pay Gap Information Bill, which is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The heads of the Government&rsquo;s Bill were published on <i>genderequality.ie </i>at the end of June.  When addressing the Seanad on the Bill before us, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said that the &ldquo;thrust and philosophy behind both [Bills] are exactly the same.&rdquo;  The Government&rsquo;s Bill, however, would amend the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 but would only apply to companies with no fewer than 250 employees.  In the Seanad debate, Senator Bacik spoke of how we all wish to see pay transparency legislation.  I understand that she met the Minister and his officials to see how they could work together to progress the most legally sound Bill.  She also stated that given that the gender pay gap has only narrowed by 4% in the past 11 years, it could, according to estimates from the National Women's Council of Ireland, take up to 170 years to close it completely.  We cannot wait that long.<br/><br/>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill is superior because it provides for the publishing of information on gender pay gaps in companies with no fewer than 50 employees.</p></speech>

In Iceland, however, the figure is 25 so the legislation there applies to even smaller companies.  I agree with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland that this should be reduced further but at least it would cover far more companies than provided for in the original Government Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes a number of new provisions.  The new section 32A(4) sets out the type of information to be published including the differences in mean hourly rates, median hourly rates, bonuses, etc.  The new section 32A(5) provides for the status of employees to also be included in the breakdown referencing the ages of employees and whether they are full-time or part-time.  This will be particularly interesting given the over-representation of women in part-time employment, and in the huge and growing precariat, and also given the increasing use of if-and-when contracts.  The new section 32A(6) provides for the imposition of a class A fine on conviction if these provisions are contravened.  The new section 32A(7) provides for the publication of the name of the employer of at least 100 staff who contravenes provisions but I am not sure why there is a difference here for employers with between 50 to 99 staff.  Why are all eligible employers also not liable to be publicly named if they are not complying with law?  Why make a difference between the size of the companies in this respect?</p>  <p>  I recently spoke on the excellent Report on Gender Budgeting produced by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member.  That report was worked extensively on by the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Examining gender and equality budgeting has been a big part of the committee&rsquo;s remit.  We have heard from many distinguished stakeholders on the topic, including the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, Members of the Scottish parliament, IHREC, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We had hoped that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, would produce a gender budgeting report alongside budget 2019, which was one of the committee's fundamental recommendations.  Hopefully, this will happen in future along with green budgeting.  Six pilot projects on equality budgeting are being undertaken by the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Children and Youth Affairs, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills and Health.  Just under &euro;2 million has been spent on these programmes, which include initiatives such as requiring more apprenticeships to be available to young women.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office produced research on historical earnings in the period 1938 to 2015.  That research included an earnings by gender section.  Between 1942 and 2007, female industrial workers earned less weekly than their male colleagues.  The weekly difference in earnings was &euro;79 in 1942 and this jumped to &euro;215 in 2007 but the actual percentage gap reduced from 50% in 1942 to 31% in 2007.  In 2014, the gap for industrial workers was 22.6%.  Earlier this year, a marketing agency, Alternatives, released the results of a survey it carried out which showed that in the marketing and advertising sectors men are more likely to receive a higher wage and additional non-salary benefits.  As Deputy Catherine Martin noted, that is the case in many professions across the public and private sectors.</p>  <p>  In 2017, when Ireland was reviewed by the UN for compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, IHREC reported on the 14% gender pay gap, the 38% gender pension gap and the prevalence of women in lower paid jobs.  We know from that report and our own evidence that it is working lone parents who are more likely to live in poverty or at risk of poverty and yet the Government has consistently introduced measures that would continue to harm this cohort of women.  One of the characteristics of the policies of the austerity Governments since 2011 has been that the cohort of the most vulnerable women were damaged most.  We still have not undertaken fundamental reforms for groups such as women returners, the women who have been out of the workforce for several years and who do not have access to programmes such as community employment.  The latter is something in respect of which we did nothing year after year.  There is a great deal of ground to be made up but this Bill is an important step.  With this and hopefully with the Minister of State&rsquo;s initiatives, we will achieve vast improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  I mentioned Iceland earlier.  Iceland introduced a gender equality law in mid-2017.  It is now mandatory for companies with over 25 employees to obtain an equal pay certification.  It is working to eradicate the gap by 2022.  We have seen many reports on the pay gap.  In the UK, we saw the outrageous differences in pay between men and women presenters at the BBC across a range of activities.</p>  <p>  The legislation introduced by Senator Bacik and the Labour Party is a small step towards transparency and echoes the thrust of my own High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill, which I introduced in the previous D&aacute;il.  I warmly support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill and I commend her and the Labour Party on their work on it.</p></speech>

He must have been looking at the books last night to put it together.  I have had this treatment from Fine Gael in the past, both in government and in opposition.  What is happening here is the legislative equivalent of putting something in the fridge and then the deep freezer so that it becomes so covered over in icicles, the Government can grab its own legislation - inferior and all as it might be - and tell us we must run with it instead.  I am very glad of the expressions of support for the Bill before the House and the principles contained therein.  The Bill can be further improved and we are totally open to that.</p>  <p>  I have a friend, Mary Upton, a former Deputy for Dublin South Central who departed this House some time ago.  She has a theory about a potted plant and it describes well something to which the Government is prone.  I refer to the situation where women cluster around male politicians to create a doughnut, or as Mary used to call it, a potted plant effect.  There is far too much of this clustering in photographs on social media posted by various men in the current Government, although I will not name names.  There is also an approach whereby women are flattered.  Flattery will get you anywhere, as a Marx said, although it might have been Groucho Marx.  Flattery does not cut it.</p>  <p>  The sentiments in the Bill are very clear.  In effect, the gender pay gap means that, from November, women work for free.  In other words, they are working for free for two weeks of November and all of December.</p></speech>
