    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400003#A00200"><p>Could I quickly take the opportunity to articulate my deepest sympathies and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party at the appalling mass murder in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last Saturday night?  Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been bereaved and with the victims.  It was an assault on the entire LGBT community in the US and globally.  It represented a fundamental attack on the essence of our liberal, free democratic society and the immense destruction that can be wreaked by access to weaponry, which wreaked such havoc among young people enjoying a normal Saturday night out.  May they rest in peace.</p><p> On Leaders' Questions proper, I want to put it to the Taoiseach - I raised this issue during the last D&aacute;il - that as revelations emerge and as the level of the investigations get deeper, the Government's position on Project Eagle, the sale of Project Eagle by NAMA, becomes more untenable by the day, that is, the sense that there is nothing to investigate down here or that there is no necessity for the Government of the Irish Republic to be overly concerned about this particular deal.  I do not believe that position is credible.  The sales process, whether we like it or not or whether Nama likes it or not, was not robust, was not competitive and did not secure the best outcome.  There are huge ethical questions over the entire sale of that asset.  As we know, there was &euro;7 million in an offshore account.  We know there are allegations of fixers' fees.  We know that PIMCO went to NAMA and said that third parties were looking for fees.  At that stage NAMA said it forced PIMCO to withdraw but PIMCO said it voluntarily withdrew.  However, that does not matter, the point is that Cerberus came in and used the same third parties or legal structures and we ended up with the sale at a very steep discount.  We are talking about assets with a book value of more than &euro;5 billion.  NAMA purchased them for &euro;2 billion and they were sold at a &euro;400 million loss on NAMA's purchase price but the bottom line is that it is the Irish taxpayer has lost out substantially as a result of this particular deal.</p> <p> The UK's National Crime Agency is investigating this.  There have been two arrests and there are rumours of more arrests on the way.  It is being investigated in the United States.  The Northern Ireland finance committee has had an inquiry.  At the very least, NAMA should have attended that inquiry.  It is the biggest sale since the agency was established and there are huge concerns about it.  Yet we, in the Republic, seem to have adopted an attitude that there is nothing to see here, that everything is fine on this side of the equation.  </p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that at the time that PIMCO revealed that people were seeking fees, surely that was the time for the entire deal to be called off, for both NAMA and the Minister for Finance, who was alerted to it, to call a halt to that deal and say there were too many questions about it.  It was something from which they should have pulled back.  The Irish taxpayer lost out to an extraordinary degree but worst than that, the deal is tainted, of that there can be no question.</p></speech>

People will be aware that I gave instructions that the flag should fly at half mast and I have been in touch with President Obama about that.  Leaders will have an opportunity to make a comment on the Order of Business.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Martin's point in respect of NAMA and Project Eagle, I want him to understand that, as I have said here on many occasions, I am informed that this loan sell was executed in a proper manner.  Despite all the comments and allegations, there are no claims of wrongdoing against NAMA.  That loan portfolio was sold following an open process to the highest bidder for what it was worth.  NAMA paid no moneys to any party on this loan sale against whom allegations of wrongdoing are now being made.  Anyone with evidence of wrongdoing needs to report it immediately to the proper authorities, as I am sure Deputy Martin will do if he has information in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Government and NAMA take very seriously, and why should they not, any accusations of NAMA employees or former employees breaching the NAMA Act.</p><p>I understand that over the weekend there have been some comments about the naming of persons who had been arrested.  I understand that two individuals were held for questioning in relation to the UK's National Crime Agency investigation into the Northern Ireland sale of assets owned by NAMA.</p> <p> I understand that a number of investigations are underway on that at the moment.  I welcome these investigations as does the Minister for Finance.  As they are serious allegations, clearly they are being thoroughly investigated in the relevant jurisdiction.  NAMA continues to co-operate fully with the NCA and other relevant authorities in these investigations.  The Department of Finance has previously made all relevant information on Project Eagle available publicly on its website.  Separately, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is continuing its examination of the disposal of loans by Northern Ireland debtors.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is, of course, positioned to report independently on that.  His officials have confirmed that, given their independent role, any queries in regard to the timing, content or any other specified aspect are matters for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I might point out that the Northern Ireland Assembly Committee for Finance and Personnel which carried out a review on the Project Eagle sale was a committee of the previous Northern Ireland Assembly.  The stated purpose of the Northern Ireland finance and personnel committee's review was to undertake a fact-finding review in respect of the operation of NAMA in Northern Ireland, including Project Eagle and related regulatory issues that fall within the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel.  The Department of Finance assisted the committee by providing a large volume of documentation in response to the committee's requests.  Separately, NAMA provided detailed written responses to over 100 questions submitted by the committee.  I understand that the committee published all of this documentation as well as all other evidence gathered in the course of its review in a detailed timeline on its website.  I understand the committee intends to resume its work.</p> <p> If there is anything else that warrants further analysis here, I would be very happy to hear it from Deputies.  I am sure that if Deputy Martin has come across information that should be given to the authorities, he will provide it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400005#C00300"><p>I said &quot;No allegations of wrongdoing against NAMA&quot;.</p></speech>

That is the point but the Taoiseach keeps almost deliberately ignoring it.  The allegations are about the entirety of the deal, its ethics and its rightness or wrongness.  Surely, when people heard that there was up to &euro;7 million in an offshore account, it raised eyebrows.  Surely, the deal should have been called off when PIMCO alerted NAMA to elements of what was going on and when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was himself alerted to what was going on at that stage.  There is no point in saying that everything on our side was fine and we have covered our backs, that all our paperwork is clear and clean in the Republic and in NAMA headquarters and the fact that others may have got up to all kinds of activity is of no concern to us.</p></speech>

It is the sense that has come from Ministers, the Taoiseach and NAMA in a very defensive mode.  Instead of saying that if something is rotten in the state of Denmark in regard to this deal, it is in our interests to tackle and deal with it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach mentioned the Northern Assembly.  There seems to be a sense of a connection and a nexus between politics and all of this in the North as well.  That may emerge in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I am informed that the sale was conducted under proper conditions, that it was sold following an open process to the highest bidder for what it was worth.</p></speech>

Tens of thousands of these families are crippled by increasing rents and the constant fear for the future.</p>  <p>  My office - I am sure that every Deputy has had this experience - deals with these issues every day.  There are landlords who will not respond to a request for a viewing by a young mother with two children when they realise that she will be seeking housing assistance payment, HAP.  A male in his late 30s is in a home in overcrowded conditions with a mother and two adult siblings because he cannot afford to rent.  Another young male who has lived in private rented accommodation for five years has just been given notice to leave the premises, cannot find other accommodation and is threatened with homelessness.  This situation is worsening day by day.  Surely this is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  The latest Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rent index report, which was published last week, confirmed what we all knew, namely, that the cost of renting a home is continuing to spiral out of control.  At the end of May, the average cost of renting a home in Dublin was almost &euro;1,500 per month, which is more than it was at its highest point in 2007.  Outside Dublin, rents are increasing at an even greater rate.  In my constituency of Louth and east Meath and depending on to whom one listens, rents have increased by either 11% or 14%.  All of the reports agree that these are the highest yearly increases in the State.</p>  <p>  Families cannot afford to pay rent.  This emergency is being compounded by the Government's failure to build social houses, which has created a significant shortage in housing supply and pushed more people into the private rented sector.  Until now, the Government has set its face against rent certainty and refused to link rent increases to the consumer price index as many other states have done.  Will the Taoiseach reflect on this issue, and particularly on the plight of the families involved?  They need our support - we are here to legislate on their behalf - and the Taoiseach's support.  The D&aacute;il's Committee on Housing and Homelessness has received repeated calls for the introduction of rent certainty.  Will the Government include a commitment to introducing rent certainty as part of its action plan on housing and will it commit to supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill that will be before the D&aacute;il this evening?</p></speech>

I have set up a Cabinet sub-committee, which has now met five times and meets again tomorrow.</p><p>At each of those meetings, a presentation was given by the relevant Departments with responsibility in this regard, including the Departments of Justice and Equality, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance and the Department with responsibility for construction, housing and planning.  The intention is to draw all the propositions together, including new ones, and have a draft strategy for housing available, presented by the Minister to the Cabinet sub-committee, hopefully, by the end of this month.  It would then become a strategy and an action plan to deal with housing.</p> <p> In respect of Deputy Adams's Private Members' time, and his party's Private Members' business, he is perfectly entitled to put that down but I think, with respect, he is playing politics a little here.  The reason I say that is that the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness is due to report this Friday.  Yesterday, the Minister for housing and planning spoke to the Deputy's own spokesperson and said: "Let us have the debate if you wish but let us suspend it until such time as the Oireachtas housing committee&rsquo;s report comes in and is debated here".  It can feed into the development of the housing strategy, an action plan being prepared by the Minister for housing for debate in the D&aacute;il and for implementation in terms of the supply of housing.  However, the Deputy&rsquo;s spokesperson was not willing to accept that and resume the debate at a later time.  He wanted to have a vote on it.  In that sense, Deputy Adams is prejudging the outcome and final deliberations of the Oireachtas committee on housing.  He is certainly going off in advance of the Government&rsquo;s response in terms of a housing strategy and an action plan.  That is his right if he wishes to do that.</p> <p> The Residential Tenancies Board's rent index for quarter one of 2016 shows the rate of rent inflation is cooling, with rents up nationally by 0.5% over quarter four of 2015 and by 0.2% in Dublin.  This compares with a growth rate of over 1.6% in quarter four of 2015.  It obviously does not deal with a situation whereby the number of homeless people on the streets still increases.  It is not acceptable that there are many families in hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts.  However, the Government is taking action here not just following the appointment of the Minister but, this morning, it also approved a &euro;200 million infrastructure fund for which local authorities can compete to draw down money to open up access to sites that are currently off limits.  Many of these are in the greater Dublin area and have the potential for much earlier investment and action on providing houses.  That is the real answer to the problem here.</p> <p> Deputy Adams is entitled to have his vote.  The Government will not be supporting his objective in this instance.  There is a great deal of work going on.  If the Deputy wants to try to pre-empt it by having a vote, that is his right.  However, he could have waited.</p></speech>

On the one hand, he says as an understatement that the supply of housing is not what it should be.  He has not built any social housing in the whole time he has been in office, or not enough worth talking about, yet he goes on to accuse us of playing politics.  He asks why we do not adjourn the debate.  Why should we adjourn the debate?  This is a question of real people living real lives and in a crisis trying to live their lives.  Why does the Taoiseach not support the Bill?  On Committee Stage, he could, if he wanted, amend it to suit whatever his position might be.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of fairness and the choice between fair rents and being homeless.  The Government, in its last manifestation, was very clear about whose side it was on.  We hear all the talk about new politics but it is equally clear what side the Taoiseach is now on.  There are people who will be homeless by the next time we have Leaders' Questions, which is tomorrow.  There will be people who will never be able to own their own homes for as long as this crisis continues.  Therefore, I ask the Taoiseach again whether he will commit to the principle of rent control.  If not, why not?  Could he explain to me why we cannot intervene to ensure there are fair rents for citizens?</p></speech>

The development of the housing strategy on behalf of the Government will, I hope, be available in draft form by the end of this month.  The strategy will take into account a range of propositions from the various Departments I mentioned to deal with the very questions the Deputy raises.  These include the supply of housing, including social housing, the taking of homeless people off the streets, the provision of proper and adequate accommodation for families that are currently in hotel rooms and bed-and-breakfast accommodation, the issue of rent certainty, which has been dealt with, the changes made by the Department of Social Protection and the increasing numbers of people who are supported by an increased rent subsidy under the relevant scheme with Threshold.</p>  <p>  A range of activity is taking place.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to make a specific point, as it is entitled to do, and vote on it.  The range of work taking place is in the interests of everybody, including Deputy Adams who can make valid comment, constructive or otherwise, on the issues that will be in the action plan and strategy.  These are designed to provide 35,000 social housing units, of which 18,000 are to provided by the end of 2017, with a further 17,000 to be provided by the end of 2020.  That is where the action must be.  It is not just about talk in here but about making decisions.</p>  <p>  The Government made another decision today which will result in &euro;200 million being provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  County councils will be able to compete to draw money from this fund to open up sites to build houses.  I am sure Deputy Adams supports this measure.</p></speech>

I welcome what I read in this morning's media, which has since been confirmed to the House by the Taoiseach, namely, the establishment of a new infrastructure fund of &euro;200 million to bring unserviced sites into use for housing.  I seek some clarity about the fund.  Is this new money to be accounted for on or off-balance sheet?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will recall the allocation last year of &euro;400 million from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy for use in providing social housing.  The difficulty with this proposal was that, under the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal parameters, we were unable to provide and spend this money without breaching the fiscal rules.  Where stands this &euro;400 million?  Is it to be expended or is it still parked and not being brought into use?</p></speech>

It is Exchequer money and, therefore, on-balance sheet.  It is designed because of the obvious difficulty in a number of locations, particularly in the Dublin area, where there is serious potential for building sizeable numbers of houses but the sites are inaccessible because of the requirement for road openings, bridges and whatever else.  The fund is designed to allow local authorities to compete to draw money to open up such sites in order that they can build houses and deal with the supply issue, which, as Deputy Howlin knows, has been the main restriction on people securing homes.  I will revert to the Deputy in respect of the expenditure of the &euro;400 million that was allocated last year.</p></speech>

This money will not be expended until next year.  Is that what the Taoiseach is telling us now?  When it is drawn down, it has to be matched by some percentage of local government money.  What is that percentage?  Where are the local authorities to get that money?  Will only local authorities with the capacity to find matching funding be allowed to draw down that money?</p>  <p>  Taken together during the past week we have seen announcements in the published Estimates of an additional &euro;500 million for health, &euro;200 million for housing, &euro;40 million for policing and an undisclosed sum, yet to be announced, for the Department of Education and Skills.  We have not seen them yet although apparently they are to be debated tomorrow.  How will all of that additional expenditure impact on the expenditure benchmark?  Has a new expenditure benchmark been agreed with Brussels?  If so, what is that benchmark?</p></speech>

Back in April the Government informed the Commission of some adjustments to the Estimates as originally drafted.</p>  <p>  This is on a 75% to 25% basis.  The local authorities will have access to finance borrowing capacity from the Housing Finance Agency.  The work will commence this year and the drawdown of that money will be next year.

Payment will be drawn down then for 2017.  We are in a situation where we have now identified a number of sites, in particular in the greater Dublin area.  It is not within the capacity of local authorities to open up these sites to allow for the construction of sizeable numbers of houses.  For that reason the Government is keen to step in with a competitive fund.  Local authorities will have to demonstrate that if they are looking for &euro;5 million to open site X, it is going to give a return in housing that will reduce the demand and therefore increase the supply.</p></speech>

This is the first opportunity we have had to hear from the Taoiseach directly about how he intends to respond.  The human rights committee found Ireland's laws subjected Amanda Mellet to severe emotional and mental pain and suffering by denying her access to abortion services in Ireland.  It found that ban violated her right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  It is now instructing this State to amend its law on voluntary termination of pregnancy, including if necessary the Constitution, to provide effective timely and accessible procedures for pregnancy termination in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It also wants an assurance that health care providers currently operating can supply full information on safe abortion services, something Irish people thought they had voted for in referendums, but which the Taoiseach's previous Government undermined in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act with criminal sanctions.  That information includes the abortion pill, which is currently being denied to women by doctors because they are fearful of the consequences.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach apologise to Amanda Mellet and commend her on her bravery in going public and exposing her personal situation?  She does not simply want an apology.  She did this for a reason: to bring about legislative change in Ireland not only for her situation but for all women.  She did it to end the hideous practice of sending women out of the country for a health service that they need right here.</p>  <p>  Every time this topic comes up the Taoiseach and his chorus of Ministers wring their hands and utter the refrain that it is highly complex and sensitive, etc.</p><p>Every other EU member state deals with this issue.  Most states around the world deal with it.  People in many of them do not have the luxury of a Ryanair aeroplane out of the country to deal with it.  The states that seem to have the most difficulty in dealing with the issue of abortion tend to be dominated by the Catholic Church, states such as Ireland and Brazil, which is gearing up to punish women even more.  In the case of Ireland, it is simple; we need a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  If the Government does not move very quickly, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and People before Profit will introduce a Bill to do so in the autumn, giving organisations and individuals time to lobby Deputies intensely to campaign for the passage of the Bill.</p> <p> For years the Taoiseach has not listened to women telling him about this human rights abuse.  Will he listen to this international human rights court?  Having been told to move on this issue, is he still seriously suggesting he will continue on with the charade of a citizens' assembly, which is a three-way process to kick it down the road?  I wonder how certain members of the Government are feeling, not the ones of long-standing who have continually voted for this abuse of women but the newer members who have gone very quiet.  Some, we were told, went into the Government to seek the repeal of the eighth amendment, but we have not heard a peep out of them in the past five days.</p></speech>

I would like the Deputy to understand that I listened to the women involved very carefully in the case of the Magdalen laundries, an issue which had gone on for over 60 years and nobody had done anything about it.  I listened to women as part of the LGBT group who expressed the fear, loathing and frustration they felt because of the lack of courage shown by all previous Governments in dealing with the marriage issue.  Together with our colleagues in government, I allowed for the people to make their decision in a referendum.  </p>  <p>  In this case I have read the report and this morning informed the Cabinet that I would bring a memo to the Government next week to initiate the citizens' assembly to which I had committed in the programme for Government to be set up within six months of the Government being formed.  I intend to bring the memo to the Cabinet next week and the first item to be reflected on by the citizens' assembly will be the eighth amendment.  It would be pointless to rush into a constitutional referendum unless there was a realistic consensus on whatever change might be recommended.  It is prudent and proper for ordinary people from around the country, based on geography, gender, age and so on, to be involved in giving their reflections on the issue that has arisen in the Mellet case and many others.  The Deputy is aware that where a woman travels abroad to procure an abortion, the HSE provides post-abortion medical and counselling services and the crisis pregnancy programme also has an input.  I committed in the programme for Government to having a citizens' assembly up and running within six months and we will bring the memo to the Government next week.  Whatever emerges from it will be brought to this House and an Oireachtas committee with access to appropriate expertise.  From this will come recommendations on whether to change.  If there is consensus and people have to vote, they will have the right to vote according to their conscience.  That is a process I do not want to see delayed into the far future, as some people allege.  These are serious and sensitive matters that need to be reflected on.  I will set up the assembly.  Its first point of reflection will be the eighth amendment.</p></speech>

He has spoken about listening to women in the case of the Magdalens - we could argue that one - and in the case of marriage equality but he did not listen to women when Savita Halappanavar died.  At that time, rather than saying it was absolutely necessary to repeal the eighth amendment to protect the health of women, he proceeded to bring in a draconian law of which the likes of Donald Trump would be proud.  He could only dream of imposing a 14-year jail sentence on a woman having an abortion or trying to help another woman have an abortion.  The Taoiseach has said that it would be pointless to rush in but this has been debated and discussed for many years.  Nobody is suggesting that a referendum should take place tomorrow, as it is obvious that there should be a period of debate, but there is already a consensus.  The consensus has always been that the eighth amendment should be removed from the Constitution on the basis that it should never have been included in the first place.  It was sought by one group only.  There has always been a consensus that the citizens' assembly here - the one to which we were all elected in recent months - should legislate following the removal of the eighth amendment.  The only people who are striking a note of discord are the likes of the Taoiseach's Ministers, who are talking about putting something into the Constitution to replace the eighth amendment that would be equally problematic for many years into the future.</p></speech>

My view is that if we were to decide to have a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment in October, it would not be passed.  I will explain why.  There needs to be a real discussion here.  If we are going to attempt to remove this from the Constitution, people will want to know what we intend to replace it with.  I have had problems with this genuine question.  With respect, I do not accept from the Deputy that we should make a rush to judgment in this instance.  The UN committee's verdict in this sensitive and distressing case is non-binding.  It is not like the European court.  It speaks for the distress caused to this good woman.  As the Deputy knows, another case is being processed.  It is right and proper for us to follow the route of having a properly selected citizens' assembly that is able to do its business of reflecting on the eighth amendment and what it might mean.  The assembly will consider what changes, if any, should be made to the eighth amendment and how they might be made.  If we are to ask people to vote on this issue, at least we should be able to tell them what will replace the eighth amendment if they vote for its removal.  People need to know the options and the consequences.  I genuinely believe people have a right to be able to discuss these things.  This matter divided Irish society for over 30 years.  I ask the Deputy to believe me when I say it is not a question of a lack of courage.  It is a question of understanding that the entire population has a responsibility and a role in this regard.  It is not as simple as saying that a referendum should be held to take out the eighth amendment without saying what it will be replaced with.</p></speech>

The changes relate to a correct decision made by the Government which had been prompted by a telephone call made by me to the Chief Whip&rsquo;s office, about an original proposal to have a European directive on country by country reporting on corporate tax requirements transposed into Irish law and the decision by the Standing Order 112 Select Committee on subsidiarity for the D&aacute;il to vote on it today without debate.  This is an important matter to do with dealing with corporate tax evasion and a recommendation of the select committee that we not debate it.  I am glad that the Government conceded, on foot of the representations made by me, to a debate on it tomorrow.  However, the House needs to know that this important issue was not going to be debated.  Everyone needs to understand how significant it is because we are dealing with the controversial and significant issue of country-by-country reporting and attempts by the European Commission to deal with corporate tax evasion.</p></speech>

Caithfimid uilig seasamh go l&aacute;idir in aghaidh an ionsaithe seo.</p>  <p>  On my behalf and on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I want to extend our sincerest and heartfelt sympathy and solidarity to the families and friends of those killed in the despicable act of brutality and hate in Orlando on Sunday.  We in Ireland and people in the USA enjoy an excellent relationship, and Irish people, like people throughout the world, watched in shock and horror the news of those brutal killings and of families being robbed of loved ones - sons, daughters, spouses, colleagues, work mates, parents and siblings.  It is another painful and harrowing reminder of the struggle for gay, lesbian and transgender equality the world over, and the need for all of us to work towards that aim.  Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are going through terrible pain at this time.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; dh&aacute; cheist agam agus ceann amh&aacute;in acu faoi chl&aacute;r an Rialtais and the other about the citizen's assembly, about which the Taoiseach spoke earlier.  Last week the UN Human Rights Committee issued a very stern rebuke to this State and accused us of subjecting Amanda Mellet to discrimination and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  It also criticised us for putting Ms Mellet through the financial and emotional suffering that she endured.  The UN body ordered the Government to compensate Ms Mellet and to ensure she receives the adequate psychological treatment she may need.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm she will be compensated and will receive any psychological treatment she requires?  Can he tell us when the citizen's assembly he has proposed will be established?  The commitment is to do it within six months.  Has the Taoiseach set a date for its first meeting?  Given that other women might find themselves in a similar situation to Ms Mellet, there is an urgency about dealing with this matter.  Can the Taoiseach spell out what consultation will be undertaken with D&aacute;il Members?  The Taoiseach says an alternative needs to be in place, which is fair enough, and while we in Sinn F&eacute;in want to see constitutional change, that is up to the people.  Can the Taoiseach spell out what consultation will be undertaken with D&aacute;il Members, especially around these matters of constitutional change?</p>  <p>  Last week I raised the issue of Moore Street under the programme for Government.</p><p>I specifically asked whether the Minister plans to appeal the High Court judgment to protect the Moore Street national monument.  The Taoiseach said, "The Minister has not decided to appeal the case", but then went on to say: "It is not a matter of wanting to appeal the case.  There is a requirement for clarification."  Will the Taoiseach spell out what is the legal basis of seeking clarification and what is the clarification that is being sought?  His reply has led to public concern, including the concerns of the 1916 relatives who took the court case in the first place.  I share this concern.  It seems to me this could be an appeal by another name.  We all know that in this centenary year of 1916 the public response to all of the centenary events has been very uplifting.  The High Court decision, which should never have had to be made in the first instance, has been widely welcomed.  Will the Taoiseach tell us clearly whether the Government is appealing the High Court judgment?  Can we ensure that any development plans for the area and the Moore Street battlefield site will protect the entire national monument as defined by the High Court?  Will the Taoiseach give us some indication as to when we can expect detailed proposals on the sensible development of this site and its environment?</p></speech>

The Government has 180 days to respond to the finding of the UN Human Rights Committee.  This will require some detailed conversations and discussions between the Office of the Attorney General and the Minister for Health.  This will take place over the next period.  As I said, we have 180 days to respond.  The citizens' assembly will be set up within six months of the date of the formation of the Government.  As I indicated to Deputy Coppinger, I intend to bring a memo to the Government next week to initiate this process.  There will have to be discussions with the D&aacute;il.  I envisage the terms of reference for the assembly would have to be discussed.  In any event, the assembly will have to report back to the D&aacute;il because there will be an Oireachtas committee representative of members, with expertise available to it, to reflect on those propositions, recommendations or whatever the citizens' assembly might bring forward.  Eventually it is this House that will have to make its decision in respect of anything to be done in regard to the eighth amendment if that be so.  I repeat again that on an issue that has been so socially divisive in this country it is not something to be rushed into immediately without a very clear understanding of the nature and scale of consensus that might exist.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Moore Street situation, the Government decided this morning to appeal this case to the Court of Appeal.</p></speech>

This is a 400 page judgment.  It is a complicated judgment.  It is the first time the High Court has ever determined that a national monument be on private property.  It could end up in all kinds of contentious litigation in future.  It certainly requires that the Government, in respect of whoever the Minister with responsibility for national monuments might be in the future, needs to know what it can do and cannot do.  In fact, if one were to proceed ahead now, without the Court of Appeal determining elements of this judgment, one could put at risk the determination of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street with regard to the expenditure being paid out for it and the work being undertaken in terms of restoration.  Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il have legitimate propositions for the development of national monuments.  The vast majority of land in this particular location is privately owned-----</p></speech>

Of course, they have sought advice in respect of its findings.</p><p>People have very strong views about this.  The Minister is anxious to have a consultative forum comprising the people of the area, not just public representatives, and others who have an involvement in this to see what the best way forward is.  I have looked at it from many angles, and in view of the complex nature of the judgment given by the High Court, it is important that this be appealed to the Court of Appeal to straighten out, from the perspective of Government, the road ahead regarding national monuments, how one determines them, what one can do with them and whether one has to apply for permission for every single item from here on that will apply to every national monument around the country or whatever.

These crimes must be condemned for what they were, namely, appalling hate crimes against LGBT people.  Great progress has been made in recent decades in the western world as we have moved towards a vindication of full citizenship for all people but the horrific events of Saturday night remind us of the need to avoid complacency.  Research in Ireland tells us that one third of LGBT people have been physically or sexually attacked and half have been harassed in the past five years.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of these attacks go unreported.  Only 17 homophobic incidents were registered on the Garda PULSE system in 2013.  Now is therefore the time for the national LGBT strategy, which examines all the needs of this community in Ireland, from tackling hate crimes and workplace discrimination to meeting the needs of older LGBT people and continuing to reform our education system to stamp out discrimination at all levels.  I hope the events of recent times will spur us to move with absolute determination on that agenda.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend my sympathy and the solidarity of my party to all those affected by the weekend's events in Orlando.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise two issues on the Order of Business.  Earlier today, together with our spokesperson on the arts, Deputy Burton, I met a cross-representative group of the arts community, people who are working directly in the arts in Ireland, to discuss Culture 2025.  We have had the opportunity to build on the legacy of decades of commemorations.  We have the opportunity now to produce an enduring and a lasting roadmap to build and copper-fasten culture at the heart of everything we do.  To make this a reality, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the draft Culture 2025 document be submitted, before it is adopted, to the joint Oireachtas committee so there can be buy-in by all parties and representatives in this House regarding that really important matter.</p>  <p>  Like the Taoiseach, I will be travelling to the UK later this week to advocate that citizens in the UK with Irish connections vote to remain.  We know, and I will not rehearse again, the importance of this issue for this country.  However, I am growing more anxious.  I see the opinion polls today and the endorsement of one of the major newspapers in the UK for a Brexit strategy.  I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach to update the House or at least, maybe privately, leaders of groups on Cabinet thinking and the Government's preparedness should there be an unfortunate exit vote in the next ten days in the UK so that we can be assured that the interests of this country are fully and completely safeguarded whatever way the people of Britain vote.</p></speech>

There were multiple murders by Mr. Mateen in Orlando where 49 people were killed and 53 wounded at a night club.  On behalf of the Irish people, I have sent a letter to President Obama indicating our solidarity with the American people and Government in the matter.  I unreservedly condemn the latest appalling incident in the United States.  That it occurred in the Pulse night club, a meeting place for the LGBT community, sends its own particular cowardly statement.  I take to heart Deputy Brendan Howlin's point about discrimination here and the issues that still must be addressed following the marriage equality referendum and other issues relevant to the LGBT community.  We will follow through on them.</p> <p> I am happy for the draft culture report to be sent to the Oireachtas committee.  It is a good suggestion.</p> <p> I thank the Members of different parties who have travelled to Britain and Northern Ireland to make comments on Brexit.  The result will depend on the turnout and whether people are sufficiently interested to vote on the issue.  The evidence from many exporting firms here is that a Brexit would have a serious impact on this country in terms of competitiveness, efficiency, export capacity and so on.  I will be happy to brief Opposition leaders.  If the British electorate decide to leave the European Union, Ireland will not be leaving it.  We have a very clear position on the issue.  Ireland will continue to operate as a member of the European Union and speak, act and work in the interests of developing its potential.  If Britain decides to leave the European Union, I will be very disappointed.  It is very much in the interests of this country and Northern Ireland that Britain remain a strong and central member of the European Union.  I hope, as people who intend to vote reflect on the issue in the coming days, that they will decide to vote to remain in the European Union.  There are issues that need to be addressed.  If Britain decides to stay, the agreement reached with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and the other 27 member states will be implemented forthwith.  If it decides to leave, these issues will fall, given that they are a one-off.  Ireland has linked its future with the euro, the eurozone and the European Union by virtue of the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty a number of years ago.  Lessons can be learned here about the necessity for change and the capacity of political leaders to effect change in the European Union in the interests of everybody.</p></speech>

We wish to show our solidarity with the LGBT community in the United States and internationally.  We echo the view in the LGBT community that this should be an occasion on which to show unity and solidarity among ordinary people and that there should be no racist or Islamophobic response.  It is more important than ever that the fight against homophobia which, unfortunately, affects all societies be stepped up in a serious way.</p>  <p>  I refer to the export of Irish greyhounds to Macau.</p><p>It continues apace and is a virtual death sentence for the dogs.  In Macau dogs that are not winners and that get injured are put down.  As a result of the death sentence on them, the Australian state recently banned the export of its dogs there.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, people here are campaigning for a similar ban, which would be right and proper.  Shame should not be brought on this country by the export of dogs to Macau for racing and to be killed.

Last year the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that the Macroom bypass project had been included in the six-year capital investment programme.  For which of the six years is it scheduled?  County Kerry is greatly hampered in the creation of jobs and we cannot attract indigenous or foreign investment because of the lack of infrastructure, especially for access.  The broadband service is practically non-existent.  If one gets off an aeroplane at Farranfore Airport and travels one mile either way on the three roads out of Farranfore, there is no mobile phone coverage.  To ensure fair play for the people of County Kerry, when will the Government provide the necessary funding for the Macroom bypass project?</p></speech>

This issue has been raised on many occasions.  Planning permission has been granted for the project which is part of the capital programme, as is the Adare bypass project.  A review is pending, in 2018, as the Deputy will be aware.  I cannot answer on the detail of where the projects stand today.  Planning permission has been granted for the Ballyvourney to Macroom project which is important and essential, while work is proceeding on the design and planning issues in respect of the Adare bypass project.  They are both included in the capital programme and we hope they can be expedited as quickly as possible.  We do not like to see any county, particularly the Kingdom, being, as the Deputy might say, "discriminated against" in the context of job creation.

Our sympathy and hearts go out to the community in Orlando, particularly the LGBT community.</p>  <p>  Last Thursday on the Order of Business I asked a question about the massive hike in waste charges.  I asked for a response which I have not yet received.  I raise this issue because it entails secondary legislation.  Last January we were told by then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, that the new charging regime, based on pay-by-weight, would result in savings for 87% of people.  However, far from this, we now have a situation where the vast majority are faced with an increase in the standing charge of up to &euro;100 a year before they put out a bin at all, as well as significant increases in the pay-by-weight system being introduced.  It is clear that the waste companies are operating a cartel.  When the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government moves to introduce regulations to prevent charging for green bin collections, will he also ensure restrictions are placed on waste companies in increasing standing charges which represent a stealth tax for many, especially older people who generate little waste?  The regime flies in the face of the polluter pays principle and will result in a significant increase in the cost of living for many families.  Will the Minister give a commitment that he will move to prevent waste companies from increasing the standing charge?  Will he, as a matter of urgency, call in the waste companies and instruct them to stop this approach?</p></speech>

He will, therefore, be in touch with her.

It said, "It is all about love".  I thought of those lines that every Irish married couple know from the letter to the Corinthians that "Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always [trusts, always protects,] always hopes, always perseveres".  That was the mood at the vigil last night, but love might need a bit of a helping hand because it seems our world at the moment is full of people who are evil and who are willing, all too easily, to dishonour others, people who are self-seeking, easily angered and keep a record of wrongs.  I was thinking of the words the Ceann Comhairle uses at the start of every day here, namely, "that every word and work of ours" may start with and end with love, in how we deal with migration, the economy, international affairs and how we stand up for our gay friends and colleagues in everything we do.  It is about equality.  We stand for love in this House against the evil we saw at the weekend.</p></speech>

It is an important one that goes to the heart of an issue that affects many low paid workers in this State.  The Taoiseach will be aware that a report was commissioned by the previous Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on "if and when" contracts.  The exploitation of people on low hour contracts, especially in the retail sector but across many other sectors, is an important issue.  This Bill will allow workers to apply for a contract that is reflective of their actual working week.  Unfortunately, we have far too many instances of workers who were on 15-hour contracts for perhaps ten years working 30 hours and 40 hours week in, week out.  This is a way for companies to exploit their workers.  The Taoiseach has often asked us to put forward solutions to problems.  This Bill offers a solution.  At some point we will move this Bill in Private Members' time and I hope the Taoiseach will support it..  I appeal to him and to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to read the Bill.  It is earnest in its intent and has the support of many trades unions.  I believe it would fix a problem which affects many low paid workers and workers who are on low hour contracts in this State.  </p></speech>

It last met on 8 October 2015.  The new Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Housing, as committed to in the programme for a partnership Government, to deal with the challenges around housing, homelessness and mortgage arrears.  Reflecting the priority that the Government attaches to these issues, this committee is meeting on a weekly basis in its early phase of work.  It has met five times to date on 12, 20 and 26 May and on 2 and 9 June.  The committee is scheduled to meet again tomorrow, Wednesday, 15 June.</p></reply>

I asked him how could low income families hope to pay increasing rents and other bills, but he did not answer that question.  My view is that he did not answer because he does not have an answer.  Regarding the dreadful situation in which people, through no fault of their own, have found themselves, as the Taoiseach said earlier, we must not only talk about addressing it but the Government must take action.  I am trying to grapple with the role of the committee in dealing with some of these matters.  </p>  <p>  I also want to comment on the plan announced today to give up to &euro;200 million to local authorities to build infrastructure on sites already in the hands of the private developers.  Was that planned?  Was it discussed by the Cabinet Committee on Construction 2020, Housing, Planning and Mortgage Arrears?  If so, we need to be told if developers sitting on undeveloped land will be required to pass on the savings in infrastructure to either private house buyers or local authorities.  Citizens also need to know if the sites developed with public funds will have social and affordable clauses in order to address the severe housing needs of low to middle income households.  Will the Government insert clear conditionality into this capital investment in order to ensure that the return benefits society as a whole, particularly those in housing difficulties and not just the speculators, the profiteers and the land hoarders?</p></speech>

The programme for Government provides for increases to rent supplement and housing assistance payments, HAP, by up to 15%, taking into account geographic regions.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and his officials are working on that.  It is important to note that the Department of Social Protection currently operates a targeted policy that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the existing limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  More than 8,500 have been assisted under this scheme  so far and anybody who finds themselves under that pressure is entitled to contact the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p> The programme also provides for expanded access to a tenancy sustainable protocol throughout the country.  With regard to the HAP, limits were increased in Cork, Galway, Kildare and Meath where flexibility allows for a 20% payment above rent supplement thresholds.  For families in emergency accommodation in Dublin city, the HAP payments will be allowed for 50% above rent supplement levels.  </p>  <p>  We have also committed to maintaining relief for landlords who lease to tenants who are in receipt of social housing supports like rent supplement or the housing assistance payment, and they can avail of 100% mortgage interest relief on their borrowings where they commit to accommodating tenants in receipt of those payments for a minimum period of three years.  In addition, from 1 January 2016, a landlord cannot discriminate against a person in receipt of rent supplement, housing assistance payment or any payment under the Social Welfare Acts.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Deputy's second question, there will be a requirement for social housing on those sites.</p><p>I point out to Deputy Adams that it is not infrastructure on the sites; it is infrastructure to access the sites, be it roads or bridges as the case might be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400019#R00200"><p>We have been very clear as a political party that the housing and homelessness emergency is the No. 1 priority which must be addressed by this Oireachtas.  Hence, I support strongly and pay tribute to the special committee on housing which was chaired by Deputy John Curran and which is completing its work this week.  It will present its work on Friday.  What we have here is an inclusive, a comprehensive and an energetic process which raises the issues and points towards solutions.  In that context, I advise some misgivings about the tendency towards and disturbing signs of a return to the old days of policy by leak whereby Ministers plant stories in the media rather than to engage in constructive discussion.  We need to avoid that as it can cause damage as it did in the past number of years.  We do not need a new strategy every three months.  If there is buy-in from all sides of the House to the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on housing and homelessness, what we need then is an implementation plan on those recommendations.  Therefore, regarding the &euro;200 million that has been announced now, it is essential that whatever is said fits within the overall full policy approach.  However, I must say following the contribution of the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on Leaders' Questions, it appears it is not new money at all.  It is a bit longer put out than one is led to believe from the statements.</p>  <p>  When we met the housing officials during the meetings with Independents prior to the formation of a Government, there seemed to be a distinct ideological resistance to building council houses.  That needs to stop and we need to build them.  It can represent the most effective and speedy way to get some housing stock back within the possession of the State apart altogether from purchasing housing and so on.  Down through the decades, some great schemes were built which have left an indelible and positive impact on our communities.  For whatever reason, there is a sense of inertia and reluctance to build council housing, which is an approach we need to change in order to start providing them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400019#R00300"><p>I commend Deputy Curran for chairing the Oireachtas committee.  I do not yet know what is in his report but, believe me, it will be a very welcome addition to set of propositions which have come now from the different Departments with responsibility in this area to the Minister for housing, planning and local government.  These are the Departments of housing, planning and local government, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport, all of which feed into the development of the strategy the Minister is putting together.  Deputy Curran's committee's recommendations will be very gratefully received in that regard.  I hope that the Minister for housing, planning and local government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is in a position to bring his draft strategy, an action plan for housing, to the Cabinet sub-committee by the end of the month and that we can develop it into a formal strategy, debate it here and, more importantly, implement it.</p>  <p>  On the &euro;200 million, which is double what was committed in the programme for Government for infrastructure development for access to sites, work there will start immediately and the first draw down will take place in 2017.  I agree with Deputy Martin that obviously the practice of building houses by local authorities has drifted over the years.  It seemed to morph into the approved housing bodies, which would build houses, but obviously if tenants acquire those houses they can never buy them in the way the Department of the Environment used to provide through the scheme for tenant purchase every number of years so that they could own their own houses.  The Minister has already called all the chief executives of the local authorities together and given them their targets and response times.  He needs to know what it is they are going to do to start building houses for tenants.  He has already made comments that if this does not happen, he is quite prepared to move project managers onto sites to see that it does.  This is all about the supply of houses which is the great challenge when one now sees so much commercial activity going on around the country.  The housing construction sector has not been able to respond for a variety of reasons.  That is now being addressed.  I hope Deputy Curran's report on Friday will include some practical recommendations that will be of value here.</p></speech>

No matter how much talk we hear from the Government or how many announcements, of which there are many, are made, it just gets worse.  This week, I had a woman come into me who had a stroke three years ago, is partially paralysed, suffered a septic aneurysm and septicaemia recently, has epilepsy and is deaf in one ear.  Her husband is her carer and they have been living in a car for the last four months.  Another case involves a woman with mental health difficulties going to Cluain Mhuire.  Her child has been put into care with her mother in order that she would be able to get on the single-persons emergency housing list.  She lives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and is told she has to accept a hostel in town, away from her family support network, or find HAPS.  Both of these people, and they are just two examples, have no chance of getting HAPS - none, zero.  We put a proposal to the local authority that it would set up a specific team to support people like this in finding HAPS, which they cannot find.  The CEO of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown just said "I am not doing it, full stop", even though a motion had been passed.  Why not?  If one believes in HAPS, the least one could do is ensure that teams are put in place to go out and find HAPS for people like that instead of them having to live in cars.  I ask for that to happen.</p>  <p>  Even if one does that, the average rent for a three-bedroom house in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is now &euro;2,200 a month.  Even with the flexibility the Government is providing on HAPS, it is nowhere near enough.  Forget it.  There is no chance that HAPS is going to work.  Of the 110,000 housing units the Government proposes to deliver, 75,000 are HAPS.  It is not going to happen in D&uacute;n Laoghaire at all.  That fantasy has to be dispelled with.  I appeal to the Taoiseach in that regard because I will not even say what one might as well tell someone who is sick, old, disabled or paralysed as to tell him or her to go out and find HAPS.  It is a nightmare that the Government is offering such people.  How is the Taoiseach going to get rents down from &euro;2,200 if he is depending on the private sector?  It is twice the cost of an average mortgage that people are being asked to pay.  It is not just a question of rent certainty.  We must go further than Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal.  There must be rent control that is linked to affordability.  This is impossible.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked the valid question as to how rents will come down.  The answer is to deal with supply.  The more houses one has, the less pressure there is on the housing stock whereby rents increase.  The Government is committed to providing extensive student accommodation which every year takes up a couple of thousand spaces in apartments or other accommodation in the larger urban areas in particular.</p><p>The Government sees as an absolute priority the provision of social housing and private sector housing so that one can deal with the situation where so many people do not have access to housing and where one is required, by virtue of numbers, to bring in schemes that have helped over 10,000 people now to be able to stay in the accommodation that they are in by virtue of the housing assistance payments or the increased rent subsidy.</p> <p> I take the point that the Deputy raises about the scale of rent levels in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or in other locations, particularly in Dublin, but this is an issue that is being discussed both by the Cabinet sub-committee and by the relevant Departments.  Hopefully, all of that will come together in the action plan for housing, which I expect the Minister will be able to publish within the 100 days that he set out.  It will take into account the question of the recommendations from the Oireachtas housing committee and from the other Departments and other people from around the country who have raised very practical suggestions as to how this particular challenge can be met.  I hope that everybody working together can deal with this in the coming period.  It will not happen in six months, but once one gets a stream coming through where houses are being built, where people know they are going to be accommodated, it provides the opportunity to deal with it once and for all.</p></speech>

The &euro;500 million in additional funding, which is welcome, will not deal with anything other than just keeping the system upright.  It will not address the core issues of funding for new services or improvements in existing ones, the availability of new drug treatments, staff recruitment, etc.  According to the delayed report from the HSE in respect of January and February, 2,700 patients aged over 75 years spent more than 24 hours on trolleys in emergency departments.  In my constituency, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital still scores among the top three hospitals with the longest trolley waiting times.  Some 9,381 patients were on trolleys, an increase on last year and double the March 2008 figure.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether Cabinet sub-committees deal with the next issue I will raise, but how could they if they are not meeting?  The Taoiseach regularly denies in the House that there is a moratorium on recruitment.  However, in a letter from the HSE to Sinn F&eacute;in's health spokesperson, Deputy O'Reilly, the author wrote that a temporary recruitment pause was in place.  That is a moratorium.  We can play with fancy words and games of Scrabble with all of this, but in the meantime the patients suffer.</p>  <p>  Another major issue is one that has been in the news recently, that of the availability of immune therapy treatments to cancer patients.  Recently, I told the Taoiseach about a constituent of mine who had been on a clinical trial since 2013.  She is now in remission, so her story is a very good one, but others are not receiving these treatments.  Negotiations are under way, but has the Minister placed a timeframe on them?  If the drug companies do not respond in a satisfactory way, will the Government use the 2013 legislation to set the price of drugs unilaterally?</p>  <p>  I will ask my final question, since we are trying to work in a new mode.  Will the Taoiseach clarify when the Minister for Health is expected to provide more details on finalising his proposals on the necessary expansion in bed capacity in services for the forthcoming autumn and winter periods?</p></speech>

These include reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund with a more targeted implementation; the examination of whether minor injuries units and clinics can have their opening hours extended; to establish an all-party Oireachtas committee to develop a long-term vision for health care, for which I understand he has been given approval by the parties; to establish a youth mental health commission, which will link with the action in the Civil Service renewal programme; launch a review of A Vision for Change; publish a national obesity strategy; restore the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill to the Order Paper; finalise the cancer strategy paper; look at the question of starting the planning for a cystic fibrosis unit in Beaumont; progress emergency departments in Galway and in Beaumont; and look at other issues like cardiac care in Waterford and so on.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has now increased by &euro;500 million the allocation to health.  This is &euro;800 million more than just over a year ago.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has raised this on many occasions.  It represents an increase of 6% in spending.  I wish to make it clear that it is not possible for any Minister to continue to go to that well as if nothing ever happened, so those people who are in charge of management of hospitals and who have budgets to manage had better understand that we cannot have a situation arising when there are no further Supplementary Estimates available to meet them.  There has to be effectiveness in terms of the way taxpayers' money is being spent.</p>  <p>  These are all very important cases, but everywhere I go, I hear the same story - that one can manage the impact of the moneys being allocated to a much greater extent in the interests of the patient.  I hope that the allocation given last week of &euro;500 million extra for the health area will, in the words of the HSE, stabilise this position and will allow for the very best level of treatment to be given to patients.  I have to say that the vast majority of people that I meet, once they go through the health system, have nothing but words of commendation and praise for those who work in the service.  It is always the blockages in the accident and emergency units or the waiting lists that cause all of the difficulties, and there are ways of dealing with these.  I hope that in a situation where the Minister for Health is now speaking to each of the managers in the hospitals, particularly the acute hospitals, there will be an understanding here of getting the best effect in the interests of the patient for the moneys that have been allocated.</p>  <p>  We do need to look at the reforms that are necessary in the health area in general, of which there are many.  I hope that with the approval of parties in the House, we can focus on a ten-year strategy and a vision for the health service.  Where do we want Ireland to be in terms of its health service in 2026?  Issues to be addressed include a growing population, an aging population, more home care packages, more primary care centres and more community-based facilities for people who should not have to go to hospital in the first place.</p>  <p>  There are so many things that need to be worked on here.  I have allocated, with the approval of Government, four Ministers of State to the Minister for Health dealing with specific areas like mental health, obesity, the national drugs strategy and another issue - it escapes me at the moment - so that, in the interests of dealing with what is an enormous challenge for the country, I hope that we can get best effect out of what is now a budget in excess of &euro;14 billion.</p></speech>

Over a sustained period it brought down inpatient waiting lists for adults to six months and for children down to three months.  It was, however, more than a matter of the allocation of funding which was obviously very important; it also involved a new way of dealing with waiting lists in public hospitals, through utilising excess capacity in the private sector, in addition to using capacity within the public hospital sector effectively to reduce waiting lists.  There is a great opportunity for the new Minister to achieve real action if he draws on the expertise that was available under the older treatment purchase scheme.  There was a reluctance about this proposal on the part of some on the Fine Gael side during the talks on the facilitation of a minority Government and only &euro;15 million was allocated, but more than that sum will be needed over time.  Believe me - the method proved to be very effective in ring-fencing funding that went directly to the patient waiting on a list.  We got rid of the era in which people were waiting for two or three years for a hip or cataract operation, for example.</p>  <p>  My third point on the Cabinet sub-committee is related to drugs pricing and the policy on the pharmaceutical industry.  On the one hand, we encourage pharmaceutical companies to come here through foreign direct investment initiatives and say we want Ireland to become a centre of pharmaceutical activity, industry and research, while, on the other, we have in recent years been very poor on new drugs and technologies and having a proper model for thelm.</p></speech>

No one knows where we stand on this issue.  The recent developments in the use of Pembro and new cancer drugs were unacceptable.  The new Minister did respond, but, unfortunately, his predecessor did not, despite the pharmacoeconomic unit having agreed as far back as last February to the release of Pembro.  We need a proper policy on new drugs and technologies.  It is essential.  We need a coherent attitude on the part of the Government to the pharmaceutical industry and new drugs and technologies.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment.</p></speech>

I was given to understand it was the only autism-specific primary school in Cork.  They were the parents of 60 children, some of whom are autistic and some of whom have learning disabilities, allergies, epilepsy and sensory and behavioural health issues.  They explained that the teachers and special needs assistants were brilliant but that there were no more resources available.  There are no speech and language therapists in the school, nor is there an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist or a nurse.  The parents have been thrown from Billy to Jack, or between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, for a considerably long time.  They have got so tired of this that they have brought the matter to their local Deputies and I am bringing it to the attention of the Taoiseach today.  My question is simply this: what is intended to be done for the parents connected with Cara junior school and their children and also for parents and children in similar circumstances throughout the State?  Those affected in Cara junior school are not alone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400021#T00800"><p>That is a question to be raised as a Topical Issue when I am quite sure the Minister would give the Deputy a detailed response.  This morning, on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and Skills, the Government approved a further allocation of over 800 special needs assistants, bringing the number to 12,900, the highest number ever.  There will, I believe, be a need for a further 115 next year.  However, it is not just a case of making appointments of special needs assistants, whose job it is to look after the physical needs of children; it is also a case of dealing with the intervention process and meeting the needs of children at a much earlier stage.  These requirements could be related to speech and language therapy services or psychological services.  There could be a range of other needs.  In making provision for what is a very extensive number of special needs assistants the Minister has commissioned, through the National Council for Special Education, an analysis of the outcome of expenditure and the numbers employed in this area.  In other words, can more be done?  Should there be a different intervention at an earlier time, or has it just become a call that the special needs assistant is a very important entity, which is the case?  Should something be done at an earlier date?  I do not know the details of the case the Deputy mentioned, but I am quite sure the Minister would respond to him.  </p>  <p>  The priority is to focus on universal health care and have it provided through home care packages, community facilities and primary care centres and to keep people out of hospital when they do not have to be there.</p>  <p>  The Minister has set out his stall on waiting lists and trolleys in emergency departments.  I do not see why we cannot have in the public health sector diagnostic centres that would be the match of anything provided in the private sector.  Some time ago I opened a privately run unit that is open from 7 a.m. until midnight, with two facilities operating in parallel all day, every day.  The number of scans that can be carried out is enormous.  There is no reason, in endoscopy units and the public health system, we cannot have really effective diagnostic capacity and centres that do not close at 5 p.m.  If we are serious about having an impact on waiting lists of individuals awaiting scans, we should be able to achieve this in the public sector also.  There is spare capacity in many hospitals where consultants and doctors could see patients not on their own waiting lists in order to make progress.</p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made a point about drugs.  This is important.  The Minister has made it perfectly clear that the trend has been to leave the decision, or the perception of it, to the Minister for Health of the day.  Some weeks ago I listened to Dr. Barry talking on the radio about the reasons clinicians turned down a drug based on its effectiveness.  It is at the clinical level that the discussion needs to take place.  The clinical discussions on the effect on quality of life, at the cost level set by the companies, have to be dealt with in the first place by those who know what they are talking about in terms of the clinical outcomes and clinical analysis of the drug in question.  The Government decides afterwards whether it can provide the funding for many of them.  We know that in the next ten years there will be a range of as yet unpatented drugs to treat particularly challenging conditions.  They will be very expensive.  The Minister is clear that the discussions should, in the first instance, be between those who can carry out a clinical analysis of the impact of drug X or Y on the quality of life of a patient.  If that is determined, the Department and the Minister can, on behalf of the Government, decide to act.  Deputy MIche&aacute;l Martin's point is valid, but I have outlined where the discussion should occur in the first instance.</p></speech>

I do not know if this matter was discussed by the Cabinet committee on justice reform.</p>  <p>  I am also concerned to learn that the Minister for Justice and Equality has failed to act on a recommendation made to her by the Garda Commissioner on 19 May to refer allegations about Sergeant Maurice McCabe to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  While the allegations may have been referred to GSOC in the intervening period, I would like to find out if the matter has been dealt with.  Last Wednesday the Minister confirmed in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on justice, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that she had not yet made the referral.  She also indicated that the Garda Commissioner had provided her with more detailed information.  What is this information?</p></speech>

The lack of action and inertia within government and the system in general in the past while have been somewhat disturbing.  I met representatives of a north inner city group approximately one month ago in the context of the appalling gangland crime in the area.  Much of the conversation and discussion focused on the impact on young people, the lack of a co-ordinated policy initiative in areas such as the north inner city and the withdrawal of many supports, including concerns that Tusla would reduce funding for the young people's facilities and services fund introduced by my party in government more than a decade ago.  </p>  <p>  They also referred to the Misuse of Drugs Act and noted that prescription drugs were the drugs of choice in the locality where young people were earning large amounts from distributing them.  However, the Garda has told the group that its hands are tied in terms of being able to do anything about it.  While I welcome the decision to earmark legislation to tackle this issue, why has it taken so long?  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall has confirmed that the issue was raised three years ago when she was a Minister of State in the Department of Health and that it was crying out to be dealt with at the time.  With the new configuration in the D&aacute;il in the aftermath of the general election, one gets a sense of urgency on some of these issues, but one must ask why there has been such a delay in amending the Misuse of Drugs Act to deal with a critical issue that is causing death and destruction and the disruption of local communities.  </p>  <p>  Likewise, in respect of proposals for a mini-Criminal Assets Bureau, community activists and organisers on the ground identified this issue some time ago.  However, it has taken the recent murders to witness legislative action on that front, which begs the question as to why there has been such a delay and a sense of inertia at the heart of justice policy.  </p>  <p>  While I do not wish to pre-empt the decision of the Minister on the matter, my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, has a progressive and constructive parole Bill before the House.  I would like the Government to examine the legislation constructively with a view to signalling its support for it.  The purpose of the Bill is to depoliticise the process of parole, modernise the statutory basis for parole and give the process greater objectivity.  This is the type of constructive legislation that should garner approval across the House. </p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Policing Authority has the necessary breadth and depth of powers required to discharge its functions?</p></speech>

The Bill has quite some merit and while there may be issues the Government and the Minister will discuss, the Government will not oppose it.</p>  <p>  If the independent Policing Authority requires further powers or instruments, I am sure the Government will want to see to it that it can do its job completely independently.  The authority has set its standard already in this regard.  It has been very clear on where it sees the path ahead and has had engagement with the Garda Commissioner.  I am sure that if the chairperson and members of the authority find that their powers are restricted in some way, the Minister, on behalf of the Government, will be happy to engage with it. </p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked about the delay in introducing legislation to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act.  On 31 May the Minister for Justice and Equality briefed the Government on measures to tackle organised crime in the north inner city and elsewhere.  At the meeting the Minister for Health offered to expedite the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill which had originally been scheduled to be introduced in the autumn of 2016.  The Bill was being prepared on the basis of Government decisions resulting from the so-called Bederev challenge to section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and Statutory Instrument No. 180/2010 and 2042 of 15 December 2015 on the establishment of supervised injecting facilities for chronic drug users.  The Minister decided to truncate and bring forward a shortened version of the Bill, which will deal with a range of drugs, namely, Z-drugs and so-called "Clockwork Orange" substances.  I also have a list of names that are difficult to pronounce, including hallucinogenic drugs, zopiclone, zaleplon, lizdexamfetamine and phenazapam, all of which are being dealt with. </p></speech>

I want to meet public representatives of all parties separately.  I am visiting the area this evening to meet community leaders and local people to hear what they have to say and understand their needs, concerns and demands as to how they think the general issue and general position on infrastructure, facilities, education, opportunities, training, apprenticeships, investment, dealing with drug trafficking, the sale and position of drugs outside the local cr&egrave;che and whatever else can be dealt with.  This is separate from the Garda Commissioner's commitment to have a specific task force with links with the community to deal with crime in Dublin.  Garda&iacute;, school principals and community leaders have great experience and a great deal to offer in trying to put this together.  I hope that, following my meeting with community leaders this evening, we will be able to engage with public representatives from the area to try to put together a strategy that will be backed by investment which will make a difference to the communities and people of the north inner city.</p></speech>

He may have got the wrong advice on the date or timing for Priority Questions.  I have to say I know nothing about it, but certainly it would not have been deliberate on anyone's part.  I fully understand if he was not prepared and I thank him for submitting the questions.</p>  <p>  The second issue is the question of free travel.  I was advised that it was a matter for another Department.  I have no problem whatsoever in answering questions on free travel.  However, if I am advised that it is more suitable for another Department, I will refer it.  I will look at the matter in more detail for the next time to see if it is appropriate.  I would be happy to address it but if the Department of Social Protection wishes to take it, that is fair enough by me as well.  Deputy Troy may ask me supplementary questions about it another time and I will try to address them, if he gives me a little notice.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and operation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  TII looked at a range of short-term and longer-term measures to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency on the M50.  This was published in its M50 demand management study in April 2014.  At my predecessor's request, TII undertook further analysis last year to identify a mix of measures to improve operational efficiency.  Since the M50 upgrade, annual traffic growth on the M50 has continued, especially with renewed economic growth.  Over 140,000 vehicles a day are now using the busiest sections.</p>  <p>  Since this analysis, TII, in conjunction with stakeholders, has been progressing several short-term measures.  These include changes to junction layouts to optimise use of lanes.  Changes at the N3 and M50 junction and the Dublin Airport and M1 junction have been performing well and similar layouts will be provided between the M1 and N3 junctions over the coming months.  New signage to direct diversions has been erected on an agreed route between the N3 and N2 and this will be extended shortly.</p>  <p>  The motorway traffic control centre has been enhanced and the number of incident response vehicles has been increased, resulting in an average response time of 15 minutes.  The working group set up by TII to strengthen co-ordination includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin Fire Brigade and local authorities and continues to enhance incident management and communication.</p>  <p>  My predecessor approved a proposal to progress work on variable speed limits with a view to smoothing peak-time traffic flows.  TII has established a project team to manage design and procurement, which is estimated to take 36 months.</p>  <p>  Public transport initiatives such as reopening the Phoenix Park tunnel and commencing services on the Luas cross city line in 2017 will provide alternative options to the car.  The Government's capital plan provides for significant investment in enlargement of the public service obligation bus fleet.  The NTA transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2016-35 envisages a core orbital bus network to ensure more trips are undertaken by public transport.</p></speech>

I will engage with him on the other question.</p>  <p>  The Minister has agreed that traffic congestion has a negative effect on people's lives, including stress as a result of getting in to work late and reducing quality family time.  It has a negative impact on economic activity too.  It is important to have more than what the Minister referred to, which are short-term measures.  I am more interested in hearing about the long-term strategic policy decisions taken by the Department to ensure free flow on the M50.</p>  <p>  The Minister alluded to changes to junctions and the fact that there are greater numbers of vehicles and response times.  Earlier this year there was an accident on the M50.  As a consequence, not only was the M50 blocked up but there was gridlock throughout the greater Dublin area.  To be fair, I do not believe the Minister has outlined or articulated exactly how he plans to deal with this in a strategic manner over the coming year or two years.</p>  <p>  The Minister alluded to something that may take 36 months and which is going to tender now.  I did not understand that.  Will the Minister elaborate further on that point?</p></speech>

He has made a good point about there being less long-term thinking than short-term thinking - I think that is the point he is making.  That is apparent probably in the plans made by the two bodies, the NTA and TII, to which I referred.  There is a need on the part of the Department, myself and, in particular, the bodies run by me in this Department to have a better long-term vision.  I am going to require a better long-term vision from them.  This is reflected in some ways by what I offered Deputy Troy today, including certain variable speed limits and various high-speed ways of addressing problems.</p><p>However, we need to address the problem of 140,000 cars on the M50 every day.  We need to address the problems which are much wider, which are being met by metro north, the port tunnel and other areas, and which are to divert people from their motor cars and bring them to public transport.</p></speech>

It is a good question and there is quite a lot behind what she has to say about the disabled.  I will answer first of all about the improvements and then I will suggest what I think.  I acknowledge that much remains to be done.</p>  <p>  Accessibility improvements to public transport services are being advanced in the context of my Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005, Transport Access for All.</p>  <p>  The plan sets out a series of policy objectives and targets for accessible public transport across all modes and significant progress has been achieved in recent years.  Transport Access for All was first published in 2006 and updated in 2012.  It is scheduled for review and update in 2016-17.</p>  <p>  The sectoral plan is premised on the principle that through accessibility improvements to the public transport system for people with disabilities, access for all people will be improved.  This is being done as extensively as possible having regard to the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  My Department funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade existing public transport infrastructure and facilities.  This includes funding in 2016 for accessibility upgrade works at a number of rail stations, including Connolly Station, for accessible bus stops and bus stations, and for a wheelchair accessible taxi grant scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition measures to provide for full accessibility is built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage and newer systems, such as the Luas, are fully accessible.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to the NTA for a rolling programme of bus replacement and refurbishment of the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO fleets both in the greater Dublin area and nationally.  This has enabled 100% of the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets to be wheelchair accessible, as well as approximately 65% of Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches, which are wheelchair accessible by lift, and this will increase as the coach fleet is replaced.</p></speech>

Are they existing Department plans or are they the Minister's new additional plans?  The previous Department plans had widespread deficiencies, as we know.  Disability access is one area of the Minister's new portfolio where he could really make a difference.  I had thought initially that I had two minutes to speak on that and I was going to outline examples of people who, owing to lack of accessibility to public transport, end up spending the day making what would normally be a one-hour journey.  On the buses, for example, wheelchair users are being told on an almost daily basis that the drivers are not qualified to operate the lifts and wheelchair users are being left by the side of the road as the public transport bus drives off without them-----</p></speech>

My understanding is the Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are all accessible.  The Deputy is correct that the ones outside the city fleet are not universally accessible.  We might have been at cross-purposes on that.  I take her point; it is one of the gaps that is not acceptable.  Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches are in a similar situation; they are not accessible.  Those gaps will need to be bridged.</p>  <p>  There are other areas that I have only really discovered since I researched the Deputy's question.  I have to admit I was under the impression that things were rather better than they were until I started to research her question over the weekend.  There are other areas, particularly on the railways, which she did not touch on, where there is a huge gap in the accessibility for disabled people.  I gather that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is slowly carrying out a limited programme that is enabling some disabled people to access stations by making them wheelchair friendly.</p>  <p>  There are other areas that concern me, which the Deputy has not mentioned.  There is a huge gap with commercial vehicles.  The commercial vehicles do not seem to be up to the same standard for wheelchair accessibility as are the State vehicles. </p></speech>

As he will be aware, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has a statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop Dublin Airport, including by providing the infrastructure necessary to meet existing and future demand.  The north runway project falls into this category.  The DAA was granted planning permission for this project in 2007 and announced its intention to proceed with it in April 2016.  While I have not yet had an opportunity to meet representatives of the DAA to discuss the project, I understand that a meeting has been arranged.  I can reassure Deputy Ryan by saying that a meeting has probably been arranged for next week or the week after.  It is coming up very shortly.  I assure the Deputy that when I meet the representatives of the DAA, I will address this important issue with them immediately.  This project will be one of the first things I discuss with them.  I have been briefed on the meetings that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have had with the DAA.  I hope to meet representatives of the DAA shortly to discuss a range of issues, including the north runway project.  I welcome the stated commitment of the DAA to work closely with all stakeholders, including local residents and community groups, on the north runway project.  I understand the DAA has already met local residents to discuss the project and further engagement is planned.</p>  <p>  New EU legislation regarding the issue of noise enters into force this month.  Specifically, EU Regulation 598/14 on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports entered into force yesterday, 13 June 2016.  This regulation sets out the process to be followed when decisions are being made on noise-related operating restrictions and involves consideration of all potential aircraft noise mitigation measures.  The regulation provides for consultation with interested parties, including local residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  The new noise regulation presents an opportunity to establish a modern, cohesive and measured approach to the management of noise at Irish airports.  It is capable of delivering the best outcome for all stakeholders.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are engaged in discussions on the technical details of the appropriate implementation of this regulation.</p></speech>

I have met and spoken with Mr. Kevin Toland.  I appreciate the work that is ongoing in this area.  I would like it to be continued and expanded.  I ask the Minister, as the democratically elected person who is representing the public in this brief, to represent the residents to the best of his ability.  We must ensure an appropriate balance is struck between delivering this project and meeting the concerns of the Fingal residents.  I believe the residents' concerns can be met.  I ask the Minister to keep a close watch on this aspect of the project as it progresses.  I thank him for indicating that it will be a priority for him when he meets the DAA.</p></speech>

I assure him that I will not allow a State monopoly to bully any group of residents, regardless of how small that group is.  The Deputy can take that message back to them.  It seems to me that State bodies of this sort are always in a position of great advantage over small groups of people.  Although I agree that the necessity for the second runway is compelling, it is imperative that those who have lived in the affected area for a long time or indeed for a short time should not have their safe and reasonably quiet residences ruined, and certainly not without adequate compensation.  They should be able to reach an amicable agreement with the DAA.  When a big body like this is seeking to get its way over a small group of residents, it is an uneven contest.  I will be asking the DAA certain questions about the second runway.  Permission for it was granted in 2007 and it is now 2016.  One would have to look at the appropriateness of that permission now.  As the permission was granted until 2017, everything they are doing is perfectly legal.  However, it is only fair that the concerns being expressed by the residents nine years on should be considered with a certain amount of generosity.</p></speech>

The Minister will be well aware of the fantastic greenway amenity that exists between Athlone and Mullingar.  He came down to have a look at it a number of weeks ago.  He will agree that this amenity will not reach its full potential until it has been finished and it extends right from the east coast to the west coast.  The Minister's predecessor decided to shelve the project over 12 months ago.  Is it a priority for the Minister to reinitiate this process?  If so, could he outline clearly how he plans to deal with it until it is completed in its entirety?  What is the expected timeframe in that regard?</p></speech>

Deputy Troy is correct when he says that I visited Athlone a few weeks ago to educate myself about greenways.  He cannot be incorrect because I was delighted to meet him there.  I was brought there by the Deputy's constituency colleague, Deputy Moran, who educated me in the benefits of greenways.  I have to say I am a convert as a result of meeting everybody down there, including Deputy Troy.  I understand the value for money and the attraction of this potential tourism bonanza.  The decision mentioned by Deputy Troy was taken by my predecessor following receipt of an interim report from Transport Infrastructure for Ireland, which is a fairly constipated-sounding quango.</p></speech>

In the meantime, I will examine potential funding options to deliver the sections of the Galway to Dublin greenway in counties Kildare and Meath that have planning permission in place and may be progressed quickly.  The completion of these sections would allow for the provision of a fully off-road greenway from Maynooth to Athlone.  The provision of this 100 km section, combined with the 26 km Mullingar to Abbeyshrule greenway, would provide a multi-day cycling experience which would be attractive to visitors from home and overseas.</p></speech>

Westmeath County Council is to be complimented on the work it has done to date.  If we are to get true value for money, we need to have the greenway open in its entirety.  That is when we will really see its potential reached.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland chose the most scenic and beautiful route from Athlone to Galway in order to attract tourists to use this product.  I ask the Minister to move this development on by proceeding with the necessary negotiations with the relevant landowners and ensuring the project can advance.  In some areas, ownership is not in question and there are disputes with local authorities, etc.  As the Minister mentioned, planning permission has been approved for Meath, parts of Longford and parts of Athlone.  Can he indicate when he will be in a position to provide the necessary funding to allow these links to proceed without delay?</p></speech>

I am not going to get involved in the rights and wrongs of the dispute or the difficulties which are obviously obstructing the progress of this greenway in the direction we had hoped.  However, I am going to appeal and hope to do something in a more concrete way to ensure it will go ahead soon.  The time for pausing is over.  There was a pause called for and it was probably a good and sensible decision at the time.  However, I am not familiar with the actual detail of the arguments between the various landowners and others in the area, but I will make an effort to see to it that they will put their heads together once again in order that we make a serious and energetic attempt to open the greenway with a great deal more speed.  What the Deputy has said about the greenway is correct.  Greenways have the potential to attract a significant number of tourists, particularly to the midlands.  I will certainly do as much as I can in the Department to promote them and bring more tourists to the country.</p></speech>

Based on the fact that when the Minister visited Athlone, we were able to convert him to the merits of the project, will he advise the local authorities of his funding intentions in the next 12, 24 and 36 months in that regard?  That would allow them to make the necessary plans and put in place the necessary works schedules to ensure the sections of the greenway which already have the benefit of planning permission could proceed without further delay.</p></speech>

County Kerry has approximately 2,000 km of such roads.  We had a successful scheme that ran for many years but which was, unfortunately, stopped in 2011.  There are approximately 100 roads on the current list awaiting improvement in County Kerry.  I am sure the position is the same in every other county.  Even if the fund were restored to 2009 levels of &euro;15 million, it would provide a valuable source of moneys for valuable projects which would benefit many people in all rural areas.</p></reply>

It is coming at me thick and fast and the Deputy has certainly been the first out of the traps in tabling a Priority Question on the matter.  I understand its importance to people, particularly those outside city areas.</p>  <p>  The local improvement scheme remains in place this year.  The scheme provides funding for private roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of which are, in the first instance, matters for the relevant landowner.  While it does not have a ring-fenced allocation in 2016, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding, 15% of the discretionary grant, for the local improvement scheme, should they wish to do so.  In addition, councils can also provide moneys from their own resources towards the scheme.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government provides that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for local improvement schemes on an annual basis.  A major objective of the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements and local improvement scheme funding will be promoted in that context.</p></reply>

Saying to the local authority that the scheme is open and can be funded from its own resources just does not work.  Since 2011, there has been a 50% cut in the funding for local roads within councils.  We can barely maintain what we have with the funding available.  Trying to fund local improvement schemes, in effect, on private roads is simply impossible.  Will the ring-fenced fund for these schemes be reintroduced?  During the good times back in 2006, the fund was &euro;24.5 million.  County Kerry benefited to the tune of &euro;2.3 million in that year which allowed 120 roads to be covered.  Even in 2009 when we were in the middle of the recession, the level of funding for the scheme was &euro;15 million, meaning that County Kerry benefited to the tune of &euro;1.3 million.  That level of funding would sustain the maintenance roads.  The first and last half kilometre of one&rsquo;s drive are the most important to us all because they are the parts on which we work most frequently.</p></speech>

I am kept conscious by the day of what the Deputy is saying by another source.  The pressure exerted on me will be equally effective from elsewhere.  The Deputy is kicking at a vulnerable and open door when talking about the issue.  While the fund will not be restored to its old form, the programme for Government stated:</p>  <p>"As the economy recovers, we will promote increased funding for local improvement schemes and community involvement schemes, on an annual basis.  A major transport objective for the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements and the LIS and CIS will play a key role in meeting that objective.  As part of our commitment to local government reform we will also give councils greater discretion in how they spend their money on local and regional roads.  We will expand the scheme to include the taking in charge of non-council roads with a view to having this scheme up and running by end 2017".</p></speech>

It is also immensely important to a large number of the population in each county.  Telling councils to use their own funding will simply not work.  From 1999 to 2007, there was substantial investment in the road network.  The majority of local roads in all counties were brought up to a reasonable level.  However, as these roads now beginning to fall apart, the councils have to reinvest in them.  Funding is needed for the improvement of private roads.  Local residents provide a 15% contribution, but the work is carried out by the local authority, meaning that it is recirculated.  One gets good value for one&rsquo;s grant money because local authority workers are the ones doing the work.  I urge the Minister to stick to the programme for Government commitments and hope 2017 will see the reintroduction of a real level of funding for the scheme.</p></speech>

The DAA has responsibility for the north runway project.  It was granted planning permission in 2007 for the project and announced its intention to proceed in April 2016.  As I have said previously, I welcome the DAA's stated commitment to work closely with all stakeholders, including local residents and community groups, in regard to the north runway project.  I understand the DAA has already met with local residents to discuss the project and that further engagement is planned.</p>  <p>  With regard to public transport services at the airport, as the Deputy will be aware, a significant number of public and private bus and coach operators are currently licensed to provide services linking the airport with the city and other suburban and regional centres across the country.  I understand that current demand for public transport services is well catered for by these operators.  In the medium to longer term, the new programme for Government includes a commitment to proceed with a metro scheme linking Dublin airport with the city centre and Swords.  Funding is being made available under the capital plan for planning, design and commencement of construction of the new Metro North scheme, with a view to delivering the link by 2026-27.​</p></speech>

The economic downturn and the subsequent fall in passenger numbers coming through the airport saw the plans put on hold.  Passenger numbers at the airport have grown substantially in recent years and the new runway is expected to be completed in 2020 at cost of some &euro;320 million.  The Dublin Airport Authority has said some of the conditions for the project in the planning permission were obstacles.  While the plan has been welcomed solely on an economic basis, there is a serious need to work with the local community and to ensure the plan is environmentally sound and that public transport services to the airport will be adequate to meet demand.  The plan has heightened awareness of difficulties for residents who may be affected by associated noise pollution and this problem of noise pollution is just one of the very real issues residents have to deal with.  The DAA must be very conscious of this issue, given it could be mitigated somewhat by supporting installation work where needed in estates close to the runway, as well as by noise barriers.</p></speech>

I am in danger of repetition given what I have already said to Deputy Ryan.  I take to heart what both the Deputies have said.  I understand the real difficulties in which the residents find themselves when a large project of this sort threatens to disturb their lives with the noise it creates.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, new EU rules and directives are coming into force on this issue.  I hope this will be used as an opportunity for a humane and understanding solution to the problems of these residents.  Obviously, the need for a second runway is imperative at this stage; it is an enormous necessity for tourism and for other aspects of the development of the country.  However, I do not think any large body like the DAA, with a State monopoly, should be able to kick around small groups of people who have made their lives in a certain area and who should be treated with compassion, generosity and understanding.  I believe meetings have already taken place, although I do not know how they went or how the residents feel about them - Deputy Ellis might come back to me on that point.  As I said to Deputy Ryan, I will be meeting the DAA very shortly and this will be a priority in those conversations.</p></speech>

The DAA has met with some residents' representatives but has not gone to a public meeting, which I think would be a good thing.  It would also be good for the DAA to advertise and display the plans across the whole community.  This affects a large proportion of the population on the north side of Dublin.  The flight paths affect areas such as Swords, in particular the Ridgewood area, Malahide, St. Margaret's, my own area of Finglas and right across to Clontarf.  Night flights are a massive issue in terms of noise pollution and the insulation of homes should be on the agenda in certain areas close to the airport.  Many people bought homes in recent years thinking the airport was going to remain the same as it is but, unfortunately, they now find there is to be a second runway.  It is important they are treated in a proper way and that insulation and so on can be installed.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned public transport and Metro North.  One of the things we badly need is a link to the airport through a metro that can serve Dublin from north to south and east to west, given this would take a massive amount of traffic off the roads annually.  Metro North, to which the Minister has committed, as far as I am aware, is a very important project.</p></speech>

D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is a quango, and a choice will be made soon as to whether it will continue to be a quango or whether it will be dissolved.  In so far as the Minister has influence on this decision, who is the Minister going to meet?

I am aware of the excellent work he has done on this project for a long period of time.  It is always a cause of great embarrassment to him and to me when we find ourselves on the same side on issues of this sort, but I am afraid we may find ourselves in that position again today.  That does not mean I am going to meet exactly who Deputy Boyd Barrett wants me to meet, but it does mean I think there is a necessity to make haste on this issue.  I will answer the Deputy's first question, on who I should and should not meet, although I do not think it is set in stone.  These kinds of rigid situations where someone does not meet people because it is not their function are a little too orthodox for my liking.  If it is useful, I will meet people, but if it is going to be damaging or just a display of ministerial action without achieving anything, I will not do it.  Of course, I would be very happy to talk to Deputy Boyd Barrett, as a public representative, on this area at any time, and that might be the most appropriate form of contact.</p>  <p>  The Harbours Act 2015 provides the legislative basis for one of the key recommendations in the national ports policy, namely, that governance of the five ports of regional significance should vest in more appropriate local authority-led governance structures.  The process of transferring governance, and the future governance and operational structures of the port, are primarily matters for agreement between the local authority and the port company and I do not think that is in dispute.  The Act provides that the two entities should work together in driving the process of transfer, including the necessary due diligence.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I understand this process is now fairly well advanced.</p>  <p>  As ports operate as commercial companies, I am not involved in day-to-day operational issues.  Nor is it normally appropriate for me to meet directly with local authorities or local interest groups on these issues.  However, I can confirm that a widespread public consultation process was undertaken by my officials from 2010 onwards, prior to the publication of the national ports policy 2013, and again during the legislative process leading up to the enactment of the Harbours Act 2015.  Other public consultation processes were undertaken by the port company on a range of issues and provided an opportunity for all stakeholders and interested parties to give their views on the future of the harbour.</p><p>Since 2013, when the transfer process commenced, senior officials from my Department have met D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and the chief executive and senior officials of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a number of occasions to clarify issues raised and to advise on the transfer process.  My Department has also been kept apprised of developments as part of the regular communications that take place between the company and shareholder.</p></speech>

I am concerned the decision about the future governance of the harbour is, according to the Minister's scripted response, a decision between the existing harbour company executive and the council executive.  This is not good enough because on all of the major issues, whether it is cruise berths, executive salaries of crazy amounts, such as &euro;160,000 for the CEO, and other plans, the harbour company and the council have alienated and are at odds with wider public opinion, harbour users and stakeholders.  The Minister should meet not just the harbour company, which will want to save its own skin and save the quango, or the council officials, but also meet the real stakeholders and public representatives so that their voices are heard.  The Minister will find their view of how the harbour should be run and what its priorities, policies and future plans should be are at radical odds with what the harbour company executives and the full-time officials of the council think should be the case.  I ask the Minister to meet a different group of genuine public stakeholders.</p></speech>

I do not think after that I would be in a position to interfere in a process which is ongoing.  If I were to meet them in the expectation that I would then interfere in the process, it would be wrong.  It would also be wrong of me not to meet public representatives, and by that I include members of Dublin City Council and the local authorities.  It would be wrong of me to refuse them point blank on any issue apart from on time grounds.  I would be happy to meet public representatives and if Deputy wants to bring a group of all views to meet me, I will do so but do not expect me, as a result of that, to intervene in a process which is, of itself, moving slowly and not quite quickly enough.</p></speech>

On the question before us, which is about metro north, as the Minister knows the north and west sides of Dublin and Fingal were totally shafted in the planning and construction of the Luas.  There was to be a north side line but it never happened.  Here we are 15 or 20 years later trying to get the whole project back on track.  We had a pre-election promise from Fine Gael last September that metro north would happen and now we are told it will be in 2025 or 2026.  Many things will have happened by 2026.  What is the Minister doing in 2016 to get metro north, a fixed line connection between O'Connell Street and Swords and the airport, under way?</p></reply>

We had a very constructive discussion.  The group has done a huge amount of homework and has much to offer in this particular area through tragic personal experience I know but all the same, it is something which may prevent accidents of the sort they have suffered happening again.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to proceed with the new metro north project and funding is provided in the capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, to facilitate construction of the link commencing in 2021 with a view to delivery by 2026 to 2027.</p>  <p>  The funding constraints that existed when the capital plan was being developed, and which continue to exist, mean that we are not in a position to deliver all that is required immediately.  The first priority has to be ensuring that we maintain our existing transport infrastructure at what is termed steady state levels, so that it remains safe and fit for purpose after a significant period of underinvestment during the financial crisis.  The funding that is being provided in the capital plan for public transport investment will see us reach steady state ​funding levels by 2020.  In addition, funding is provided to commence critical transport projects, such as new metro north, to meet growing demand.</p>  <p>  ​The National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, have commenced preparatory work on the planning and design of new metro north and a dedicated project steering group has been established.  In the meantime, the NTA has been asked to keep under review the interim public transport requirements of the Swords and airport corridor over the next ten years, with a view to ensuring adequate capacity to meet demand and to address constraints arising along the corridor.</p>  <p>  In the event that additional funding becomes available in the next few years, the groundwork that is being done will position us to progress the project in line with available funding.</p></reply>

In the programme for Government, there is only a throwaway line.  There is very little about transport generally speaking, so I am not sure what the Minister was trying to achieve in all of his long negotiations with Fine Gael.  We got a commitment from the former Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that we would have a new metro north line with 14 stops, 30 trams an hour and 60 m long trams carrying 30 million passengers.  The cost was put at &euro;2.4 billion.  What is the Minister telling us about the delivery of this?  When will he get a report from the dedicated steering group?  What type of funding will he spend on the project this year and in the forthcoming years?  Many people on all sides of the House, the west and north sides of Dublin and, indeed, the whole of the Dublin region are very much committed to this.  The Fingal county manager, Mr. Paul Reid, and Fingal County Council are very committed.   Dublin City Council is committed.  We want to see some action.  What type of consultations has the Minister had on the various proposals made in the public consultation in January 2015?  Has he met distinguished transport engineers, such as Mr. Cormac Rabbitt, who advocated very strongly that we should proceed with the Spanish system, as is found in Madrid, with a much lower cost-type development which would deliver much more quickly than 2026 or 2030.  Many of us may not be in the House in 2026.  It is way down the line.  The Minister needs to give us something more concrete.</p></speech>

It has to be approached on an available money basis.  As I said in my earlier response, we only have a certain amount of money to keep us in a healthy public transport financial sphere until 2020 and to keep it in a steady state condition.  In other words, we will not be able to afford to spend money on more than design and planning of metro north until 2020.  We have made this absolutely plain.  I said in my earlier reply that in the event additional funding becomes available in the next few years the groundwork being done will position us to progress the project in line with available funding.</p><p>I am very hopeful that we may be able to advance it a little but that would depend on available funding.</p> <p> The Government realises the problems, particularly in the area between St. Stephen's Green and Swords and the airport as well as other areas in north Dublin and the need to meet the demand from the travelling public in these areas.  We have instructed the relevant authorities to provide the necessary public transport in the interim, but I cannot make a promise here today that metro north will be advanced as the funding is not available.  If the funding becomes available, however, the Deputy has a pledge from the Government that this would be taken into early consideration.</p></speech>

CSO figures for 2015 show there were over 8.6 million overseas visits to Ireland, an increase of 13.7% on 2014.  Spending in Ireland by overseas visitors, excluding air fares or ferry charges, for 2015 increased by 18.6% compared to 2014.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland informs me that overseas promotion activity to support sustainable growth is weighted towards those segments that provide the best return on marketing investment.  In this regard, the Ireland brand is underpinned by the tourism brand experiences that have been developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air, which are all designed to appeal to the most promising consumer segments in overseas source markets.  All of the sectors mentioned by the Deputy, namely, business, activity and cultural tourism, present significant opportunities for promotion and development and are captured within the brand experiences.</p>  <p>  In this regard, business tourism was worth in excess of &euro;669 million to the Irish economy in 2015 and has increased by 35% since 2011.  It accounts for 16% of overseas tourism spend in Ireland.  The Government is continuing to invest in the activity tourism sector, to which the Deputy also referred, and there is provision in the multi-year capital investment programme for further expansion.  Finally, cultural tourism is an intrinsic element of all the experience brands but it forms a major part of the appeal of Ireland's Ancient East, which has a particularly rich and diverse range of cultural heritage, and which extends into the Deputy's constituency, where the experiences include many sites with which the Deputy is familiar.</p></speech>

I wish to ask the Minister of State the extent to which he sees further potential for the development of the various sectors mentioned in the question, with particular reference to activity holidays, which seem to be an international craze at present, the degree to which there is room for growth in the conference sector of tourism and the extent to which the greenways referred to already can be incorporated into packages for use by those visiting the country for the purpose of a conference with obvious other potential in growing the industry.</p></speech>

It is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the D&aacute;il in my capacity as Minister of State since my appointment, and I thank the Taoiseach for having made the appointment.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ross, in his previous reply to a question referred to the development of greenways, to which Deputy Durkan refers.  The Government is anxious to ensure that the use of capital investment through the smarter travel initiative be identified for these greenways.  The Deputy is right that there is a number of challenges in the area of tourism development, none more so than in the Dublin region, namely, hotel availability, to which the Deputy referred from the point of view of conferencing.  The Government is very conscious of this and we are actively considering the issue with a view to ensuring that we maximise the number of bed nights that can be achieved for business tourism and conferencing tourism so that people coming into the country, whether they are coming to the west, south or east, experience the maximum benefit for whatever their purpose.  To that end, the development of the facilities to which the Deputy referred is a priority for the Government.  The extension of the greenways and their use and accessibility is also a priority for the Government and a priority for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, which are the agencies with responsibility for them.</p></speech>

The Government is very conscious of the role that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland play, and to that end I have, since coming into the Department, used every opportunity to find out formally and informally from Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland what are the challenges ahead.  The Deputy has pointed out a number of challenges and he has a very clear knowledge of the issue from his constituency and the broader Leinster region.  There are challenges in the industry, but this was one of the two industries, the other being agriculture, that helped to drag the country out of the economic mire in which we found ourselves.  The Government therefore values the tourism industry.  We are very eager to work with all of the stakeholders, driven by the State agencies and underpinned by the policy on which the Department and its officials rely.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, and I are very conscious of this.  That is why we have been very clear from the start, since we came into the Department, that this is an industry that we want to see continuing to develop and to supply real jobs in constituencies like Kildare North.</p></speech>

I presume she is referring to a statement I made at a Road Safety Authority Garda event recently.</p>  <p>  Although Ireland, as of the latest available data, for 2014, is now one of the better-performing EU countries in terms of road safety, there is no room for complacency.  It is important that we continually evaluate our performance with a view to delivering the best possible outcomes.  The Government and the Road Safety Authority have in the past adopted a highly ambitious vision for road safety in Ireland for the period 2013-20 in the current road safety strategy.  Progress has already been achieved since Ireland first begun to pursue a strategic approach to road safety in 1998.  In the last ten years to the end of 2015, road fatalities were reduced by 58%, from 369 deaths in 2005 to 166 in 2015, our second safest year on record.  The stark reality, however, is that each one of those deaths is one too many.</p><p>While the RSA has overall responsibility for the strategy, its implementation is overseen by a high level ministerial group which is chaired by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The next meeting of the group is on 27 June and I plan to discuss what action we can take to reverse the unwelcome increase in road fatalities this year which has seen the number rise by 16 for the same period last year.  A mid-term review of the strategy will also take place this year.  I intend to ensure the review will be used to maintain progress and that the strategy is still fit for purpose.</p> <p> While highly visible enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is important and encourages better road safety behaviour, it is equally important that each of us, as a road user, whether it be as a driver, cyclist or pedestrian, take seriously our personal responsibility to reduce the senseless waste of life on the roads.  It is important that we do not rest on our laurels.  Some of the road safety figures that have emerged recently are alarming.</p></speech>

Garda resources police the roads and these resources have been slashed.  The traffic corps has been slashed from 1,200 to 700 members.  The CEO of the RSA has expressed serious concern about the lack of garda&iacute; and checkpoints on the roads.  It is one thing to say the RSA might need to examine the saturation of its media campaign and how effective or ineffective it is.  Given the recent rise in the number of deaths, it is blatantly obvious to everybody that anybody intent on drinking and driving can confidently get into a car and know that there is no chance of him or her being stopped at a Garda checkpoint.  That is the problem.  The RSA has done good work in reducing the numbers with its graphic advertisements which have been very effective.  The problem is the slashing of Garda resources and numbers in the traffic corps.  Will the Minister restore the number in the traffic corps which was slashed by 500 to it previous level to address this?  One must think in practical terms.  It is common knowledge that there is no chance of being stopped at a checkpoint if one is drink driving.  If we allow this to creep in, the figures will creep up accordingly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400030#CC00300"><p>Much as I would love to be, I am not Minister for Justice and Equality and cannot increase the number in the traffic corps at the drop of a hat.  I understand the Deputy's point and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the lack of checkpoints coincides with the increased number of accidents and deaths and the increased number of traffic fatalities in which alcohol was a factor.  At the meeting to which I referred there was the launch of a study by the RSA which found the very alarming figure that 38% of fatalities included an ingredient of excess alcohol.  This shows that alcohol is becoming a new danger on the road and that people are drinking much more than we thought.  There had been an assumption that it was no longer acceptable to drink and drive.  That is not the case.  Drink driving is very frequent and a large number of fatalities include a drink driving factor.  What was worse about the study was that it covered only the period from 2008 to 2012 and the evidence is that the level of drink driving has been increasing since and that it is becoming more acceptable.  There is a huge amount of work to be done.  I agree with the Deputy about Garda resources.  We definitely need more in all areas and they would help.  It would also help if we had comparative figures from elsewhere in Europe.  People tend to blame growing prosperity and say the reason there are more road deaths is there are more cars on the road and that it is inevitable.  I am not sure it is true.  This year's figures have increased by an enormous amount, over 24%.</p></speech>

While I have responsibility for road traffic legislation, traffic management is a matter for the local authorities.  The Deputy might wish to raise any concern he may have about the proposed College Green traffic management measures with Dublin City Council.  Regarding the impact of measures on visitors and holidaymakers, the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has a formal consultative role under the legislation governing the planning system.  It would not be appropriate for me to impinge on that statutory operational role.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply.  Will he advise my office if he has not received a reply within ten days?</p></reply>

In the 18th century the likes of Theobald Wolfe Tone who founded the Republic could stroll from Trinity College Dublin across to Parliament House and watch Henry Grattan and Henry Flood arguing the case for full Irish independence.  Although our Parliament was independent, this was not an independent state.  In theory, the proposal is attractive.  However, Dublin Bus and other public transport operators have expressed grave concerns that it will make north-south connectivity in Dublin much more difficult.  The matter is within the Minister's remit and we will have to proceed very carefully on it.  There are already connectivity issues for people like me who live on the north side and work in this quadrant of the city.  This connectivity could be disrupted.  Trades people need to drive independently.  Other workers who cannot use public transport are in the same boat.  There is a significant issue, although, in general terms, the proposal seems to be incredibly attractive.  I have also made the point that we need more initiatives on the north side of Dublin, particularly in the north inner city.  We have discussed this issue a lot in recent times.  There are all kinds of initiative south of the Liffey.  A visitor to the city recently thought, in looking at Dublin, that there were two cities, one on the north side and one on the south side.</p></speech>

It is the third time I have answered it today and I will try to answer it in a manner which is consistent with the way I have answered the other two.  Deputies Brendan Ryan and Dessie Ellis asked the same question.  </p><p>I hope to meet the DAA next week or the week after.</p><p>A meeting was supposedly going to be arranged today.  The issue of the second runway and the effect it will have on the residents of the area is something I will raise as a priority.  I said in my earlier response that I do not regard it as the right of a State monopoly simply to destroy or damage the lives of individual citizens or groups of individual citizens because it is more powerful.  It is only fair that, as the argument is weighted very strongly in favour of the DAA, the position of those residents should be given strong consideration by the State and by the authority itself and I intend to make strong representations to the authority on behalf of the residents.  Obviously, it is my view and probably the view of every Member that it would be wrong to stand in the way of the second runway because of the great benefits it will bring to the country and because of the necessity for it.  Given 25 million passengers go through the airport every year, it must go ahead but that does not mean the authority can ride roughshod over the sensibilities or the lives of those who live in the area.  Those who represent them have a strong case.  They will obviously have to have either the necessary insulation from noise, which is impossible to guarantee, or adequate compensation for the extraordinary disturbance to their lives this will cause.</p></speech>

I did not expect to get to this question and I will defer to his previous replies but the fact that practically all Deputies in the constituency have tabled a question on this issue today indicates the seriousness of the threat residents feel regarding this development.  We will call the Minister to account and call on him to stand by them and by the comments he has just made.  We are dealing with a planning permission that has almost expired.  It is almost ten years old and it was granted at a time standards were different in terms of noise pollution and the impact that has on people's mental health and well-being and in terms of climate change factors.  An evaluation of the decision now has to be updated to take cognisance of the environmental damage and the impact on householders.  One of the particular concerns in Portmarnock is noise but the St. Margaret's community is very much impacted from the point of view of some properties being bought up while others have not been because they were on the periphery of the development.  Does the Minister intend to raise that aspect of the issue with the DAA?  When a line is drawn, the people on the other side of it feel aggrieved that they face the worst scenario whereby their properties are not bought but they will be impacted most by the development.</p></speech>

That will not happen because there is an overall national interest in putting the second runway there.  The damage and the difficulties caused in their lives by the runway should be recognised in a material way.  Some of these people have lived there for 30 or 40 years and the inconvenience, disturbance and disruption would be indefensible on its own but in the greater national interest, they must be compensated properly.  I do not know whether that should be done by mitigation of noise or by monetary compensation but due consideration must be given to the difficulties in which they find themselves.</p></speech>

We have to factor in the cost of the impact in terms of climate change, which has not been factored in given the project was originally put together many years ago.  One of the key impacts on the residents is the move which will undoubtedly take place from restricted flying hours, particularly at night and early in the morning.  The DAA seems to be operating knowing this clause was not granted in the planning permission but is going ahead anyway before inevitably forcing the State's hand.  It is similar to building an additional lane on the M50, closing it and allowing the pressure to build before saying that we have to open it during these hours.  The DAA is building the runway with a view to breaching the condition imposed on it in respect of the health and well-being of the citizens to whom the Minister referred.  Unless that issue is nailed down, we will have a big problem in that regard.</p></speech>

The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority, NTA, in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  I ask her to please advise my private office if she does not receive a response within ten working days.</p>  <p>  As regards accessibility generally, I understand that Bus &Eacute;ireann regularly sends customer service notices to its depots around the country to remind staff of their responsibilities regarding passengers with specific needs.  Of course, customers should raise specific incidents directly with the bus operator in the first instance.  There has been considerable progress in enhancing the accessibility of bus services in the State.  This progress is most apparent in the subsidised bus fleet, which is funded by the State via the NTA.  The Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are now 100% accessible while most Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches are wheelchair accessible.</p>  <p>  During 2016 the NTA intends to begin the installation of wheelchair accessible bus stops across the Bus &Eacute;ireann network.  The long-term objective is to install a wheelchair accessible bus stop in every town in the State.  The NTA is rolling this out on a route-by-route basis starting this year with Bus &Eacute;ireann routes 30, Dublin-Donegal, and 32, Dublin-Letterkenny.</p>  <p>  Some of what I have said is repetition, as was the Deputy's question, to some extent, but the following is new.  Progress on the provision of wheelchair accessible bus services has been slower among operators of commercial bus services which do not have access to State funding.  In late 2014, the NTA launched a public consultation on ways to support the transition to wheelchair accessible buses among licensed bus operators.  Among the issues identified in the responses to the public consultation is the suitability of high-floor coaches with wheelchair lift compared to low-floor buses.  Accordingly, the NTA is examining whether there is an alternative approach which improves the customer experience of wheelchair users of services outside of cities and is looking at the subsidised bus fleet purchase as well as possible changes to the licensing of commercial services.</p></speech>

One wheelchair user had been in contact about this issue with the previous Minister and had been in continuous correspondence with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department, all to no avail.  As I asked in my priority question, what plans has the Minister that are different from the previous Minister's to address this issue?  I cannot imagine an individual in another European country being told to telephone the rail or bus station 24 hours in advance of making a journey to make sure there will be a train or a bus that he or she can access.  One would not hear the like of that in any European country.</p><p>It is all down to this issue never have been prioritised properly.  If there is one good effective initiative the Minister could do in his transport portfolio, it would be to address the lack of equality of access for people with disabilities.  I said this gentleman has been in touch with the previous Minister.  I ask the Minister again to look into this matter and not to give the bog standard letter that is sent out with the every excuse under the sun being given.  Will he take this issue seriously?  Will he make it his business to address disability access on the public transport network and, if he will, what will his plans be and how does he intend to be different?</p></speech>

Let me first say that seated two places to my left, we have a recognition of the fact that this Government is taking disabilities more seriously than any previous Government has done in the history of the State.  We have a Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities who sits at the Cabinet table.  I do not know if I would be revealing Cabinet confidentiality, which the Deputy would love me to do, by saying that he is not a man without a voice at the Cabinet table.  Disabilities have got that voice at the Cabinet table and will continue to have that, and that is something that is unique in this country.  I will raise this issue with the Minister of State immediately.  He is here.  He has heard what the Deputy had to say.  She has got his ear here.  This area is his job.  It is the Government position that we should give a higher priority to disability and the Minister of State is a recognition of that.</p>  <p>  I repeat what I said to the Deputy earlier because it is important that I should say this.  My sphere of influence as regards disabilities extends only as far as transport, tourism and sport.  The Deputy's questions and a few other questions on this area have revealed matters to me that I did not know previously, matters which I have only found out about in the past week or so, and that is the fact that transport is lacking in many areas in its consideration of disabled people.  That is something I am beginning to recognise and which I will certainly do something about.  I will urge that there is an enhanced interest, particularly in railway stations and outside the big cities' fleets where the buses do not provide enough access, and particularly on trains and in taxis.  I do not know if it was the Deputy or another Deputy who said today that only 5% of the taxi fleet is wheelchair accessible, which I only learned about in the past week or so.  Forgive me for saying that I am just learning about this area.  I am particularly surprised by what I have found and I will do my best to ensure that disabilities is given a much higher priority than it was in the past.</p></speech>

I want to state that I communicated by letter on 2 June 2016 with the chief executive officer, CEO, the chief financial officer, CFO, the chairperson of the board and the human resources, HR, manager on this issue in a comprehensive fashion on behalf of the employees.  I have not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement of or a reply to the same correspondence.  That is symptomatic of the way the employees, who were and are members of this defined benefit scheme, were treated in recent weeks by their employer.  I do not believe the most right wing employer would be so dismissive and uncaring and I will not tolerate any body or institution behaving in such a fashion and acting in blatant disregard of the interests of their valuable employees, past and present.</p>  <p>  I was motivated by this glaring disregard to wonder aloud who was in place and whose responsibility it was to protect, promote and advocate for the interests of workers when they were members of the IPT scheme.  As I said, the pension scheme was abruptly terminated with immediate effect as and from Wednesday, 18 May 2016 without leave or notice to the relevant staff or any appropriate consultation with the said staff, most of whom have given long years of service.  It is notable that, as far as I am aware, nobody has been admitted into the scheme since 2002 and, therefore, there is a finite and definite number of people involved, with only 47 active members of staff currently in the IPT pension, and about 50 deferred and 50 retired members of the scheme, who have been impacted by this unilateral decision.</p>  <p>  What I find disturbing is that the CRC is, for the most part, a publicly funded institution whereby employees are subject to contractual arrangements which set out their terms and conditions of employment.  In any event, in any employment situation at least one month's notice should be given to the affected personnel whereby any change in their terms and conditions are contemplated.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, this scheme has been in existence since 1975.  There was not any question about its viability in 2011 but like all defined benefit, DB, schemes, it did not meet the minimum funding standard required that was introduced.  However, the staff played a very significant role in ensuring its continued viability and sustainability.</p></speech>

It is pushing matters to say that this decision to close the scheme was taken just prior to the staff being informed.  I have no doubt there was a great deal of evaluation and assessment carried out by the professionals involved.  That is why I believe the way the staff were treated is disgraceful.  I trust the Minister will deal with this in a comprehensive fashion.</p></speech>

Initially the cost was 5% of their salary and since 2011 it has been 10% of their salary.  That was paid in good faith with the belief they would have a pension when they retired.  They have now been told that they will not have a pension and we can all imagine how they must be feeling.  I am thinking about the human face of this.  Some of these people have given 20, 30 and 40 years of faithful, loyal service to the CRC and to the very significant work that it does.</p>  <p>  The affected staff were called to a meeting, they had no idea of the agenda and then they were given the catastrophic news about their pensions.  My understanding is that there was no formal communication from the CRC or the trustee to the staff.  One of the aspects is about the process.  It is the complete opposite of what constitutes good practice in a wind-up; in fact, it is an example of bad practice, poor management, a very fast process and no consultation.  There is also an aspect of a conflict of interest and of questions around the trustee, their fitness to practise as a trustee and whether they undertook the mandatory training and whether the staff even know who they were.  It is appalling the way that the CRC staff have been kept out of the loop on this.  The CRC was working away with legal advice, but the affected staff need access to that professional advice, legal and actuarial.  I ask that the CRC would contribute to and support them in getting that advice.</p>  <p>  Why did management make the decision to close the scheme?  On what advice did it make that decision?  Why were the staff not allowed to see that advice?  It is an appalling example of very poor employer-employee relationships.  All the staff have been left very much high and dry at this stage.  I thought the CRC would be much more careful about this in view of the other controversies that have surrounded it in recent times.</p></speech>

Overnight, unilaterally and without warning, a pension scheme was shut down that loyal staff members had paid into all their working lives.  Subsequent to that decision, those staff members have been unable to meet the members of the board of the CRC who have no problem going to a gala dinner in the Burlington tonight.  It is absolutely reprehensible.</p> <p> As other Deputies have said, the CRC plan in 2011, as with other defined benefits schemes, did not meet the minimum funding standard requirements.  On 24 March 2014, the CRC's actuary, Mercer, declared that the funding proposal was on track to meet the minimum standard by next year.  If the CRC plan was on track in 2014, why was it closed down in such a hurry by the CRC board with effect from 18 May 2016?  Can the Minister answer that?  What went wrong between March 2014 and May 2016?  Did Mercer give poor financial advice which led to the scheme closing given that contributions increased and a de-risking strategy was put in place?</p> <p> There are conflicts of interests at the heart of this.  Mercer appears on all sides of the equation in this.  The company provides administration, actuarial services and consultancy advice to the CRC meanwhile the so-called independent trustee of the plan is the Irish Pension Trust, which is owned by Mercer.  It is an absolutely clear-cut case of a conflict of interest.  Not only that, it has completely been missed that it appears an integrated, defined-benefit pension scheme with a contribution rate of 35% could not support the continuance of entitlements under the plan.  How in God's name can that be?  It does not add up.  The scheme must be reinstated until such time as comprehensive investigations around this are held.  I urge the Minister to secure that.</p></speech>

The Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, is funded by the Health Service Executive under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  Therefore, the CRC is accountable in the first instance to the HSE in relation to pay and superannuation matters.  The CRC employs approximately 290 people, of whom approximately 45 are members of a privately funded pension plan operated by the trustee, the Irish Pensions Trust.  It is important to explain at the outset that neither the Department of Health nor the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has any role or function in relation to the operation of this funded pension plan which was established some decades ago by the CRC.</p>  <p>  Following an extraordinary meeting on 17 May, the board of the CRC decided to cease contributions to the private pension plan.  The CRC then issued notice of termination of contributions to the trustee, Irish Pensions Trust Limited.  The notice provided that with effect from 18 May 2016, the CRC was terminating its liability to contribute to the plan.  Neither the Minister, Deputy Harris, nor the Department had any advance notice from the CRC of its intention to cease contributions to the pension plan.  The Department of Health was informed of the CRC decision on 18 May.  It is regrettable that the CRC took a decision to cease contributions to the scheme without first consulting with the employees concerned and the HSE.  In fact, the Department had previously highlighted to the CRC that any proposal in relation to any pay or pension matter must first be submitted to the HSE.  It was also explained to the CRC that Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction would be required for any CRC proposal.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of information from the CRC on the winding up of the scheme, the CRC was requested as a matter of urgency to prepare viable alternative proposals in conjunction with the HSE.  The HSE has today confirmed that it is working with the CRC to find a viable solution in relation to the employees concerned but that as yet, a detailed business case has not been submitted by the CRC.  The Minister assures the House that once a detailed proposal is received by the Department, it will be examined as a matter or urgency.  The proposal will be considered in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is responsible for the implementation of Government policy in relation to public service pensions.  The Minister and I ask the CRC to work as quickly as possible with the HSE to resolve this situation which has left the employees concerned in a most difficult position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400033#FF00400"><p>What makes us all very suspicious is that the scheme has &euro;28.5 million in assets and &euro;30.5 million in liabilities, which is a &euro;2 million deficit.  It could easily be made up.  The Minister of State is no doubt aware that some schemes may have fallen into deficit due to various oscillation of equities and the bond market but these have all recovered.  What is perplexing is that there was no consultation with staff to allow them to evaluate this issue and to consider whether to seek further advice by hiring their own actuary, paid for by CRC, to examine the situation and, indeed, whether they might contemplate the scheme remaining in existence by opting to either take reduced benefits or increase their contributions as they had already done to try to maintain existing benefits.  It occurred within a couple of weeks of the receipt of the actuarial report.  Pursuant to the Pensions Act 1990, it seems to me that the trustees would have had approximately nine months to submit a funding plan and it is clear that over a period of time, the scheme could be got back on track.</p>  <p>  Given the section 38 funding, it is time the trustees and the management of the CRC were called before the new Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts to explain why they acted in such a fast fashion.  As Deputy Daly asked, why, given that an assurance was given on 24 March 2014 that the pension scheme was on track, did it collapse on 18 May 2016?  I ask the Minister to reinstate the scheme as it was until those issues pertaining to the winding up of the scheme are addressed and investigated, including the roles of all the professionals involved at all levels in respect of the operation of the scheme.</p></speech>

If so, that is public funding and there is an accountability issue to address.  The CRC has shown its disdain for its employees as well as for the relevant Departments and the HSE.  The employees feel very much abandoned and crushed in respect of this mess which is not of their making.  They are the workers who had to face the public disappointment, disdain and disgust over the other controversies involving the CRC and this is what they are left with now.  The affected staff should get the full value of their pensions.  I note what the Minister of State said and that it is being treated as a matter of urgency but my question is how anyone can trust the CRC given its behaviour to date on this and other issues.  I seek the Minister of State's assurance that this is not going to go off the agenda now that the Topical Issue has been taken and that the CRC will be given a timeframe in which to come back to the Department.</p></speech>

I call it bizarre, sinister and highly suspect.  It just does not add up.  If our concern is to have any meaning whatsoever, the only instruction we should be issuing to the CRC is to reinstate the scheme until comprehensive issues involving the decision to wind it up can be investigated.  It does not add up.  If one looks at the scheme, it was very well funded.  A deficit of &euro;2 million is very little.  There were breaches of the Pensions Act.  The trustees could have had and lawfully did have nine months to come up with an alternative funding plan.  As such, why was a decision taken 18 days after the actuarial assessment?  There are serious questions about some of the assumptions applied by Mercer in relation to the scheme.  The report which was given to the staff has been redacted in many parts so that we cannot even have an accurate assessment of the actuarial advice that was given.  There seems to have been bizarre and questionable behaviour and I urge the Minister to intervene to hold people to account and not just to look at alternatives now.  He should halt it, get it back to where it was and hold people to account.</p></speech>

I will address each specifically.  I accept that Deputy Penrose received no acknowledgement.  It was a disgrace as far as I am concerned and I will follow up on the issue.  Regarding Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's points on good faith, the great service of the staff and accountability, I have also raised these issues and will discuss them again later.  Deputy Clare Daly mentioned the idea of shutting down on a loyal workforce.  I am familiar with the staff of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.  I have made my views known to the board's chairperson many times.  Even though this matter is not necessarily in my remit, I have met some of the staff and heard their case.  Many of their views have been expressed in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  Other issues exist.  For example, this raises serious questions of financial and corporate governance.  I have concerns in that regard.  The majority of the staff are unaffected but I am concerned about the 47 individuals on whom this situation will impact.</p>  <p>  I will be answering a question on an issue that I have been addressing in recent weeks, namely, the level of monitoring of this matter.  Before yesterday, there was no contact with the HSE since the actuaries began their review.  I am demanding answers of the HSE and the CRC as to why there was no communication from either side during this period and what level of monitoring was conducted.  Both knew that the problem existed.</p>  <p>  The CRC does not have unilateral authority to move employees onto the single public service pension scheme.  This matter must be discussed with the HSE.  The pension scheme had a serious and escalating gap and it is incredible that such a point was reached with so little information being passed to the HSE or the Minister.  I want to see a speedy solution.  I am asking the CRC to proceed with its talks with the HSE on this matter and am demanding a full report on the outcome of whatever meetings are held so that we can determine how to proceed in the best interests of the taxpayers and the 47 people affected.</p></speech>

His personal commitment is clear and exceptional in terms of his membership of the Oireachtas.  He has continuously articulated the needs of people with disabilities and I hope that he will give a positive response to this important programme, which works effectively and efficiently in County Louth.</p>  <p>  People with disabilities generally have lower skill and qualification levels than the population at large.  Any programme, facility or involvement is important and positive in terms of the outcomes for those involved.  One such initiative is the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability providing equal employment routes, WALK PEER, programme.  It will continue operating in County Louth until July.  More than 119 people covering many types of disability and a broad spectrum of diagnoses were involved, including a number with dual or multiple diagnoses.  Some 49% of its participants had an intellectual disability and almost one fifth had a learning disability, for example, struggling with basic literary skills as a result of dyspraxia.  Other conditions, including autism, physical or sensory disabilities, accounted for 11%, mental health problems accounted for 6% and 3% of participants had an acquired brain injury.</p>  <p>  This programme achieved great success for those with disabilities and enriched the participants greatly.  It involved their families, who strongly supported it, employers, the community and schools.  The schools that were involved over a two-year period included the Drogheda Institute of Further Education, DIFE, the Dundalk Institute of Technology, the &Oacute; Fiaich Institute of Further Education, St. Mary's College, St. Vincent's secondary school and the volunteer centre in County Louth.  No programme is perfect but this one was independently assessed.  Its participants, their families, schools and employers were communicated with and gave very positive responses.</p>  <p>  The WALK PEER initiative's funding stopped in 2015 but the programme continued because of the support of private donors.  By any benchmark, it is successful and is what the people what.  The community is behind it but there is a problem in that bureaucracy is not continuing its funding.  Initially, this was one of 14 programmes in the region.  Last year, I attended meetings in Castlebellingham that were packed in support of it.  We continue to receive representations from WALK PEER's participants, their families and everyone else.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State meet the programme urgently?  Those involved are deeply committed and are concerned about its future.  There is an integrity in their approach and support.  I will be happy to respond following the Minister of State's answer.</p></speech>

The project was delivered by WALK.  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.</p>  <p>  The WALK PEER project provided an early intervention customised employment support service for its participants to access employment and economic activity.  The target group was young people with disabilities aged 16 to 24 years, including those with a physical disability, sensory impairment, a mental health problem, challenging behaviours, a medical condition and-or autism.</p>  <p>  I understand that the WALK PEER project supported a total of 119 participants over the period that it was funded by the Department and the ESF.  The total number of participants on the DACT programme across the 14 projects was 2,079.  In terms of progression outcomes, 49 WALK PEER participants progressed to further education and 21 took up employment.  Of these, 12 individuals remained in economic activity - education or employment - after 12 months.</p>  <p>  A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that the learning from this activity should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.  Therefore, it is important to note that the projects were never intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right no matter how successful the projects might have been.  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end date of 30 April 2015.  In the closure phase of the programme, however, it was recognised by the Department that there would be a number of people still actively participating on some of the DACT projects, so a decision was made to provide funding to seven of the projects, including WALK PEER, for a short period to the end of July 2015.  This funding was provided so as to allow projects to ensure that their participants finished their involvement in a framed manner.  I understand that the WALK PEER project was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from a private sector organisation and that this source of support will terminate in July 2016.</p>  <p>  Given the origin and history of the project as set out, there is no provision in the Department of Social Protection's Estimates to provide further funding to this project.  The Department's mainstream work supports for people with disabilities focus on supporting people in the context of jobs in an open labour market.  This is the official departmental response but I will respond in more detail to the concerns raised by Deputy O'Dowd.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400035#HH00100"><p>It certainly is the official departmental response.  As far as I am concerned, it is bureaucracy and does not make sense at all.  This programme clearly works.  It shines a light into to the lives of the participants, their families and their community.  It has the full support of the schools, employers and everybody concerned.  Why is it that something that is successful and that is wanted by everyone involved is hammered by the bureaucracy?</p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to meet the group.  It is crucial that he do so.  It is crucial that we uphold success and support the people succeeding in this area.  According to the very words of the Minister of State, the programme is a success.  When the Government funding stopped, funding was obtained from a private sector source to keep the programme going.  It is a success and we should be replicating and supporting programmes that actually work.</p>  <p>  I understand the actual cost per participant to the wonderful Department is approximately &euro;5,000.  There is another Minister present, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, who spends - properly so - approximately &euro;250,000 per individual on children who are in trouble with the law and in care.  They need it.  In the case of the programme I am raising, a paltry sum of &euro;5,000 per individual is not being spent.  Why is it that when a programme works, we say "No"?  Why is the bureaucracy getting away with it?  Why did the Department give the Minister of State that gobbledygook of an answer to give today?  It is insulting to the participants and their families.  I have never met a group more committed, dedicated and articulate and with more support on an issue.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to and meet that group and sit down with officials from the Department.  He is the person in charge; he is the Minister of State.  The bureaucracy must do what it is told but it must always replicate and support success.  That is absolutely critical in this day and age as part of our comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  Either it means nothing or it means something.  The Minister of State is the man to make the difference and I hope his reply will.</p></speech>

My view on this is that the amount of money being spent, namely, &euro;5,000 per person per year, contrasts with the huge sums of being spent in other areas.  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is that I will strongly take on board the views he has raised today.  Other colleagues, such as Deputy Gerry Adams, raised this matter recently also.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of disabilities, I strongly agree that we need to invest in the services.  Disability services were severely slashed over the past six or seven years.  I am trying to address that at present.  Last week, I announced in the region of &euro;31 million for school leavers and various worthwhile projects.</p>  <p>  We have to be seen to be supporting people with disabilities and acting in regard to supported employment.  Supported employment is completely different from the circumstances of somebody with an illness who can re-enter the workforce on recovery.  The reality is that within the intellectual disability sector, we need supported employment.  Therefore, I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on the issue of bureaucracy.</p>  <p>  Over the past couple of weeks, I have raised this matter with my Cabinet colleagues and I told them we need to react.  It is not just a matter for the Minister of State responsible for disabilities to talk about the rights of people with disability.  It is a matter for every single Minister.</p>  <p>  On the question as to whether I will meet the families, I absolutely will do so.  I will be honoured to meet them.  I had a few rows behind the scenes with my officials.</p></speech>

I will be fighting for those concerned and I commit to doing my best.  We need to ensure the Department of Social Protection faces the reality.  It cannot just run away from a particular project if it is very successful.  I will be fighting and arguing with my Cabinet colleagues on this project.</p>  <p>  Last Saturday, I was at an Inclusion Ireland conference in the Gibson Hotel.  I met some of those involved in the WALK PEER programme and they convinced me.  I also met other people outside the project and asked them directly whether it was credible.  Every one of them said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  My answer is that I will commit to doing my best on this.</p></speech>

As evident in the discussion on WALK PEER, we are seeing services being pulled from people with disabilities.  In the case I wish to raise, a number of children are seeing their services go.  St. John of God has decided not to continue with the service.  It is saying demand for residential services has decreased.  It does not say demand is gone and that the service is not needed anymore or that there is no one using it but rather it is just saying demand has decreased.  Therefore, why is the provider pulling the service when there are still people using it?</p>  <p>  The vocational education services are to be withdrawn from the school from the beginning September 2018.  The houses - five in total - adjacent to the school are to be withdrawn from the children and are to be no longer available to assist in teaching independent living skills.  That is from the end of this school year, which is effectively immediately.  More than 25 members of staff are to be pulled out of the school and reallocated or reassigned within the St. John of God organisation.</p>  <p>  This must not be allowed to happen.  It is up to the Minister of State to intervene, particularly in respect of the disability sector.  A parents' group has been set up and it has had contact with the Minister of State.  He was to get back to it yesterday, according to a letter that was sent.  I was informed a meeting was to take place with the Minister of State responsible for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, who it was said would be more than sympathetic to the group's plight.  The group expected an update on Monday, 13 June.  What has happened?  Has the Minister of State replied to the group?</p>  <p>  Whatever about St. John of God making this decision, I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene.  Alternatively, the HSE should intervene to ensure the services are retained in the school.</p></speech>

It was an incredibly emotional, distressing and angry meeting of parents of children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities who, incredibly, had letters put into their schoolbags by St. John of God telling them the vocational services that are the critical component of this special school are to be removed completely over the next three years, starting in the summer and in September.  The services are to be phased out.</p>  <p>  There are 27 members of staff providing services that give meaning to the commitment in the programme for Government to give support to young people with disabilities in gaining access to independent living and education and in having an equal opportunity in life.  The removal of the services is unconscionable.  The reason almost all the parents had sent their children to St. Augustine's is precisely because of the vocational services that were provided there, which included all sorts of training for life supports and programmes.  Staff included speech and language therapists, psychologists and social workers.  All of these services are to go and families are absolutely devastated.  We cannot get a straight answer from St. John of God.  I want to know the extent to which this is the decision of the HSE or St. John of God.  Whichever it is, it is absolutely unacceptable and has to be reversed.  It will damage the future prospects of a vulnerable group of children, in direct contradiction of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase support, particularly for young people, and to give them a chance so they will not have to depend on adult services.  All the parents testify to the fact that the children are flourishing in the school.</p><p>If the cuts are not reversed, the children will be knocked back and into further dependency on adult services and their life chances undermined and ruined.</p></speech>

I assure them the Government is committed to the provision and development of services for children with special needs and improving their access to therapy services.  In recent years significant resources have been invested by the health sector in services for children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be standardised.  To this end, a major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities aged up to 18 years is under way.  The HSE's national programme for progressing disability services for children and young people aged up to 18 years aims to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school the child attends or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  There is also a greater emphasis on the health and education sectors working more closely together in supporting children with special needs to achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, the roll-out of the progressing disability services for children and young people programme has entailed targeted investment of &euro;14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities.  Reconfiguration of disability services in line with the programme is under way in the HSE D&uacute;n Laoghaire area where St. Augustine's special school is located.  This area has received a total of 13 new therapy posts to assist in implementing the new model.</p>  <p>  St. Augustine's special school in Blackrock, County Dublin was established by the St. John of God Order in the 1930s as a traditional boarding school for boys with a mild learning disability.  Students from all over Ireland boarded at the school which provided a range of educational and residential services unavailable at the time in the child's community.  In recent times services have been developed which ensure children can access special education while remaining in their family home.  More and more families are choosing to have their child attend a mainstream school.  As a result, demand for residential services has dropped significantly in the past ten years, from 36 to two pupils recently.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides the funding for St. Augustine's special school.  I understand the National Council for Special Education will allocate 22 teachers for the 2016-17 school year.  The number of special needs assistants, SNAs, allocated to the school for the coming school year will be 28, which means that there has been no reduction in the number of SNA posts or special school teachers.  St. Augustine's special school will continue to provide education and services for its pupils.  However, I understand there will be changes in the services currently funded by St. John of God community services.  For historical reasons, St. John of God community services fund some additional programmes in St. Augustine's special school, including the residential service and a vocational development programme.  As stated previously, demand for residential services has declined during the years and in the years before special needs assistants were available through the Department of Education and Skills.  While the vocational development programme provided vital support for pupils in the school, there are now 28 special needs assistants for 162 students in the school.  In addition, there are ever-increasing and competing demands on resources, including compliance with national regulations.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, I am informed that the board of directors of St. John of God community services has taken the decision to reallocate resources from St. Augustine's special school to other parts of its service.  This will involve phasing out funding for residential, vocational and extended day services in the next three years.  I understand this type of change can be difficult for the children and families concerned.  As Deputy Joan Collins stated, I recently met a group of parents who voiced their strong concerns on several matters and I raised these concerns with the HSE and my Cabinet colleagues on their behalf.</p></speech>

The key issue, as he noted and the letter from St. John of God community services states, is that demand for residential services in St. Augustine's special school has decreased.  Nevertheless, regardless of whether only two or three children are involved, they should be facilitated through the provision of services.  It is crucial that disabled children and their families do not find themselves having to fight for services.  They must feel comfortable that wraparound services are being provided in school.  I urge the Minister of State to intervene with St. John of God community services to ensure it maintains residential services for current and future students.  While I accept the point he makes about special needs assistants, it is important that children using residential services are able to continue using these services.</p></speech>

Special needs assistants are not a replacement for residential services.  The whole point of the school was that it provided vocational supports, which are not provided by special needs assistants who provide support with the mainstream academic curriculum.  That is not the point of St. Augustine's special school.  All of the parents stated in the strongest possible terms that the reason they sent their children to the school was its vocational aspect, in other words, the training for life provided by the staff employed by the Health Service Executive, as opposed to staff employed by the Department.  The parents want this service retained.  They have been robbed of the basis on which they sent their children to the school.  All of them made it clear that their children would have been eaten up - that is how they put it - in mainstream school, whereas they were flourishing in St. Augustine's special school.  It is not acceptable that all of the things that have helped them to flourish and are giving them the opportunity to participate equally in life will be lost under the plan.  I hate the word "streamlining" because it is always a euphemism for cutting and scaling down rather than scaling up.  Any badly needed improvement in other services in D&uacute;n Laoghaire should not be made at the expense of vulnerable children in St. Augustine's special school.  New services must be additional and not result in services being taken away from young children in the school.</p></speech>

It is important that people be made aware that funding of approximately &euro;110 million was provided for St. John of God community services in 2016.  This included &euro;67 million for services in the Dublin area, which include the services provided in Blackrock.  St. John of God community services receive the second largest amount of funding of all disability service providers in the State.  As I indicated, I met a group of parents with children in St. Augustine's special school and I will relay their views.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to letters being given to children to take home in their schoolbags.  That was an appalling decision by the service provider.  The key issue is vocational support and speech and language services.  While I have started communicating on this issue, I will communicate directly on the impact on the families in question.  We must ensure all children with disabilities receive the services they need.  The organisation in question has a responsibility to act on this matter.  However, the Health Service Executive and the Minister cannot be blamed because the board of directors made the relevant decision and handled the matter very badly.</p></speech>

The report contains details that are deeply disturbing and expose for all of us, once again, a dark chapter in Northern Ireland's history.</p><p>The families of those six men who were ruthlessly gunned down finally have the truth but they do not have justice.  We learned from the report that police officers missed investigative opportunities and destroyed evidence.  It concludes that there was collusion between some police officers and loyalist paramilitaries.  This report reminds us once again of the desperate and unacceptable attitudes that prevailed within elements of policing and other state forces in Northern Ireland during that era.  We now have the truth.  Collusion was a factor in the murder of six innocent men in Loughinisland and in the maiming and attempted murder of others in The Heights bar.</p> <p> Unfortunately, today there is no real evidence that the PSNI has been actively pursuing those identified by the ombudsman report.  It is essential that the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman report is referred to the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland. A clear message must be sent by the Irish and British Governments and by the Northern Ireland Executive to the PSNI directing the service to pursue its investigations in the most rigorous manner possible to ensure that those who committed this heinous crime are brought to justice.  The victims and survivors as well as their families and the wider community deserve justice.</p> <p> There were many dark chapters in the history of Northern Ireland, including at Loughinisland.  The depth and scale of collusion with violent gunmen is a damning indictment of the rotten culture that prevailed in parts of the security services.  The establishment of the PSNI was an important step forward.  Indeed, there is need for ongoing reform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

They were not subject to any meaningful investigation.  They were given a licence to kill and maim with no real likelihood of conviction.</p>  <p>  In 1974 bombs exploded in Dublin and Monaghan killing 33 people, including an unborn child.  The farm of James Mitchell, a member of the so-called Glenanne gang, was used to assemble and launch these attacks with the support, it is believed, of British intelligence services.  Mitchell was in the RUC and other gang members were in the Ulster Defence Regiment.  The gang is linked to over 120 deaths.</p>  <p>  In 1988 weapons were imported from South Africa.  Where did they end up?  They ended up on James Mitchell's farm.  Through their informants, the intelligence agencies knew where and when the weapons were arriving.  Some were recovered but many more were allowed to go to loyalist death squads.  One of these weapons was used in the Loughinisland massacre.  At least one of those killers is suspected to be an agent.  Six were killed and five were injured watching an Ireland football match, like the match many of us were watching last night.  There were killed simply for being Catholics.  We owe it to the victims of the Loughinisland massacre and their families, who have been waiting for 22 years, that time be set aside in the D&aacute;il to discuss this report.  I do not accept that speaking time of two or three minutes each is adequate.</p></speech>

The years of conflict were brutal and vicious.  The Loughinisland report is one example of this.  A total of 3,500 people died and many thousands more were injured or imprisoned as a consequence of the actions of combatant groups on all sides, including the British Government.  The extensive legacy of injustice and suffering has never been properly addressed.  A victim-centred truth and reconciliation process to help victims is urgently needed.  London has had knowledge of the involvement of its agencies and operatives for decades.  This is why the British Government has undermined the Haass proposals for dealing with legacy issues.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether members of the Government have talked to their counterparts in London since this report?  What discussions have the Government held with the British Government to put in place either the Haass proposals or alternative proposals?</p></speech>

The report by the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland on the Loughinisland murders in 1994 is a source of deep concern to the Government and all parties in this House.  Our thoughts are first and foremost with the families of the six murder victims of the terrible attack at Loughinisland, Adrian Rogan, Daniel McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Patrick O'Hare, Barney Green and Malcolm Jenkinson.  As we approach the 22nd anniversary of these sectarian murders, the report is a traumatic reminder of the loss and pain endured by their families and loved ones.</p>  <p>  The findings of the ombudsman are deeply disturbing, in particular his determination that collusion is a significant feature of the Loughinisland murders.  The report also evidences shocking failures on the part of the RUC in tackling loyalist groups active in County Down at the time, dealing with informants and conducting the original investigation into the Loughinisland killings.  The ombudsman report vindicates the concerns the families have raised over many years and their continuing search for justice.  The hurt caused by their loved ones being murdered in such vicious circumstances is compounded by the knowledge that elements of the British security forces colluded with such callous crimes.  The ombudsman's findings must now be carefully examined with a view to the question of further investigations and possible prosecutions.</p>  <p>  The PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, has made clear the PSNI commitment to apprehending those responsible for these appalling sectarian murders.  It is vital that the PSNI investigation and the work of the service is given full support by all relevant authorities in order that all possible efforts can be made to bring to justice those who ordered and carried out the Loughinisland murders and those implicated by the ombudsman's finding of collusion.</p>  <p>  The Government will be unstinting in ensuring that the Loughinisland case remains a priority on the political agenda in our engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Therefore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be raising the cause at his next meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Despite its disturbing findings, the report is an important reminder of the central importance of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman in supporting public confidence in the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland, as envisaged in the Patten report.  It is important that the achievement of substantial progress on the Patten vision of a transformed policing service in Northern Ireland is recognised and continues to be supported by all sides.  The Police ombudsman's report on the Loughinisland attacks is also a stark reminder of the need to agree dedicated mechanisms for dealing with the painful legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, as is the current inquest into the Kingsmill massacre of 1976 and the establishment of a new policing investigation into the so-called Stakeknife allegations.</p>  <p>  All of these controversial cases are manifestations of the toxic legacy of the past which, if not addressed in a comprehensive way, has the capacity to destabilise the politics of the present and overwhelm the policing and justice system.  The establishment of such dedicated mechanisms is a priority for the Government and is reflected in the programme for Government.  The need to maintain victims and their survivors is at the core of our approach.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is actively engaged to seek and support an agreement on the establishment of the legacy institutions envisaged under the Stormont House Agreement.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I believe that substantial progress can and must be achieved on this crucial issue over the coming months.  Making progress on this issue would, in some measure at least, help to honour the memory of those six men who were indiscriminately murdered while watching a World Cup match in Loughinisland on 18 June 1994.</p></speech>

I do not know if it is possible for the families to find some sense of closure with the truth of how their loved ones were murdered.  Again, I emphasise that the killers must be brought to justice and that there has to be answers for this mass murder.</p><p>Through parliamentary questions and various debates in this House over the years, I have highlighted the issue of collusion and the needless loss of life that resulted from such collusion.  I again emphasise the need for the British Government to co-operate with investigations into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and also into bombings in my constituency, including Belturbet, where innocent decent people lost their lives.  Two young teenagers died in the bombing in Belturbet.</p> <p> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, must state clearly that she accepts the findings of the Loughinisland report.  She should also apologise and retract her statement of February where she referenced the RUC not pulling the trigger in Loughinisland.</p> <p> I have asked successive Ministers for Justice and Equality, and Foreign Affairs and Trade, to pursue relentlessly with the British Government the need for it to honour its international commitments and provide full and proper co-operation with all investigations into these horrific crimes.</p></speech>

The Ombudsman believes there was collusion and I think he is right.  Following this finding, what will the Government do?

The families of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings have waited for 42 years.  Are they waiting for the families of the victims to die as well?  When will the British release their files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?

That includes the families of those killed in Loughinisland.  The British Government and its agencies armed, directed and then covered up the killings at Loughinisland.  That is a fact and there can be no dispute about that.</p>  <p>  Over the years, I have met many families of victims of the conflict.  They include victims of the IRA, and British forces and their lethal allies within unionism.  Members of my family have been killed and injured.  The grief and trauma suffered by everyone is the same.  The resolve of all political leaders must be to ensure no other family is bereaved.  That means us working together.</p>  <p>  The Government does not have a consistent strategic approach to dealing with legacy issues.  It is not enough that the Loughinisland injustice is reduced to a Topical Issue.  Will the Government encourage a joined-up, inclusive and thoughtful discussion aimed at unshackling-----</p></speech>

I know from our engagement on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which included Deputies Crowe and Smith, we tackled all legacy issues and I think we all know the complexities involved.  I am certainly aware that time skips by and time is not a commodity that is of any use to people seeking justice.  As Deputy Smith pointed out, they have the truth but they do not have the justice.  We have to keep focus on that.</p>  <p>  The fresh start agreement and the Stormont House agreement make a commitment to include an historical investigations unit.  Independence has to be paramount to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths and we need an independent commission on information retrieval to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.</p>  <p>  During our work on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement we met all the groups.  Different groups seek different things but, ultimately, it is the quest for justice and to find out as much truth as possible.  It will not change things for them in terms of bringing loved ones back but with the Saville inquiry, we saw the very positive impact that truth recovery can bring.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams asked if the Minister would meet the Secretary for State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers.  He will do that in the short term.  Obviously, this will be a priority.</p>  <p>  The Deputies asked if this would be debated in the D&aacute;il.  I think there is a need to debate wider legacy issues and I will certainly ask my Whip to raise it at the Whips' meeting.  It is important to provide an opportunity to debate the wider issues of the past and legacy issues that so critically need to be the focus.</p>  <p>  Different parts of the world from Afghanistan to the Knesset look to the Northern Ireland peace model, including the east-west and North-South elements.  However, as legislators, we are all aware that the process is not finished.  As a Donegal man and a politician, I work very closely with my colleagues across the Border.  It is a process and the truth and legacy issues of the past are very much part of that.  I will certainly do my best to try to convey the need for having an open and wider debate.  There may be things we could look at differently.</p>  <p>  This may be an important juncture.  It is 40 years since the Kingsmills massacre and we are also discussing the Loughinisland tragedy, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Pat Finucane murder.  So many relatives are affected and we have to do justice to them.</p></speech>

That appalling act of inhumanity lives in all our memories and our sympathies remain with the victims and their families.</p><p>The 1998 Act was a robust response by the Oireachtas that made a series of amendments to the Offences against the State Acts to enhance the fight against terrorism.  Principally, the Act provided for: changes in the rules of evidence for certain offences under the Acts, including the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances; the creation of new offences, such as directing an unlawful organisation, the possession of certain articles and collecting information; and extending to 72 hours the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  That atrocity demanded a clear and resolute response from the State in defence of the desire of the vast majority of law-abiding people on this island to live their lives in peace.</p><p>Section 18 of the 1998 Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force.  By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2015, these sections were continued in force for a period of 12 months.</p><p>Prior to moving any motion for renewal, the Act requires that I lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions.  The present report covers the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and was laid before the House on 10 June 2016.</p><p>The report, based on information provided by the Garda authorities, sets out the numbers of instances in which the various sections in question have been used over the period.  The report also includes a table showing comparative usage for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  The report indicates that two sections, namely, sections 6 and 12, were not used during the reporting period in question.  However, it should not be inferred from this that these provisions are in some way redundant or unnecessary as the usage of the different sections varies from year to year.</p><p>It is the clear view of the Garda Commissioner that the Act continues to be a most important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report I have laid before the House.  They are, in short, a necessary legislative support in the fight against terrorism.</p><p> The fact remains that there is a real and lethal threat on this island from so-called dissident paramilitary groups that are fundamentally opposed to peace.  There has been and there will be no let-up in actions to tackle these groups.  My decision to bring the second Special Criminal Court into operation was made in response to this threat.  The court is now up and running.  This underlines my determination and that of the Government to deal with serious crime affecting the security of the State.</p> <p> The threat level in Northern Ireland is severe.  The appalling murder of a Northern Ireland prison officer, Adrian Ismay, earlier this year highlights the morally vacant and nihilistic path followed by these groups in direct opposition to the democratic wishes and efforts of the majority on this island.  The Garda authorities work tirelessly and in co-operation with their counterparts in the PSNI to counter the activities of these paramilitary organisations.  They deserve credit for their ongoing work.  A key priority for me is to combat the security threat.  The additional funding I have secured for the Garda Vote this year will be partly used to support measures against terrorism.  The Government and I are determined that these groups will not prevail.  I know we have the support of right-thinking people in this House.  It would be a happy day if legislative provisions such as these were no longer needed.  The sad truth is that such a day has not yet arrived.</p> <p> The second motion before the House proposes the continuation in force for another year of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  Section 8 provides for a limited number of serious organised crime offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court, thereby removing the possibility of jury-tampering or the intimidation of jurors or potential jurors.  The offences in question are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 71A of the 2006 Act relates to directing the activities of a criminal organisation, section 72 relates to participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation, section 73 relates to committing a serious offence for a criminal organisation and section 76 relates to liability for these offences committed by a body corporate.  The 2009 Act deems that these offences are scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  While this means the Special Criminal Court will hear trials for these offences, the Director of Public Prosecutions retains the power to direct that they should be tried in the ordinary courts.</p> <p> As I said in my remarks on the previous motion, section 8(6) of the 2009 Act provides that in order to assist the Oireachtas in its consideration of these matters, I must prepare and lay before both Houses a report on the operation of the section in question.  A report covering the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016 was laid before the House on 10 June last.  Section 8 was not used during the period in question.  It has not been used since 2009, but this neither invalidates the reasoning for having such a provision available to us for use in the appropriate circumstances nor diminishes its potential value in bringing organised criminals to justice.  In fact, the operation of this provision to date highlights the considered approach of the DPP in using her discretion to direct that cases should be tried in the ordinary courts where it is possible to do so.  Its critics might do well to bear in mind that this is positive proof of the balance that has been struck with this provision as a robust but proportionate power.  In the period under report, there were 17 arrests under two of the four offences covered by section 8, comprising seven arrests under section 72 and ten arrests under section 73.  Sections 71A and 76 were not used in the reporting period in question.  Of course, a variety of other provisions of the criminal law have been and are used against gangs.  My Department is examining whether other changes to the law might be made to tackle these gangs.  I will bring forward changes to the law shortly to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize the proceeds of crime.</p> <p> None of us can be under any illusions about the dangers to society from organised crime.  Recent gang-related murders in Dublin and the Dublin region have placed in stark relief the utter disregard of organised criminals for human life and the rule of law.  Counteracting this danger presents very real challenges for the State.  I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the necessary resources to confront these criminal thugs and bring them to justice.  As I have said, to this end I have secured substantial additional funding of &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the remainder of 2016.  These funds will, among other things, be used to support the necessary activities to target gang-related crime.  The Garda Commissioner has made clear to me her view that this provision will be required for some time to come.  As T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, I must have the utmost regard for her analysis.  Trial by jury is the standard for our system.  It should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can afford to ignore the threat to the rule of law from violent organised criminals who will stop at nothing to protect themselves and their profits.  We are duty-bound as legislators to ensure we respond robustly but proportionately to that threat.  I commend these motions to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400039#MM00200"><p>The purpose of the two resolutions before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this evening is to determine whether this House agrees to extend the operation of 12 sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for another 12 months.  I am conscious that many Members of the House have previously spoken and voted on the annual resolutions on these sections.  However, I am one of many new Members who have not yet had an opportunity to speak or vote on this question.  For that reason, it is important for all Members, particularly new Members, to inform themselves of the particular legislative sections we are being asked to consider extending over the next few days before we vote on this matter.  I believe the relevant sections of the 1998 amending legislation are proportionate and necessary provisions to deal with the threat from dissident republicanism and from international terrorism, as evidenced in the most appalling circumstances in Orlando over the weekend.</p>  <p>  It is important to set out some of the measures that are provided for in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  For example, the evidential provision in section 2 provides that an inference can be drawn against an accused person in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation if he or she fails to answer or gives "false or misleading" answers to any question.  Section 4 provides that evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation can be inferred from certain conduct.  Another interesting section of the 1998 Act is section 9, which makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of serious offences or securing the apprehension or conviction of another person.  Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention from 48 hours to 72 hours.  It is important to note this can happen on foot of the authorisation of a judge of the District Court only.  Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives.</p>  <p>  Section 14, which is a procedural section, is probably the most controversial aspect of what we are debating.  It makes the offences created under the sections I have mentioned scheduled offences for the purposes of the 1939 Act.  This means the offences in question can be heard by the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions directs otherwise.  It is important to note as well that there is a protection mechanism in this legislation.  Under section 18, these provisions have to come back before this House on an annual basis.  We are also being asked to extend the provisions of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which establishes certain offences in respect of organised crime.  The specific offences we have to renew on an annual basis are the section 71A offence of directing a criminal organisation, the section 72 offence of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation and the section 73 offence of committing an offence for a criminal organisation.</p>  <p>  I should say at the outset that Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting these resolutions because we believe the statutory provisions under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 both continue to be necessary because this island still faces a threat from dissident republicans.  Unfortunately, there are still people on this island who believe the objective of republicanism is to try to force one group of people to agree with them.  That is not the objective of republicanism.  The objective of republicanism is to unite Irish people, rather than to divide them.  One cannot unite Catholics, Protestants and dissenters by trying to bomb one of those groups into agreeing with one's political assessment.  Unfortunately, a minority on this island still believes this is the way forward.</p>  <p>  As I have said, we cannot ignore the role of international terrorism in the world.  We saw that over the weekend, tragically.  The horrific attacks in Orlando reminded us that certain people believe they can attack innocent individuals as a legitimate form of political warfare.</p><p>I am a civil libertarian and value the civil liberties we have.  However, as libertarians, we need to stand up and defend the liberty we all take for granted.  Sometimes that stance requires us to put through legislation which may make us uncomfortable.  Those who wish to protect and cherish the Good Friday Agreement and those of us who oppose political violence need to recognise that any regression into violence needs not simply to be opposed politically but also requires an immediate tough response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why we have these measures on the Statute Book.  Everyone hopes we do not have to use these provisions.  However, as seen in the report presented by the Minister, they are being used and, consequently, are necessary.</p> <p> The second resolution concerns the extension of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  This provision allows for certain criminal offences involving organised crime to be tried by the Special Criminal Court.  Article 38.5 of our Constitution provides that a person is entitled to be tried by jury but there are exceptions, such as in the case of minor offences.  Article 38.3 provides for trial by non-jury when a special court is established when it is considered that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the administration of justice.  The overwhelming number of criminal trials in this country are conducted before juries who perform their functions diligently and admirably, as was evident by the jury that concluded the longest criminal trial in the history of the State last week.</p> <p> However, there are some offences which cannot be tried by juries.  It would be unfair of this State to put juries in a position where they would be under threat because of the nature of the offences they would be trying.  We have an obligation to ensure our criminal justice system operates fairly.  That system will not operate fairly where a jury can be nobbled or intimidated.  Such a statutory regime is not unique to Ireland.  In Britain, section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for the capacity for a trial of a serious criminal charge to be heard without a jury and before a judge alone in circumstances where there is a threat the jury will be interfered with.  We should not countenance a situation where justice could be denied as a result of a jury being interfered with.</p> <p> Sometimes critics ask for the evidence of juries being intimidated.  Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it a criminal offence to intimidate jurors or witnesses.  Between 2006 and 2011, there were 50 convictions under section 41.  Unfortunately, the intimidation of jurors and witnesses is a fact of life.  We also need to remember that people involved in serious organised crime have previously murdered journalists and innocent bystanders who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Does anyone actually think that those responsible for the Regency Hotel shooting or gangland feuding around Dublin would not intimidate jurors if they thought it would stop them from going to jail?  I have no doubt that if any of them faced an ordinary jury that they would seek to threaten and intimidate individual jurors.  The advantage of intimidating a jury is that if one gets an acquittal, one cannot be tried for that offence again.</p> <p> As a legislator, neither I nor my party are prepared to allow a situation develop where ordinary citizens on the electoral register are asked to try cases when there is a serious risk that either they or their families would be subjected to intimidation and death threats during the course of a trial.  What we must recognise is that there are occasions - fortunately very few - where a trial by a non-jury court is necessary to protect the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.  However, there is an obligation also on those who challenge and condemn the Special Criminal Court to identify miscarriages of justice which have occurred in that court since 1998 and the introduction of these new measures.  Does anyone actually believe the four members of the Provisional IRA convicted by the Special Criminal Court for the killing Detective Garda Jerry McCabe were victims of a miscarriage of justice?  Does anyone believe those convicted by the Special Criminal Court of the murder of Veronica Guerin were victims of a miscarriage of justice?  Does anyone believe those convicted by the Special Criminal Court of the murder of Shane Geoghegan or Roy Collins were victims of a miscarriage of justice?  Does anyone believe the prominent republican, who was last year convicted by the Special Criminal Court of tax evasion, was a victim of a miscarriage of justice?</p> <p> It is not enough simply to state that democratic societies must have trial by jury.  The reason why trial by jury is provided for in our Constitution is because it ensures a fair criminal justice system.  The reason why our Constitution also provides for special courts in certain instances is because it similarly recognises that a fair criminal justice system can sometimes only be achieved through a non-jury court.  Accordingly, those who condemn and criticise the Special Criminal Court should identify the miscarriages of justice they say have arisen since 1998 when the new regime was introduced.  One cannot just say this system violates human rights without identifying some detrimental consequence to the human rights of an accused person which has occurred as a result of the use of the Special Criminal Court.</p> <p> Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect or utopian society.  We have dissident republicans or people who may attack us on behalf of international terrorists, as well as serious gangland criminals.  We need to mould our criminal justice system so we can adequately respond to them to defend our civil liberties.</p></speech>

The United Nations Human Rights Committee has also expressed its opposition to the ongoing use of the Special Criminal Court, outlining many reasons why it considers it is unnecessary, as well as many other civil liberties groups outside of the Chamber.</p>  <p>  It must be made clear that those responsible for the recent killings in the ongoing feud in Dublin or anyone involved in organised criminality must be brought to justice and face the courts.  If they are found guilty, then they must face the sentences handed down to them.  Both the Minister and Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan spoke about improved and increased resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help combat organised crime.  It should be noted, however, that in recent years it was the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which actually closed Templemore College and stopped recruitment of members to the force, a measure continued by the previous Government.  While we welcome the recent announcements of increased investment in tackling crime, it has to go beyond investing in armed response units.  If one wants long-term solutions to deal with organised criminality, we need to prevent our young people from going down that path in life.  We need to invest in programmes with a proven track record of working, such as the youth and juvenile diversion programmes.  These are areas where we need increased investment.</p>  <p>  I know all too well the scourge of drugs in communities, as I come from one which, for many years, has had a drug problem like many others.  One common element in all of these communities is that the legislation we are being asked to extend tonight for a further 12 months does not have the effect of ending criminality in our communities.  It has not worked, although it has been in existence for the past 20 years.  We must look at international best practice and what actually does work.  As I have said previously, what does work is increased investment at grassroots level in programmes which divert young people from straying down the path of criminality.  This legislation has failed and will continue to fail in this regard.</p>  <p>  On the point about jury intimidation, several years ago, the Keane murder case in Limerick had to be abandoned because the authorities could not get people to serve on the jury.  Rather than having the trial in a non-jury court, it was transferred to Dublin, where a jury was sworn in and those individuals who are involved in the murder in question were convicted.  It has been proved that juries can convict people involved in the highest levels of criminality.</p><p>In regard to witness intimidation, there are many models used in other countries throughout the world to protect witnesses.  The system we have in place to protect witnesses is not adequate and we need to improve it.</p> <p> We are certainly opposed to criminality, and we will support any measures which we feel will work towards ending criminality.  However, in our opinion, the motions we are being asked to extend today will not do that.  As I said at the outset, we are not alone in our opinion, given that the UN Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International and many other groups have stated this issue needs to be dealt with by this State.  There are also obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to address the issue of the Special Criminal Court.  As a co-guarantor of that Agreement, we cannot allow the Minister to forget that.</p></speech>

The elements of legislation proposed for renewal today come up every year.  I and my party colleagues are of the very strong view that it is neither appropriate nor justified to continue to renew this legislation.  It is important that we recognise that emergency legislation and the entire raft of so-called Offences Against the State Acts, dating from 1939 to 1972, and again since 1998, with this renewable series of sections, serve no good at this point and, arguably, as I have articulated on the floor of this House these past 19 years, have served no good at any time.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement, to which Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred, requires steps towards security normalisation, including the progressive elimination of the Acts' provisions.  It is not appropriate or justifiable to continue with this legislation, with the Good Friday Agreement now in place for a full 18 years.  No emergency exists that could possibly justify the continuation of the draconian measures contained in the sections that are up for renewal or, indeed, the rest of the Offences Against the State Acts as a compendium.  This legislation has a highly corrosive effect on human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in this State.</p>  <p>  I want to make it abundantly clear that Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty facilitating the introduction of good law to deal with any shortcomings that may exist.  Adequately resourcing the Garda and maintaining a consistent, committed strategy to tackling gang crime is what is needed.  I want to see gang crime and the fear it generates removed from our streets and from our midst.  These Acts and measures are clearly not working in that regard.  It is my firm belief that new thinking is required.  I look forward, in my capacity as the new Chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, to an opportunity to discuss these important matters further in a calm and measured way.</p>  <p>  Needless to say, and as has already been stated, we will not be supporting the renewal of these powers, which we have opposed year upon year.  I ask Members to reflect on the real and growing consensus at home and abroad in regard to the Special Criminal Court and related unnecessary legislation which should be removed.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the UN Human Rights Committee, some high-profile barristers - although clearly not all are of the same view - and other public commentators, as well as Sinn F&eacute;in, have all expressed concern in the past about its continuing existence.</p>  <p>  Again, it is critically important that I not only emphasise, but that the Minister and others fully understand and accept, that we will not be and most definitely are not soft on crime.  It is critical there is proper resourcing and legislation to provide for effective address of the abuses and abominable actions we have witnessed on our streets, not only in the recent past but going back over some considerable time.  We will not be supporting the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400041#OO00300"><p>I am speaking on behalf of our justice spokesperson, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and on behalf of the Labour Party.  While we intend to support these motions, I want to express serious reservations about the technical procedures we adopt.  In doing so, I recognise I am open to the charge that precisely the same procedures were adopted when we were in government.  That is true, and it is also true that Ministers tend to confine themselves to operating within their own departmental responsibilities rather than inquiring too closely into the business of their colleagues.  In any event, it is clear to me, from this side of the House, that we need to better arrange the role of the D&aacute;il in extending this legislation.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, I would make a comparison with another set of legislative measures with which everyone in this House is familiar - the FEMPI legislation.  Those Acts had a major impact on vested statutory and contractual rights.  When the first Act was introduced, it was recognised that the provisions might be vulnerable to constitutional challenge.  The swingeing measures could be justified only by reference to the emergency economic circumstances in which we found ourselves.  Hence, unusually, a series of facts are set out at the start of the Act, where it is recited that a serious disturbance in the economy and a serious deterioration in the revenues of the State had occurred, threatening the well-being of the community.  The purpose was to justify the measures taken in the Act as being necessary but also proportionate in order to address the economic crisis.</p>  <p>  We were also advised in government that, as economic conditions improved, we would have to unwind FEMPI.  We were told that this was not just sound policy but was constitutionally necessary.  As the facts on the ground diverted from the facts asserted in the recitals to the Acts, the risk would increase that the courts would look behind those recitals and assess the real facts.  If the facts on the ground no longer justified the measures taken, then the Acts were liable to be struck down as a disproportionate interference with constitutional rights.</p>  <p>  It seems to me that the comparison with the legislation we are considering now is instructive.  In both cases, the Oireachtas makes a factual judgment in order to justify what would otherwise be unconstitutional.  In both cases, the factual judgment has to be evidence-based.  In both cases, the risk is that the courts may be invited to look behind the facts as asserted by the Oireachtas.  In both cases, if the courts discover that the Oireachtas arrived at its conclusion on no evidence, inadequate evidence or out-of-date evidence, then the Act may be challenged and it may fall.</p>  <p>  What we are dealing with here is the fact that the Constitution entitles every citizen to trial by jury on a serious charge.  An exception can be made where it is determined in accordance with law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.  A person or body closer to the facts - such as the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Government - could have been chosen to make that determination.  However, under the 2009 Act, the Oireachtas abrogated to the two Houses themselves the responsibility for determining that the ordinary courts are inadequate to administer justice effectively.</p>  <p>  If the Houses are to perform this function properly, then the Houses must inform themselves as to the factual situation.  That our ordinary courts cannot adequately administer criminal justice is a strong assertion to make, to put it mildly.</p><p>Critically, it has the effect of abolishing what would otherwise be a constitutionally-vested right.  It is, therefore, it seems to me, a conclusion that can only be arrived at on foot of an examination of the evidence.</p> <p> In the case of the FEMPI Acts, we in this House were able to make a judgment call, based on the information available to us.  Members of the D&aacute;il vote expenditure and authorise taxation.  The Houses receive statutory monthly Exchequer reports and a wealth of other economic data.  The Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad would, therefore, be better placed than most to determine if there had been a serious deterioration in the revenues of the State.  We cannot say this about the adequacy of our criminal justice system.  We cannot say the determination we are being asked to make today is based on information that is generally available to us.  This is why the 2009 Act requires the Minister to prepare a report and lay it before the Houses prior to extending the legislation for yet another year.  The report was filed electronically last Friday.  It has a cover page and five other pages of double spaced typing.  It runs to a little over 1,200 words, less than the length of my contribution this evening.</p> <p> I am not being unfair to the report to summarise it as stating the Garda Commissioner believes the legislation has proved effective in tackling organised crime.  The Minister has stated her position on the report, which I do not have time to quote.  However, we are not being asked to decide whether this legislation is either important or effective.  Neither the Minister nor the Commissioner addresses the issue which we are, in fact, being asked to determine.  The net question before us is whether the ordinary criminal courts, sitting with juries, are inadequate to try these offences.  This is what we are asked to determine, and to determine not just in accordance with the 2009 Act but also in accordance with Article 38 of the Constitution.  If we rubber-stamp this process year after year, then I do not think it will be beyond the wit of defence counsel in the Special Criminal Court to argue that a valid extension of the Act is a prerequisite to the trial of these offences in that court; that a valid extension requires a determination in accordance with law that the ordinary courts cannot administer justice in these cases; that a valid determination in accordance with law as to the state of the justice system in the ordinary courts has to be an evidence-based determination; and that the two Houses have either no or inadequate evidence before them to enable them satisfactorily to arrive at any such determination.  I do not second guess the Minister and nor do I want to.  What I am arguing for is a realisation that if it is to fall to the two Houses to make this decision then it must be an informed decision.  This is not just good policy but it is also, it seems to me, a necessary precondition to ensuring the continuing constitutional validity of this legislation.</p> <p> Many of the provisions of the 1998 Act which we renew from year to year should no longer be renewed.  I say this not because I believe we should let them lapse but for the opposite reason.  Some of these provisions should long ago have become a permanent part of our criminal law.  I do not know why it strikes anyone as sensible, 18 years later, that we still annually renew a section that makes it an offence to direct an unlawful organisation.  It should have been dealt with.  Neither do I think anyone seriously disagrees that withholding information about serious offences should be a crime.  We need a serious look at what our permanent criminal code should say about offences against the State, public order and organised crime, and then disentangle anything that we consider exceptional and suited only to emergencies.  We should do this because we can create serious confusion and allow for errors, omissions and, possibly, injustices if we cannot arrive at a holistic overview.</p> <p> There are many other issues to do with the 1998 Act, which the Labour Party intends to put in writing to the Minister as we do not have time to discuss them.  I do not believe that either of these Acts entitles or enables us to repose unquestioning confidence in the assertions of the Minister.  The time has come for the House to schedule a proper debate on the issues, which I have outlined, involved in keeping this legislation in place.  This would allow all Members to have a serious and properly informed discussion.  On this occasion we will support the motion, but I ask the Minister to please take on board the points I have made.  I have raised a number of issues and the Houses need to bring forward new legislation to deal with many of the anomalies I have outlined.</p></speech>

It is deeply ironic they are supposed to be emergencies but they have become a norm in this country.  Every year the Minister tells us the threat is unchanged and is the same as it was the last time and that these are exceptional powers and must be retained.  Given what we have witnessed over the past year, with the rise in organised crime, is this failure of the legislation to in any way deal with this situation not even evidence enough on its own of how futile it is, not to mind the appalling trampling wholesale on the human rights of individuals for it?  Has the penny not dropped, given what has happened here while the Government has been utilising this legislation, that a different approach will have to be necessary?</p><p>We have to start with the international human rights institutions, the United Nations and the Council of Europe, which have repeatedly raised serious questions about the proportionality of Irish emergency powers legislation in this regard, particularly the area of non-jury courts.  Too often in Ireland, when we get international human rights reports, be they on crime, abortion or whatever, we feel we are an exception and they are things we can ignore.  This is not good enough, because human rights are supposed to be universal and applied in all situations.</p><p>This year we are voting again on whether to renew these exceptional powers, on the heels of one of the most horrendous explosions of violence on the streets of Dublin.  It has been a horrifying few months, but what is striking is how little effect the so-called emergency legislation has had in dealing with these issues.  However, year upon year we are asked to retain this bad law.  Put simply, law and order responses on their own do not work and us ratifying again these appalling human rights violations will not make a single person in Dublin, or in any other part of the country, safer in bed tonight.</p><p>As long as we are following a doomed war on drugs, which is essentially a licence for crime gangs to print money and facilitating the drugs trade on the one hand and perpetuating disadvantage in parts of our city on the other, then the problems of crime are inevitably going to be there.  We only need to take a look at the north inner city, the area of the latest rounds of violence, where we see huge levels of male unemployment.  In some areas it is at 70%.  One third of the areas in question are disadvantaged and 10% are extremely disadvantaged.  Rather than dealing with the issues, we cut funding to vital projects in these areas.  If we really wanted to deal with crime and organised crime this is where we would start.  Take the words of Johns Hopkins and the <i>Lancet</i>Commission, hardly a bunch of firebrand radicals, who had this to say in their report on public health in March this year:</p><blockquote>Policies meant to prohibit or greatly suppress drugs ... are portrayed and defended vigorously by many policy makers as necessary to preserve public health and safety, and yet the evidence suggests that they have contributed directly and indirectly to lethal violence, communicable-disease transmission, discrimination, forced displacement, unnecessary physical pain, and the undermining of people's right to health.</blockquote><p>It also states, &quot;Drug policy that is dismissive of extensive evidence of its own negative impact and of approaches that could improve health outcomes is bad for all concerned&quot;.  It states a far more serious approach is decriminalising drugs as a gradual move towards regulated drugs markets.</p><p>That is where we should be if we want to talk about really dealing with crime, not flexing our muscles in terms of law and order and the provisions before us today that are non-compliant with human rights.</p> <p> The Special Criminal Court is in part at the heart of some of these emergency powers.  It has been repeatedly criticised by the UN Human Rights Committee for its lack of democracy.  The UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteur for human rights defenders has drawn particular attention to the court.  He said that it needed to be carefully monitored and that the council was very concerned about the recent expansion of the Special Criminal Court to include organised crime.  Bodies such as Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and so on have repeatedly criticised this human rights violation.  There are a number of very worrying aspects to it.  The fact that the Special Criminal Court has jurisdiction over both scheduled and non-scheduled offences is a particular problem.  It might be a little dramatic, but what we are proposing here is a provision whereby somebody could be scooped up, arrested, charged with anything at all and have the DPP decide on whether to send them to a non-jury trial with no obligation to explain why and where they can be tried and convicted by judges who are essentially unaccountable.  That might be a bit exaggerated but it is the reality in the case of some of these courts.</p> <p> The justification of jury intimidation is laughable because we know there are ways of dealing with this without the jury being present: having it watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television, anonymising juries and so on.  Even if the Government were not willing to do that, however, why is the problem of the blanket ban on juries not even considered as it is, say, in the UK, where the possibility of jury tampering and the risk have to be evaluated first, rather than having a blanket ban and a presumption of intimidation in that regard.  In those cases there can be that violation of human rights only if other reasonable, preventative steps such as police protection and so on cannot be taken.  We should consider these systems.  If the Government were really worried about protecting juries, that is what it would consider.</p> <p> We cannot ignore the reality that tonight, for example, a young person, Donal &Oacute; Coisdealbha, is spending another night in Portlaoise Prison, having been there now for over a year.  Mr. &Oacute; Coisdealbha was arrested on 13 May and charged with membership of an illegal organisation along with other offences which have never been made clear to him.  He had never been charged with anything or involved in violent behaviour or anything like that.  Before he was arrested he was working full-time.  He finished college the previous year.  He had no convictions or anything like that.  In view of the category under which he was charged, however, he will face trial in the Special Criminal Court.  He cannot get bail and it is likely that he will spend two to three years in prison before he will even be brought to a non-jury trial.  I do not want to live in a society that has that kind of repressive legislation because it does not work, apart from violating human rights.</p> <p> I find it utterly reprehensible that not only is the Government doing this, but it does not need to do it, not only because it is ineffective, but because it has other alternatives.  If the Minister is really serious about dealing with organised crime, I do not know why she has not, for example, dealt with and initiated the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigations Team) Act, which has been on the Statute Book since 2004.  The Act gives the power to the Garda Commissioner to ask another EU country to establish a joint investigation team with another European jurisdiction, but the Government has never initiated it.  Why is the Government not linking up with the Spanish authorities in this regard, given that crime is global, and initiating this joint investigations team, JIT, provision that is already published, rather than asking us to ignore human rights considerations and again nod through repressive legislation which violates human rights and, sickeningly, does not actually work.  It is appalling that we are being asked to do this in the absence of other legislation on the Statute Book being invoked, but more particularly when we are discussing crime and the drugs industry being at the heart of that and we are failing to deal with issues surrounding the criminalisation of drugs, that whole market which is being left to people to profit from, which is one of the key motivators of crime and violence in this city.</p></speech>

Let us state it boldly as it is: the war on drugs has failed and the war on gangland criminality via the Special Criminal Court or other repressive legislation has failed.  We are just as concerned as the Minister and, in many cases I suspect, more concerned in that some of the Deputies on the left represent some of the poorest and most disadvantaged areas where the problems of drugs and gangland crime are felt most acutely.  We do not believe that increasing or retaining very repressive powers for the State - which include eliminating the use of jury trial or extraordinary powers in terms of the right to detain people, to infer guilt and so on, which go beyond the normal process of justice - are justified or effective.  They have not been to date and there is no reason and no evidence to suggest they will be in the future.</p>  <p>  Mark Kelly of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties rightly described how "some electioneering politicians" were using the Regency attack as a "political football", and that is what is going on.  We are all appalled by the gangland killings that we have seen recently and we are all acutely concerned for the communities, the families, the areas and so on that are affected by these problems and terrified by them and by the deeper, underlying problems of drug addiction, disadvantage, deprivation and so on that fuel this kind of gangland activity.  However, none of this will deal with the problem.  It has not in the past and there has been no serious evidence provided by the Government, even though it supports the retention of these powers, that it has done so because no such evidence exists.  If we are serious, therefore, and if we are going to move beyond political posturing or, as Mark Kelly said, "electioneering", then we need to recognise that a radical departure in policy is necessary.</p>  <p>  To me it is blindingly obvious.  The Mafia in the United States was created by the prohibition of alcohol.  The Mafia came from the misguided belief that prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcohol would eradicate it, and it did not.  Instead it produced a massive criminal network which continues to dog the United States to the present day, and eventually in the United States they realised prohibition was not the way forward.  That does not mean advocating excessive alcohol use or believing alcohol is a wonderful thing or not recognising that alcohol addiction and all the problems that come from it are a major problem.  However, there was a final recognition that trying to ban it did not work and made the problem worse, and that is exactly the situation with drugs.  There is no question about it.  I am not even sure if hippies believe that drug use is a great thing.  Nobody believes that.  Trying to ban it, however, and driving it underground and into criminal networks has failed and has produced a worse problem in terms of the criminal networks that it has spawned and the gangland violence that is associated with it, so we need a bit of political courage and political honesty to say we need to move away from that failed policy.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the only argument that is put forward for the Special Criminal Court is the intimidation of juries, and that is a serious issue.</p><p>Across the world, there are plenty of examples of how we can retain jury courts, which are a hallmark and benchmark of the most advanced form of justice we have.  To disregard it is very dangerous while there are other ways to retain jury courts which can safeguard the safety of juries.  This is the road we must take and it is why we oppose the motion.</p></speech>

This year, we will oppose it again.  The measures were introduced in the wake of the Omagh bombing, which saw widespread shock and revulsion on the part of people on both sides of the Border and in all communities.  This public opposition pressurised the Real IRA and other paramilitaries and forced them back.</p>  <p>  The shock of the Omagh bombing and people's desire for an end to attacks such as these and justice for the victims was cynically exploited by the political establishment to erode democratic rights.  Although the legislation was significant, it was rushed through the D&aacute;il in one day.  Incredibly, the text of the Bill was made available to Deputies only hours before it was voted on.  The measures represent a serious attack on some of the key basic democratic principles in a bourgeois democracy.  The right to trial by jury, the right to silence and the right to call witnesses in a trial are impinged on.  There is also a lengthening of the time for which a person can be detained after arrest, a shift in the burden of proof and the provision that the mere opinion of a garda is to be treated as evidence.  These offences add to the already draconian offences against the State legislation.</p>  <p>  When the legislation was rushed through Parliament, we were told it was a necessary evil that was needed in order to combat paramilitary organisations.  On publication of the legislation, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, described the measures as draconian.  The Minister who introduced the legislation, John O'Donoghue, described the Act as harsh during the debate.  In 1998, the impression was given that this attack on civil liberties would be a temporary measure.  However, each year we have been told that this harsh, draconian law is still needed due to threats posed by sectarian paramilitaries, criminal gangs or international terrorism.</p>  <p>  The history of the Troubles is one in which the British State introduced measures such as internment and the Diplock courts, and repressive measures were also introduced in this State.  We saw the deployment of troops and the militarisation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC.  None of these measures ended the conflict.  Neither were ceasefires by the paramilitaries brought about due to repressive legislation.  As I alluded to earlier, regarding the pushing back of the real IRA and others in 1998, it was the opposition to sectarian conflict by working class communities, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, that pushed back the paramilitaries and prevented escalation into all-out conflict.</p>  <p>  Draconian legislation is not the answer.  It is counterproductive.  Terrorism and crime are fuelled by a number of factors.  Poverty, injustice, anger against discrimination and racism, outrage against imperialist wars, and alienation from the political establishment can be exploited to recruit young people and direct them down the reactionary dead ends of terrorism and crime.  People should not trust the capitalist establishment with these laws.  Attacks on democratic rights brought in under the guise of combatting terrorism and serious crime have been continually used as a weapon to clamp down on people's right to protest and against social movements.</p>  <p>  An example of this is graphically seen in the US, where the Patriot Act has been used to cut across dissent and protest.  In France, following last November's attacks, the state of emergency imposed by President Hollande was used to forbid protests and gatherings, including those of striking workers and social movements, such as Nuit Debout.  In Belgium, anti-fascist demonstrations were forbidden following the attacks there in March.  These draconian laws occur in the context of the generalised attack on democratic rights.  The imposition of austerity measures against the will of the vast majority has seen democratically elected governments overturned and economic blackmail being used to push mass poverty on millions.  In Ireland, the Garda and the courts have been used against the movement against water charges, with nearly 200 arrested for peacefully protesting against metering.  We are opposed to repressive measures of this kind and we also call for the repeal of all of these repressive laws.</p></speech>

He is one of our best historians and I listened with interest to such an impartial and reasoned observer.  He was superb.  He said something one does not often hear.  He said that for all our stupidity and failings, we were battered but we stood back up.  We looked up and out and maintained that value of resilience and strength.  Professor Lee said in the modern world we are a success.  I agree, for all our failings and stupidity.  At a recent meeting I was asked what I liked most about Ireland and what I thought was the reason for this success.  I think it is because we have an unarmed police force and an independent judicial system.</p>  <p>  Our system has flaws.  There are instances when our garda&iacute; are not straight an our courts get it wrong.  However it is a strength.  We do not stand up for our democratic institutions enough.  Our political system is one of the other strengths, including this talking shop.  Talking shops are not bad things.  Those who give out most about talking shops are those in the media who make their money out of talking to people.  We are part of the institutional fabric.  I like the fact that this is a citizens' assembly, as Deputy Coppinger said earlier.  We are a representative body.</p>  <p>  The legal system is similar.  Without a detailed knowledge or understanding of it, I see from afar that a jury is a fundamental cornerstone of the strength of an independent system.  The Oireachtas is similar, albeit we are elected while a jury is selected on a random basis.  A jury is a cornerstone of a republican, democratic, constitutional system.  We rely on juries in ways that sometimes surprise us.  There have been recent cases in which everybody might have expected the politically correct thing would be a certain judgment, but in which juries have surprised us.  Having heard the evidence over a long period, they have refused to convict someone, whereas if the trial had been judged by other means, the accused probably would have been convicted.  I stand by the concept of jury trials and the independence and strength of our judicial system being based on our adhering to certain intrinsic values and qualities.</p>  <p>  It is understandable, and when in government the Green Party was involved in passing a motion on the legislation.  It is tricky.  One is in government and is faced with gangland murders, evidence is presented that suggests jury trials are not possible due to intimidation of witnesses, and one responds in legislation.  It is appropriate that both pieces of legislation have the safety clause that they must go back to the Oireachtas which considers whether we will continue with these unusual provisions, which are breaches of the basic principles around evidence, jury trial, being able to draw inference and being able to imprison people for a period of time.  It is appropriate that we consider it.</p>  <p>  I have listened to what some of the previous speakers have said and have come to a common understanding that the pieces of legislation do not necessarily guarantee us the security they were introduced with the very good intention of providing.  I agree with the speakers who see that the cause of the gangland problems in our city is the ability of gangs to make huge amounts of money from trading in drugs and that a far more effective approach to undermining this undoubted threat to our security and peace would be to change the laws around how we criminalise the possession or use of certain drugs.</p><p>We must be careful with it because, as Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, no Member will argue that would not have consequences - not health reasons - which should be taken into account.  However, it would fundamentally be a better approach to take at this time to tackle the gangs rather than relying so much on different judicial proceedings to prosecute them, an approach that does not seem to work.</p> <p> Similarly, when it comes to offences against the State, it is more difficult because, in some ways, it goes to the cornerstone of the State.  If there are people with a fundamentally different view from the one I articulated - the view Professor Joe Lee expressed in the programme I referenced - and they believe the State needs to be changed radically through a revolutionary process or that, in any way, terrorist attacks can be justified in the name of an alterative vision for the State, that is a more difficult issue.  However, the ultimate way to police against this and to defeat such a mentality is to adhere to the values of the Constitution and the inherent freedoms we expect the legal system to provide for us.  The ongoing existence of these provisions in the Act is not worth the undermining of these basic principles of the democratic constitutional structures within the State.</p> <p> The original crime which resulted in the instigation of this legislation was the Omagh bombings, as well as the failure of the policing system, and, despite the introduction of the legislation and doing what we could to support a worthy approach to bringing the people who had been involved in that terrible heinous crime to justice, we have been unable to do so.  I believe in the structures of good policing in our independent judicial system.  The provisions set out in this legislation which the Minister is asking us to retain will not necessarily assist us and the Green Party will not support their continued use.  We should see how we survive without them.</p></speech>

Being in government I suspect I now see it a little differently, although I have always been in favour of the Special Criminal Court.  However, I recognise the threat as being somewhat more immediate and difficult to oppose without these measures than perhaps I did when I was on the other side of the House.  I take Deputy Eamon Ryan's point about what Professor Lee said about how Ireland had achieved so much despite all of its flaws.</p>  <p>  It is good that the Government has decided, for the first time, to allow the motion to be taken without the use of a guillotine.  It has been passed every year following a 45-minute debate, which was not a debate.  It has been rushed through at this time of year as an embarrassment - the Government parties wanted to get it out of the way because they were ashamed that it had to be passed annually and did not want it to be recognised as a big issue, which it is.  It is a major issue when a democratic country decides to suspend one of the pillars of democracy to which we aspire and for which many people fought.  We all have in common the need to support the right of people to a trial by their peers.  Happily, this year the debate will continue until every Member has contributed and we have had a civilised discussion about what the legislation means.</p>  <p>  The Government that introduced the original Bill in 2008 and those which used the suspension of human rights ever since did so reluctantly.  No Member likes this on the Statute Book.  Nobody has an ambition to lock people up at will or to send them to the Special Criminal Court, while suspending the normal democratic values and legal tenets over which we stand, but we do it.  The only argument is whether it is right to do so and whether it works.  Those who say it is not right say it does not work, while those who say it is say it does work.  I am not sure whether it does works, but it is right.  When I think of the Omagh bombings which formed the original basis for the Act, I think of something absolutely and utterly horrific.  I think of people who have absolutely no respect whatsoever for the rights of others and who are prepared to intimidate witnesses and jurors.  When that is the scenario which is not as relevant today as it was, thank God - it applies to organised crime also where people show the same oblivious disregard for the lives of others - we have to ask ourselves whether the people concerned are entitled to the privilege of enjoying democratic rights others have.  While 99.9% of people in the country are imperfect and do things to each other, of which we do not approve, they do not go around killing others or intimidating witnesses and jurors at will and get away with it.  If we donate that luxury to them, are we legally giving them the green light to do the same thing again?  They are living in a world which is completely and utterly different from the one in which the rest of us live.  It is a world of total and utter immorality.  They have absolutely no respect for the lives or human rights of others, yet some say they should be given the privileges for which they so noticeably have contempt and should be let go for the sake of a sacred democratic principle in which they have no interest whatsoever.  It is the kind of luxury we cannot afford.  We then have to ask the next question.  If we refuse to impose these new laws of evidence and witness protection, will we allow them as a result to walk free and commit more murders?  That is a price which is too high to pay.</p></speech>

Outside this city in the rest of the State, the average cost of renting per year is &euro;8,772.  A middle income working family paying this level of rent simply would not be able to afford to save for a deposit to purchase a home.  A low income working family paying this level of rent would spend as much as 60% of their disposable income on their monthly rent.  A family on rent supplement could pay up to &euro;900 per month from an income of less than &euro;1,800.  A family on &euro;188 per week jobseeker's allowance in receipt of the housing assistance payment could pay up to &euro;500 a month.</p><p>According to the<i>Daft.ie</i>rental report published two months ago, rents have risen on average across the State by 9% in the past 12 months.  According to the Private Residential Tenancies Board report published last week, in parts of Galway, Kildare, Meath and Laois, the increase has been between 15% and 19%.  In almost every single part of the country rents are spiralling out of control and this is happening at a time when inflation in the economy is virtually at 0%.</p><p>The consequences of these rent rises are not trivial.  Parents are having to decide between paying rent and paying for other essential household items.  In some cases, families are being made homeless because of inability to pay rents or to secure rental accommodation.  Out of control rents are having a crushing financial impact on some of the State's poorest households and thousands of children are affected, spending up to two years in some instances in emergency accommodation or living in households with ever deeper levels of income poverty.  The scale of this crisis cannot be underestimated and, in Sinn F&eacute;in's view, the time for action is now.</p><p>We know the causes of the crisis in the private rental sector.  For decades, successive Governments have failed to build real social housing.  Families who should have been living in council housing were forced into the private rental sector.  This pushed up the price of rents for all.  Successive Governments also failed to ensure an adequate supply of student accommodation and affordable homes for first-time buyers.  Again, tens of thousands of households were forced into the private rental sector, which pushed up rents.  An ever-increasing number of home evictions are adding another layer to the housing crisis.  As many as 150,000 households are living in the private rental sector when they should be living elsewhere in our housing system.  In our view, this is a damning indictment of Government failure on a massive scale.</p><p>The D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homelessness will report this Friday.  It will lay out detailed recommendations on how to address the structural causes of our housing crisis.  Hopefully, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will include all our recommendations in his action plan on housing due later this summer.  Many of the recommendations will take some time to implement but in the immediate term measures must be taken to stem the flow of families into homelessness and to relieve the pressure on hard-pressed renting families.</p><p>In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, rent certainty is key to this.  This Bill is very simple in its objective.  It seeks to link rent reviews to the consumer price index.  It is not rent control.  It is not arbitrary.  It is in the common good and it is based on principles of social justice.  I do not believe there is any constitutional impediment to this measure.  The Bill seeks to ensure stability for renters and for landlords.  It would prevent volatile shocks in the rental market.  If the previous Government had introduced this measure earlier in its term, score of families who are now homeless would still be in their private rented accommodation.  Instead, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, blocked the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, from introducing this measure and matters have got much worse.</p><p>In drafting this Bill, I have kept it as simple as possible.  It seeks simply to link rent reviews to the consumer price index.  Some Deputies may argue that there is a better index to which to link rents.  Others may want to see a time limit or periodic reviews built into rent certainty measures and others may want to see reference rents accompanying rent certainty.  I and my colleagues on this side of the House are open to persuasion on all of these issues.  I would say to those Deputies that if this is what they want, let this Bill pass Second Stage and propose amendments when we come to deal with Committee Stage.</p><p>I listened carefully to An Taoiseach earlier today during Leaders' Questions.  He said Fine Gael would not support the Bill as it was pre-empting the report of the D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homelessness and the Minister, Deputy Coveney's action plan on housing.  He did not have the same problem with his colleagues announcing a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing fund today despite the fact that it is an issue also under consideration in the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness to be launched on Friday.  An Taoiseach said Sinn F&eacute;in's refusal to agree to an adjournment of the debate tonight was playing politics.  Let me say very clearly in this House tonight that I doubt the thousands of families struggling with out of control rents would agree. </p><p>I also read with interest Deputy Cowen's comments in the media this afternoon.  He accused Sinn F&eacute;in of trying to gazump and undermine the work of the Dail Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  He described our moving of this Bill as &quot;gutter politics&quot;.  If the Deputy was in the Chamber, I would ask him directly if he really meant to use the term &quot;gutter politics&quot; on such an important issue.  Yet like An Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, Fianna F&aacute;il has a Private Members' motion on housing in the Seanad tomorrow, which makes five specific recommendations, all of which are also matters under consideration by the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  There is no talk of gazumping or undermining the committee there.</p><p>During statements on housing in the D&aacute;il last March, Deputy Cowen called for the introduction of rent certainty.  Only last Sunday on &quot;The Week in Politics&quot; his colleague, Deputy Sean Fleming, said that &quot;linking rent to inflation needs to happen straight away&quot; to keep families in their homes.  Fianna F&aacute;il's refusal to support this Bill is genuinely hard to understand and deeply disappointing.  I suspect what is happening here is that Fine Gael remains opposed to rent certainty.  Fianna Fail, as part of its agreement with the Government is helping it avoid any embarrassment.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are asking us to wait.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, on &quot;Drivetime&quot; this evening suggested that we may return to this issue in the autumn.</p></speech>

In my view, this is simply not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's intention in tabling this Bill is to advance what we believe is a sensible policy that urgently needs to be introduced.  I make no apologies for doing that here tonight.  The only gazumping going on here is in the private rental sector as desperate families are being forced by Government inaction to outbid each other to put a roof over their heads.  The only people being undermined are low and middle income families trapped - again because of a Government inaction - in over-priced rental accommodation or, even worse, in inadequate emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.</p>  <p>  The choice before Deputies this evening is very simple.  If they are opposed to rent certainty, then they should vote against, or abstain on, this Bill but if they believe that rent certainty has a role to play in tackling the housing and homeless crisis, then they should vote for our Bill and give some hope to the thousands of families who tonight desperately need it. </p></speech>

This is an important Bill and I hope the D&aacute;il will agree that it is a component in tackling the unparalleled housing and homelessness crisis prevalent in the State at this time.</p><p>If they do not agree to it tonight, or when we vote on it, I hope they will at some time in the future.</p> <p> This is a very commonsensical Bill which seeks to provide greater protection for both tenants and landlords against volatility in the rental market by linking any increases or decreases in rental value with the CSO's consumer price index.  Rents have risen by 10% across the State since this time last year and they continue to rise as the rent certainty measures introduced by the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, last year have abjectly failed adequately to address the rental crisis.  This has all been well documented.  The Daft quarterly rental report last month showed that average rents across the State are now more than &euro;1,000 per month, which is an increase of nearly 9%.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board quarterly rent index released earlier this month shows that rents across the State are 8.6% higher in the first three months of the year than in the same period last year.  Dublin has been particularly affected with average rental prices reaching just short of &euro;1,100 at the end of March.  This has had a major knock-on effect on growth in rents outside the capital as people move into north Leinster, including into my own constituency of Louth and east Meath where rents are soaring to sustainable levels.  Both counties have seen the largest rent increases across the State.  No category of rental property in County Louth has seen an increase of less than 10% while rents in Meath have risen even higher by almost 15%.  These findings were backed up by another report of the Private Residential Tenancies Board which finds that both counties have seen the highest rent increases in the State.</p> <p> As with other Members, my office deals with the human outworkings of this crisis every day.  There are landlords who will not respond to requests for a viewing by those who would need HAP while adults live in overcrowded conditions because they cannot afford to rent.  Some of them are in their mid-30s.  Families have been given notice to vacate homes, cannot find other accommodation and are faced with homelessness.  All of this is a direct by-product of the fact that it is now more expensive to rent a home in Dublin than it was during the boom in 2007.</p> <p> We need solutions and, as legislators, we have a responsibility to find them.  This Bill is a start.  There is no logic to Fianna F&aacute;il not supporting this Bill.  Rent control provides certainty for both the landlord and the tenant and it is used in many other European Union member states as a practical solution to tackle out of control rent increases and decreases.  The Bill would allow the same for citizens of the State, many of whom simply cannot afford to pay these rents.  This has been compounded by the lack of social housing construction as well as a lack of affordable housing which has kept more people in the private rented sector.  All of these issues must be resolved.  This Bill is a positive step in that direction.</p> <p> I appeal to all Members to support the Bill, in particular Fianna F&aacute;il Members.  The soldiers of destiny come here every day.  They rail against something the Government has or has not done in line with popular opinion and then they vote with the Government or in its interests in the lobbies.  It is an absurd position.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members are masters at playing this kind of politics and their new politics looks very like old politics to me.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is backing up Fine Gael in pursuit of a bad policy agenda which is actively creating greater stress and unfairness in the lives of citizens.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot distance itself from that and say it is facilitating.  It is as complicit in the decisions and failures of this Government as Fine Gael and the smattering of Independents propping it up.</p> <p> Ba mhaith liom an Bille seo a mholadh os comhair na D&aacute;la.

This emphasises the nature of the problem in the State.  Rent certainty can protect against homelessness as it gives certainty to the tenants and a safety net against one of the most serious deprivations in life, which is to lose one's home.  Rent is one of the major outgoings of any household.  As such, it governs other payments and so much of people's daily living expenses.  We have seen a rise in rents with zero protection for tenants.  The Bill put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in provides against gross, inconsistent and erratic variations in individual rents.  We are seeing directly on the ground the consequences of large rises in rents faced by our constituents and the impact they have on people's lives.  In north County Dublin, taking in my own constituency of Dublin Bay North, rents have risen at an average rate of 10.2% compared to the same period last year.  With the rise in property prices and the shortage of social housing, people are left with only one option, which is to rent.  They are being placed at the whim of the market and private landlords.  If rents rise suddenly and substantially, where are people to turn?  This has forced many of our people into homelessness.</p>  <p>  The Bill can provide families with a degree of certainty in regard to the very basic matters of a roof over their heads and their weekly incomes.  What is the purpose of a Government if not to ensure that it looks after the needs of its citizens?  A starting point should be the very basic need for housing assistance and creating stability in the market for the protection of citizens.</p></speech>

One only has to walk out the gates of Leinster House to see people sleeping in doorways, trying to stay warm and dry.  I had a mother of six children in my constituency office just this week, one of whom is seriously ill.  She has been living in a bed and breakfast establishment for the last 12 months and has been told by South Dublin County Council that it will be at least six more months before she will get any offer at all.  That is the context for tonight's Bill.  The Bill will not end our housing crisis but it is a significant and essential part of the housing conundrum.</p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Rent Certainty Bill 2016 would, if enacted, provide greater protection for both tenants and landlords from volatility in the rental market as it will link any rent increases or decreases to the consumer price index.  This will prevent dramatic increases or decreases in average rents, which now stand at more than &euro;1,000 per month.  The lack of real social housing units has created a deficit in supply which has pushed more and more families into the private rented sector on which other speakers have commented.  The inaction of successive Governments has created the perfect storm with longer waiting lists, more people losing their homes and no new social housing units becoming available, certainly in the short term.  This has been coupled with a lack of affordable housing in the private rented market, especially in Dublin, which has kept more people trapped in the rented sector.  For many, rents are now unaffordable.  More low-income families are being pushed into homelessness as rent supplement and HAP levels fail to keep up with rising rent levels.  Our Bill will help to achieve rent certainty, allowing renters to plan and bring greater stability to their lives and those of their families.  Why would anybody oppose this Bill?</p></speech>

There is some merit in this Bill in the context of the broader debate on the rental market.  However, having regard to the all-party report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness to be published later this week and the Government's action plan for housing, which is due next month, supporting the Bill's passage through Second Stage now would be premature.  For this reason, if Sinn F&eacute;in chose to adjourn the debate tonight, I would happily facilitate that and pick up the debate at a later stage when we would have an opportunity for a more informed discussion.</p> <p> I was appointed as Minister with specific responsibility for housing, planning and local government to focus intensively on the challenge of tackling the housing crisis.  I have been tasked with preparing an action plan for housing within the Government's first 100 days, working with Government colleagues, Oireachtas colleagues and key stakeholders.  This plan must map out a vision for the evolution of the housing sector over the coming years, including the rental sector in which one fifth of the population now resides.  The rental sector has faced considerable pressures in recent years and continues to suffer from an acute supply challenge, which is placing many families under severe pressure and, in extreme cases, at risk of homelessness.</p> <p> A strong and viable private rental sector can play an important role in the housing market and the wider economy.  It can provide a housing option for those who either cannot or choose not to enter the owner-occupied market but who still have sufficient means to meet their own accommodation needs.  It can provide a housing option to meet rising demand and can promote flexibility and better alignment to a more mobile labour market, making it easier for individuals and families to pursue job opportunities or adapt their accommodation to changing family circumstances.  It can also reduce the macroeconomic risks of an over-reliance on home ownership.  In the past decade, we have seen examples of states with relatively large private rental sectors, such as Germany and Switzerland, being better insulated against housing booms that states with smaller rented sectors, such as Ireland and Spain, suffered as a result of.</p> <p> The rental sector has traditionally been regarded as a transitional one in which households either wait while saving to buy their own homes or trying to access permanent social housing.  It has been perceived as a stopover, not a destination of choice, but this traditional picture is changing.  The rental sector has doubled in size in the past two decades.  Almost one fifth of the population now lives therein.  Growth in the sector has been driven by a range of factors, including a reducing reliance on home ownership as a tenure of choice and demographic influences, such as immigration from the EU and decreasing household sizes.  It has also been influenced by a contribution made by the rental sector on delivering social housing supports for low-income households through the rental accommodation scheme, the social housing leasing initiative and, more recently, the housing assistance payment, HAP.  While I favour a dramatic increase in social housing stock, the private rental sector will continue to play an important role in the immediate term while we try to increase stock levels.</p> <p> Notwithstanding this, the rental sector is not yet on a truly viable or sustainable path.  Severe supply pressures, rising rents, security of tenure issues, limited but nonetheless unacceptable examples of poor accommodation and a shortage of professional institutional landlords are impediments to delivering on a strong, stable and modern rental sector that offers real choice for individuals and households while contributing to economic growth.</p> <p> Regarding rent levels, much has been done through last November's rent certainty and supply package, which introduced important amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015.  The new rules mean that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies has increased from 12 months to 24 months.  This will apply for a four-year period until 2019.  In addition, the minimum notice period for new rent has increased from 28 days to 90 days, and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced.  I accept that these measures are not enough and that we must do more, but we must undergo a process before the right decisions can be guaranteed.</p> <p> While I appreciate the motivation behind Deputy &Oacute; Broin's Bill, the proposal to tie rents strictly to the consumer price index, CPI, would break the link with the fundamental mechanism for determining rent under the Act, which is prevailing market rents.  On the face of it, CPI-linked rent regulation looks attractive, particularly for tenants, but there are issues that need to be considered carefully.  For example, a properly functioning rental market needs to offer something for landlords as well as tenants.  Saying this might not be popular but without them, we do not get the supply that we need.  With current inflation levels running at close to zero, a rent linked to the CPI would be a disincentive to future investment in the market.  It could even force existing suppliers to exit the market, exacerbating an already acute supply shortage.  Moreover, where rent regulation is too strong, it can lead to market segmentation by creating lock-in effects, black market distortions and supply fall-off.  We all know the stories of rent top-ups being paid under the table so that people can stay in their premises.  We must not facilitate the continuation of that practice.</p> <p> In limiting rent reviews to every two years, the Government decided on an approach that would bring increased stability and predictability for tenants without changing the fundamental mechanism for the setting and reviewing of rent as laid down in the 2004 Act.  Recent data from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, index appear to show that these changes are beginning to have some effect, with the rate of rent increases moderating in Dublin and nationally in the first quarter of this year.  However, I fully support the view that more is to be done if we are to allow the sector to evolve into a mature and stable one in which there is a true balance between the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.  While the most recent data provide some encouragement, the sector remains fragile and unbalanced, with rents continuing to rise at unsustainable levels.  However, we must avoid taking actions that could further destabilise it, contribute to a withdrawal of supply or discourage future investment.</p> <p> The key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through a dramatic increase in housing supply.  Last year, we effectively built approximately one third of what we needed to build.  The figure was far less over the past decade.  Accelerating the supply of housing is a priority for the Government.  Accordingly, a key priority for the programme for Government is the preparation and publication of an action plan for housing.  That plan is being drafted with the input from a number of key Departments and will draw on the work of the special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, the report on which I look forward to considering and which I understand we will have by the weekend.</p> <p> The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to reviewing the regulatory regime for the rental sector in order to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights, interests and responsibilities of tenants and landlords and between the need to ensure that we continue to get increased supply while helping people to stay in their homes regardless of whether they rent or own them.  The forthcoming action plan on housing will set out a detailed timeline for the delivery of this commitment.  We are committed to publishing a paper and a set of actions in the autumn on putting in place a more sustainable rental sector.</p> <p> It is primarily for this reason that supporting the Bill would be premature from our perspective.  I want the opportunity to be able to read and discuss in detail the work of the Oireachtas committee, to put our action plan for housing in place next month, to listen to all of the stakeholders involved and to work with many Deputies on putting as complete a response as we can manage in place so as to provide more certainty around rent, security of tenure and so on for tenants while hearing what landlords have to save on how not to undermine supply fundamentally.  These are not unreasonable requests.  We would have been willing to allow this legislation to continue to be discussed by adjourning the debate at the end of today's two hours as opposed to forcing a vote this week.  If a vote is forced, however, it is too early to support the legislation that has been proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>

Somebody asked me in the past hour or two in the corridor how the Government is progressing and about the potential of it or this D&aacute;il to be a success.  We have to reserve judgment regarding the way business is being and is about to be done and the effect it can have on those who gave us the privilege of being here and who seek to resolve many of the issues we were elected to address.  We are in a new space and new circumstances, and there is a new dynamic.  As we all know, there is a considerable disparity in terms of representation in the D&aacute;il.  Undoubtedly, business will be done in new ways, and there will be new rules and methods.  They are not laid down in stone, but people must be cognisant of them and of the way in which one can hope to effect the sort of change we want to see.  My party did not win enough seats to lead the Government.  It did not win enough votes in the vote for Taoiseach to lead the Government.  Having failed on both of those counts, we still believed there was an onus on us to act responsibly as republicans and democrats and to allow the people an opportunity to form a Government from the existing configuration.  We sought to facilitate the formation of a Government, with certain provisos.</p>  <p>  We know and accept that, undoubtedly, the greatest challenge facing the State, the economy and society is in the area of housing.  There is a chronic set of circumstances, a crisis and an emergency.  I acknowledge the good faith and intentions of members of Sinn F&eacute;in who initially proposed the setting up of a special housing committee during the period between the election and the formation of the Government.  It went somewhat beyond that, and a date was proposed.  I acknowledged, welcomed and supported the proposal.  A great effort has been made by all Members, of all parties and none, to consult the stakeholders and all concerned in the public, private and voluntary sectors who are working at the coalface, to seek to achieve a consensus among the disparate representatives, to make honest, forthright recommendations, and to acknowledge that the conventional processes and ways in which housing was funded need to be addressed.  There are many worthwhile, credible recommendations that will emanate from the committee.  I congratulate its chairman, Deputy John Curran, on the manner in which he conducted its affairs.  I congratulate all the members, the staff and the executive who assisted in the provision of the report to be produced next Friday.  The report will seek to address the provision of housing by the public and private sectors.  It will seek to address mortgage distress, mortgage difficulties and the issues in the rental sector.  It will seek to provide solutions that can be applied by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and also by colleges in respect of the provision of accommodation on their campuses.  It will address affordability for many professionals and others who can no longer afford accommodation that may be provided in larger cities and towns.  Companies such as Google can provide many top-class jobs but, as good as those jobs are, as good as the qualifications of those who acquire those jobs are and as good as the pay might be, the employees still cannot aspire to own their own homes.  That must be addressed.</p>  <p>  That is but one issue.  Rent certainty, rent tenure, the quality of tenure and the ridiculous circumstances of those who have mortgage-to-rent properties that are being taken from under their noses, thereby leaving them out on the road, must be addressed also.  A holistic approach must result from the work of the committee, with a view to the making of recommendations to the Minister and his Department.  The Minister has acknowledged that the conventional methods, processes and funding models can no longer sustain the extraordinary amount of investment that is required in order to address the extraordinary circumstances that prevail.</p>  <p>  Like the Minister, I acknowledge the good intentions of the proposer of tonight&rsquo;s Bill.  Just as I was to the forefront, along with others, in putting a committee in place that sought to instruct and assist the Government in addressing this issue in the way in which an all-party committee believes it can and should, the Minister, along with his Department and the Government, must acknowledge the responsibility he has to take into consideration much of what is being presented by the committee, because it is representative of this D&aacute;il and, by association, the people.  The Government does not have the power to disregard any more.  It does not have the power to analyse and scrutinise the proposals of this side of the House adequately, as it could have done in the past, most especially because of the magnitude of this issue.</p>  <p>  In so far as I can, I am prepared to be responsible and pragmatic as a representative who has been given the privilege of addressing these issues, having taken on board the recommendations, good intentions, will and hard work of those involved with the committee, the parties and all others associated.  Respect should be given to the process.  It is not fair or appropriate to come forward with this Bill, despite the fact that, as I said, it is well-meaning.  It is simplistic in nature and, in addition, addresses but one issue of the many that must be addressed holistically.  That is why it undermines the work of the committee.  That is why it is usurping and gazumping the committee.  I, too, earnestly ask that this debate, on its conclusion, be adjourned until such time as the report is laid before the House, debated, analysed and scrutinised and, if and where necessary, improved by others in this House who have the opportunity to do so.  At that stage, there will be a united approach on the part of us all to make a recommendation to the Minister to address this great crisis.  If he or his Government fails to take on board those issues in a new way that involves an overhaul and a new consensus, the future of the Government will be at stake.  As I said at the outset, we all agree this is the greatest crisis facing the economy and society at present.  This has been the case for the past two years, unfortunately.</p>  <p>  The Government that had the power in the last D&aacute;il believed it could deal with this issue in the old, conventional style in which it had been addressed in years past, but this style cannot accommodate the sort of investment that is required nowadays.  For example, the fiscal rules that govern the amount of spending by the Government in this area would not allow this issue to be addressed in the necessary manner.  As I said, there has to be an extraordinary investment of many multiples of what was invested in the past.  That can be done through special-purpose initiatives off the balance sheet.  It could involve the State, housing agencies, the NTMA, the private sector and the credit unions that wish to participate.  I hope all of these factors can combine to create an opportunity over a two-year period to address this matter such that we will be able to look back and say a commitment was made by the whole D&aacute;il and all its parts to resolve an issue that needed to be resolved, a crisis.  At that point, I could say to the person who asked me a couple of hours ago whether this D&aacute;il can succeed that it could.  However, if people will not play by the rules and acknowledge the changes that must be addressed, this D&aacute;il will be dissolved sooner rather than later.</p><p>An election will then be called and we will waste another six months.  In saying this, I am not casting aspersions on members of the public and the result they gave us to deal with.  We dealt with the outcome of the election as pragmatists and responsible citizens, while respecting the decision of the electorate, as convoluted as we may have found the configuration of representation in the House.  I earnestly ask the proposer of the motion not to force a vote on the issue because if a division is forced, I and my party will vote against the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-14a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="20:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400050#XX00200"><p>It is with frustration and disappointment that I will oppose the motion.  I am frustrated because I wanted this D&aacute;il to be different from its previous incarnations when the Chamber was used for party political gamesmanship, rather than as a forum for exchanges on policy proposals that would resolve the challenges facing the nation.  There is no doubt that housing is a national crisis that requires urgent action.  It was for this very reason that, despite the uncertainty around Government formation, the House decided to establish an all-party committee on housing and homelessness.  Calls for the committee's creation were led by Sinn F&eacute;in and the committee, with members from Sinn F&eacute;in, including Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, working very hard under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy John Curran, to produce a report that will contain targeted actions to be published within 72 hours.  As I do not have access to the report, I can only assume that it addresses the issue of rent certainty effectively and with a significant input from Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p>  <p>  The responsible, purposeful and correct course of action would be to wait for the report and implement the actions it recommends as quickly as possible.  While there will be differences of opinion on some of these actions, as is to be expected, to pre-empt the report with a simplistic Bill designed to generate publicity is not new politics but old, cynical and frustrating politics which I will not support.</p>  <p>  I will work positively and in good faith with every Deputy from every political perspective who wants to provide solutions for those trapped in a rental market in which rents are rocketing out of control.  We must not be tempted to put in place quick-fix solutions which would have the counterproductive effect of causing rental houses and apartments to be sold, thus shrinking supply even further.</p>  <p>  I am saddened because families and tenants who are experiencing increasing and unaffordable rents, with the financial pressure and anxiety that goes with these, deserve better than the political game being played tonight.  They are looking to politicians to work together to tackle what is a complex social and economic issue.  Housing is a social and economic right, not a speculative market to be exploited at will.  This D&aacute;il must work to re-establish a working housing sector in which the rental market fits into a wider housing framework designed for the demographic realities of 2016 and beyond.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy from Wicklow-East Carlow, I am acutely aware of the various rental issues in my commuting constituency.  In north County Wicklow rents have spiralled out of reach for prospective tenants and out of control for existing tenants.  The Bill, if passed, would result in an increase in the number of property owners exiting the rental market, thus forcing more families out of their homes.  This is an indisputable and sad fact.  I have already observed this development in the rental accommodation scheme under which local authorities pay rent to private landlords on behalf of tenants for a set term.  The gap between what can be paid by local authorities and what the private rental sector can demand has increased dramatically throughout Wicklow in recent years.  As a result, landlords are exiting the rental accommodation scheme and selling their properties, leaving families homeless.  This is just one area of the rental sector where we can clearly see that the Bill before us would make matters worse.</p>  <p>  Rent certainty is needed and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposed measures, published in our policy document, Generation Rent, to stabilise rent prices immediately by restricting rents to an area-based rental index both within and between tenancies.  This is similar to the model in operation in many German cities.  The system would be in place for a maximum three-year period, pending annual reviews of the effects of the regulations on market supply.</p>  <p>  What is equally required in the Irish context is a wide-ranging package of housing actions where each sector - public and private, rental and ownership, building and regulatory - is clearly managed.  This would ensure that actions in one area would not cause difficulties in another.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Bill be withdrawn to allow the all-party report to be discussed by all Deputies and enable the D&aacute;il to serve as an example of new politics working on behalf of all people, rather than as a smokescreen for the old and cynical political game which only erodes trust in the ability of politics to resolve the housing crisis.</p></speech>

The committee has had various groups before it as it tries to get a firm handle on the problem and produce an overall set of proposals for the Minister to consider and discuss with all sides of the House.</p>  <p>  The committee, for which Sinn F&eacute;in called in the early days of this Thirty-second D&aacute;il, will report this Friday.  There is no doubt, given that all parties and many experts across the board fed into its recommendations, that the results of its work will form the basis for responding to the major national crisis facing us.  This is a crisis about which there should not be any rancour or division among the political groupings in the D&aacute;il.  We should try to reach a consensus to ensure we tackle the crisis in a meaningful way.</p>  <p>  I was particularly interested in listening to the contribution to the Committee on Housing and Homelessness of the chairman of the City and County Managers Association, Mr. Eugene Cummins.  Mr. Cummins, who is also the chief executive of Roscommon County Council, previously held the position of director of services in Meath County Council and was the town manager in Navan.  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I know Mr. Cummins well.  He thinks deeply about the issues and challenges facing local councils as the lead authorities for dealing with this issue.  In his conclusions, Mr. Cummins noted the great importance of ensuring the private sector becomes a main player in the provision of housing because the problem of trying to find a home is common not only to the many thousands who find themselves on council housing waiting lists - on which people can wait up to eight years to be housed as is the case in County Meath - but also to those who earn a decent income.  While they have the ability to purchase a home, they are as far away as ever from turning the dream of home ownership into a reality because of the lack of homes being built.  No one seems to stand up for this whole new group of people in the squeezed middle.  I will stand up for those who cannot get on the property ladder because there are no homes being built, especially in pressure areas such as County Meath, County Louth, which is represented by Deputy Gerry Adams, County Kildare and County Wicklow, which Deputy Pat Casey represents.</p>  <p>  Among the issues the committee examined in connection with the lack of activity in housing construction is the cost of constructing a home and the taxes associated with doing so.  Having listened to Deputy Mick Wallace speak very knowledgeably about this issue, I agree with much of what he said on the subject.  There is no doubt that the lack of supply caused by the absence of construction has allowed unscrupulous landlords to exploit people in receipt of rent supplement as well as those who earn a good wage but find themselves paying exorbitant rents because the market has given those in command of property the upper hand.  The figures clearly demonstrate the reason this has occurred.  Last year, 9,000 homes were constructed when we need at least 25,000 housing units per annum.  It is a case of simple mathematics.</p>  <p>  The need to rebalance the market in favour of people seeking accommodation must be tackled in a manner that helps those affected, rather than makes matters worse or creates a short-term spike in rents in what is already a volatile marketplace or makes people homeless rather than keeping them in their homes.  We cannot do this in isolation from all the other issues discussed in this debate.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Pat Casey noted, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposes an area-based rental index governed by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, for a maximum of three years.  There is no doubt that the key issue of supply must be addressed.  For too long, the building industry and builders who provide homes have been considered dirty words.</p><p>When I hear the emotive and grandiose speeches in this House from people on the left, I often wonder who they think will build the homes that will sort out this problem.  Do they think it will be magic fairies or little people with pixie dust?  I hear all the problems, but the reality is that some people on the left must acknowledge that we need builders to help those people to get their first homes.  This applies not only to those on the council housing waiting list, but those in the squeezed middle.  They have the capacity to buy a home but are being squeezed out because of the conditions that exist at present.  This is something those on the left cannot bring themselves to do.</p> <p> There is a broken market and a broken housing sector.  It is not only impacting on those who are struggling to get a home.  It does not encourage people who could get a home either.  Let us look closely at the detail and the findings of the committee report on Friday.  Let us work collectively to try to find an agreed strategy such that landlords, those who are hoarding zoned land and the statutory agencies are all make aware that there is a serious plan on the table with teeth.  In this way they will get the message that they need to respond to it or else they will get beaten into submission.</p></speech>

The response to this difficult and challenging issue must be complex and multi-factoral.  It requires us to counterbalance the private property rights in the Constitution with the principles of social justice and the common good.  This means the State must intervene not only to fund, but to regulate the market and protect and provide for its citizens.</p>  <p>  Tonight's Bill is limited in scope but it is an important element in tackling affordability in the private rental market.  Previous speakers, including the Minister, have made valid points about the fact that the all-party committee will report on Friday.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will respond to these calls but, in any event, if it is pushed to a vote the Labour Party will support the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  It remains to be seen whether this will arise.  We will support the Bill because linking rent to the consumer price index will ensure rent increases remain affordable and related directly to the general cost of living.  It is a limited but important measure to bring that about.  It continues the progress made last November, when the law was amended to give added protection to tenants and limit rent reviews to once every two years.  I disagree with the remarks of Deputy Adams, who suggested those measures did not have an effect.  I believe they have had a positive effect.  I have dealt with many individuals who have been relieved to know that their rent cannot go up for two years.</p>  <p>  This is a limited measure.  The report of the all-party committee to be published later this week will no doubt contain a comprehensive series of recommendations.  I agree with Deputy Cassells that everyone in the House needs to work together to provide solutions to this issue.  Nevertheless, we support the measure being introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in tonight.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party is working on drafting a wide-ranging housing Bill which we intend to publish as our contribution to the debate sometime within the next fortnight.  It will include a measure relating to the consumer price index as well as a number of actions to improve affordability for tenants.  It will also address the need for security for tenants and measures to significantly boost the supply of housing, which is probably more important.  It is because of the shortage of supply that we have such serious problems of affordability.  That is one of the main reasons the issue of affordability arises.  Supply is an important factor.  The Minister has promised to publish his action plan and we will be watching very closely in this regard.</p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of funding.  Significant funding is available to build social and affordable housing.  The &euro;4 billion multiannual capital fund announced by the last Government in conjunction with the social housing strategy is available to be spent.  The real challenge is to have it spent.  The evidence thus far is that local authorities have not been as quick as we would like them to be in spending the money available.</p>  <p>  I welcome the additional &euro;200 million announced today by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohue, to support local authorities in providing infrastructure to facilitate housing development.  I understand it will become available next year.  I hope the Minister will not take his eye off the more immediate need to get these same local authorities to spend the money they have been allocated for social housing.  The list of approved construction, turnkey and large scale acquisition projects for which capital was allocated to local authorities in 2015 and 2016 amounts to over &euro;600 million.  It is imperative that these houses are delivered on time.  A number of houses have been funded.  I have before me a list from the appendix to the outcome published earlier this year.  A total of 3,366 houses are listed in a variety of local authorities throughout the country.  Having examined the list, it is clear some of these houses were approved in May 2015, others were approved in July 2015 and still more were approved in January 2016.  Progress has been slow in delivering this social housing.  Moreover, it is alarming that the specific measure introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, is not being used.  Under that measure local authorities could make a single funding submission for social housing developments of 15 or fewer units up to a cost of &euro;2 million.  This measure simply does not appear to have been used at all on the basis of the evidence we have.  That is not acceptable given the level of need.  Councils are not using this option to construct small developments.  There have been suggestions that councils are concerned about the risk of going over budget, but that cannot be used as an excuse.  I urge the Minister to ensure that councils take up this practical proposal.  They need only make one submission to the Department and they can then build up to 15 units.  I have just left the Department of Education and Skills.  School authorities throughout the country use a devolved grant to provide classrooms.  They are willing to take it upon themselves to organise the construction of classrooms.  I do not see why local authorities cannot do the same thing.  I urge the Minister to ensure that they do so and spend the considerable funding that has been made available.  It is up to local councillors to ensure that they push for the spending of this money and do not put obstacles in the way.</p>  <p>  The voluntary housing sector is playing a crucial role and must be supported to grow its contribution in the delivery of new units and support for tenants.  This morning, I had the opportunity to launch the Housing First programme in Limerick for the Novas Initiatives.  That is only one example of the strong positive work of the voluntary housing sector in delivering units and supporting tenants, especially vulnerable tenants, to stay in their accommodation.  Those involved also give 24-hour wrap-around support and service to tenants.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cowen mentioned specific measures to deal with the needs of students.  These should be introduced as well because the needs of students tend to be more short term and somewhat different from the needs of other private renters.  This is another area that needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the private rented sector has evolved rapidly, especially in recent years.  We have a great deal to learn from models in other countries.  For many years other countries have had stable organised private rented sectors.  We need to learn from those models to provide secure homes for people on a long-term basis.  While this is a limited measure, it is one of several measures required to address the issue.</p></speech>

The private rented sector is the sector of insecurity, stress, poverty and homelessness.  Some 40 years ago, local authorities provided one third of all housing in this State.  Today, the corresponding provision is minuscule.  Instead, low-income families are forced into the private rented sector, yet the State subsidises the rents of one third of all private landlords instead of actually building homes.  It spends &euro;5.5 billion in rent supplement.</p><p>It has been clear for a number of years - this is not new - that Government inaction on rocketing rents has led to homelessness.  I support tonight's Bill.  However, I believe it is the very minimum that is needed.  On its own it would be inadequate because my reading of it is that it applies only to existing tenancies.  However, I fully support the Bill.<br/><br/>We actually need rents to come down.  Does the Minister think the current rent levels are acceptable?  I know of low-paid workers with families who are paying &euro;1,400 in rent for not very nice houses - very substandard accommodation.  That is what people in Tyrrelstown threatened by vulture funds are paying.  I hope the Minister does not think that is acceptable.  If he does not think it is acceptable, I am mystified as to why he is telling us tonight that we need to slow down and not move too fast.  Rents in my area have gone up by &euro;341 in two years.<br/><br/>I heard the Minister say earlier that the measures the Government put in place last year were beginning to work.  He obviously did not read the <i>daft.ie</i>rental report, which shows a fifteenth consecutive quarter of rent increases.  Professor P. J. Drudy has testified that all that has happened is that rents have doubled to get around the very limited rent certainty measures introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It was not the Constitution that prevented the former Minister from introducing rent controls last year; it was a concerted campaign by what Professor P. J. Drudy called the Irish and international property investment groups - companies such as Kennedy Wilson that wrote to the Department of Finance suggesting that it not proceed.  I hope that is not what the hesitation of the Minister tonight is about, because the dogs in the street know that this is the very minimum needed.  It is a matter of urgency.  Does the Minister have any sense of an emergency when he stands over there and suggests that we should not move too fast?  We do not need a housing committee to tell us this is needed; it is obviously needed.  It is the very minimum required, and the Minister should not shirk from bringing it in.  We need to go further and introduce proper rent controls that stop new leases and new tenancies from being rack-rented and entire apartment blocks from being built out and rents of &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 being charged for them.  The Minister needs to get with the programme.  We need rent certainty.  We need rent controls now.</p></speech>

I do not understand the reticence being expressed by the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il about the committee and so on.  If this can roll in to highlight the issue, further indicate the urgency of it and roll into any good that comes out - I certainly hope something good comes out on Thursday - that is all to the good.  However, it seems this is a minimal measure against which it is impossible to argue.  I do not see what the problem is.  In any event, after Second Stage it will go to further Stages after Thursday and we can discuss it there.</p>  <p>  I say now to our Sinn F&eacute;in comrades that we need to go a hell of a lot further on rent, because this will not deal with the fact that rents are already out of control and need to be scaled back.  We need models such as the Scottish model whereby something like a beefed-up PRTB goes into a place and specifies that a landlord cannot charge more than &euro;1,100 for a specific dwelling.  The Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il keep referring to the market.  The market has failed.  Markets cannot be allowed to set rents.  This model has failed.  It is not a theoretical discussion any more, one that we can debate in university debating chambers.</p></speech>

If there is no recognition of that, we are going nowhere.</p>  <p>  The situation is worse.  The first time I brought homeless people to the D&aacute;il was in 2012.  I brought in about ten or 15 families.  I warned then there was a crisis and the then Government laughed at me because, at that time, for a very brief period, rents were decreasing, as were property prices.  I warned then - because in D&uacute;n Laoghaire they did not go down - that they were going back up everywhere and that there would be a crisis in a year or two.  I was laughed at by the former Minister, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, and others.</p>  <p>  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire now it is disastrous.  Rents for a three-bedroom house are &euro;2,200 on average.  That has nearly doubled in the past two years.  The HAP scheme is a write-off - it will not happen in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Unless we ratchet up the provision of social housing and scale back rents to affordable levels that are related to people's income, we are going nowhere.  Even the most cursory examination of the situation in parts of this city would tell the Minister that.  He needs to get with reality.</p>  <p>  The Minister needs to stop with the mantra of the market.  I do not know what this obsession is.  The Minister is still referring to the 75,000 units he will deliver through the HAP scheme.  It will not happen.  I also hear ideological claptrap that supply will solve the problem.  Does anybody's memory stretch back even to 2006 and 2007?  We had supply to beat the band.  Did it make rents affordable or property prices affordable?  No.  Supply does not bring rent down and it does not bring property prices down.  We know that from 2006, 2007 and 2008.  It did not do it.  We had the biggest level of supply in the history of the State, and rent and property prices went up because the people who were building them were interested in profit and the market was setting the rate.  So even if the supply is increased via the private for-profit sector, I guarantee it will not solve the problem.  Without controlled and subsidised low rents and housing, including affordable housing - I heard mention of the squeezed middle - we will not solve the problem.  We should support any measure that moves us in that direction, but we need to go a lot further.</p></speech>

I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for bringing it to the House for debate.  The Rent Certainty Bill will amend section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 by repealing section 19(2)(b) of the Act and introducing section 19A to provide for the linking of rent reviews to the level of inflation as indicated in the consumer price index.</p><p>Throughout the last D&aacute;il and the previous one, I advocated some kind of rent control as a public policy.  I remember raising the issue one morning on the Order of Business and there were howls of anguish from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael at the mere mention of some kind of rent control.  While people will argue that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill will cause constitutional difficulties or that to advance to more stringent rent control as advocated by the previous two speakers would not be possible, it is possible.  We know that rent regulation could have been introduced.  In the House tonight is a former Minister from the previous Government who could have done that, as could her successor.</p><p>I am concerned about the spiralling cost of rent, particularly in Dublin and the regions around Dublin.  As the <i>Irish Independent</i>journalists Dearbhail McDonald and Paul Melia showed yesterday morning, in Dublin and in all the commuter regions around our great cities, rents are spiralling completely out of control.  It is very striking that rents in Dublin are now higher than they were in 2007 and that nationally rents are 8.6% higher compared with the same time last year.  Yet people's income has remained pretty static.</p><p>The recent NEC report to the Committee on Housing and Homelessness recommended rent regulation &quot;through a mechanism for disciplined market-sensitive rent adjustment&quot;.  That clearly can happen.  The previous Minister seemed to feel he had gone towards rent certainty, but he had not; he just introduced a mechanism which, along with rent uplifts, gave some little assistance to existing tenants.</p><p>He did not address rent certainty at all.  This Bill would do that at least.  The former Minister, Deputy Kelly, buckled when the pressure came on from Fine Gael colleagues such as the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He buckled completely in the face of an onslaught from Fine Gael and the property interests that back up the two bigger parties in this House.  We ended up without any kind of rent regulation.  As a result, some 2,000 children are homeless tonight.</p></speech>

I think a similar campaign is needed today.  We have done a great deal of talking in the previous D&aacute;il and in this one.  I am a member of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which has heard a wide variety of presentations on many aspects of the housing crisis.  While it is obvious that there is no quick-fix solution, action will have to be taken.  I suggest that a series of actions, backed by the resources needed to make a difference, by implementation plans and by timeframes, will be required.</p>  <p>  Rent is obviously central to the crisis.  It is appalling that rents are increasing for no apparent reason other than the ability of landlords to provide for increases.  I know of monthly rent increases of &euro;100, &euro;200, &euro;300 or more that have been applied to accommodation that has not been improved or amended.  I do not suggest that landlords should be deprived of the ability to make a profit, but we cannot have a system in which rents may be increased at will at any time.  I know efforts were made in the previous D&aacute;il to provide for rent certainty.  A measure was introduced in November 2015 to guarantee rents for two years, but the period leading into its introduction was too long.  Rents continued to increase during that lead-in period because landlords were able to do what they wanted while the proposal was being debated.</p>  <p>  We know that housing policy has to be about affordability, equality and ease of access.  The 2020 social housing strategy contains a commitment to a pilot cost-rental model, as recommended by various groups.  Large-scale intervention is needed, particularly in Dublin and the major cities.  We need rent certainty.  It is essential for the housing market.  It would be of benefit to landlords and tenants.  It would mean that rent increases and decreases could be foreseen and could help to ensure they are reasonable.  I think the Bill before the House, which proposes to link rents to the consumer price index, sounds reasonable and is welcome.  It would mean the results of rent reviews would be in line with the calculations of the Central Statistics Office.  I accept the point that the natural progression would have involved the presentation of the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, followed by the introduction of the various Bills that are required.</p></speech>

I always try to introduce a balance to these debates.  There is a major housing crisis in Galway city and county.  As I have said every time I have had an opportunity to participate in a debate on housing, there are 15,000 people on the waiting list in Galway.  That is a conservative estimate.  When I made a phone call today regarding the number one family on the three-bedroom list, which has been on the list since 2002, the official answer from the city council was that it has no idea when it will be in a position to provide a home for the family in question.</p>  <p>  It is disconcerting, at the very least, to hear Fianna F&aacute;il talking about the new politics while playing the old politics.  There would be nothing wrong with passing this legislation tonight, regardless of Sinn F&eacute;in's motivation in introducing it.  At best, the introduction of this legislation is an indication of the urgency that must be attached to the problems caused by rents increasing to the levels that have been quoted tonight by all Deputies on the left.  I am still seeing a mixed response from the Government and from Fianna F&aacute;il when solutions are proposed.</p>  <p>  While I look forward to the publication of the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness on Friday, I am not heartened by what I have heard from the Minister this evening.  I think his mind is still in the market, as a previous speaker said.  He thinks the market will provide the supply.  The market created this problem and has failed to provide the supply.  The Government has created the problem in the market.  The fanfare with which the social housing programme was announced last year or the year before by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, simply added to the market problem.  I refer to his suggestion that the market would provide 75,000 homes under the wrong name of "social housing".</p>  <p>  In the past two years, we have repeatedly been told in Galway city that the housing assistance payment, which puts guaranteed money into the pockets of landlords, is the only game in town.  The former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, told us tonight that councils are to blame.  It is very upsetting to hear that local authorities are to blame.  I would like this to be put to bed once and for all.  If city and the county managers have failed to use the money allocated to them at a time of housing crisis, it is nothing short of scandalous and they should be held responsible.  If that is not the position, the Deputy should apologise for casting aspersions on city managers.</p></speech>

I appreciate that some houses have been purchased or made available under the voluntary housing scheme, but not one local authority house has been built in Galway in recent years.  I ask those who are wondering why there is a housing crisis to bear that in mind.  I accept that there is a role for the market, but I suggest that the local authorities and the Government have an even bigger role in providing homes for our citizens.  We cannot have healthy people without homes and without security of tenure.  If we continue to ask families to move from one form of accommodation to another on a yearly or two-yearly basis, and therefore require children to move from one school to another at the same time, it is absolute nonsense to talk about having a healthy society.</p></speech>

It is important to analyse and assess the dire housing crisis in this country.  It should not give us any solace to be here this evening at the onset of darkness in the knowledge that over 2,000 children will sleep in hotel beds tonight and that many people are homeless.  Successive Governments have failed to deal with this problem.  It is necessary that we try to do so.  I salute the interim housing committee that was established under the chairmanship of Deputy Curran.  I know those who have made an input into the committee have worked hard.  People from outside agencies and bodies have given their advice and input.  I look forward with bated breath to reading the committee's report.  I hope to do so by the end of the week.  Many people have been writing about this issue from far and near.  Many people have suggested ways of solving this crisis.  We can have all the reports in the world, but none of them will bring any solace to those who are homeless, including many children and those who are sleeping rough tonight, or to the thousands of people who are living in dread of being made homeless.</p>  <p>  This is a multifaceted problem.  While I do not doubt Deputy Connolly, I was quite shocked to hear her say that no local authority houses have been built in Galway in the past year.  Very few houses have been built in Tipperary.  Something has gone fundamentally wrong.  I know we had a deep and dark recession in recent years, but I remind the House that local authorities were able to build thousands of houses in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and even into the 1980s and 1990s.  There was very little construction equipment in the 1950s and 1960s.  There was a reliance on manual labour because cranes and modern forms of technology, such as the modern means of excavation and construction, were not available.  We seem to have some kind of inertia now.  We do not seem able to respond to the need that exists.  These issues are passed between the county managers and the directors of services and housing.  They are passed up to the Department and back down again.</p>  <p>  Funding has been announced by successive Ministers.  The previous Minister, Deputy Kelly, announced that a multi-annual fund of &euro;4 billion would be provided, but nothing is happening.  This is highly frustrating for people who have been waiting for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 or 12 years to be put on the housing list.  It is fundamentally soul-destroying.  This is happening in Wicklow, Tipperary and everywhere else.  The number of approved applicants on the housing list in Tipperary is 30 or 40 short of 3,000.  That is a massive figure.  There are many unfinished estates in the county.  When companies came to me in the last year or so because they wanted to buy those estates and offer them to local authorities with a quick turnaround, they were met with total disbelief.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is now a kind of taboo with regard to builders.  Small builders, in particular, seem to be an endangered species.  It is as if there is a bounty on their heads.  If we do not enable small builders to provide housing, we will never restart the construction industry.  I accept that many rogues and cowboys got into the building industry during the boom.</p><p> There are many good and decent builders who started off as tradesmen, becoming self-employed and employing people, building fine well-finished and good houses at reasonable prices.  They are still out there willing to take up the cudgels but they cannot get a bob from the banks or credit from elsewhere.</p> <p> There are also issues of blockages in terms of development lands.  I welcome this week's announcement of &euro;200 million by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to deal with blockages, such as access to development land.  This is not only needed in the major areas where there are significant crises but in small towns and villages.</p> <p> I also welcome the penalties to be introduced in respect of those hoarding zoned lands.  There are a lot of zoned lands, some of them are in NAMA while others are in no man's land.  We need to deal with this situation.</p> <p> Planning permission needs to be dealt with too.  I have met several young couples who have acquired sites, hired architects, put money and deposits together for loans and have gone to much expense to build their own homes.  However, they cannot get planning permission.  The county councils are like the dog in the manger.  They will not build houses for anybody nor will they allow people to build for themselves.  I accept there must be planning guidelines and rules with good proper planning.  However, the rules are over strenuous.  The granting of planning permission is onerous and can cost a fortune.  It is putting off those people who want to build their own houses, who do not want to add to the housing crisis and who have the vision, the wherewithal and the courage to borrow and to build.  The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, brought in a regulation to stop all that.  The building of individual private houses was stopped in its tracks.  This needs to be examined as well, as it is a multifaceted problem.</p> <p> Last night, I chaired a meeting of the Carrick-On-Suir Voluntary Housing Association.  The association has 17 two-bed units, built in 2000 and rented to tenants since 2001 at &euro;55 a week.  The rent has never been increased.  We discussed it again last night but did not increase it.  I salute voluntary bodies up and down the country, as well as the board of the Irish Council for Social Housing, which are making a significant contribution to housing.  There used to be a one-stop shop for these voluntary housing boards to cut out the red tape.  It must be remembered these voluntary groups are ordinary individuals giving their time voluntarily to supply houses.  In 2009, someone decided - an bord snip was blamed for it but it was probably on the instruction of the departmental officials - to do away with this one-stop shop.  Now the housing associations have to go to seven different parts of the country to deal with the Department.  It is just frustratingly mind-boggling.</p> <p> The same is happening with the county councils.  They are passing paper back and forward with e-mails about talks about talks and meetings about meetings and sweet - I will not say it - is happening, or not much happening, with house commencements or completions.  When I was a councillor back in 2000, it was lovely to see the handover of the keys for council houses and to go to the official openings of local authority housing estates.  However, it has all stopped.  We need to examine why.  The councils and the Department have to take up the cudgels, stand up and be held accountable as to why it is not happening at any level.  We have voids lying idle for one to four years.  The councils will claim they cannot get approval from the Department for the costs to repair the voids.  We found out recently that if the repairs cost more than &euro;12,000, it will have to go to the Department but the Department cannot get the money to the local authorities.</p> <p> I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in for introducing this Bill tonight.  We need a far more detailed response to housing.  I had hoped we would wait a little longer, but not too much longer, to get the full package promised from the housing committee.  However, we cannot wait forever, just rubbing our hands.  That is no good to the homeless people.  We are shirking our responsibilities if we do not act.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, well in his new role and hope he will be successful.  This is a matter that needs to be dealt with urgently.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we are all too well aware of the significant escalation in rents.  It is a point I raised right through the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.  It is particularly evident in large urban centres.  Linking rents to the consumer price index is a good idea in theory.  However, we cannot presuppose that the current levels of rents are affordable to begin with.</p>  <p>  Renting is now the most expensive but the least secure of tenure types.  The number of people renting has doubled over the past ten years.  It is a whole area which requires a policy in its own right.  Too often we have seen policy responses being just legislation when, in fact, it needs to be multifaceted.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board requires to be significantly beefed up.</p>  <p>  The crisis was evident several years ago and I was certainly raising it in 2012 at the environment committee.  We were continually told that if there was a reduction in rent assistance, it would drive rents down, despite what we were seeing in our own areas.  This crisis has been growing over the past several years.  Last year in my area, rent for a three-bedroom house was &euro;900.  This year, it is &euro;1,300.  This is for no good reason other than the market is dictating the price.  There has to be some mechanism of containing that.</p>  <p>  Creating a viable rental sector is about far more than affordability, although it is of critical importance.  It also requires consideration of issues such as security of tenure and rights for both landlords and tenants.  There is more to be done about these.  It is certainly the number one issue in my constituency office, and was the case over the lifetime of the past D&aacute;il.  I suspect this was also the case for most Deputies, particularly in urban and suburban areas.</p>  <p>  When people ask me for advice about a tenancy dispute, I tell them to go to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  However, it will take about a year to have a dispute dealt with, meaning I have to give them that advice with a health warning.  We need to have a sector which can be regulated and that has to be part of the solution.</p>  <p>  At various stages, people will want to choose renting as an option.  For some people, it is the only option but for others, it is a desired option.  That is how it is in other European countries and in American cities.  How do we get to a point where we have renting as an option?  One cannot do so without security of tenure or affordability.</p>  <p>  I support the idea of having large socially mixed estates where one is essentially building communities with mixed tenure types and different sizes of accommodation which will allow people to move up and down over their lifetime.  That is the way to go.  We have to deal with the crisis at this stage.  One element of the crisis that is hard to understand is that there are 200,000 vacant houses around the country.  The housing associations have been saying for the past several years that we have to find ways of reducing the level of vacancy.</p><p>For example, the level of vacancy in this city is about 8%.  To reduce that to 4% would provide in the region of 20,000 houses, which would have an immediate impact on rents because the supply-side issue would be dealt with.  There are reasons that people are not offering their houses for rent, some being simple things like the impediment created by the fair deal scheme.  These are the kinds of things that need to be looked at in the immediate term.</p> <p> We need a major scaling up of local authority building.  When we met the Minister recently, we pointed out there is a reason that the local authorities are slow.  We made the point that there needs to be a delivery aspect to the Housing Finance Agency, which would go in and project-manage the large new developments which might involve housing from the tier 3 housing associations, local authority houses or private houses.  It requires to be managed so there needs to be that kind of intervention in the market.  Even though this would scale up the local authority build, I do not think we should go back to the point where there is just one house type or tenure type in an area.  This did not work in the past in some areas where very large housing estates were built and the only thing they had in common was that they were economically less well-off than other areas.  A different response is needed if we are not to create problems later on.</p> <p> We support the Bill in principle, although we do not see it as a silver bullet.  It is one of a very large number of things that need to be done.  It will be important that we not just have a report at the end of this week from the Minister because we need that report turned into action across a range of different responses.  Obviously, limiting rent increases and linking them to the consumer price index is a realistic part of a bigger package.</p></speech>

Recent legislation by the last Government has not stemmed this flow.  The introduction of rules preventing landlords raising rents for two years and putting a moratorium of two years before another rise would be considered did not go anywhere near what was required.  The ideological battle between Fine Gael and the ex-Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Alan Kelly, was very noticeable, with Fine Gael winning out.  It was and still is clear that rent certainty was required, as well as an increase in rent supplement.  The private rented sector is not fit for purpose in its current format and is actually contributing negatively to the housing and homelessness crisis.</p>  <p>  At present there are approximately 6,000 homeless people in the country, 2,000 of whom are children.  Most of them were previously living in the private rented sector and are now in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  According to a study commissioned by the Housing Agency in 2015, one of the most commonly cited reasons for family homelessness was lack of affordability in the private rented sector.  Other common reasons were poor quality of accommodation in the private rented sector, that private rented property was to be sold or that the landlord wanted to move in.</p>  <p>  This outlines a narrative of finance-related issues which, in part, are contributing to homelessness.  If rent certainty is introduced, it will contribute in some part to an easing of the crisis.  However, it is only one part of the solution.  Rent supplement, which was meant originally to be a temporary measure, has been subsumed in HAP.  Neither is adequate, and the supplement needs to be increased with a view to a long-term solution, leading to an introduction of rent regulations and the capping of rent subsidies to ensure rents demanded by landlords do not rise in tandem with an increase in the rent cap.  Fine Gael's partners in the last Government also held this view but Fine Gael was ideologically opposed to it and stopped it last year.  We are now a year on and rent prices have increased further.  We cannot wait another month because the families who are looking to rent cannot wait.</p>  <p>  As we all know, the price of renting has increased so much that it is now cheaper to have a mortgage than to rent.  In my own consistency of Dublin North-West, the average rent for a three-bedroom house is &euro;1,407 a month, whereas, for a 30-year mortgage at 4.3%, it is &euro;1,029 a month, and even for a mortgage at 6.3%, it is &euro;1,287.  That is &euro;1,400 a month before people pay for life's other necessities.  It is scandalous and does not take into account that the ability to get a mortgage is beyond the capacity of the majority of families on the average industrial wage and is completely unachievable for any family on the minimum wage.  To give these families a chance, a change in rent supplement needs to be made.  That is why we must look beyond the private sector and towards Government and the councils to provide the long-term solution to this crisis.</p>  <p>  We need to build more social housing which, in itself, will bring down rental prices.  The introduction of rent certainty would allow for rent increases or decreases in line with inflation and tied to the consumer price index.  We need to build and acquire more social housing to increase the stock, and the Bill before us will help that.  Given our reliance on the private market for rental as well as to build social and affordable housing, the Government's last Bill means this will only apply to 10% of each scheme, which is scandalous.  We should turn back the clock and look for 20% or 30%.  The Minister must take this on board or we will be here in another year, arguing the same case because we will not be able to deliver enough social and affordable housing.  The Government needs to be more imaginative.</p></speech>

It could have taken a positive approach to our genuine, earnest attempt to deal with a very important issue but it chose instead to take the most negative, the most sinister interpretation it could possibly find to cast aspersions on my party in regard to our intention in bringing this Bill forward.

I am pointing out the reality of what the Taoiseach said and of what Fianna F&aacute;il said about our Bill, namely, that we were playing political games.  If the Minister does not believe that, and if he believes, like me, that is disingenuous, he should say that and say that what we are doing here tonight is in the best interests of citizens.  It is Sinn F&eacute;in using our Private Members' time to do what is our job, which is to hold the Government to account and, more than that, to come forward with solutions.  We did not bring forward a motion; we brought forward a practical Bill that can help people.  However, the Government, whatever about the Minister personally, chose to look at the negative rather than the positive.  When it comes to my party, what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael want to do is to continuously create this narrative that we are not serious, that we are negative and that we are opposing for opposition's sake when, in fact, what is happening is that the Government is opposing what we are bringing forward simply for opposition's sake.</p>  <p>  That is what is happening.  I hope it will not be the pattern of this new politics.  I say sincerely to the Minister that I want to work constructively with the Government.  However, when we bring forward proposals, the Government has to give them the same merit it is asking us to give its proposals when it brings them forward.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Fine Gael Party does not always sing from the same hymn sheet as the Minister did this evening.</p>  <p>  To get to the heart of this issue, we are dealing with people who are in dire straits.  One would think listening to some of the speeches that none of what happened is the fault of policy-makers and that rising rents are somehow an accident of the market.  The reality is the State chose to stop building social housing and not to build local authority housing.  This did not just happen in the course of the recession.  The State stopped building local authority housing even during the boom.  Even at the height of the Celtic tiger we started to slow down and we did not build social housing because we were far too reliant on the private sector.  If I can have the Minister's attention, we were far too reliant on the private sector and it was all Part V social and affordable housing.  What happened, of course, when the crash came was that we stopped building social housing and no local authority housing units were built.  The private sector also stopped building, so Part V social and affordable houses dried up and we had no new builds.  Everybody in the private rental sector was competing with social housing applicants, and now 95% of social housing applicants are being told by the State the only way it will meet their needs is through the private rental sector.  This did not happen because it was inconsistent or incidental to Government policy.  All this happened because of policy.  The reason rents have increased is social housing tenants and those in need of social housing are competing with those who want private rental accommodation.  This is what happened.</p>  <p>  We want sustainable and fair rents.  Nobody is saying this, in and of itself, is a panacea or the only solution, but it is one way in which we can bring about greater certainty for those families who need it and for those families in need of support.  The rising rents we have at present are not sustainable.</p>  <p>  Moving away from rent prices being set by the market would also be good for landlords, because it does not suit them to see a spike or rise in rents or, as they have seen in the past, rents drop to unsustainable levels.  It suits everybody to have much fairer and sustainable rent prices in the State.  Our Bill is an honest attempt to do this.  Whatever the committee we proposed will recommend over the coming weeks, it will not prevent the Minister from accepting the Bill.  If he really believes this is the right thing to do and it is not just about opposing it for ideological reasons, he should let it go through.  I appeal to the Minister to do this, to be constructive and positive and to practise what he preaches.  He should let the Bill go through, and whatever differences we have let us work them out in a constructive way on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I find myself agreeing with much of what Opposition speakers, including members of Sinn F&eacute;in, have said, but I fundamentally disagree with them on the matter of rent controls by another name, which is contained in the Bill.  I will refer to this later.</p>  <p>  I should declare my interests.  I am a landlord, completely by accident.  I am not sure if I am one of those who should be locked up according to some members of the Government.  Like thousands of people, because of the economic situation in which the country found itself, I became a landlord completely by accident and unintentionally.  I feel I should declare this at the start.</p>  <p>  It does not matter whether one is from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael or any other political party, we all deal with people.  Anyone who has been a member of a local authority, as I was until 14 years ago, has dealt with people trying to get and keep housing.  The fundamental issue is one of supply.  The Sinn F&eacute;in speakers are right.  At the height of the boom, the State through its agencies got out of the provision of public housing, which was a disastrous mistake.  It was a calamitous error at a time when the economy was overheating because of a bubble in construction when we thought we would have enough houses forever and a day.  This meant not only did the private housing supply collapse once the economy collapsed, but increases in public housing supply were non-existent at that stage.  The figure of 25,000 units is reckoned to be the number we need to produce per annum, and I welcome the fact the Government has set this as its target.  I genuinely welcome what was announced today by the Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Donohoe, regarding proposals to fund necessary infrastructural improvements to ensure lands suitable for housing are able to be developed.</p>  <p>  During the period of the Celtic tiger, most local authorities significantly reduced their landbanks.  Where they have land, most of it is not in the areas with major demand for housing.  This is a disastrous legacy of the politics of the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, who was the man who kicked me off the local authority 14 years ago when he got rid of the dual mandate.  He was also the man who introduced Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  He did many very damaging things to the country, as it turned out.</p>  <p>  I wish to express my opposition, which I suppose is ideological, to rent controls.  I do not see it as an ideological question.  I studied rent controls when I was in college.  There is no example of any city in the world where rent controls have had a positive effect in the medium or long term on the provision of housing, so a serious political party should not propose it as part of a measure.  Of course it should be discussed, but it has not worked anywhere, so why would we look to introduce it here?  The reason it has not worked is because it decreases the supply of available accommodation.  This happened in every city, most famously in New York where, over the first ten years of rent controls, 300,000 fewer housing units became available because those who had a lot of money, wealth and property were not making enough of a return from renting and it was not economic for others to maintain accommodation at the necessary standards.  It would be like a doctor writing a prescription for a patient and recommending medication which made the patient worse.  This is why rent controls should not happen.</p>  <p>  There is much in the Bill and in what has been discussed with which I agree.  While we never know how long a D&aacute;il will last or how long anybody will be in any position, there is an opportunity.  So far, the Minister has proved himself eager to address this problem.  We have all sat at desks with people with tears in their eyes who do not know where they will spend that night or where they will be the following week.  There is nothing more dear to Irish people than the sense of home.  The biggest calamity that has befallen us following the collapse of the Celtic tiger economy is that so many people now find themselves homeless, most of them through no fault of their own.  There have always been homeless people who suffer from contributory problems, such as addiction or mental health issues.  I urge the Minister in whatever time he has to ensure he addresses homelessness and housing provision, but not to go down the route of rent controls.</p></speech>

The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, introduced a number of measures to address rent stability and housing supply.</p><p>Regarding rent stability, the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a four-year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced.  Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.<br/><br/>Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of three comparable dwellings in the area, and that notification of a rent increase to the RTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by tenants that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews.  The extension of the period between rent reviews from 12 to 24 months takes effect from the date of the last review, so if a tenant had a rent review in July 2015, the next rent review will not be until July 2017.<br/><br/>The RTB quarterly rent index, which is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute for the Residential Tenancies Board, is the most accurate and authoritative rent report of its kind on the private accommodation sector in Ireland.  It is based on new tenancies commenced each quarter and on the actual rents being paid, as distinct from the asking or advertised rent.  The most recent RTB rent index for the first quarter of 2016 shows that the rate of rent inflation is cooling, with rents up nationally by 0.5% over the fourth quarter of 2015 and by 0.2% in Dublin.  This compares to a national growth rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2015, almost 4% in the third quarter and over 2.5% in the second quarter.  The data also show that the supply challenge remains acute.  The trend in new tenancy registrations is downward, with annual tenancy registrations peaking in 2013 - with nearly 112,000 tenancies registered in that year - but dipping consecutively in 2014 and 2015.  Overall numbers of registered tenancies have increased though suggesting that tenants are staying longer in their properties, thereby reducing the normal supply churn.<br/><br/>It is still early days, of course, but there is reasonable cause to believe that these rent data represent the first stage in a welcome stabilisation of the rental market as the new provisions begin to take proper effect.  Fundamentally, the increases in rent have been driven by a combination of economic recovery and a lack of supply.  The rent stability measures are one side of the equation.  Measures to support accelerated supply across all tenures are also critical.  In addition to measures already under way under Construction 2020 and the social housing strategy to tackle this issue, the November package included the following measures to further address supply: a targeted development contribution rebate initiative in Dublin and Cork and changes to planning guidelines on apartment standards.<br/><br/>There is no on-off button for the delivery of additional rental accommodation.  It will take time for the supply measures in particular to take effect and alleviate some of the pressures.<br/><br/>I welcome the motion and the opportunity for debate.  The Minister's bona fides in seeking an adjournment should still stand, and I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to consider this and a longer period of time to consider this issue after the recess.  I would also like to point out that we have a serious supply problem.  We all know this and we all know where the population is going globally - 9 billion by 2030, 65% of whom will be living in urban centres.  We will be part of that challenge, and this is the House to debate it.  I welcome the announcement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, today.  Every little bit helps.  His was a big intervention today.  I also acknowledge the passion, commitment and drive of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to try to find a solution, but he will not be doing it on his own.  It will be done together with all the stakeholders, and that is not just the people in this House.</p></speech>

The lack of that security, the lack of that knowledge, is something that most of us will never understand and hope never to have to understand.  The fact of 2,000 children being homeless in Ireland in April 2016 is a scandal which shames us all.  It is the most appalling and urgent face of the housing crisis and should motivate us all here to ensure that it is resolved and never allowed to repeat itself.  T&aacute; s&eacute; scannalach go bhfuil s&eacute; sin ag tarl&uacute; sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann agus t&aacute; dualgas orainn go l&eacute;ir, ar an Rialtas ach go h&aacute;irithe, an cheist sin a r&eacute;iti&uacute;.</p>  <p>  The lack of affordable or even close to affordable accommodation directly impacts upon homelessness - for example, people who just cannot find anywhere else to go after they get their notice.  Our office deals with such people day in, day out, as I am sure do many other offices.  Some end up in hotels and emergency accommodation, some end up in their cars and some even end up on the streets.  What we sometimes do not discuss, however, is the massive sacrifices that people are making in this country so that they can stay in their homes and have that security, even if it means discomfort and misery.  I do not believe any Deputy would contradict me when I say there are people in this city, in my own city and right across Ireland who are going hungry to make rent, who in winter scrimp on heating simply to make rent and to stay where they are, even if that means staying in a tiny old bungalow, perhaps 100 years old, damp, cold and in terrible condition.  At least for them it is better than having nowhere.  Ar uaireamh is daoine aosta at&aacute; i gceist ansin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go dona d&aacute; sl&aacute;inte agus is cruatan f&iacute;ochmhar at&aacute; ann d&oacute;ibh.  </p>  <p>  Inability to find a place to rent that is affordable also means that people, many of whom have spent years on local authority waiting lists, move back in with parents, causing unbearable overcrowding, perhaps to the point of squalor.  I am aware of a case of three adults, three teenagers and a nine-year-old, a mixture of boys and girls, all squeezed into a two-bedroom Cork City Council flat.  If they could find anywhere else to rent that they could afford, you can be sure they would.</p>  <p>  High rents are also forcing people to move huge distances to find any place.  I have dealt with families who have had to move a considerable distance from the city to get anywhere at all.  I have dealt with families who have moved from Ballincollig to Baile Bh&uacute;irne, from Ballyphehane to Youghal and from Carrigaline to Kealkill.  The Minister will be familiar with those distances.  They are distances of 28, 32 and 50 miles, respectively.  People have to move their entire lives and perhaps leave the communities in which they grew up and the schools their children attended.  The housing crisis in Cork is getting more severe by the day.  This is illustrated by the fact that Cork city saw an increase of an enormous 16% in rents in a year.  That is a much greater increase year-on-year than in Dublin or any other urban centre.  The average cost of renting a home is now &euro;1,003 but it is much higher than that in some areas.  The dynamic in the city is replicated and echoed just outside it, in places such as Carrigaline, Ballincollig and Glanmire.  T&aacute; tionchar millteanach aige seo ar teaghlaigh ar fud na cathrach agus an chontae.  </p>  <p>  The housing crisis is first and foremost a social crisis and is causing huge hardship for many families across the city and county, with the number of homeless on the streets increasing substantially.  This alone should prompt us to deal with it firmly and conclusively.  However, there is increasingly evidence that this crisis could hamper growth in our city as well and may have implications for employment prospects.  The Minister will be aware that we have heard the CEO of Voxpro previously express his concern that its ability to expand was being held back by the rental crisis as so many of its employees were struggling to find affordable accommodation in Mahon, Blackrock, Douglas or anywhere across the southside, and doubtless this is true for many other businesses as well.  We are also seeing tenants facing eviction because of vulture capitalists buying portfolios of housing and seeking to remove tenants before selling on, as we saw with Eden in Blackrock and Tyrrelstown here in Dublin.</p>  <p>  Tackling the housing crisis will obviously involve substantial social housing building.  However, it also requires providing greater security for tenants and ensuring that rents stay at an affordable level.  The regulations of the previous Minister, Deputy Kelly, have proven to be inadequate, and there is an obvious - very obvious to renters in any event - need for this legislation, which fixes rent increases to the consumer price index.  People deserve to know that they will be able to stay in their current accommodation, they deserve to know that they can confidently expect to have enough money for rent, they deserve not to have to go cold or without food to make rent, and they deserve this legislation.</p></speech>

There are many things the Minister has said over the course of recent weeks which I find encouraging and give some hope in terms of the action plan for housing.  I also agree with him that no party has a monopoly on concern.  As constituency Deputies, we are all getting representations and we all work on these issues on a regular basis, but our responsibility here is to act.</p><p>It is because of the urgent need for action that I cannot accede to the Minister's request for an adjournment to the debate.  We have been discussing rent certainty for some time.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues would have discussed it during the run up to the decision on the amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act last year.  Threshold has produced detailed reports and has lobbied Deputies on all sides of the House for some time.  We know the issues involved.  If we adjourn the debate and return after the summer recess, it will be the end of the year before legislation on the issue is enacted, if legislation is forthcoming from the Government at all.  The people we need to help with spiralling rents cannot wait that long for this very modest measure.</p> <p> The Minister repeated the Taoiseach's earlier comments that we are not giving the housing committee its place.  I would take it seriously if the Minister had not launched the initiative he launched today.  I have no problem with the initiative as long as it results in more affordable homes being provided on those sites.  However, the initiative the Minister launched this morning is a matter the housing committee actively considered and which we will address in our recommendations on Friday.  If the Minister is willing to pre-empt and take action on this one issue, I do not see how he can criticise us for, as he sees it, pre-empting and taking action on this issue.</p></speech>

I live in the private rental sector.  I choose to live there and I want to continue living there.  I am very happy to say, without hesitation, that we need a private rental system that is good for landlords and tenants.  One of the values of rent certainty is that, over time, it would help deal with one of the systemic problems in our private rental sector, namely, too many accidental landlords who are governed, through no fault of their own in many cases, by short-term thinking rather than long-term, stable activity in the market.  Deputy John Paul Phelan confuses rent controls and rent certainty.  It is a pity he does not study hard enough to know the difference between the two.  They are fundamentally different propositions and he will find many examples of rent certainty that make a positive contribution to other member states.</p>  <p>  I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, that I am guided by the evidence.  There is no evidence to suggest that what the previous Government introduced in November is working.  While the latest figures show the rate of rent price inflation is beginning to slow, it is still increasing.  When the spat between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, first arose and the deadline was enacted for the new rent review regulations, there was a spike in rents and many people experienced two years worth of rent increases rather than one.</p>  <p>  For those reasons, Sinn F&eacute;in will press the Bill and will continue to argue for it.  If the Minister includes rent certainty in his action plan on housing, I will welcome it.  I will wait and see.  I am confused by Fianna F&aacute;il's position, however.  Deputy Barry Cowen spoke much about the rules but I am not sure what they are because when Sinn F&eacute;in introduced our first Private Members' motion, we were told it was not serious and the rules meant one had to introduce legislation.  When we introduced legislation, we were told it was not the right way to proceed.  While we are told we cannot pre-empt the housing committee, tomorrow Fianna F&aacute;il Senators will bring forward a motion on housing with five specific recommendations to the Government which cover the territory of the housing and homelessness committee.  I am most confused by the fact that, on Sunday, a senior spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il called for rent certainty, involving linking rent reviews to the consumer price index, to be introduced urgently, yet today we have heard Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies say it is a very bad thing.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies from the Labour Party, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and the Independent benches for their support for our Bill.  They are right; it is very modest and the private rental sector reform requires much more substantive and radical action.  The central point at the heart of the Bill remains that there is an urgent crisis being caused by out of control rents.  This modest measure, if enacted, and amended if required on Committee and Report Stages, would make a real difference to people's lives.  On that basis, I urge all Deputies to support it.</p></speech>
